Parsing [sent. 1 len. 86]: Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens IN LIEU OF PREFACE BOOK THE FIRST THE CUP AND THE LIP Chapter 1 ON THE LOOK OUT In these times of ours , though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise , a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance , with two figures in it , floated on the Thames , between Southwark bridge which is of iron , and London Bridge which is of stone , as an autumn evening was closing in .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 39]: The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face , and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty , sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 37]: The girl rowed , pulling a pair of sculls very easily ; the man , with the rudder-lines slack in his hands , and his hands loose in his waistband , kept an eager look out .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 102]: He had no net , hook , or line , and he could not be a fisherman ; his boat had no cushion for a sitter , no paint , no inscription , no appliance beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope , and he could not be a waterman ; his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for delivery , and he could not be a lighterman or river-carrier ; there was no clue to what he looked for , but he looked for something , with a most intent and searching gaze .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 57]: The tide , which had turned an hour before , was running down , and his eyes watched every little race and eddy in its broad sweep , as the boat made slight head-way against it , or drove stern foremost before it , according as he directed his daughter by a movement of his head .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 12]: She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 17]: But , in the intensity of her look there was a touch of dread or horror .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 55]: Allied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface , by reason of the slime and ooze with which it was covered , and its sodden state , this boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they often did , and were seeking what they often sought .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 80]: Half savage as the man showed , with no covering on his matted head , with his brown arms bare to between the elbow and the shoulder , with the loose knot of a looser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and whisker , with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that begrimed his boat , still there was a business-like usage in his steady gaze .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 34]: So with every lithe action of the girl , with every turn of her wrist , perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror ; they were things of usage .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 7]: ` Keep her out , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 5]: Tide runs strong here .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 10]: Keep her well afore the sweep of it . '
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 24]: Trusting to the girl 's skill and making no use of the rudder , he eyed the coming tide with an absorbed attention .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 6]: So the girl eyed him .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 51]: But , it happened now , that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into the bottom of the boat , and , touching a rotten stain there which bore some resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form , coloured it as though with diluted blood .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 11]: This caught the girl 's eye , and she shivered .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 6]: ` What ails you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 24]: said the man , immediately aware of it , though so intent on the advancing waters ; ' I see nothing afloat . '
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 30]: The red light was gone , the shudder was gone , and his gaze , which had come back to the boat for a moment , travelled away again .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 16]: Wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment , his gaze paused for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 65]: At every mooring-chain and rope , at every stationery boat or barge that split the current into a broadarrowhead , at the offsets from the piers of Southwark Bridge , at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the filthy water , at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off certain wharves , his shining eyes darted a hungry look .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 24]: After a darkening hour or so , suddenly the rudder-lines tightened in his hold , and he steered hard towards the Surrey shore .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 43]: Always watching his face , the girl instantly answered to the action in her sculling ; presently the boat swung round , quivered as from a sudden jerk , and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 48]: The girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore , over her head and over her face , and , looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were turned down the river , kept the boat in that direction going before the tide .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 50]: Until now , the boat had barely held her own , and had hovered about one spot ; but now , the banks changed swiftly , and the deepening shadows and the kindling lights of London Bridge were passed , and the tiers of shipping lay on either hand .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 18]: It was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 15]: His arms were wet and dirty , and he washed them over the side .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 17]: In his right hand he held something , and he washed that in the river too .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 4]: It was money .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 37]: He chinked it once , and he blew upon it once , and he spat upon it once , -- ` for luck , ' he hoarsely said -- before he put it in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 4]: ` Lizzie ! '
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 16]: The girl turned her face towards him with a start , and rowed in silence .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 6]: Her face was very pale .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 29]: He was a hook-nosed man , and with that and his bright eyes and his ruffled head , bore a certain likeness to a roused bird of prey .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 9]: ` Take that thing off your face . '
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 5]: She put it back .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 8]: and give me hold of the sculls .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 10]: I 'll take the rest of the spell . '
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 7]: ` No , no , father !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 5]: I ca n't indeed .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 2]: Father !
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 10]: -- I can not sit so near it ! '
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 21]: He was moving towards her to change places , but her terrified expostulation stopped him and he resumed his seat .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 9]: ` What hurt can it do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 5]: ` None , none .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 8]: But I can not bear it . '
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 15]: ` It 's my belief you hate the sight of the very river . '
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 12]: ` I -- I do not like it , father . '
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 9]: ` As if it was n't your living !
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 12]: As if it was n't meat and drink to you ! '
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 24]: At these latter words the girl shivered again , and for a moment paused in her rowing , seeming to turn deadly faint .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 20]: It escaped his attention , for he was glancing over the stern at something the boat had in tow .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 14]: ` How can you be so thankless to your best friend , Lizzie ?
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 23]: The very fire that warmed you when you were a babby , was picked out of the river alongside the coal barges .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 13]: The very basket that you slept in , the tide washed ashore .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 32]: The very rockers that I put it upon to make a cradle of it , I cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or another . '
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 63]: Lizzie took her right hand from the scull it held , and touched her lips with it , and for a moment held it out lovingly towards him : then , without speaking , she resumed her rowing , as another boat of similar appearance , though in rather better trim , came out from a dark place and dropped softly alongside .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 8]: ` In luck again , Gaffer ? '
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 35]: said a man with a squinting leer , who sculled her and who was alone , ' I know 'd you was in luck again , by your wake as you come down . '
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 6]: replied the other , drily .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 10]: ` So you 're out , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 6]: ` Yes , pardner . '
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 34]: There was now a tender yellow moonlight on the river , and the new comer , keeping half his boat 's length astern of the other boat looked hard at its track . '
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 33]: I says to myself , ' he went on , ` directly you hove in view , yonder 's Gaffer , and in luck again , by George if he ai n't !
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 18]: Scull it is , pardner -- do n't fret yourself -- I did n't touch him . '
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 44]: This was in answer to a quick impatient movement on the part of Gaffer : the speaker at the same time unshipping his scull on that side , and laying his hand on the gunwale of Gaffer 's boat and holding to it .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 22]: ` He 's had touches enough not to want no more , as well as I make him out , Gaffer !
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 15]: Been a knocking about with a pretty many tides , ai n't he pardner ?
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 9]: Such is my out-of-luck ways , you see !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 22]: He must have passed me when he went up last time , for I was on the lookout below bridge here .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 19]: I a ` most think you 're like the wulturs , pardner , and scent 'em out . '
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 23]: He spoke in a dropped voice , and with more than one glance at Lizzie who had pulled on her hood again .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 17]: Both men then looked with a weird unholy interest in the wake of Gaffer 's boat .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 8]: ` Easy does it , betwixt us .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 9]: Shall I take him aboard , pardner ? '
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 8]: ` No , ' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 39]: In so surly a tone that the man , after a blank stare , acknowledged it with the retort : ' -- Ar n't been eating nothing as has disagreed with you , have you , pardner ? '
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 13]: ` Why , yes , I have , ' said Gaffer . '
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 12]: I have been swallowing too much of that word , Pardner .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 8]: I am no pardner of yours . '
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 15]: ` Since when was you no pardner of mine , Gaffer Hexam Esquire ? '
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 10]: ` Since you was accused of robbing a man .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 8]: Accused of robbing a live man ! '
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 7]: said Gaffer , with great indignation .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 17]: ` And what if I had been accused of robbing a dead man , Gaffer ? '
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: ` You COULD N'T do it . '
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 8]: ` Could n't you , Gaffer ? '
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 9]: Has a dead man any use for money ?
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 11]: Is it possible for a dead man to have money ?
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 9]: What world does a dead man belong to ?
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 4]: ` Tother world .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 7]: What world does money belong to ?
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 3]: This world .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 8]: How can money be a corpse 's ?
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 18]: Can a corpse own it , want it , spend it , claim it , miss it ?
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 16]: Do n't try to go confounding the rights and wrongs of things in that way .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 15]: But it 's worthy of the sneaking spirit that robs a live man . '
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 11]: ` I 'll tell you what it is -- . '
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: ` No you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 8]: I 'll tell you what it is .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 25]: You got off with a short time of it for putting you 're hand in the pocket of a sailor , a live sailor .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 24]: Make the most of it and think yourself lucky , but do n't think after that to come over ME with your pardners .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 21]: We have worked together in time past , but we work together no more in time present nor yet future .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 3]: Let go .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 4]: Cast off ! '
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 3]: ` Gaffer !
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 13]: If you think to get rid of me this way -- . '
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 38]: ` If I do n't get rid of you this way , I 'll try another , and chop you over the fingers with the stretcher , or take a pick at your head with the boat-hook .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 3]: Cast off !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 5]: Pull you , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 13]: Pull home , since you wo n't let your father pull . '
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 11]: Lizzie shot ahead , and the other boat fell astern .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 43]: Lizzie 's father , composing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the high moralities and taken an unassailable position , slowly lighted a pipe , and smoked , and took a survey of what he had in tow .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 40]: What he had in tow , lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat was checked , and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away , though for the most part it followed submissively .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 33]: A neophyte might have fancied that the ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint changes of expression on a sightless face ; but Gaffer was no neophyte and had no fancies .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 24]: Chapter 2 THE MAN FROM SOMEWHERE Mr and Mrs Veneering were bran-new people in a bran-new house in a bran-new quarter of London .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 10]: Everything about the Veneerings was spick and span new .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 99]: All their furniture was new , all their friends were new , all their servants were new , their plate was new , their carriage was new , their harness was new , their horses were new , their pictures were new , they themselves were new , they were as newly married as was lawfully compatible with their having a bran-new baby , and if they had set up a great-grandfather , he would have come home in matting from the Pantechnicon , without a scratch upon him , French polished to the crown of his head .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 46]: For , in the Veneering establishment , from the hall-chairs with the new coat of arms , to the grand pianoforte with the new action , and upstairs again to the new fire-escape , all things were in a state of high varnish and polish .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 30]: And what was observable in the furniture , was observable in the Veneerings -- the surface smelt a little too much of the workshop and was a trifle sticky .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 43]: There was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy castors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in Duke Street , Saint James 's , when not in use , to whom the Veneerings were a source of blind confusion .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 8]: The name of this article was Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 29]: Being first cousin to Lord Snigsworth , he was in frequent requisition , and at many houses might be said to represent the dining-table in its normal state .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 30]: Mr and Mrs Veneering , for example , arranging a dinner , habitually started with Twemlow , and then put leaves in him , or added guests to him .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 36]: Sometimes , the table consisted of Twemlow and half a dozen leaves ; sometimes , of Twemlow and a dozen leaves ; sometimes , Twemlow was pulled out to his utmost extent of twenty leaves .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 66]: Mr and Mrs Veneering on occasions of ceremony faced each other in the centre of the board , and thus the parallel still held ; for , it always happened that the more Twemlow was pulled out , the further he found himself from the center , and nearer to the sideboard at one end of the room , or the window-curtains at the other .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 16]: But , it was not this which steeped the feeble soul of Twemlow in confusion .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 12]: This he was used to , and could take soundings of .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 40]: The abyss to which he could find no bottom , and from which started forth the engrossing and ever-swelling difficulty of his life , was the insoluble question whether he was Veneering 's oldest friend , or newest friend .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 41]: To the excogitation of this problem , the harmless gentleman had devoted many anxious hours , both in his lodgings over the livery stable-yard , and in the cold gloom , favourable to meditation , of Saint James 's Square .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 2]: Thus .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 78]: Twemlow had first known Veneering at his club , where Veneering then knew nobody but the man who made them known to one another , who seemed to be the most intimate friend he had in the world , and whom he had known two days -- the bond of union between their souls , the nefarious conduct of the committee respecting the cookery of a fillet of veal , having been accidentally cemented at that date .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 23]: Immediately upon this , Twemlow received an invitation to dine with Veneering , and dined : the man being of the party .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 23]: Immediately upon that , Twemlow received an invitation to dine with the man , and dined : Veneering being of the party .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 41]: At the man 's were a Member , an Engineer , a Payer-off of the National Debt , a Poem on Shakespeare , a Grievance , and a Public Office , who all seem to be utter strangers to Veneering .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 92]: And yet immediately after that , Twemlow received an invitation to dine at Veneerings , expressly to meet the Member , the Engineer , the Payer-off of the National Debt , the Poem on Shakespeare , the Grievance , and the Public Office , and , dining , discovered that all of them were the most intimate friends Veneering had in the world , and that the wives of all of them -LRB- who were all there -RRB- were the objects of Mrs Veneering 's most devoted affection and tender confidence .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 32]: Thus it had come about , that Mr Twemlow had said to himself in his lodgings , with his hand to his forehead : ' I must not think of this .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 27]: This is enough to soften any man 's brain , ' -- and yet was always thinking of it , and could never form a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 8]: This evening the Veneerings give a banquet .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 12]: Eleven leaves in the Twemlow ; fourteen in company all told .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 13]: Four pigeon-breasted retainers in plain clothes stand in line in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 33]: A fifth retainer , proceeding up the staircase with a mournful air -- as who should say , ` Here is another wretched creature come to dinner ; such is life ! '
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 8]: -- announces , ` Mis-ter Twemlow ! '
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: Mrs Veneering welcomes her sweet Mr Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 7]: Mr Veneering welcomes his dear Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 32]: Mrs Veneering does not expect that Mr Twemlow can in nature care much for such insipid things as babies , but so old a friend must please to look at baby .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 33]: You will know the friend of your family better , Tootleums , ' says Mr Veneering , nodding emotionally at that new article , ` when you begin to take notice . '
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 30]: He then begs to make his dear Twemlow known to his two friends , Mr Boots and Mr Brewer -- and clearly has no distinct idea which is which .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 7]: But now a fearful circumstance occurs .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 7]: ` Mis-ter and Mis-sus Podsnap ! '
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 31]: ` My dear , ' says Mr Veneering to Mrs Veneering , with an air of much friendly interest , while the door stands open , ` the Podsnaps . '
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 36]: A too , too smiling large man , with a fatal freshness on him , appearing with his wife , instantly deserts his wife and darts at Twemlow with : ` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 6]: So glad to know you .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 6]: Charming house you have here .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 7]: I hope we are not late .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 11]: So glad of the opportunity , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 51]: When the first shock fell upon him , Twemlow twice skipped back in his neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion , as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him ; but the large man closed with him and proved too strong .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 34]: ` Let me , ' says the large man , trying to attract the attention of his wife in the distance , ` have the pleasure of presenting Mrs Podsnap to her host .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 37]: She will be , ' in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure and eternal youth in the phrase , ` she will be so glad of the opportunity , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 85]: In the meantime , Mrs Podsnap , unable to originate a mistake on her own account , because Mrs Veneering is the only other lady there , does her best in the way of handsomely supporting her husband 's , by looking towards Mr Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to Mrs Veneering in a feeling manner , firstly , that she fears he has been rather bilious of late , and , secondly , that the baby is already very like him .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 62]: It is questionable whether any man quite relishes being mistaken for any other man ; but , Mr Veneering having this very evening set up the shirt-front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come home , is not at all complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow , who is dry and weazen and some thirty years older .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 13]: Mrs Veneering equally resents the imputation of being the wife of Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 28]: As to Twemlow , he is so sensible of being a much better bred man than Veneering , that he considers the large man an offensive ass .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 41]: In this complicated dilemma , Mr Veneering approaches the large man with extended hand and , smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he is delighted to see him : who in his fatal freshness instantly replies : ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 31]: I am ashamed to say that I can not at this moment recall where we met , but I am so glad of this opportunity , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 40]: Then pouncing upon Twemlow , who holds back with all his feeble might , he is haling him off to present him , as Veneering , to Mrs Podsnap , when the arrival of more guests unravels the mistake .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 49]: Whereupon , having re-shaken hands with Veneering as Veneering , he re-shakes hands with Twemlow as Twemlow , and winds it all up to his own perfect satisfaction by saying to the last-named , ` Ridiculous opportunity -- but so glad of it , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 144]: Now , Twemlow having undergone this terrific experience , having likewise noted the fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots , and having further observed that of the remaining seven guests four discrete characters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to commit themselves as to which is Veneering , until Veneering has them in his grasp ; -- Twemlow having profited by these studies , finds his brain wholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion that he really is Veneering 's oldest friend , when his brain softens again and all is lost , through his eyes encountering Veneering and the large man linked together as twin brothers in the back drawing-room near the conservatory door , and through his ears informing him in the tones of Mrs Veneering that the same large man is to be baby 's godfather .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 8]: ` Dinner is on the table ! '
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 24]: Thus the melancholy retainer , as who should say , ` Come down and be poisoned , ye unhappy children of men ! '
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 21]: Twemlow , having no lady assigned him , goes down in the rear , with his hand to his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 14]: Boots and Brewer , thinking him indisposed , whisper , ` Man faint .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 5]: Had no lunch . '
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 13]: But he is only stunned by the unvanquishable difficulty of his existence .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 16]: Revived by soup , Twemlow discourses mildly of the Court Circular with Boots and Brewer .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 31]: Is appealed to , at the fish stage of the banquet , by Veneering , on the disputed question whether his cousin Lord Snigsworth is in or out of town ?
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 10]: Gives it that his cousin is out of town .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 6]: ` At Snigsworthy Park ? '
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 3]: Veneering inquires .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 8]: ` At Snigsworthy , ' Twemlow rejoins .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 23]: Boots and Brewer regard this as a man to be cultivated ; and Veneering is clear that he is a renumerative article .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 24]: Meantime the retainer goes round , like a gloomy Analytical Chemist : always seeming to say , after ` Chablis , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 15]: -- ` You would n't if you knew what it 's made of . '
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 14]: The great looking-glass above the sideboard , reflects the table and the company .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 24]: Reflects the new Veneering crest , in gold and eke in silver , frosted and also thawed , a camel of all work .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 56]: The Heralds ' College found out a Crusading ancestor for Veneering who bore a camel on his shield -LRB- or might have done it if he had thought of it -RRB- , and a caravan of camels take charge of the fruits and flowers and candles , and kneel down be loaded with the salt .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 29]: Reflects Veneering ; forty , wavy-haired , dark , tending to corpulence , sly , mysterious , filmy -- a kind of sufficiently well-looking veiledprophet , not prophesying .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 43]: Reflects Mrs Veneering ; fair , aquilinenosed and fingered , not so much light hair as she might have , gorgeous in raiment and jewels , enthusiastic , propitiatory , conscious that a corner of her husband 's veil is over herself .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 48]: Reflects Podsnap ; prosperously feeding , two little light-coloured wiry wings , one on either side of his else bald head , looking as like his hairbrushes as his hair , dissolving view of red beads on his forehead , large allowance of crumpled shirt-collar up behind .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 34]: Reflects Mrs Podsnap ; fine woman for Professor Owen , quantity of bone , neck and nostrils like a rocking-horse , hard features , majestic head-dress in which Podsnap has hung golden offerings .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 50]: Reflects Twemlow ; grey , dry , polite , susceptible to east wind , First-Gentleman-in-Europe collar and cravat , cheeks drawn in as if he had made a great effort to retire into himself some years ago , and had got so far and had never got any farther .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 75]: Reflects mature young lady ; raven locks , and complexion that lights up well when well powdered -- as it is -- carrying on considerably in the captivation of mature young gentleman ; with too much nose in his face , too much ginger in his whiskers , too much torso in his waistcoat , too much sparkle in his studs , his eyes , his buttons , his talk , and his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 64]: Reflects charming old Lady Tippins on Veneering 's right ; with an immense obtuse drab oblong face , like a face in a tablespoon , and a dyed Long Walk up the top of her head , as a convenient public approach to the bunch of false hair behind , pleased to patronize Mrs Veneering opposite , who is pleased to be patronized .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 69]: Reflects a certain ` Mortimer ' , another of Veneering 's oldest friends ; who never was in the house before , and appears not to want to come again , who sits disconsolate on Mrs Veneering 's left , and who was inveigled by Lady Tippins -LRB- a friend of his boyhood -RRB- to come to these people 's and talk , and who wo n't talk .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 46]: Reflects Eugene , friend of Mortimer ; buried alive in the back of his chair , behind a shoulder -- with a powder-epaulette on it -- of the mature young lady , and gloomily resorting to the champagne chalice whenever proffered by the Analytical Chemist .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 25]: Lastly , the looking-glass reflects Boots and Brewer , and two other stuffed Buffers interposed between the rest of the company and possible accidents .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 19]: The Veneering dinners are excellent dinners -- or new people would n't come -- and all goes well .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 37]: Notably , Lady Tippins has made a series of experiments on her digestive functions , so extremely complicated and daring , that if they could be published with their results it might benefit the human race .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 77]: Having taken in provisions from all parts of the world , this hardy old cruiser has last touched at the North Pole , when , as the ice-plates are being removed , the following words fall from her : ' I assure you , my dear Veneering -- ' -LRB- Poor Twemlow 's hand approaches his forehead , for it would seem now , that Lady Tippins is going to be the oldest friend . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 15]: I assure you , my dear Veneering , that it is the oddest affair !
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 20]: Like the advertising people , I do n't ask you to trust me , without offering a respectable reference .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 14]: Mortimer there , is my reference , and knows all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 12]: Mortimer raises his drooping eyelids , and slightly opens his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 14]: But a faint smile , expressive of ` What 's the use ! '
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 15]: passes over his face , and he drops his eyelids and shuts his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 52]: ` Now , Mortimer , ' says Lady Tippins , rapping the sticks of her closed green fan upon the knuckles of her left hand -- which is particularly rich in knuckles , ' I insist upon your telling all that is to be told about the man from Jamaica . '
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 26]: ` Give you my honour I never heard of any man from Jamaica , except the man who was a brother , ' replies Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 6]: ` Tobago , then . '
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 7]: ` Nor yet from Tobago . '
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 72]: ` Except , ' Eugene strikes in : so unexpectedly that the mature young lady , who has forgotten all about him , with a start takes the epaulette out of his way : ` except our friend who long lived on ricepudding and isinglass , till at length to his something or other , his physician said something else , and a leg of mutton somehow ended in daygo . '
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 13]: A reviving impression goes round the table that Eugene is coming out .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 10]: An unfulfilled impression , for he goes in again .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 30]: ` Now , my dear Mrs Veneering , ' quoth Lady Tippins , I appeal to you whether this is not the basest conduct ever known in this world ?
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 44]: I carry my lovers about , two or three at a time , on condition that they are very obedient and devoted ; and here is my oldest lover-in-chief , the head of all my slaves , throwing off his allegiance before company !
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 44]: And here is another of my lovers , a rough Cymon at present certainly , but of whom I had most hopeful expectations as to his turning out well in course of time , pretending that he ca n't remember his nursery rhymes !
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 16]: On purpose to annoy me , for he knows how I doat upon them ! '
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 13]: A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is Lady Tippins 's point .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 66]: She is always attended by a lover or two , and she keeps a little list of her lovers , and she is always booking a new lover , or striking out an old lover , or putting a lover in her black list , or promoting a lover to her blue list , or adding up her lovers , or otherwise posting her book .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 13]: Mrs Veneering is charmed by the humour , and so is Veneering .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 23]: Perhaps it is enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins 's throat , like the legs of scratching poultry . '
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 32]: I banish the false wretch from this moment , and I strike him out of my Cupidon -LRB- my name for my Ledger , my dear , -RRB- this very night .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 41]: But I am resolved to have the account of the man from Somewhere , and I beg you to elicit it for me , my love , ' to Mrs Veneering , ` as I have lost my own influence .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 7]: Oh , you perjured man ! '
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 11]: This to Mortimer , with a rattle of her fan .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 17]: ` We are all very much interested in the man from Somewhere , ' Veneering observes .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 21]: Then the four Buffers , taking heart of grace all four at once , say : ` Deeply interested ! '
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 5]: ` Quite excited ! '
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 4]: ` Dramatic ! '
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 8]: ` Man from Nowhere , perhaps ! '
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 38]: And then Mrs Veneering -- for the Lady Tippins 's winning wiles are contagious -- folds her hands in the manner of a supplicating child , turns to her left neighbour , and says , ` Tease !
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 2]: Pay !
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 5]: Man from Tumwhere ! '
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 23]: At which the four Buffers , again mysteriously moved all four at once , explain , ` You ca n't resist ! '
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 62]: ` Upon my life , ' says Mortimer languidly , ' I find it immensely embarrassing to have the eyes of Europe upon me to this extent , and my only consolation is that you will all of you execrate Lady Tippins in your secret hearts when you find , as you inevitably will , the man from Somewhere a bore .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 42]: Sorry to destroy romance by fixing him with a local habitation , but he comes from the place , the name of which escapes me , but will suggest itself to everybody else here , where they make the wine . '
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 9]: Eugene suggests ` Day and Martin 's . '
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 22]: ` No , not that place , ' returns the unmoved Mortimer , ` that 's where they make the Port .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 13]: My man comes from the country where they make the Cape Wine .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 19]: But look here , old fellow ; its not at all statistical and it 's rather odd . '
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 41]: It is always noticeable at the table of the Veneerings , that no man troubles himself much about the Veneerings themselves , and that any one who has anything to tell , generally tells it to anybody else in preference .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 34]: ` The man , ' Mortimer goes on , addressing Eugene , ` whose name is Harmon , was only son of a tremendous old rascal who made his money by Dust . '
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 8]: ` Red velveteens and a bell ? '
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 5]: the gloomy Eugene inquires .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 10]: ` And a ladder and basket if you like .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 30]: By which means , or by others , he grew rich as a Dust Contractor , and lived in a hollow in a hilly country entirely composed of Dust .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 28]: On his own small estate the growling old vagabond threw up his own mountain range , like an old volcano , and its geological formation was Dust .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 22]: Coal-dust , vegetable-dust , bone-dust , crockery dust , rough dust and sifted dust , -- all manner of Dust . '
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 46]: A passing remembrance of Mrs Veneering , here induces Mortimer to address his next half-dozen words to her ; after which he wanders away again , tries Twemlow and finds he does n't answer , ultimately takes up with the Buffers who receive him enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 34]: ` The moral being -- I believe that 's the right expression -- of this exemplary person , derived its highest gratification from anathematizing his nearest relations and turning them out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 36]: Having begun -LRB- as was natural -RRB- by rendering these attentions to the wife of his bosom , he next found himself at leisure to bestow a similar recognition on the claims of his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 44]: He chose a husband for her , entirely to his own satisfaction and not in the least to hers , and proceeded to settle upon her , as her marriage portion , I do n't know how much Dust , but something immense .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 65]: At this stage of the affair the poor girl respectfully intimated that she was secretly engaged to that popular character whom the novelists and versifiers call Another , and that such a marriage would make Dust of her heart and Dust of her life -- in short , would set her up , on a very extensive scale , in her father 's business .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 24]: Immediately , the venerable parent -- on a cold winter 's night , it is said -- anathematized and turned her out . '
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 61]: Here , the Analytical Chemist -LRB- who has evidently formed a very low opinion of Mortimer 's story -RRB- concedes a little claret to the Buffers ; who , again mysteriously moved all four at once , screw it slowly into themselves with a peculiar twist of enjoyment , as they cry in chorus , ` Pray go on . '
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 19]: ` The pecuniary resources of Another were , as they usually are , of a very limited nature .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 19]: I believe I am not using too strong an expression when I say that Another was hard up .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 31]: However , he married the young lady , and they lived in a humble dwelling , probably possessing a porch ornamented with honeysuckle and woodbine twining , until she died .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 51]: I must refer you to the Registrar of the District in which the humble dwelling was situated , for the certified cause of death ; but early sorrow and anxiety may have had to do with it , though they may not appear in the ruled pages and printed forms .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 37]: Indisputably this was the case with Another , for he was so cut up by the loss of his young wife that if he outlived her a year it was as much as he did . '
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 46]: There is that in the indolent Mortimer , which seems to hint that if good society might on any account allow itself to be impressible , he , one of good society , might have the weakness to be impressed by what he here relates .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 13]: It is hidden with great pains , but it is in him .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 80]: The gloomy Eugene too , is not without some kindred touch ; for , when that appalling Lady Tippins declares that if Another had survived , he should have gone down at the head of her list of lovers -- and also when the mature young lady shrugs her epaulettes , and laughs at some private and confidential comment from the mature young gentleman -- his gloom deepens to that degree that he trifles quite ferociously with his dessert-knife .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 3]: Mortimer proceeds .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 25]: ` We must now return , as novelists say , and as we all wish they would n't , to the man from Somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 45]: Being a boy of fourteen , cheaply educated at Brussels when his sister 's expulsion befell , it was some little time before he heard of it -- probably from herself , for the mother was dead ; but that I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 10]: Instantly , he absconded , and came over here .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 45]: He must have been a boy of spirit and resource , to get here on a stopped allowance of five sous a week ; but he did it somehow , and he burst in on his father , and pleaded his sister 's cause .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 12]: Venerable parent promptly resorts to anathematization , and turns him out .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 41]: Shocked and terrified boy takes flight , seeks his fortune , gets aboard ship , ultimately turns up on dry land among the Cape wine : small proprietor , farmer , grower -- whatever you like to call it . '
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 20]: At this juncture , shuffling is heard in the hall , and tapping is heard at the dining-room door .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 28]: Analytical Chemist goes to the door , confers angrily with unseen tapper , appears to become mollified by descrying reason in the tapping , and goes out .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 20]: ` So he was discovered , only the other day , after having been expatriated about fourteen years . '
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 27]: A Buffer , suddenly astounding the other three , by detaching himself , and asserting individuality , inquires : ` How discovered , and why ? '
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 4]: To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 6]: Thank you for reminding me .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 5]: Venerable parent dies . '
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 13]: Same Buffer , emboldened by success , says : ` When ? '
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 5]: ` The other day .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 7]: Ten or twelve months ago . '
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 11]: Same Buffer inquires with smartness , ` What of ? '
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 28]: But herein perishes a melancholy example ; being regarded by the three other Buffers with a stony stare , and attracting no further attention from any mortal .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 31]: ` Venerable parent , ' Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that there is a Veneering at table , and for the first time addressing him -- ` dies . '
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 40]: The gratified Veneering repeats , gravely , ` dies ' ; and folds his arms , and composes his brow to hear it out in a judicial manner , when he finds himself again deserted in the bleak world .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 18]: ` His will is found , ' said Mortimer , catching Mrs Podsnap 's rockinghorse 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 12]: ` It is dated very soon after the son 's flight .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 46]: It leaves the lowest of the range of dust-mountains , with some sort of a dwelling-house at its foot , to an old servant who is sole executor , and all the rest of the property -- which is very considerable -- to the son .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 40]: He directs himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and precautions against his coming to life , with which I need not bore you , and that 's all -- except -- ' and this ends the story .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 10]: The Analytical Chemist returning , everybody looks at him .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 38]: Not because anybody wants to see him , but because of that subtle influence in nature which impels humanity to embrace the slightest opportunity of looking at anything , rather than the person who addresses it . '
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 43]: -- Except that the son 's inheriting is made conditional on his marrying a girl , who at the date of the will , was a child of four or five years old , and who is now a marriageable young woman .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 52]: Advertisement and inquiry discovered the son in the man from Somewhere , and at the present moment , he is on his way home from there -- no doubt , in a state of great astonishment -- to succeed to a very large fortune , and to take a wife . '
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 15]: Mrs Podsnap inquires whether the young person is a young person of personal charms ?
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 6]: Mortimer is unable to report .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 23]: Mr Podsnap inquires what would become of the very large fortune , in the event of the marriage condition not being fulfilled ?
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 48]: Mortimer replies , that by special testamentary clause it would then go to the old servant above mentioned , passing over and excluding the son ; also , that if the son had not been living , the same old servant would have been sole residuary legatee .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 53]: Mrs Veneering has just succeeded in waking Lady Tippins from a snore , by dexterously shunting a train of plates and dishes at her knuckles across the table ; when everybody but Mortimer himself becomes aware that the Analytical Chemist is , in a ghostly manner , offering him a folded paper .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 8]: Curiosity detains Mrs Veneering a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 82]: Mortimer , in spite of all the arts of the chemist , placidly refreshes himself with a glass of Madeira , and remains unconscious of the Document which engrosses the general attention , until Lady Tippins -LRB- who has a habit of waking totally insensible -RRB- , having remembered where she is , and recovered a perception of surrounding objects , says : ` Falser man than Don Juan ; why do n't you take the note from the commendatore ? '
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 28]: Upon which , the chemist advances it under the nose of Mortimer , who looks round at him , and says : ` What 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 6]: Analytical Chemist bends and whispers .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 4]: ` WHO ? '
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 3]: Says Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 7]: Analytical Chemist again bends and whispers .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 10]: Mortimer stares at him , and unfolds the paper .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 23]: Reads it , reads it twice , turns it over to look at the blank outside , reads it a third time .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 37]: ` This arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner , ' says Mortimer then , looking with an altered face round the table : ` this is the conclusion of the story of the identical man . '
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 5]: ` Already married ? '
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 3]: one guesses .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: ` Declines to marry ? '
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 3]: another guesses .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 7]: ` Codicil among the dust ? '
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 3]: another guesses .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 18]: ` Why , no , ' says Mortimer ; ` remarkable thing , you are all wrong .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 12]: The story is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 5]: Man 's drowned ! '
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 51]: Chapter 3 ANOTHER MAN As the disappearing skirts of the ladies ascended the Veneering staircase , Mortimer , following them forth from the dining-room , turned into a library of bran-new books , in bran-new bindings liberally gilded , and requested to see the messenger who had brought the paper .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 8]: He was a boy of about fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 34]: Mortimer looked at the boy , and the boy looked at the bran-new pilgrims on the wall , going to Canterbury in more gold frame than procession , and more carving than country .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 7]: ` Whose writing is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 6]: ` Mine , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: ` Who told you to write it ? '
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 8]: ` My father , Jesse Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 10]: ` Is it he who found the body ? '
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 7]: ` What is your father ? '
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 42]: The boy hesitated , looked reproachfully at the pilgrims as if they had involved him in a little difficulty , then said , folding a plait in the right leg of his trousers , ` He gets his living along-shore . '
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 6]: ` Is it far ? '
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 6]: ` Is which far ? '
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 16]: asked the boy , upon his guard , and again upon the road to Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: ` To your father 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 9]: ` It 's a goodish stretch , sir .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 16]: I come up in a cab , and the cab 's waiting to be paid .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 15]: We could go back in it before you paid it , if you liked .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 38]: I went first to your office , according to the direction of the papers found in the pockets , and there I see nobody but a chap of about my age who sent me on here . '
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 17]: There was a curious mixture in the boy , of uncompleted savagery , and uncompleted civilization .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 63]: His voice was hoarse and coarse , and his face was coarse , and his stunted figure was coarse ; but he was cleaner than other boys of his type ; and his writing , though large and round , was good ; and he glanced at the backs of the books , with an awakened curiosity that went below the binding .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 24]: No one who can read , ever looks at a book , even unopened on a shelf , like one who can not .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 23]: ` Were any means taken , do you know , boy , to ascertain if it was possible to restore life ? '
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 10]: Mortimer inquired , as he sought for his hat .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 14]: ` You would n't ask , sir , if you knew his state .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 19]: Pharaoh 's multitude that were drowned in the Red Sea , ai n't more beyond restoring to life .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 19]: If Lazarus was only half as far gone , that was the greatest of all the miracles . '
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 29]: cried Mortimer , turning round with his hat upon his head , ` you seem to be at home in the Red Sea , my young friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 15]: ` Read of it with teacher at the school , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 5]: ` And Lazarus ? '
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 7]: ` Yes , and him too .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 8]: But do n't you tell my father !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 15]: We should have no peace in our place , if that got touched upon .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 8]: It 's my sister 's contriving . '
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 10]: ` You seem to have a good sister . '
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 33]: ` She ai n't half bad , ' said the boy ; ` but if she knows her letters it 's the most she does -- and them I learned her . '
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 54]: The gloomy Eugene , with his hands in his pockets , had strolled in and assisted at the latter part of the dialogue ; when the boy spoke these words slightingly of his sister , he took him roughly enough by the chin , and turned up his face to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 10]: ` Well , I 'm sure , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 16]: said the boy , resisting ; ' I hope you 'll know me again . '
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 24]: Eugene vouchsafed no answer ; but made the proposal to Mortimer , ` I 'll go with you , if you like ? '
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 43]: So , they all three went away together in the vehicle that had brought the boy ; the two friends -LRB- once boys together at a public school -RRB- inside , smoking cigars ; the messenger on the box beside the driver .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 82]: ` Let me see , ' said Mortimer , as they went along ; ' I have been , Eugene , upon the honourable roll of solicitors of the High Court of Chancery , and attorneys at Common Law , five years ; and -- except gratuitously taking instructions , on an average once a fortnight , for the will of Lady Tippins who has nothing to leave -- I have had no scrap of business but this romantic business . '
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 31]: ` And I , ' said Eugene , ` have been `` called '' seven years , and have had no business at all , and never shall have any .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 16]: And if I had , I should n't know how to do it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 31]: I am far from being clear as to the last particular , ' returned Mortimer , with great composure , ` that I have much advantage over you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 23]: I hate , ' said Eugene , putting his legs up on the opposite seat , ' I hate my profession . '
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 14]: ` Shall I incommode you , if I put mine up too ? '
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 3]: returned Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 5]: I hate mine . '
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 27]: ` It was forced upon me , ' said the gloomy Eugene , ` because it was understood that we wanted a barrister in the family .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 8]: We have got a precious one . '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 25]: ` It was forced upon me , ' said Mortimer , ` because it was understood that we wanted a solicitor in the family .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 9]: And we have got a precious one . '
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 64]: ` There are four of us , with our names painted on a door-post in right of one black hole called a set of chambers , ' said Eugene ; ` and each of us has the fourth of a clerk -- Cassim Baba , in the robber 's cave -- and Cassim is the only respectable member of the party . ' '
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 59]: I am one by myself , one , ' said Mortimer , ` high up an awful staircase commanding a burial-ground , and I have a whole clerk to myself , and he has nothing to do but look at the burial-ground , and what he will turn out when arrived at maturity , I can not conceive .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 55]: Whether , in that shabby rook 's nest , he is always plotting wisdom , or plotting murder ; whether he will grow up , after so much solitary brooding , to enlighten his fellow-creatures , or to poison them ; is the only speck of interest that presents itself to my professional view .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 7]: Will you give me a light ?
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 4]: Thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 33]: ` Then idiots talk , ' said Eugene , leaning back , folding his arms , smoking with his eyes shut , and speaking slightly through his nose , ` of Energy .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 23]: If there is a word in the dictionary under any letter from A to Z that I abominate , it is energy .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 11]: It is such a conventional superstition , such parrot gabble !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 4]: What the deuce !
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 52]: Am I to rush out into the street , collar the first man of a wealthy appearance that I meet , shake him , and say , `` Go to law upon the spot , you dog , and retain me , or I 'll be the death of you '' ?
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 7]: Yet that would be energy . '
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 10]: ` Precisely my view of the case , Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 24]: But show me a good opportunity , show me something really worth being energetic about , and I 'll show you energy . '
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 10]: ` And so will I , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 35]: And it is likely enough that ten thousand other young men , within the limits of the London Post-office town delivery , made the same hopeful remark in the course of the same evening .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 70]: The wheels rolled on , and rolled down by the Monument and by the Tower , and by the Docks ; down by Ratcliffe , and by Rotherhithe ; down by where accumulated scum of humanity seemed to be washed from higher grounds , like so much moral sewage , and to be pausing until its own weight forced it over the bank and sunk it in the river .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 63]: In and out among vessels that seemed to have got ashore , and houses that seemed to have got afloat -- among bow-splits staring into windows , and windows staring into ships -- the wheels rolled on , until they stopped at a dark corner , river-washed and otherwise not washed at all , where the boy alighted and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 16]: ` You must walk the rest , sir ; it 's not many yards . '
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 14]: He spoke in the singular number , to the express exclusion of Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 30]: ` This is a confoundedly out-of-the-way place , ' said Mortimer , slipping over the stones and refuse on the shore , as the boy turned the corner sharp .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 15]: ` Here 's my father 's , sir ; where the light is . '
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 13]: The low building had the look of having once been a mill .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 34]: There was a rotten wart of wood upon its forehead that seemed to indicate where the sails had been , but the whole was very indistinctly seen in the obscurity of the night .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 42]: The boy lifted the latch of the door , and they passed at once into a low circular room , where a man stood before a red fire , looking down into it , and a girl sat engaged in needlework .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 38]: The fire was in a rusty brazier , not fitted to the hearth ; and a common lamp , shaped like a hyacinthroot , smoked and flared in the neck of a stone bottle on the table .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 34]: There was a wooden bunk or berth in a corner , and in another corner a wooden stair leading above -- so clumsy and steep that it was little better than a ladder .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 37]: Two or three old sculls and oars stood against the wall , and against another part of the wall was a small dresser , making a spare show of the commonest articles of crockery and cooking-vessels .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 20]: The roof of the room was not plastered , but was formed of the flooring of the room above .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 63]: This , being very old , knotted , seamed , and beamed , gave a lowering aspect to the chamber ; and roof , and walls , and floor , alike abounding in old smears of flour , red-lead -LRB- or some such stain which it had probably acquired in warehousing -RRB- , and damp , alike had a look of decomposition .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 7]: ` The gentleman , father . '
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 21]: The figure at the red fire turned , raised its ruffled head , and looked like a bird of prey .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 13]: ` You 're Mortimer Lightwood Esquire ; are you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 7]: ` Mortimer Lightwood is my name .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 22]: What you found , ' said Mortimer , glancing rather shrinkingly towards the bunk ; ` is it here ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 13]: Tai n't not to say here , but it 's close by .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 7]: I do everything reg ` lar .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 21]: I 've giv ' notice of the circumstarnce to the police , and the police have took possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 11]: No time ai n't been lost , on any hand .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 19]: The police have put into print already , and here 's what the print says of it . '
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 28]: Taking up the bottle with the lamp in it , he held it near a paper on the wall , with the police heading , BODY FOUND .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 23]: The two friends read the handbill as it stuck against the wall , and Gaffer read them as he held the light .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 28]: ` Only papers on the unfortunate man , I see , ' said Lightwood , glancing from the description of what was found , to the finder .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 5]: ` Only papers . '
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 18]: Here the girl arose with her work in her hand , and went out at the door .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 18]: ` No money , ' pursued Mortimer ; ` but threepence in one of the skirtpockets . '
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 3]: ` Three .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 2]: Penny .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 12]: Pieces , ' said Gaffer Hexam , in as many sentences .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 12]: ` The trousers pockets empty , and turned inside out . '
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 4]: Gaffer Hexam nodded .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 6]: ` But that 's common .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 16]: Whether it 's the wash of the tide or no , I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 25]: Now , here , ' moving the light to another similar placard , ` HIS pockets was found empty , and turned inside out .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 22]: And here , ' moving the light to another , ` HER pocket was found empty , and turned inside out .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 7]: And so was this one 's .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 7]: And so was that one 's .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 24]: I ca n't read , nor I do n't want to it , for I know 'em by their places on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 20]: This one was a sailor , with two anchors and a flag and G. F. T. on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 9]: Look and see if he war n't . '
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 5]: ` Quite right . '
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 19]: ` This one was the young woman in grey boots , and her linen marked with a cross .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 9]: Look and see if she war n't . '
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 5]: ` Quite right . '
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 13]: ` This is him as had a nasty cut over the eye .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 14]: This is them two young sisters what tied themselves together with a handkecher .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 55]: This the drunken old chap , in a pair of list slippers and a nightcap , wot had offered -- it afterwards come out -- to make a hole in the water for a quartern of rum stood aforehand , and kept to his word for the first and last time in his life .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 16]: They pretty well papers the room , you see ; but I know 'em all .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 6]: I 'm scholar enough ! '
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 37]: He waved the light over the whole , as if to typify the light of his scholarly intelligence , and then put it down on the table and stood behind it looking intently at his visitors .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 24]: He had the special peculiarity of some birds of prey , that when he knitted his brow , his ruffled crest stood highest .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 13]: ` You did not find all these yourself ; did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 3]: asked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 20]: To which the bird of prey slowly rejoined , ` And what might YOUR name be , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 17]: ` This is my friend , ' Mortimer Lightwood interposed ; ` Mr Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 8]: ` Mr Eugene Wrayburn , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 13]: And what might Mr Eugene Wrayburn have asked of me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 15]: I asked you , simply , if you found all these yourself ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 11]: I answer you , simply , most on 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 20]: ` Do you suppose there has been much violence and robbery , beforehand , among these cases ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 14]: I do n't suppose at all about it , ' returned Gaffer . '
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 9]: I ai n't one of the supposing sort .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 27]: If you 'd got your living to haul out of the river every day of your life , you might n't be much given to supposing .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 8]: Am I to show the way ? '
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 34]: As he opened the door , in pursuance of a nod from Lightwood , an extremely pale and disturbed face appeared in the doorway -- the face of a man much agitated . '
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 5]: A body missing ? '
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 13]: asked Gaffer Hexam , stopping short ; ` or a body found ?
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 4]: Which ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 5]: I am lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 12]: replied the man , in a hurried and an eager manner .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 4]: ` Lost ? '
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 16]: ` I -- I -- am a stranger , and do n't know the way .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 18]: I -- I -- want to find the place where I can see what is described here .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 9]: It is possible I may know it . '
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 27]: He was panting , and could hardly speak ; but , he showed a copy of the newly-printed bill that was still wet upon the wall .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 23]: Perhaps its newness , or perhaps the accuracy of his observation of its general look , guided Gaffer to a ready conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 13]: ` This gentleman , Mr Lightwood , is on that business . '
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 5]: ` Mr Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 12]: During a pause , Mortimer and the stranger confronted each other .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 6]: Neither knew the other . '
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 32]: I think , sir , ' said Mortimer , breaking the awkward silence with his airy self-possession , ` that you did me the honour to mention my name ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 9]: I repeated it , after this man . '
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 11]: ` You said you were a stranger in London ? '
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 6]: ` An utter stranger . '
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 9]: ` Are you seeking a Mr Harmon ? '
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 26]: ` Then I believe I can assure you that you are on a fruitless errand , and will not find what you fear to find .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 7]: Will you come with us ? '
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 91]: A little winding through some muddy alleys that might have been deposited by the last ill-savoured tide , brought them to the wicketgate and bright lamp of a Police Station ; where they found the Night-Inspector , with a pen and ink , and ruler , posting up his books in a whitewashed office , as studiously as if he were in a monastery on top of a mountain , and no howling fury of a drunken woman were banging herself against a cell-door in the back-yard at his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 33]: With the same air of a recluse much given to study , he desisted from his books to bestow a distrustful nod of recognition upon Gaffer , plainly importing , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 31]: we know all about YOU , and you 'll overdo it some day ; ' and to inform Mr Morrimer Lightwood and friends , that he would attend them immediately .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 62]: Then , he finished ruling the work he had in hand -LRB- it might have been illuminating a missal , he was so calm -RRB- , in a very neat and methodical manner , showing not the slightest consciousness of the woman who was banging herself with increased violence , and shrieking most terrifically for some other woman 's liver . '
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 16]: A bull 's - eye , ' said the Night-Inspector , taking up his keys .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 6]: Which a deferential satellite produced .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 6]: ` Now , gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 24]: With one of his keys , he opened a cool grot at the end of the yard , and they all went in .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 30]: They quickly came out again , no one speaking but Eugene : who remarked to Mortimer , in a whisper , ` Not MUCH worse than Lady Tippins . '
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 52]: So , back to the whitewashed library of the monastery -- with that liver still in shrieking requisition , as it had been loudly , while they looked at the silent sight they came to see -- and there through the merits of the case as summed up by the Abbot .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 9]: No clue to how body came into river .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 6]: Very often was no clue .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 31]: Too late to know for certain , whether injuries received before or after death ; one excellent surgical opinion said , before ; other excellent surgical opinion said , after .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 22]: Steward of ship in which gentleman came home passenger , had been round to view , and could swear to identity .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 6]: Likewise could swear to clothes .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 13]: And then , you see , you had the papers , too .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 16]: How was it he had totally disappeared on leaving ship , 'till found in river ?
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: Probably had been upon some little game .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 21]: Probably thought it a harmless game , was n't up to things , and it turned out a fatal game .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 9]: Inquest to-morrow , and no doubt open verdict .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 30]: ` It appears to have knocked your friend over -- knocked him completely off his legs , ' Mr Inspector remarked , when he had finished his summing up .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 13]: ` It has given him a bad turn to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 26]: This was said in a very low voice , and with a searching look -LRB- not the first he had cast -RRB- at the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 11]: Mr Lightwood explained that it was no friend of his .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 4]: ` Indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 18]: said Mr Inspector , with an attentive ear ; ` where did you pick him up ? '
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 5]: Mr Lightwood explained further .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 43]: Mr Inspector had delivered his summing up , and had added these words , with his elbows leaning on his desk , and the fingers and thumb of his right hand , fitting themselves to the fingers and thumb of his left .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 24]: Mr Inspector moved nothing but his eyes , as he now added , raising his voice : ` Turned you faint , sir !
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 12]: Seems you 're not accustomed to this kind of work ? '
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 21]: The stranger , who was leaning against the chimneypiece with drooping head , looked round and answered , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 7]: It 's a horrible sight ! '
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 13]: ` You expected to identify , I am told , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 6]: ` HAVE you identified ? '
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 6]: It 's a horrible sight .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 7]: a horrible , horrible sight ! '
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 11]: ` Who did you think it might have been ? '
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 4]: asked Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 8]: ` Give us a description , sir .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 7]: Perhaps we can help you . '
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 17]: ` No , no , ' said the stranger ; ` it would be quite useless .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 3]: Good-night . '
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 62]: Mr Inspector had not moved , and had given no order ; but , the satellite slipped his back against the wicket , and laid his left arm along the top of it , and with his right hand turned the bull 's - eye he had taken from his chief -- in quite a casual manner -- towards the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 29]: ` You missed a friend , you know ; or you missed a foe , you know ; or you would n't have come here , you know .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 16]: Well , then ; ai n't it reasonable to ask , who was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 5]: Thus , Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 8]: ` You must excuse my telling you .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 28]: No class of man can understand better than you , that families may not choose to publish their disagreements and misfortunes , except on the last necessity .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 26]: I do not dispute that you discharge your duty in asking me the question ; you will not dispute my right to withhold the answer .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 3]: Good-night . '
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 23]: Again he turned towards the wicket , where the satellite , with his eye upon his chief , remained a dumb statue .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 24]: ` At least , ' said Mr Inspector , ` you will not object to leave me your card , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 16]: I should not object , if I had one ; but I have not . '
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 12]: He reddened and was much confused as he gave the answer .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 31]: ` At least , ' said Mr Inspector , with no change of voice or manner , ` you will not object to write down your name and address ? '
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 6]: ` Not at all . '
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 28]: Mr Inspector dipped a pen in his inkstand , and deftly laid it on a piece of paper close beside him ; then resumed his former attitude .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 51]: The stranger stepped up to the desk , and wrote in a rather tremulous hand -- Mr Inspector taking sidelong note of every hair of his head when it was bent down for the purpose -- ` Mr Julius Handford , Exchequer Coffee House , Palace Yard , Westminster . '
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 10]: ` Staying there , I presume , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 5]: ` Staying there . '
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 8]: ` Consequently , from the country ? '
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 3]: ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 7]: Yes -- from the country . '
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 6]: ` Good-night , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 17]: The satellite removed his arm and opened the wicket , and Mr Julius Handford went out .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 4]: ` Reserve ! '
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 4]: said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 34]: ` Take care of this piece of paper , keep him in view without giving offence , ascertain that he IS staying there , and find out anything you can about him . '
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 30]: The satellite was gone ; and Mr Inspector , becoming once again the quiet Abbot of that Monastery , dipped his pen in his ink and resumed his books .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 39]: The two friends who had watched him , more amused by the professional manner than suspicious of Mr Julius Handford , inquired before taking their departure too whether he believed there was anything that really looked bad here ?
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 10]: The Abbot replied with reticence , could n't say .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 10]: If a murder , anybody might have done it .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 7]: Burglary or pocket-picking wanted ` prenticeship .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 5]: Not so , murder .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: We were all of us up to that .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 20]: Had seen scores of people come to identify , and never saw one person struck in that particular way .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 11]: Might , however , have been Stomach and not Mind .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 6]: If so , rum stomach .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 9]: But to be sure there were rum everythings .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 33]: Pity there was not a word of truth in that superstition about bodies bleeding when touched by the hand of the right person ; you never got a sign out of bodies .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 44]: You got row enough out of such as her -- she was good for all night now -LRB- referring here to the banging demands for the liver -RRB- , ` but you got nothing out of bodies if it was ever so . '
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 32]: There being nothing more to be done until the Inquest was held next day , the friends went away together , and Gaffer Hexam and his son went their separate way .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 36]: But , arriving at the last corner , Gaffer bade his boy go home while he turned into a red-curtained tavern , that stood dropsically bulging over the causeway , ` for a half-a-pint . '
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 23]: The boy lifted the latch he had lifted before , and found his sister again seated before the fire at her work .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 21]: Who raised her head upon his coming in and asking : ` Where did you go , Liz ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 8]: I went out in the dark . '
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 8]: ` There was no necessity for that .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 7]: It was all right enough . '
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 22]: ` One of the gentlemen , the one who did n't speak while I was there , looked hard at me .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 12]: And I was afraid he might know what my face meant .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 3]: But there !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 7]: Do n't mind me , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 21]: I was all in a tremble of another sort when you owned to father you could write a little . '
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 21]: But I made believe I wrote so badly , as that it was odds if any one could read it .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 26]: And when I wrote slowest and smeared but with my finger most , father was best pleased , as he stood looking over me . '
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 27]: The girl put aside her work , and drawing her seat close to his seat by the fire , laid her arm gently on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 17]: ` You 'll make the most of your time , Charley ; wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 5]: ` Wo n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 4]: I like that .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 5]: Do n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 7]: ` Yes , Charley , yes .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 10]: You work hard at your learning , I know .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 54]: And I work a little , Charley , and plan and contrive a little -LRB- wake out of my sleep contriving sometimes -RRB- , how to get together a shilling now , and a shilling then , that shall make father believe you are beginning to earn a stray living along shore . '
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 16]: ` You are father 's favourite , and can make him believe anything . ' '
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 7]: I wish I could , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 33]: For if I could make him believe that learning was a good thing , and that we might lead better lives , I should be a ` most content to die . '
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 11]: ` Do n't talk stuff about dying , Liz . '
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 75]: She placed her hands in one another on his shoulder , and laying her rich brown cheek against them as she looked down at the fire , went on thoughtfully : ` Of an evening , Charley , when you are at the school , and father 's -- ' ` At the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters , ' the boy struck in , with a backward nod of his head towards the public-house .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 67]: Then as I sit a-looking at the fire , I seem to see in the burning coal -- like where that glow is now -- ' ` That 's gas , that is , ' said the boy , ` coming out of a bit of a forest that 's been under the mud that was under the water in the days of Noah 's Ark. .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 3]: Look here !
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 32]: When I take the poker -- so -- and give it a dig -- ' ` Do n't disturb it , Charley , or it 'll be all in a blaze .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 16]: It 's that dull glow near it , coming and going , that I mean .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 19]: When I look at it of an evening , it comes like pictures to me , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 11]: ` Show us a picture , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 8]: ` Tell us where to look . '
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 8]: It wants my eyes , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: ` Cut away then , and tell us what your eyes make of it . '
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 55]: ` Why , there are you and me , Charley , when you were quite a baby that never knew a mother -- ' ` Do n't go saying I never knew a mother , ' interposed the boy , ` for I knew a little sister that was sister and mother both . '
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 27]: The girl laughed delightedly , and here eyes filled with pleasant tears , as he put both his arms round her waist and so held her .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 59]: ` There are you and me , Charley , when father was away at work and locked us out , for fear we should set ourselves afire or fall out of window , sitting on the door-sill , sitting on other door-steps , sitting on the bank of the river , wandering about to get through the time .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 17]: You are rather heavy to carry , Charley , and I am often obliged to rest .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 36]: Sometimes we are sleepy and fall asleep together in a corner , sometimes we are very hungry , sometimes we are a little frightened , but what is oftenest hard upon us is the cold .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 7]: You remember , Charley ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 32]: I remember , ' said the boy , pressing her to him twice or thrice , ` that I snuggled under a little shawl , and it was warm there . '
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 40]: ` Sometimes it rains , and we creep under a boat or the like of that : sometimes it 's dark , and we get among the gaslights , sitting watching the people as they go along the streets .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 11]: At last , up comes father and takes us home .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 11]: And home seems such a shelter after out of doors !
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 72]: And father pulls my shoes off , and dries my feet at the fire , and has me to sit by him while he smokes his pipe long after you are abed , and I notice that father 's is a large hand but never a heavy one when it touches me , and that father 's is a rough voice but never an angry one when it speaks to me .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 37]: So , I grow up , and little by little father trusts me , and makes me his companion , and , let him be put out as he may , never once strikes me . '
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 21]: The listening boy gave a grunt here , as much as to say ` But he strikes ME though ! '
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 15]: ` Those are some of the pictures of what is past , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 23]: ` Cut away again , ' said the boy , ` and give us a fortune-telling one ; a future one . '
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 21]: There am I , continuing with father and holding to father , because father loves me and I love father .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 34]: I ca n't so much as read a book , because , if I had learned , father would have thought I was deserting him , and I should have lost my influence .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 37]: I have not the influence I want to have , I can not stop some dreadful things I try to stop , but I go on in the hope and trust that the time will come .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 44]: In the meanwhile I know that I am in some things a stay to father , and that if I was not faithful to him he would -- in revenge-like , or in disappointment , or both -- go wild and bad . '
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 14]: ` Give us a touch of the fortune-telling pictures about me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 40]: I was passing on to them , Charley , ' said the girl , who had not changed her attitude since she began , and who now mournfully shook her head ; ` the others were all leading up .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 13]: There are you -- ' ` Where am I , Liz ? '
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: ` Still in the hollow down by the flare . '
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 40]: ` There seems to be the deuce-and-all in the hollow down by the flare , ' said the boy , glancing from her eyes to the brazier , which had a grisly skeleton look on its long thin legs .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 54]: ` There are you , Charley , working your way , in secret from father , at the school ; and you get prizes ; and you go on better and better ; and you come to be a -- what was it you called it when you told me about that ? '
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 5]: ` Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 7]: Fortune-telling not know the name ! '
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 23]: cried the boy , seeming to be rather relieved by this default on the part of the hollow down by the flare .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 4]: ` Pupil-teacher . '
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 30]: ` You come to be a pupil-teacher , and you still go on better and better , and you rise to be a master full of learning and respect .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 25]: But the secret has come to father 's knowledge long before , and it has divided you from father , and from me . '
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 7]: ` No it has n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: ` Yes it has , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 49]: I see , as plain as plain can be , that your way is not ours , and that even if father could be got to forgive your taking it -LRB- which he never could be -RRB- , that way of yours would be darkened by our way .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 20]: But I see too , Charley -- ' ` Still as plain as plain can be , Liz ? '
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 5]: asked the boy playfully .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 2]: Still .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 26]: That it is a great work to have cut you away from father 's life , and to have made a new and good beginning .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 63]: So there am I , Charley , left alone with father , keeping him as straight as I can , watching for more influence than I have , and hoping that through some fortunate chance , or when he is ill , or when -- I do n't know what -- I may turn him to wish to do better things . '
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 12]: ` You said you could n't read a book , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 17]: Your library of books is the hollow down by the flare , I think . ' '
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 13]: I should be very glad to be able to read real books .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 11]: I feel my want of learning very much , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 23]: But I should feel it much more , if I did n't know it to be a tie between me and father .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 3]: -- Hark !
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 5]: Father 's tread ! '
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 15]: It being now past midnight , the bird of prey went straight to roost .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 30]: At mid-day following he reappeared at the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters , in the character , not new to him , of a witness before a Coroner 's Jury .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 44]: Mr Mortimer Lightwood , besides sustaining the character of one of the witnesses , doubled the part with that of the eminent solicitor who watched the proceedings on behalf of the representatives of the deceased , as was duly recorded in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 15]: Mr Inspector watched the proceedings too , and kept his watching closely to himself .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 59]: Mr Julius Handford having given his right address , and being reported in solvent circumstances as to his bill , though nothing more was known of him at his hotel except that his way of life was very retired , had no summons to appear , and was merely present in the shades of Mr Inspector 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 72]: The case was made interesting to the public , by Mr Mortimer Lighiwood 's evidence touching the circumstances under which the deceased , Mr John Harmon , had returned to England ; exclusive private proprietorship in which circumstances was set up at dinnertables for several days , by Veneering , Twemlow , Podsnap , and all the Buffers : who all related them irreconcilably with one another , and contradicted themselves .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 72]: It was also made interesting by the testimony of Job Potterson , the ship 's steward , and one Mr Jacob Kibble , a fellow-passenger , that the deceased Mr John Harmon did bring over , in a hand-valise with which he did disembark , the sum realized by the forced sale of his little landed property , and that the sum exceeded , in ready money , seven hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 63]: It was further made interesting , by the remarkable experiences of Jesse Hexam in having rescued from the Thames so many dead bodies , and for whose behoof a rapturous admirer subscribing himself ' A friend to Burial ' -LRB- perhaps an undertaker -RRB- , sent eighteen postage stamps , and five ` Now Sir 's to the editor of the Times .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 73]: Upon the evidence adduced before them , the Jury found , That the body of Mr John Harmon had been discovered floating in the Thames , in an advanced state of decay , and much injured ; and that the said Mr John Harmon had come by his death under highly suspicious circumstances , though by whose act or in what precise manner there was no evidence before this Jury to show .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 35]: And they appended to their verdict , a recommendation to the Home Office -LRB- which Mr Inspector appeared to think highly sensible -RRB- , to offer a reward for the solution of the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 37]: Within eight-and-forty hours , a reward of One Hundred Pounds was proclaimed , together with a free pardon to any person or persons not the actual perpetrator or perpetrators , and so forth in due form .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 33]: This Proclamation rendered Mr Inspector additionally studious , and caused him to stand meditating on river-stairs and causeways , and to go lurking about in boats , putting this and that together .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 30]: But , according to the success with which you put this and that together , you get a woman and a fish apart , or a Mermaid in combination .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 21]: And Mr Inspector could turn out nothing better than a Mermaid , which no Judge and Jury would believe in .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 93]: Thus , like the tides on which it had been borne to the knowledge of men , the Harmon Murder -- as it came to be popularly called -- went up and down , and ebbed and flowed , now in the town , now in the country , now among palaces , now among hovels , now among lords and ladies and gentlefolks , now among labourers and hammerers and ballast-heavers , until at last , after a long interval of slack water it got out to sea and drifted away .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 43]: Chapter 4 THE R. WILFER FAMILY Reginald Wilfer is a name with rather a grand sound , suggesting on first acquaintance brasses in country churches , scrolls in stained-glass windows , and generally the De Wilfers who came over with the Conqueror .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 21]: For , it is a remarkable fact in genealogy that no De Any ones ever came over with Anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 44]: But , the Reginald Wilfer family were of such commonplace extraction and pursuits that their forefathers had for generations modestly subsisted on the Docks , the Excise Office , and the Custom House , and the existing R. Wilfer was a poor clerk .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 49]: So poor a clerk , though having a limited salary and an unlimited family , that he had never yet attained the modest object of his ambition : which was , to wear a complete new suit of clothes , hat and boots included , at one time .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 69]: His black hat was brown before he could afford a coat , his pantaloons were white at the seams and knees before he could buy a pair of boots , his boots had worn out before he could treat himself to new pantaloons , and , by the time he worked round to the hat again , that shining modern article roofed-in an ancient ruin of various periods .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 22]: If the conventional Cherub could ever grow up and be clothed , he might be photographed as a portrait of Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 24]: His chubby , smooth , innocent appearance was a reason for his being always treated with condescension when he was not put down .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 24]: A stranger entering his own poor house at about ten o'clock P.M. might have been surprised to find him sitting up to supper .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 34]: So boyish was he in his curves and proportions , that his old schoolmaster meeting him in Cheapside , might have been unable to withstand the temptation of caning him on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 33]: In short , he was the conventional cherub , after the supposititious shoot just mentioned , rather grey , with signs of care on his expression , and in decidedly insolvent circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 23]: He was shy , and unwilling to own to the name of Reginald , as being too aspiring and self-assertive a name .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 30]: In his signature he used only the initial R. , and imparted what it really stood for , to none but chosen friends , under the seal of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 29]: Out of this , the facetious habit had arisen in the neighbourhood surrounding Mincing Lane of making christian names for him of adjectives and participles beginning with R .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 44]: Some of these were more or less appropriate : as Rusty , Retiring , Ruddy , Round , Ripe , Ridiculous , Ruminative ; others , derived their point from their want of application : as Raging , Rattling , Roaring , Raffish .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 83]: But , his popular name was Rumty , which in a moment of inspiration had been bestowed upon him by a gentleman of convivial habits connected with the drug-markets , as the beginning of a social chorus , his leading part in the execution of which had led this gentleman to the Temple of Fame , and of which the whole expressive burden ran : ` Rumty iddity , row dow dow , Sing toodlely , teedlely , bow wow wow . '
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 37]: Thus he was constantly addressed , even in minor notes on business , as ` Dear Rumty ' ; in answer to which , he sedately signed himself , ` Yours truly , R. Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 14]: He was clerk in the drug-house of Chicksey , Veneering , and Stobbles .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 52]: Chicksey and Stobbles , his former masters , had both become absorbed in Veneering , once their traveller or commission agent : who had signalized his accession to supreme power by bringing into the business a quantity of plate-glass window and French-polished mahogany partition , and a gleaming and enormous doorplate .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 31]: R. Wilfer locked up his desk one evening , and , putting his bunch of keys in his pocket much as if it were his peg-top , made for home .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 21]: His home was in the Holloway region north of London , and then divided from it by fields and trees .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 52]: Between Battle Bridge and that part of the Holloway district in which he dwelt , was a tract of suburban Sahara , where tiles and bricks were burnt , bones were boiled , carpets were beat , rubbish was shot , dogs were fought , and dust was heaped by contractors .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 34]: Skirting the border of this desert , by the way he took , when the light of its kiln-fires made lurid smears on the fog , R. Wilfer sighed and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 5]: ` Ah me ! '
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: said he , ` what might have been is not what is ! '
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 31]: With which commentary on human life , indicating an experience of it not exclusively his own , he made the best of his way to the end of his journey .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 14]: Mrs Wilfer was , of course , a tall woman and an angular .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 19]: Her lord being cherubic , she was necessarily majestic , according to the principle which matrimonially unites contrasts .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 18]: She was much given to tying up her head in a pocket-handkerchief , knotted under the chin .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 47]: This head-gear , in conjunction with a pair of gloves worn within doors , she seemed to consider as at once a kind of armour against misfortune -LRB- invariably assuming it when in low spirits or difficulties -RRB- , and as a species of full dress .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 44]: It was therefore with some sinking of the spirit that her husband beheld her thus heroically attired , putting down her candle in the little hall , and coming down the doorsteps through the little front court to open the gate for him .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 27]: Something had gone wrong with the house-door , for R. Wilfer stopped on the steps , staring at it , and cried : ` Hal-loa ? '
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 29]: ` Yes , ' said Mrs Wilfer , ` the man came himself with a pair of pincers , and took it off , and took it away .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 43]: He said that as he had no expectation of ever being paid for it , and as he had an order for another LADIES ' SCHOOL door-plate , it was better -LRB- burnished up -RRB- for the interests of all parties . '
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 14]: ` Perhaps it was , my dear ; what do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 14]: ` You are master here , R. W. , ' returned his wife .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 12]: ` It is as you think ; not as I do .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 16]: Perhaps it might have been better if the man had taken the door too ? '
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 14]: ` My dear , we could n't have done without the door . '
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 6]: ` Could n't we ? '
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 6]: ` Why , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 4]: Could we ? '
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 16]: ` It is as you think , R. W. ; not as I do . '
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 91]: With those submissive words , the dutiful wife preceded him down a few stairs to a little basement front room , half kitchen , half parlour , where a girl of about nineteen , with an exceedingly pretty figure and face , but with an impatient and petulant expression both in her face and in her shoulders -LRB- which in her sex and at her age are very expressive of discontent -RRB- , sat playing draughts with a younger girl , who was the youngest of the House of Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 50]: Not to encumber this page by telling off the Wilfers in detail and casting them up in the gross , it is enough for the present that the rest were what is called ` out in the world , ' in various ways , and that they were Many .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 34]: So many , that when one of his dutiful children called in to see him , R. Wilfer generally seemed to say to himself , after a little mental arithmetic , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 7]: here 's another of 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 21]: before adding aloud , ` How de do , John , ' or Susan , as the case might be .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 15]: ` Well Piggywiggies , ' said R. W. , ` how de do to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 103]: What I was thinking of , my dear , ' to Mrs Wilfer already seated in a corner with folded gloves , ` was , that as we have let our first floor so well , and as we have now no place in which you could teach pupils even if pupils -- ' ` The milkman said he knew of two young ladies of the highest respectability who were in search of a suitable establishment , and he took a card , ' interposed Mrs Wilfer , with severe monotony , as if she were reading an Act of Parliament aloud .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 13]: ` Tell your father whether it was last Monday , Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 20]: ` But we never heard any more of it , ma , ' said Bella , the elder girl .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 45]: ` In addition to which , my dear , ' her husband urged , ` if you have no place to put two young persons into -- ' ` Pardon me , ' Mrs Wilfer again interposed ; ` they were not young persons .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 8]: Two young ladies of the highest respectability .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 13]: Tell your father , Bella , whether the milkman said so . '
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 11]: ` My dear , it is the same thing . '
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 17]: ` No it is not , ' said Mrs Wilfer , with the same impressive monotony .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 6]: ` Pardon me ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 15]: I mean , my dear , it is the same thing as to space .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 4]: As to space .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 32]: If you have no space in which to put two youthful fellow-creatures , however eminently respectable , which I do not doubt , where are those youthful fellow-creatures to be accommodated ?
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 8]: I carry it no further than that .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 50]: And solely looking at it , ' said her husband , making the stipulation at once in a conciliatory , complimentary , and argumentative tone -- ` as I am sure you will agree , my love -- from a fellow-creature point of view , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 21]: I have nothing more to say , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , with a meek renunciatory action of her gloves .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 16]: ` It is as you think , R. W. ; not as I do . '
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 54]: Here , the huffing of Miss Bella and the loss of three of her men at a swoop , aggravated by the coronation of an opponent , led to that young lady 's jerking the draught-board and pieces off the table : which her sister went down on her knees to pick up .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 5]: ` Poor Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 11]: ` And poor Lavinia , perhaps , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 16]: suggested R. W. ` Pardon me , ' said Mrs Wilfer , ` no ! '
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 41]: It was one of the worthy woman 's specialities that she had an amazing power of gratifying her splenetic or wordly-minded humours by extolling her own family : which she thus proceeded , in the present case , to do .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 16]: ` No , R. W. Lavinia has not known the trial that Bella has known .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 28]: The trial that your daughter Bella has undergone , is , perhaps , without a parallel , and has been borne , I will say , Nobly .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 65]: When you see your daughter Bella in her black dress , which she alone of all the family wears , and when you remember the circumstances which have led to her wearing it , and when you know how those circumstances have been sustained , then , R. W. , lay your head upon your pillow and say , `` Poor Lavinia ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 33]: Here , Miss Lavinia , from her kneeling situation under the table , put in that she did n't want to be ` poored by pa ' , or anybody else . '
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 24]: I am sure you do not , my dear , ' returned her mother , ` for you have a fine brave spirit .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 23]: And your sister Cecilia has a fine brave spirit of another kind , a spirit of pure devotion , a beau-ti-ful spirit !
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 18]: The self-sacrifice of Cecilia reveals a pure and womanly character , very seldom equalled , never surpassed .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 27]: I have now in my pocket a letter from your sister Cecilia , received this morning -- received three months after her marriage , poor child !
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 19]: -- in which she tells me that her husband must unexpectedly shelter under their roof his reduced aunt .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 33]: `` But I will be true to him , mamma , '' she touchingly writes , `` I will not leave him , I must not forget that he is my husband .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 6]: Let his aunt come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 16]: If this is not pathetic , if this is not woman 's devotion -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 31]: The good lady waved her gloves in a sense of the impossibility of saying more , and tied the pockethandkerchief over her head in a tighter knot under her chin .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 43]: Bella , who was now seated on the rug to warm herself , with her brown eyes on the fire and a handful of her brown curls in her mouth , laughed at this , and then pouted and half cried . '
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 31]: I am sure , ' said she , ` though you have no feeling for me , pa , I am one of the most unfortunate girls that ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 22]: You know how poor we are ' -LRB- it is probable he did , having some reason to know it ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 31]: , ` and what a glimpse of wealth I had , and how it melted away , and how I am here in this ridiculous mourning -- which I hate !
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 11]: -- a kind of a widow who never was married .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 9]: And yet you do n't feel for me .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 10]: -- Yes you do , yes you do . '
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 11]: This abrupt change was occasioned by her father 's face .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 32]: She stopped to pull him down from his chair in an attitude highly favourable to strangulation , and to give him a kiss and a pat or two on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 15]: ` But you ought to feel for me , you know , pa . '
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 8]: ` My dear , I do . '
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 10]: ` Yes , and I say you ought to .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 21]: If they had only left me alone and told me nothing about it , it would have mattered much less .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 39]: But that nasty Mr Lightwood feels it his duty , as he says , to write and tell me what is in reserve for me , and then I am obliged to get rid of George Sampson . '
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 27]: Here , Lavinia , rising to the surface with the last draughtman rescued , interposed , ` You never cared for George Sampson , Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 11]: ` And did I say I did , miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 38]: Then , pouting again , with the curls in her mouth ; ` George Sampson was very fond of me , and admired me very much , and put up with everything I did to him . '
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: ` You were rude enough to him , ' Lavinia again interposed .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: ` And did I say I was n't , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 12]: I am not setting up to be sentimental about George Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 11]: I only say George Sampson was better than nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 17]: ` You did n't show him that you thought even that , ' Lavinia again interposed .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 25]: ` You are a chit and a little idiot , ' returned Bella , ` or you would n't make such a dolly speech .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 8]: What did you expect me to do ?
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 18]: Wait till you are a woman , and do n't talk about what you do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 7]: You only show your ignorance ! '
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 28]: Then , whimpering again , and at intervals biting the curls , and stopping to look how much was bitten off , ` It 's a shame !
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: There never was such a hard case !
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 13]: I should n't care so much if it was n't so ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 21]: It was ridiculous enough to have a stranger coming over to marry me , whether he liked it or not .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 32]: It was ridiculous enough to know what an embarrassing meeting it would be , and how we never could pretend to have an inclination of our own , either of us .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 42]: It was ridiculous enough to know I should n't like him -- how COULD I like him , left to him in a will , like a dozen of spoons , with everything cut and dried beforehand , like orange chips .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 6]: Talk of orange flowers indeed !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 8]: I declare again it 's a shame !
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 25]: Those ridiculous points would have been smoothed away by the money , for I love money , and want money -- want it dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 21]: I hate to be poor , and we are degradingly poor , offensively poor , miserably poor , beastly poor .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 27]: But here I am , left with all the ridiculous parts of the situation remaining , and , added to them all , this ridiculous dress !
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 52]: And if the truth was known , when the Harmon murder was all over the town , and people were speculating on its being suicide , I dare say those impudent wretches at the clubs and places made jokes about the miserable creature 's having preferred a watery grave to me .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 14]: It 's likely enough they took such liberties ; I should n't wonder !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 18]: I declare it 's a very hard case indeed , and I am a most unfortunate girl .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 16]: The idea of being a kind of a widow , and never having been married !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 44]: And the idea of being as poor as ever after all , and going into black , besides , for a man I never saw , and should have hated -- as far as HE was concerned -- if I had seen ! '
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 23]: The young lady 's lamentations were checked at this point by a knuckle , knocking at the half-open door of the room .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 16]: The knuckle had knocked two or three times already , but had not been heard .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 6]: ` Who is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 9]: said Mrs Wilfer , in her Act-of-Parliament manner .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 4]: ` Enter ! '
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 33]: A gentleman coming in , Miss Bella , with a short and sharp exclamation , scrambled off the hearth-rug and massed the bitten curls together in their right place on her neck .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 28]: ` The servant girl had her key in the door as I came up , and directed me to this room , telling me I was expected .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 13]: I am afraid I should have asked her to announce me . '
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 9]: ` Pardon me , ' returned Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 5]: ` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 5]: Two of my daughters .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 13]: R. W. , this is the gentleman who has taken your firstfloor .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 20]: He was so good as to make an appointment for to-night , when you would be at home . '
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 4]: A dark gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 5]: Thirty at the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 10]: An expressive , one might say handsome , face .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 5]: A very bad manner .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 12]: In the last degree constrained , reserved , diffident , troubled .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 25]: His eyes were on Miss Bella for an instant , and then looked at the ground as he addressed the master of the house .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 47]: ` Seeing that I am quite satisfied , Mr Wilfer , with the rooms , and with their situation , and with their price , I suppose a memorandum between us of two or three lines , and a payment down , will bind the bargain ?
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 10]: I wish to send in furniture without delay . '
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 20]: Two or three times during this short address , the cherub addressed had made chubby motions towards a chair .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 39]: The gentleman now took it , laying a hesitating hand on a corner of the table , and with another hesitating hand lifting the crown of his hat to his lips , and drawing it before his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 22]: ` The gentleman , R. W. , ' said Mrs Wilfer , ` proposes to take your apartments by the quarter .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 9]: A quarter 's notice on either side . '
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 32]: ` Shall I mention , sir , ' insinuated the landlord , expecting it to be received as a matter of course , ` the form of a reference ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 39]: I think , ' returned the gentleman , after a pause , ` that a reference is not necessary ; neither , to say the truth , is it convenient , for I am a stranger in London .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 19]: I require no reference from you , and perhaps , therefore , you will require none from me .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 8]: That will be fair on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 31]: Indeed , I show the greater confidence of the two , for I will pay in advance whatever you please , and I am going to trust my furniture here .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 48]: Whereas , if you were in embarrassed circumstances -- this is merely supposititious -- ' Conscience causing R. Wilfer to colour , Mrs Wilfer , from a corner -LRB- she always got into stately corners -RRB- came to the rescue with a deep-toned ` Per-fectly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 10]: -- Why then I -- might lose it . '
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 18]: observed R. Wilfer , cheerfully , ` money and goods are certainly the best of references . '
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 12]: ` Do you think they ARE the best , pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 24]: asked Miss Bella , in a low voice , and without looking over her shoulder as she warmed her foot on the fender .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 10]: ` Among the best , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 30]: I should have thought , myself , it was so easy to add the usual kind of one , ' said Bella , with a toss of her curls .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 23]: The gentleman listened to her , with a face of marked attention , though he neither looked up nor changed his attitude .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 24]: He sat , still and silent , until his future landlord accepted his proposals , and brought writing materials to complete the business .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 12]: He sat , still and silent , while the landlord wrote .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 54]: When the agreement was ready in duplicate -LRB- the landlord having worked at it like some cherubic scribe , in what is conventionally called a doubtful , which means a not at all doubtful , Old Master -RRB- , it was signed by the contracting parties , Bella looking on as scornful witness .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 12]: The contracting parties were R. Wilfer , and John Rokesmith Esquire .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 40]: When it came to Bella 's turn to sign her name , Mr Rokesmith , who was standing , as he had sat , with a hesitating hand upon the table , looked at her stealthily , but narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 23]: He looked at the pretty figure bending down over the paper and saying , ` Where am I to go , pa ?
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 7]: Here , in this corner ? '
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 41]: He looked at the beautiful brown hair , shading the coquettish face ; he looked at the free dash of the signature , which was a bold one for a woman 's ; and then they looked at one another .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 10]: ` Much obliged to you , Miss Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 5]: ` Obliged ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 9]: I have given you so much trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 5]: ` Signing my name ?
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 4]: Yes , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 11]: But I am your landlord 's daughter , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 59]: As there was nothing more to do but pay eight sovereigns in earnest of the bargain , pocket the agreement , appoint a time for the arrival of his furniture and himself , and go , Mr Rokesmith did that as awkwardly as it might be done , and was escorted by his landlord to the outer air .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 22]: When R. Wilfer returned , candlestick in hand , to the bosom of his family , he found the bosom agitated .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 18]: ` Pa , ' said Bella , ` we have got a Murderer for a tenant . '
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 15]: ` Pa , ' said Lavinia , ` we have got a Robber . '
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 16]: ` To see him unable for his life to look anybody in the face ! '
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 9]: ` There never was such an exhibition . '
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 32]: ` My dears , ' said their father , ` he is a diffident gentleman , and I should say particularly so in the society of girls of your age . '
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 7]: ` Nonsense , our age ! '
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 5]: cried Bella , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 11]: ` What 's that got to do with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 16]: ` Besides , we are not of the same age : -- which age ? '
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 3]: demanded Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 25]: ` Never YOU mind , Lavvy , ' retorted Bella ; ` you wait till you are of an age to ask such questions .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 6]: Pa , mark my words !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 24]: Between Mr Rokesmith and me , there is a natural antipathy and a deep distrust ; and something will come of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 45]: ` My dear , and girls , ' said the cherub-patriarch , ` between Mr Rokesmith and me , there is a matter of eight sovereigns , and something for supper shall come of it , if you 'll agree upon the article . '
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 46]: This was a neat and happy turn to give the subject , treats being rare in the Wilfer household , where a monotonous appearance of Dutch-cheese at ten o'clock in the evening had been rather frequently commented on by the dimpled shoulders of Miss Bella .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 27]: Indeed , the modest Dutchman himself seemed conscious of his want of variety , and generally came before the family in a state of apologetic perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 24]: After some discussion on the relative merits of veal-cutlet , sweetbread , and lobster , a decision was pronounced in favour of veal-cutlet .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 32]: Mrs Wilfer then solemnly divested herself of her handkerchief and gloves , as a preliminary sacrifice to preparing the frying-pan , and R. W. himself went out to purchase the viand .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 21]: He soon returned , bearing the same in a fresh cabbage-leaf , where it coyly embraced a rasher of ham .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 41]: Melodious sounds were not long in rising from the frying-pan on the fire , or in seeming , as the firelight danced in the mellow halls of a couple of full bottles on the table , to play appropriate dance-music .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 7]: The cloth was laid by Lavvy .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 71]: Bella , as the acknowledged ornament of the family , employed both her hands in giving her hair an additional wave while sitting in the easiest chair , and occasionally threw in a direction touching the supper : as , ` Very brown , ma ; ' or , to her sister , ` Put the saltcellar straight , miss , and do n't be a dowdy little puss . '
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 49]: Meantime her father , chinking Mr Rokesmith 's gold as he sat expectant between his knife and fork , remarked that six of those sovereigns came just in time for their landlord , and stood them in a little pile on the white tablecloth to look at . '
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 6]: I hate our landlord ! '
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 35]: But , observing a fall in her father 's face , she went and sat down by him at the table , and began touching up his hair with the handle of a fork .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 34]: It was one of the girl 's spoilt ways to be always arranging the family 's hair -- perhaps because her own was so pretty , and occupied so much of her attention .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 20]: ` You deserve to have a house of your own ; do n't you , poor pa ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 13]: I do n't deserve it better than another , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 57]: ` At any rate I , for one , want it more than another , ' said Bella , holding him by the chin , as she stuck his flaxen hair on end , ` and I grudge this money going to the Monster that swallows up so much , when we all want -- Everything .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 73]: And if you say -LRB- as you want to say ; I know you want to say so , pa -RRB- `` that 's neither reasonable nor honest , Bella , '' then I answer , `` Maybe not , pa -- very likely -- but it 's one of the consequences of being poor , and of thoroughly hating and detesting to be poor , and that 's my case . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 19]: Now , you look lovely , pa ; why do n't you always wear your hair like that ?
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 6]: And here 's the cutlet !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 28]: If it is n't very brown , ma , I ca n't eat it , and must have a bit put back to be done expressly . '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 51]: However , as it was brown , even to Bella 's taste , the young lady graciously partook of it without reconsignment to the frying-pan , and also , in due course , of the contents of the two bottles : whereof one held Scotch ale and the other rum .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 61]: The latter perfume , with the fostering aid of boiling water and lemon-peel , diffused itself throughout the room , and became so highly concentrated around the warm fireside , that the wind passing over the house roof must have rushed off charged with a delicious whiff of it , after buzzing like a great bee at that particular chimneypot .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 50]: ` Pa , ' said Bella , sipping the fragrant mixture and warming her favourite ankle ; ` when old Mr Harmon made such a fool of me -LRB- not to mention himself , as he is dead -RRB- , what do you suppose he did it for ? '
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 8]: ` Impossible to say , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 31]: As I have told you time out of number since his will was brought to light , I doubt if I ever exchanged a hundred words with the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 13]: If it was his whim to surprise us , his whim succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 7]: For he certainly did it . '
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 22]: ` And I was stamping my foot and screaming , when he first took notice of me ; was I ? '
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 9]: said Bella , contemplating the ankle before mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 109]: ` You were stamping your little foot , my dear , and screaming with your little voice , and laying into me with your little bonnet , which you had snatched off for the purpose , ' returned her father , as if the remembrance gave a relish to the rum ; ` you were doing this one Sunday morning when I took you out , because I did n't go the exact way you wanted , when the old gentleman , sitting on a seat near , said , `` That 's a nice girl ; that 's a VERY nice girl ; a promising girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 9]: And so you were , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 14]: ` And then he asked my name , did he , pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 39]: ` Then he asked your name , my dear , and mine ; and on other Sunday mornings , when we walked his way , we saw him again , and -- and really that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 57]: As that was all the rum and water too , or , in other words , as R. W. delicately signified that his glass was empty , by throwing back his head and standing the glass upside down on his nose and upper lip , it might have been charitable in Mrs Wilfer to suggest replenishment .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 40]: But that heroine briefly suggesting ` Bedtime ' instead , the bottles were put away , and the family retired ; she cherubically escorted , like some severe saint in a painting , or merely human matron allegorically treated .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 39]: ` And by this time to-morrow , ' said Lavinia when the two girls were alone in their room , ` we shall have Mr Rokesmith here , and shall be expecting to have our throats cut . '
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 18]: ` You need n't stand between me and the candle for all that , ' retorted Bella .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: ` This is another of the consequences of being poor !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 29]: The idea of a girl with a really fine head of hair , having to do it by one flat candle and a few inches of looking-glass ! '
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 20]: ` You caught George Sampson with it , Bella , bad as your means of dressing it are . '
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 6]: ` You low little thing .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 6]: Caught George Sampson with it !
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 24]: Do n't talk about catching people , miss , till your own time for catching -- as you call it -- comes . '
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 17]: ` Perhaps it has come , ' muttered Lavvy , with a toss of her head .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 7]: ` What did you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 6]: asked Bella , very sharply .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 9]: ` What did you say , miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 67]: Lavvy declining equally to repeat or to explain , Bella gradually lapsed over her hair-dressing into a soliloquy on the miseries of being poor , as exemplified in having nothing to put on , nothing to go out in , nothing to dress by , only a nasty box to dress at instead of a commodious dressing-table , and being obliged to take in suspicious lodgers .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 41]: On the last grievance as her climax , she laid great stress -- and might have laid greater , had she known that if Mr Julius Handford had a twin brother upon earth , Mr John Rokesmith was the man .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 90]: Chapter 5 BOFFIN 'S BOWER Over against a London house , a corner house not far from Cavendish Square , a man with a wooden leg had sat for some years , with his remaining foot in a basket in cold weather , picking up a living on this wise : -- Every morning at eight o'clock , he stumped to the corner , carrying a chair , a clothes-horse , a pair of trestles , a board , a basket , and an umbrella , all strapped together .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 65]: Separating these , the board and trestles became a counter , the basket supplied the few small lots of fruit and sweets that he offered for sale upon it and became a foot-warmer , the unfolded clothes-horse displayed a choice collection of halfpenny ballads and became a screen , and the stool planted within it became his post for the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 9]: All weathers saw the man at the post .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 27]: This is to be accepted in a double sense , for he contrived a back to his wooden stool , by placing it against the lamp-post .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 71]: When the weather was wet , he put up his umbrella over his stock in trade , not over himself ; when the weather was dry , he furled that faded article , tied it round with a piece of yarn , and laid it cross-wise under the trestles : where it looked like an unwholesomely-forced lettuce that had lost in colour and crispness what it had gained in size .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 13]: He had established his right to the corner , by imperceptible prescription .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 27]: He had never varied his ground an inch , but had in the beginning diffidently taken the corner upon which the side of the house gave .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 25]: A howling corner in the winter time , a dusty corner in the summer time , an undesirable corner at the best of times .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 48]: Shelterless fragments of straw and paper got up revolving storms there , when the main street was at peace ; and the watercart , as if it were drunk or short-sighted , came blundering and jolting round it , making it muddy when all else was clean .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 119]: On the front of his sale-board hung a little placard , like a kettleholder , bearing the inscription in his own small text : Errands gone On with fi Delity By Ladies and Gentlemen I remain Your humble Servt : Silas Wegg He had not only settled it with himself in course of time , that he was errand-goer by appointment to the house at the corner -LRB- though he received such commissions not half a dozen times in a year , and then only as some servant 's deputy -RRB- , but also that he was one of the house 's retainers and owed vassalage to it and was bound to leal and loyal interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 37]: For this reason , he always spoke of it as ` Our House , ' and , though his knowledge of its affairs was mostly speculative and all wrong , claimed to be in its confidence .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 20]: On similar grounds he never beheld an inmate at any one of its windows but he touched his hat .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 68]: Yet , he knew so little about the inmates that he gave them names of his own invention : as ` Miss Elizabeth ' , ` Master George ' , ` Aunt Jane ' , ` Uncle Parker ' -- having no authority whatever for any such designations , but particularly the last -- to which , as a natural consequence , he stuck with great obstinacy .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 19]: Over the house itself , he exercised the same imaginary power as over its inhabitants and their affairs .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 63]: He had never been in it , the length of a piece of fat black water-pipe which trailed itself over the area-door into a damp stone passage , and had rather the air of a leech on the house that had ` taken ' wonderfully ; but this was no impediment to his arranging it according to a plan of his own .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 42]: It was a great dingy house with a quantity of dim side window and blank back premises , and it cost his mind a world of trouble so to lay it out as to account for everything in its external appearance .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 63]: But , this once done , was quite satisfactory , and he rested persuaded , that he knew his way about the house blindfold : from the barred garrets in the high roof , to the two iron extinguishers before the main door -- which seemed to request all lively visitors to have the kindness to put themselves out , before entering .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 22]: Assuredly , this stall of Silas Wegg 's was the hardest little stall of all the sterile little stalls in London .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 27]: It gave you the face-ache to look at his apples , the stomach-ache to look at his oranges , the tooth-ache to look at his nuts .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 39]: Of the latter commodity he had always a grim little heap , on which lay a little wooden measure which had no discernible inside , and was considered to represent the penn ` orth appointed by Magna Charta .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 33]: Whether from too much east wind or no -- it was an easterly corner -- the stall , the stock , and the keeper , were all as dry as the Desert .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 34]: Wegg was a knotty man , and a close-grained , with a face carved out of very hard material , that had just as much play of expression as a watchman 's rattle .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 15]: When he laughed , certain jerks occurred in it , and the rattle sprung .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 59]: Sooth to say , he was so wooden a man that he seemed to have taken his wooden leg naturally , and rather suggested to the fanciful observer , that he might be expected -- if his development received no untimely check -- to be completely set up with a pair of wooden legs in about six months .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 23]: Mr Wegg was an observant person , or , as he himself said , ` took a powerful sight of notice ' .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 34]: He saluted all his regular passers-by every day , as he sat on his stool backed up by the lamp-post ; and on the adaptable character of these salutes he greatly plumed himself .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 110]: Thus , to the rector , he addressed a bow , compounded of lay deference , and a slight touch of the shady preliminary meditation at church ; to the doctor , a confidential bow , as to a gentleman whose acquaintance with his inside he begged respectfully to acknowledge ; before the Quality he delighted to abase himself ; and for Uncle Parker , who was in the army -LRB- at least , so he had settled it -RRB- , he put his open hand to the side of his hat , in a military manner which that angry-eyed buttoned-up inflammatory-faced old gentleman appeared but imperfectly to appreciate .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 16]: The only article in which Silas dealt , that was not hard , was gingerbread .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 75]: On a certain day , some wretched infant having purchased the damp gingerbread-horse -LRB- fearfully out of condition -RRB- , and the adhesive bird-cage , which had been exposed for the day 's sale , he had taken a tin box from under his stool to produce a relay of those dreadful specimens , and was going to look in at the lid , when he said to himself , pausing : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 6]: Here you are again ! '
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 34]: The words referred to a broad , round-shouldered , one-sided old fellow in mourning , coming comically ambling towards the corner , dressed in a pea over-coat , and carrying a large stick .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 18]: He wore thick shoes , and thick leather gaiters , and thick gloves like a hedger 's .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 59]: Both as to his dress and to himself , he was of an overlapping rhinoceros build , with folds in his cheeks , and his forehead , and his eyelids , and his lips , and his ears ; but with bright , eager , childishly-inquiring , grey eyes , under his ragged eyebrows , and broad-brimmed hat .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 7]: A very odd-looking old fellow altogether .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 13]: ` Here you are again , ' repeated Mr Wegg , musing .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 7]: ` And what are you now ?
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 11]: Are you in the Funns , or where are you ?
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 18]: Have you lately come to settle in this neighbourhood , or do you own to another neighbourhood ?
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 18]: Are you in independent circumstances , or is it wasting the motions of a bow on you ?
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 4]: I 'll speculate !
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 9]: I 'll invest a bow in you . '
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 26]: Which Mr Wegg , having replaced his tin box , accordingly did , as he rose to bait his gingerbread-trap for some other devoted infant .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 11]: The salute was acknowledged with : ` Morning , sir !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 2]: Morning !
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 3]: Morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 7]: -LRB- ` Calls me Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 13]: said Mr Wegg , to himself ; ` HE wo n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 6]: A bow gone ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 8]: ` Morning , morning , morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 30]: ` Appears to be rather a ` arty old cock , too , ' said Mr Wegg , as before ; ` Good morning to YOU , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: ` Do you remember me , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 29]: asked his new acquaintance , stopping in his amble , one-sided , before the stall , and speaking in a pounding way , though with great good-humour . '
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 24]: I have noticed you go past our house , sir , several times in the course of the last week or so . '
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 9]: ` Our house , ' repeated the other .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 5]: ` Meaning -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 26]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Wegg , nodding , as the other pointed the clumsy forefinger of his right glove at the corner house .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 39]: Now , what , ' pursued the old fellow , in an inquisitive manner , carrying his knotted stick in his left arm as if it were a baby , ` what do they allow you now ? '
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 34]: ` It 's job work that I do for our house , ' returned Silas , drily , and with reticence ; ` it 's not yet brought to an exact allowance . '
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: It 's not yet brought to an exact allowance ?
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 10]: It 's not yet brought to an exact allowance .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 8]: -- Morning , morning , morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 26]: ` Appears to be rather a cracked old cock , ' thought Silas , qualifying his former good opinion , as the other ambled off .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 23]: But , in a moment he was back again with the question : ` How did you get your wooden leg ? '
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 18]: Mr Wegg replied , -LRB- tartly to this personal inquiry -RRB- , ` In an accident . '
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 7]: ` Do you like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 28]: I have n't got to keep it warm , ' Mr Wegg made answer , in a sort of desperation occasioned by the singularity of the question .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 29]: ` He has n't , ' repeated the other to his knotted stick , as he gave it a hug ; ` he has n't got -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 3]: -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 6]: -- to keep it warm !
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 11]: Did you ever hear of the name of Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 17]: ` No , ' said Mr Wegg , who was growing restive under this examination . '
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 11]: I never did hear of the name of Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 7]: ` Do you like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 23]: ` Why , no , ' retorted Mr Wegg , again approaching desperation ; ' I ca n't say I do . '
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 10]: ` Why do n't you like it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 26]: I do n't know why I do n't , ' retorted Mr Wegg , approaching frenzy , ` but I do n't at all . '
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 23]: ` Now , I 'll tell you something that 'll make you sorry for that , ' said the stranger , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 8]: ` My name 's Boffin . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 7]: I ca n't help it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 4]: returned Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 19]: Implying in his manner the offensive addition , ` and if I could , I would n't . '
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 26]: ` But there 's another chance for you , ' said Mr Boffin , smiling still , ` Do you like the name of Nicodemus ?
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 4]: Think it over .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 6]: Nick , or Noddy . '
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 70]: ` It is not , sir , ' Mr Wegg rejoined , as he sat down on his stool , with an air of gentle resignation , combined with melancholy candour ; it is not a name as I could wish any one that I had a respect for , to call ME by ; but there may be persons that would not view it with the same objections .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 16]: -- I do n't know why , ' Mr Wegg added , anticipating another question .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 9]: ` Noddy Boffin , ' said that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 3]: ` Noddy .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: That 's my name .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 7]: Noddy -- or Nick -- Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 6]: What 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 4]: ` Silas Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 37]: -- I do n't , ' said Mr Wegg , bestirring himself to take the same precaution as before , ' I do n't know why Silas , and I do n't know why Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 27]: ` Now , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin , hugging his stick closer , ' I want to make a sort of offer to you .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 10]: Do you remember when you first see me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 23]: The wooden Wegg looked at him with a meditative eye , and also with a softened air as descrying possibility of profit .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 5]: ` Let me think .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 19]: I ai n't quite sure , and yet I generally take a powerful sight of notice , too .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 41]: Was it on a Monday morning , when the butcher-boy had been to our house for orders , and bought a ballad of me , which , being unacquainted with the tune , I run it over to him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: ` Right , Wegg , right !
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 8]: But he bought more than one . '
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 41]: ` Yes , to be sure , sir ; he bought several ; and wishing to lay out his money to the best , he took my opinion to guide his choice , and we went over the collection together .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 6]: To be sure we did .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 48]: Here was him as it might be , and here was myself as it might be , and there was you , Mr Boffin , as you identically are , with your self-same stick under your very same arm , and your very same back towards us .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 7]: To -- be -- sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 32]: added Mr Wegg , looking a little round Mr Boffin , to take him in the rear , and identify this last extraordinary coincidence , ` your wery self-same back ! '
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 13]: ` What do you think I was doing , Wegg ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 18]: I should judge , sir , that you might be glancing your eye down the street . '
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 5]: ` No , Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: I was a listening . '
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 7]: ` Was you , indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 6]: said Mr Wegg , dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 34]: ` Not in a dishonourable way , Wegg , because you was singing to the butcher ; and you would n't sing secrets to a butcher in the street , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 24]: ` It never happened that I did so yet , to the best of my remembrance , ' said Mr Wegg , cautiously .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 7]: ` But I might do it .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 17]: A man ca n't say what he might wish to do some day or another . '
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 19]: -LRB- This , not to release any little advantage he might derive from Mr Boffin 's avowal . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 18]: ` Well , ' repeated Boffin , ' I was a listening to you and to him .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 15]: And what do you -- you have n't got another stool , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 10]: I 'm rather thick in my breath . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 20]: I have n't got another , but you 're welcome to this , ' said Wegg , resigning it .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 11]: ` It 's a treat to me to stand . '
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 4]: ` Lard ! '
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 34]: exclaimed Mr Boffin , in a tone of great enjoyment , as he settled himself down , still nursing his stick like a baby , ` it 's a pleasant place , this !
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 20]: And then to be shut in on each side , with these ballads , like so many book-leaf blinkers !
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 6]: Why , its delightful ! '
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 44]: ` If I am not mistaken , sir , ' Mr Wegg delicately hinted , resting a hand on his stall , and bending over the discursive Boffin , ` you alluded to some offer or another that was in your mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 7]: ` I 'm coming to it !
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 3]: All right .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: I 'm coming to it !
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 20]: I was going to say that when I listened that morning , I listened with hadmiration amounting to haw .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 36]: I thought to myself , `` Here 's a man with a wooden leg -- a literary man with -- '' ' ` N -- not exactly so , sir , ' said Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 45]: ` Why , you know every one of these songs by name and by tune , and if you want to read or to sing any one on 'em off straight , you 've only to whip on your spectacles and do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 5]: cried Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 7]: I see you at it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 28]: ` Well , sir , ' returned Mr Wegg , with a conscious inclination of the head ; ` we 'll say literary , then . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 19]: `` A literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- and all Print is open to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 47]: That 's what I thought to myself , that morning , ' pursued Mr Boffin , leaning forward to describe , uncramped by the clotheshorse , as large an arc as his right arm could make ; ' `` all Print is open to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 9]: And it is , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 41]: ` Why , truly , sir , ' Mr Wegg admitted , with modesty ; ' I believe you could n't show me the piece of English print , that I would n't be equal to collaring and throwing . '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 6]: ` On the spot ? '
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 7]: ` On the spot . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 5]: I know 'd it !
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 4]: Then consider this .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 21]: Here am I , a man without a wooden leg , and yet all print is shut to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 6]: ` Indeed , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 7]: Mr Wegg returned with increasing self-complacency .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 5]: ` Education neglected ? '
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 6]: ` Neg -- lected ! '
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 6]: repeated Boffin , with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 9]: ` That ai n't no word for it .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 31]: I do n't mean to say but what if you showed me a B , I could so far give you change for it , as to answer Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 26]: ` Come , come , sir , ' said Mr Wegg , throwing in a little encouragement , ` that 's something , too . '
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 23]: ` It 's something , ' answered Mr Boffin , ` but I 'll take my oath it ai n't much . '
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 23]: ` Perhaps it 's not as much as could be wished by an inquiring mind , sir , ' Mr Wegg admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 6]: ` Now , look here .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 6]: I 'm retired from business .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 45]: Me and Mrs Boffin -- Henerietty Boffin -- which her father 's name was Henery , and her mother 's name was Hetty , and so you get it -- we live on a compittance , under the will of a diseased governor . '
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 7]: ` Gentleman dead , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 10]: ` Man alive , do n't I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 4]: A diseased governor ?
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 18]: Now , it 's too late for me to begin shovelling and sifting at alphabeds and grammar-books .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 17]: I 'm getting to be a old bird , and I want to take it easy .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 56]: But I want some reading -- some fine bold reading , some splendid book in a gorging Lord-Mayor 's - Show of wollumes ' -LRB- probably meaning gorgeous , but misled by association of ideas -RRB- ; ` as 'll reach right down your pint of view , and take time to go by you .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 9]: How can I get that reading , Wegg ?
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 41]: By , ' tapping him on the breast with the head of his thick stick , ` paying a man truly qualified to do it , so much an hour -LRB- say twopence -RRB- to come and do it . '
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 3]: ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 22]: Flattered , sir , I am sure , ' said Wegg , beginning to regard himself in quite a new light .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 3]: ` Hew !
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 10]: This is the offer you mentioned , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 7]: Do you like it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 11]: I am considering of it , Mr Boffin . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 30]: I do n't , ' said Boffin , in a free-handed manner , ` want to tie a literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- down too tight .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 9]: A halfpenny an hour sha n't part us .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 20]: The hours are your own to choose , after you 've done for the day with your house here .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 31]: I live over Maiden-Lane way -- out Holloway direction -- and you 've only got to go East-and - byNorth when you 've finished here , and you 're there .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 107]: Twopence halfpenny an hour , ' said Boffin , taking a piece of chalk from his pocket and getting off the stool to work the sum on the top of it in his own way ; ` two long ` uns and a short ` un -- twopence halfpenny ; two short ` uns is a long ` un and two two long ` uns is four long ` uns -- making five long ` uns ; six nights a week at five long ` uns a night , ' scoring them all down separately , ` and you mount up to thirty long ` uns .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 5]: A round ` un !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: Half a crown ! '
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 28]: Pointing to this result as a large and satisfactory one , Mr Boffin smeared it out with his moistened glove , and sat down on the remains .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 11]: ` Half a crown , ' said Wegg , meditating .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: -LRB- It ai n't much , sir . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 5]: Half a crown . '
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 8]: ` Per week , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 4]: ` Per week .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 11]: As to the amount of strain upon the intellect now .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 9]: Was you thinking at all of poetry ? '
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 6]: Mr Wegg inquired , musing .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 7]: ` Would it come dearer ? '
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 4]: Mr Boffin asked .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 11]: ` It would come dearer , ' Mr Wegg returned .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 33]: ` For when a person comes to grind off poetry night after night , it is but right he should expect to be paid for its weakening effect on his mind . '
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 63]: ` To tell you the truth Wegg , ' said Boffin , ' I was n't thinking of poetry , except in so fur as this : -- If you was to happen now and then to feel yourself in the mind to tip me and Mrs Boffin one of your ballads , why then we should drop into poetry . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 10]: I follow you , sir , ' said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 44]: ` But not being a regular musical professional , I should be loath to engage myself for that ; and therefore when I dropped into poetry , I should ask to be considered so fur , in the light of a friend . '
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 38]: At this , Mr Boffin 's eyes sparkled , and he shook Silas earnestly by the hand : protesting that it was more than he could have asked , and that he took it very kindly indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 12]: ` What do you think of the terms , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 9]: Mr Boffin then demanded , with unconcealed anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 50]: Silas , who had stimulated this anxiety by his hard reserve of manner , and who had begun to understand his man very well , replied with an air ; as if he were saying something extraordinarily generous and great : ` Mr Boffin , I never bargain . '
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 10]: ` So I should have thought of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 6]: said Mr Boffin , admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 12]: I never did ` aggle and I never will ` aggle .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 21]: Consequently I meet you at once , free and fair , with -- Done , for double the money ! '
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 42]: Mr Boffin seemed a little unprepared for this conclusion , but assented , with the remark , ` You know better what it ought to be than I do , Wegg , ' and again shook hands with him upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 10]: ` Could you begin to night , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 4]: he then demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 20]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Mr Wegg , careful to leave all the eagerness to him . '
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 9]: I see no difficulty if you wish it .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 14]: You are provided with the needful implement -- a book , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 12]: ` Bought him at a sale , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 4]: ` Eight wollumes .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 4]: Red and gold .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 15]: Purple ribbon in every wollume , to keep the place where you leave off .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 6]: Do you know him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 9]: ` The book 's name , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 4]: inquired Silas . '
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 18]: I thought you might have know 'd him without it , ' said Mr Boffin slightly disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 9]: ` His name is Decline-And-Fall-Off - TheRooshan-Empire . '
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 14]: -LRB- Mr Boffin went over these stones slowly and with much caution . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 5]: ` Ay indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 14]: said Mr Wegg , nodding his head with an air of friendly recognition .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 9]: ` You know him , Wegg ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 30]: I have n't been not to say right slap through him , very lately , ' Mr Wegg made answer , ` having been otherways employed , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 4]: But know him ?
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: Old familiar declining and falling off the Rooshan ?
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: Rather , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 11]: Ever since I was not so high as your stick .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 14]: Ever since my eldest brother left our cottage to enlist into the army .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 51]: On which occasion , as the ballad that was made about it describes : ` Beside that cottage door , Mr Boffin , A girl was on her knees ; She held aloft a snowy scarf , Sir , Which -LRB- my eldest brother noticed -RRB- fluttered in the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 17]: She breathed a prayer for him , Mr Boffin ; A prayer he coold not hear .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 20]: And my eldest brother lean 'd upon his sword , Mr Boffin , And wiped away a tear . '
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 45]: Much impressed by this family circumstance , and also by the friendly disposition of Mr Wegg , as exemplified in his so soon dropping into poetry , Mr Boffin again shook hands with that ligneous sharper , and besought him to name his hour .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 5]: Mr Wegg named eight .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 16]: ` Where I live , ' said Mr Boffin , ` is called The Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 19]: Boffin 's Bower is the name Mrs Boffin christened it when we come into it as a property .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 60]: If you should meet with anybody that do n't know it by that name -LRB- which hardly anybody does -RRB- , when you 've got nigh upon about a odd mile , or say and a quarter if you like , up Maiden Lane , Battle Bridge , ask for Harmony Jail , and you 'll be put right .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 26]: I shall expect you , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin , clapping him on the shoulder with the greatest enthusiasm , ` most joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 11]: I shall have no peace or patience till you come .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 8]: Print is now opening ahead of me .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 45]: This night , a literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- ' he bestowed an admiring look upon that decoration , as if it greatly enhanced the relish of Mr Wegg 's attainments -- ` will begin to lead me a new life !
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 6]: My fist again , Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 7]: Morning , morning , morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 38]: Left alone at his stall as the other ambled off , Mr Wegg subsided into his screen , produced a small pocket-handkerchief of a penitentially-scrubbing character , and took himself by the nose with a thoughtful aspect .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 26]: Also , while he still grasped that feature , he directed several thoughtful looks down the street , after the retiring figure of Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 11]: But , profound gravity sat enthroned on Wegg 's countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 67]: For , while he considered within himself that this was an old fellow of rare simplicity , that this was an opportunity to be improved , and that here might he money to be got beyond present calculation , still he compromised himself by no admission that his new engagement was at all out of his way , or involved the least element of the ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 29]: Mr Wegg would even have picked a handsome quarrel with any one who should have challenged his deep acquaintance with those aforesaid eight volumes of Decline and Fall .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 33]: His gravity was unusual , portentous , and immeasurable , not because he admitted any doubt of himself but because he perceived it necessary to forestall any doubt of himself in others .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 29]: And herein he ranged with that very numerous class of impostors , who are quite as determined to keep up appearances to themselves , as to their neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 26]: A certain loftiness , likewise , took possession of Mr Wegg ; a condescending sense of being in request as an official expounder of mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 44]: It did not move him to commercial greatness , but rather to littleness , insomuch that if it had been within the possibilities of things for the wooden measure to hold fewer nuts than usual , it would have done so that day .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 24]: But , when night came , and with her veiled eyes beheld him stumping towards Boffin 's Bower , he was elated too .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 16]: The Bower was as difficult to find , as Fair Rosamond 's without the clue .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 31]: Mr Wegg , having reached the quarter indicated , inquired for the Bower half a dozen times without the least success , until he remembered to ask for Harmony Jail .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 22]: This occasioned a quick change in the spirits of a hoarse gentleman and a donkey , whom he had much perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 13]: ` Why , yer mean Old Harmon 's , do yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 21]: said the hoarse gentleman , who was driving his donkey in a truck , with a carrot for a whip .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 9]: ` Why did n't yer niver say so ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 10]: Eddard and me is a goin ' by HIM !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 4]: Jump in . '
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 30]: Mr Wegg complied , and the hoarse gentleman invited his attention to the third person in company , thus ; ` Now , you look at Eddard 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 9]: What was it as you named , agin ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 3]: Whisper . '
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 10]: Mr Wegg whispered , ` Boffin 's Bower . '
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 3]: ` Eddard !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 16]: -LRB- keep yer hi on his ears -RRB- cut away to Boffin 's Bower ! '
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 11]: Edward , with his ears lying back , remained immoveable .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 3]: ` Eddard !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 16]: -LRB- keep yer hi on his ears -RRB- cut away to Old Harmon 's . '
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 33]: Edward instantly pricked up his ears to their utmost , and rattled off at such a pace that Mr Wegg 's conversation was jolted out of him in a most dislocated state .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 4]: ` Was-it-Ev-verajail ? '
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 7]: asked Mr Wegg , holding on .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 38]: ` Not a proper jail , wot you and me would get committed to , ' returned his escort ; ` they giv ' it the name , on accounts of Old Harmon living solitary there . '
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 4]: ` And-why-did-they-callitharm-Ony ? '
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 3]: asked Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 10]: ` On accounts of his never agreeing with nobody .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 6]: Like a speeches of chaff .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 7]: Harmon 's Jail ; Harmony Jail .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 6]: Working it round like . '
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 4]: ` Doyouknow-Mist-Erboff-in ? '
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 4]: asked Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 5]: I should think so !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 5]: Everybody do about here .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 4]: Eddard knows him .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 9]: -LRB- Keep yer hi on his ears . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 6]: Noddy Boffin , Eddard ! '
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 74]: The effect of the name was so very alarming , in respect of causing a temporary disappearance of Edward 's head , casting his hind hoofs in the air , greatly accelerating the pace and increasing the jolting , that Mr Wegg was fain to devote his attention exclusively to holding on , and to relinquish his desire of ascertaining whether this homage to Boffin was to be considered complimentary or the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 24]: Presently , Edward stopped at a gateway , and Wegg discreetly lost no time in slipping out at the back of the truck .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 23]: The moment he was landed , his late driver with a wave of the carrot , said ` Supper , Eddard ! '
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 28]: and he , the hind hoofs , the truck , and Edward , all seemed to fly into the air together , in a kind of apotheosis .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 50]: Pushing the gate , which stood ajar , Wegg looked into an enclosed space where certain tall dark mounds rose high against the sky , and where the pathway to the Bower was indicated , as the moonlight showed , between two lines of broken crockery set in ashes .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 35]: A white figure advancing along this path , proved to be nothing more ghostly than Mr Boffin , easily attired for the pursuit of knowledge , in an undress garment of short white smock-frock .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 62]: Having received his literary friend with great cordiality , he conducted him to the interior of the Bower and there presented him to Mrs Boffin : -- a stout lady of a rubicund and cheerful aspect , dressed -LRB- to Mr Wegg 's consternation -RRB- in a low evening-dress of sable satin , and a large black velvet hat and feathers .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 17]: ` Mrs Boffin , Wegg , ' said Boffin , ` is a highflyer at Fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 12]: And her make is such , that she does it credit .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 18]: As to myself I ai n't yet as Fash ` nable as I may come to be .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 23]: Henerietty , old lady , this is the gentleman that 's a going to decline and fall off the Rooshan Empire . '
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 19]: ` And I am sure I hope it 'll do you both good , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 26]: It was the queerest of rooms , fitted and furnished more like a luxurious amateur tap-room than anything else within the ken of Silas Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 23]: There were two wooden settles by the fire , one on either side of it , with a corresponding table before each .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 56]: On one of these tables , the eight volumes were ranged flat , in a row , like a galvanic battery ; on the other , certain squat case-bottles of inviting appearance seemed to stand on tiptoe to exchange glances with Mr Wegg over a front row of tumblers and a basin of white sugar .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 16]: On the hob , a kettle steamed ; on the hearth , a cat reposed .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 26]: Facing the fire between the settles , a sofa , a footstool , and a little table , formed a centrepiece devoted to Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 33]: They were garish in taste and colour , but were expensive articles of drawing-room furniture that had a very odd look beside the settles and the flaring gaslight pendent from the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 40]: There was a flowery carpet on the floor ; but , instead of reaching to the fireside , its glowing vegetation stopped short at Mrs Boffin 's footstool , and gave place to a region of sand and sawdust .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 62]: Mr Wegg also noticed , with admiring eyes , that , while the flowery land displayed such hollow ornamentation as stuffed birds and waxen fruits under glassshades , there were , in the territory where vegetation ceased , compensatory shelves on which the best part of a large pie and likewise of a cold joint were plainly discernible among other solids .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 46]: The room itself was large , though low ; and the heavy frames of its old-fashioned windows , and the heavy beams in its crooked ceiling , seemed to indicate that it had once been a house of some mark standing alone in the country .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 9]: ` Do you like it , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 10]: asked Mr Boffin , in his pouncing manner . '
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 11]: I admire it greatly , sir , ' said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 10]: ` Peculiar comfort at this fireside , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: ` Do you understand it , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 55]: ` Why , in a general way , sir , ' Mr Wegg was beginning slowly and knowingly , with his head stuck on one side , as evasive people do begin , when the other cut him short : ` You DO N'T understand it , Wegg , and I 'll explain it .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 13]: These arrangements is made by mutual consent between Mrs Boffin and me .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 20]: Mrs Boffin , as I 've mentioned , is a highflyer at Fashion ; at present I 'm not .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 22]: I do n't go higher than comfort , and comfort of the sort that I 'm equal to the enjoyment of .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 3]: Well then .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 14]: Where would be the good of Mrs Boffin and me quarrelling over it ?
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 30]: We never did quarrel , before we come into Boffin 's Bower as a property ; why quarrel when we HAVE come into Boffin 's Bower as a property ?
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 28]: So Mrs Boffin , she keeps up her part of the room , in her way ; I keep up my part of the room in mine .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 26]: In consequence of which we have at once , Sociability -LRB- I should go melancholy mad without Mrs Boffin -RRB- , Fashion , and Comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 23]: If I get by degrees to be a higherflyer at Fashion , then Mrs Boffin will by degrees come for ` arder .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 31]: If Mrs Boffin should ever be less of a dab at Fashion than she is at the present time , then Mrs Boffin 's carpet would go back ` arder .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 25]: If we should both continny as we are , why then HERE we are , and give us a kiss , old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 23]: Mrs Boffin who , perpetually smiling , had approached and drawn her plump arm through her lord 's , most willingly complied .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 26]: Fashion , in the form of her black velvet hat and feathers , tried to prevent it ; but got deservedly crushed in the endeavour .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 31]: ` So now , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin , wiping his mouth with an air of much refreshment , ` you begin to know us as we are .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 20]: This is a charming spot , is the Bower , but you must get to apprechiate it by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 23]: It 's a spot to find out the merits of ; little by little , and a new ` un every day .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 22]: There 's a serpentining walk up each of the mounds , that gives you the yard and neighbourhood changing every moment .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 21]: When you get to the top , there 's a view of the neighbouring premises , not to be surpassed .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 26]: The premises of Mrs Boffin 's late father -LRB- Canine Provision Trade -RRB- , you look down into , as if they was your own .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 53]: And the top of the High Mound is crowned with a lattice-work Arbour , in which , if you do n't read out loud many a book in the summer , ay , and as a friend , drop many a time into poetry too , it sha n't be my fault .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 9]: Now , what 'll you read on ? '
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 23]: ` Thank you , sir , ' returned Wegg , as if there were nothing new in his reading at all . '
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 10]: I generally do it on gin and water . '
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: ` Keeps the organ moist , does it , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 8]: asked Mr Boffin , with innocent eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 21]: ` N-no , sir , ' replied Wegg , coolly , ' I should hardly describe it so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 7]: I should say , mellers it .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 14]: Mellers it , is the word I should employ , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 16]: His wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted expectation of his victim .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 44]: The visions rising before his mercenary mind , of the many ways in which this connexion was to be turned to account , never obscured the foremost idea natural to a dull overreaching man , that he must not make himself too cheap .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 40]: Mrs Boffin 's Fashion , as a less inexorable deity than the idol usually worshipped under that name , did not forbid her mixing for her literary guest , or asking if he found the result to his liking .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 34]: On his returning a gracious answer and taking his place at the literary settle , Mr Boffin began to compose himself as a listener , at the opposite settle , with exultant eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 28]: ` Sorry to deprive you of a pipe , Wegg , ' he said , filling his own , ` but you ca n't do both together .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 8]: and another thing I forgot to name !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 31]: When you come in here of an evening , and look round you , and notice anything on a shelf that happens to catch your fancy , mention it . '
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 30]: Wegg , who had been going to put on his spectacles , immediately laid them down , with the sprightly observation : ` You read my thoughts , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 17]: DO my eyes deceive me , or is that object up there a -- a pie ?
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 8]: It ca n't be a pie . '
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 28]: ` Yes , it 's a pie , Wegg , ' replied Mr Boffin , with a glance of some little discomfiture at the Decline and Fall .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 19]: ` HAVE I lost my smell for fruits , or is it a apple pie , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: asked Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 14]: ` It 's a veal and ham pie , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 7]: ` Is it indeed , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 33]: And it would be hard , sir , to name the pie that is a better pie than a weal and hammer , ' said Mr Wegg , nodding his head emotionally .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 7]: ` Have some , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 16]: ` Thank you , Mr Boffin , I think I will , at your invitation .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 20]: I would n't at any other party 's , at the present juncture ; but at yours , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 35]: -- And meaty jelly too , especially when a little salt , which is the case where there 's ham , is mellering to the organ , is very mellering to the organ . '
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 15]: Mr Wegg did not say what organ , but spoke with a cheerful generality .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 105]: So , the pie was brought down , and the worthy Mr Boffin exercised his patience until Wegg , in the exercise of his knife and fork , had finished the dish : only profiting by the opportunity to inform Wegg that although it was not strictly Fashionable to keep the contents of a larder thus exposed to view , he -LRB- Mr Boffin -RRB- considered it hospitable ; for the reason , that instead of saying , in a comparatively unmeaning manner , to a visitor , ` There are such and such edibles down stairs ; will you have anything up ? '
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 32]: you took the bold practical course of saying , ` Cast your eye along the shelves , and , if you see anything you like there , have it down . '
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 74]: And now , Mr Wegg at length pushed away his plate and put on his spectacles , and Mr Boffin lighted his pipe and looked with beaming eyes into the opening world before him , and Mrs Boffin reclined in a fashionable manner on her sofa : as one who would be part of the audience if she found she could , and would go to sleep if she found she could n't .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 38]: began Wegg , ` This , Mr Boffin and Lady , is the first chapter of the first wollume of the Decline and Fall off -- ' here he looked hard at the book , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 9]: ` What 's the matter , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 64]: ` Why , it comes into my mind , do you know , sir , ' said Wegg with an air of insinuating frankness -LRB- having first again looked hard at the book -RRB- , ` that you made a little mistake this morning , which I had meant to set you right in , only something put it out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 10]: I think you said Rooshan Empire , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 12]: ` It is Rooshan ; ai n't it , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 2]: Roman .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 3]: Roman . '
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 9]: ` What 's the difference , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 7]: ` The difference , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 19]: Mr Wegg was faltering and in danger of breaking down , when a bright thought flashed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 6]: ` The difference , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 11]: There you place me in a difficulty , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 26]: Suffice it to observe , that the difference is best postponed to some other occasion when Mrs Boffin does not honour us with her company .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 15]: In Mrs Boffin 's presence , sir , we had better drop it . '
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 45]: Mr Wegg thus came out of his disadvantage with quite a chivalrous air , and not only that , but by dint of repeating with a manly delicacy , ` In Mrs Boffin 's presence , sir , we had better drop it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 19]: turned the disadvantage on Boffin , who felt that he had committed himself in a very painful manner .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 150]: Then , Mr Wegg , in a dry unflinching way , entered on his task ; going straight across country at everything that came before him ; taking all the hard words , biographical and geographical ; getting rather shaken by Hadrian , Trajan , and the Antonines ; stumbling at Polybius -LRB- pronounced Polly Beeious , and supposed by Mr Boffin to be a Roman virgin , and by Mrs Boffin to be responsible for that necessity of dropping it -RRB- ; heavily unseated by Titus Antoninus Pius ; up again and galloping smoothly with Augustus ; finally , getting over the ground well with Commodus : who , under the appellation of Commodious , was held by Mr Boffin to have been quite unworthy of his English origin , and ` not to have acted up to his name ' in his government of the Roman people .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 65]: With the death of this personage , Mr Wegg terminated his first reading ; long before which consummation several total eclipses of Mrs Boffin 's candle behind her black velvet disc , would have been very alarming , but for being regularly accompanied by a potent smell of burnt pens when her feathers took fire , which acted as a restorative and woke her .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 80]: Mr Wegg , having read on by rote and attached as few ideas as possible to the text , came out of the encounter fresh ; but , Mr Boffin , who had soon laid down his unfinished pipe , and had ever since sat intently staring with his eyes and mind at the confounding enormities of the Romans , was so severely punished that he could hardly wish his literary friend Good-night , and articulate ` Tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 42]: ` Commodious , ' gasped Mr Boffin , staring at the moon , after letting Wegg out at the gate and fastening it : ` Commodious fights in that wild-beast-show , seven hundred and thirty-five times , in one character only !
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 21]: As if that was n't stunning enough , a hundred lions is turned into the same wild-beast-show all at once !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 23]: As if that was n't stunning enough , Commodious , in another character , kills 'em all off in a hundred goes !
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 28]: As if that was n't stunning enough , Vittle-us -LRB- and well named too -RRB- eats six millions ' worth , English money , in seven months !
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 17]: Wegg takes it easy , but uponmy-soul to a old bird like myself these are scarers .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 20]: And even now that Commodious is strangled , I do n't see a way to our bettering ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 33]: Mr Boffin added as he turned his pensive steps towards the Bower and shook his head , ' I did n't think this morning there was half so many Scarers in Print .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 9]: But I 'm in for it now ! '
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 31]: Chapter 6 CUT ADRIFT The Six Jolly Fellowship Porters , already mentioned as a tavern of a dropsical appearance , had long settled down into a state of hale infirmity .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 38]: In its whole constitution it had not a straight floor , and hardly a straight line ; but it had outlasted , and clearly would yet outlast , many a better-trimmed building , many a sprucer publichouse .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 83]: Externally , it was a narrow lopsided wooden jumble of corpulent windows heaped one upon another as you might heap as many toppling oranges , with a crazy wooden verandah impending over the water ; indeed the whole house , inclusive of the complaining flag-staff on the roof , impended over the water , but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver who has paused so long on the brink that he will never go in at all .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 13]: This description applies to the river-frontage of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 39]: The back of the establishment , though the chief entrance was there , so contracted that it merely represented in its connexion with the front , the handle of a flat iron set upright on its broadest end .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 41]: This handle stood at the bottom of a wilderness of court and alley : which wilderness pressed so hard and close upon the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters as to leave the hostelry not an inch of ground beyond its door .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 47]: For this reason , in combination with the fact that the house was all but afloat at high water , when the Porters had a family wash the linen subjected to that operation might usually be seen drying on lines stretched across the reception-rooms and bed-chambers .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 34]: The wood forming the chimney-pieces , beams , partitions , floors and doors , of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters , seemed in its old age fraught with confused memories of its youth .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 39]: In many places it had become gnarled and riven , according to the manner of old trees ; knots started out of it ; and here and there it seemed to twist itself into some likeness of boughs .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 23]: In this state of second childhood , it had an air of being in its own way garrulous about its early life .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 61]: Not without reason was it often asserted by the regular frequenters of the Porters , that when the light shone full upon the grain of certain panels , and particularly upon an old corner cupboard of walnut-wood in the bar , you might trace little forests there , and tiny trees like the parent tree , in full umbrageous leaf .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 17]: The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters was a bar to soften the human breast .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 103]: The available space in it was not much larger than a hackney-coach ; but no one could have wished the bar bigger , that space was so girt in by corpulent little casks , and by cordial-bottles radiant with fictitious grapes in bunches , and by lemons in nets , and by biscuits in baskets , and by the polite beer-pulls that made low bows when customers were served with beer , and by the cheese in a snug corner , and by the landlady 's own small table in a snugger corner near the fire , with the cloth everlastingly laid .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 85]: This haven was divided from the rough world by a glass partition and a half-door , with a leaden sill upon it for the convenience of resting your liquor ; but , over this half-door the bar 's snugness so gushed forth that , albeit customers drank there standing , in a dark and draughty passage where they were shouldered by other customers passing in and out , they always appeared to drink under an enchanting delusion that they were in the bar itself .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 97]: For the rest , both the tap and parlour of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters gave upon the river , and had red curtains matching the noses of the regular customers , and were provided with comfortable fireside tin utensils , like models of sugar-loaf hats , made in that shape that they might , with their pointed ends , seek out for themselves glowing nooks in the depths of the red coals , when they mulled your ale , or heated for you those delectable drinks , Purl , Flip , and Dog 's Nose .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 36]: The first of these humming compounds was a speciality of the Porters , which , through an inscription on its door-posts , gently appealed to your feelings as , ` The Early Purl House ' .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 46]: For , it would seem that Purl must always be taken early ; though whether for any more distinctly stomachic reason than that , as the early bird catches the worm , so the early purl catches the customer , can not here be resolved .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 76]: It only remains to add that in the handle of the flat iron , and opposite the bar , was a very little room like a three-cornered hat , into which no direct ray of sun , moon , or star , ever penetrated , but which was superstitiously regarded as a sanctuary replete with comfort and retirement by gaslight , and on the door of which was therefore painted its alluring name : Cosy .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 42]: Miss Potterson , sole proprietor and manager of the Fellowship Porters , reigned supreme on her throne , the Bar , and a man must have drunk himself mad drunk indeed if he thought he could contest a point with her .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 56]: Being known on her own authority as Miss Abbey Potterson , some water-side heads , which -LRB- like the water -RRB- were none of the clearest , harboured muddled notions that , because of her dignity and firmness , she was named after , or in some sort related to , the Abbey at Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 28]: But , Abbey was only short for Abigail , by which name Miss Potterson had been christened at Limehouse Church , some sixty and odd years before .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 77]: ` Now , you mind , you Riderhood , ' said Miss Abbey Potterson , with emphatic forefinger over the half-door , ` the Fellowship do n't want you at all , and would rather by far have your room than your company ; but if you were as welcome here as you are not , you should n't even then have another drop of drink here this night , after this present pint of beer .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: So make the most of it . '
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 32]: ` But you know , Miss Potterson , ' this was suggested very meekly though , ` if I behave myself , you ca n't help serving me , miss . '
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 6]: ` CA N'T I ! '
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 7]: said Abbey , with infinite expression .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 49]: ` No , Miss Potterson ; because , you see , the law -- ' ' I am the law here , my man , ' returned Miss Abbey , ` and I 'll soon convince you of that , if you doubt it at all . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 14]: I never said I did doubt it at all , Miss Abbey . '
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 9]: ` So much the better for you . '
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 28]: Abbey the supreme threw the customer 's halfpence into the till , and , seating herself in her fireside-chair , resumed the newspaper she had been reading .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 33]: She was a tall , upright , well-favoured woman , though severe of countenance , and had more of the air of a schoolmistress than mistress of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 33]: The man on the other side of the half-door , was a waterside-man with a squinting leer , and he eyed her as if he were one of her pupils in disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 12]: ` You 're cruel hard upon me , Miss Potterson . '
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 21]: Miss Potterson read her newspaper with contracted brows , and took no notice until he whispered : ` Miss Potterson !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 2]: Ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 10]: Might I have half a word with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 51]: Deigning then to turn her eyes sideways towards the suppliant , Miss Potterson beheld him knuckling his low forehead , and ducking at her with his head , as if he were asking leave to fling himself head foremost over the half-door and alight on his feet in the bar .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 21]: said Miss Potterson , with a manner as short as she herself was long , ` say your half word .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 5]: Bring it out . '
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 4]: ` Miss Potterson !
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 2]: Ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 22]: Would you ` sxcuse me taking the liberty of asking , is it my character that you take objections to ? '
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 8]: ` Certainly , ' said Miss Potterson .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 30]: ` Is it that you 're afraid of -- ' ' I am not afraid OF YOU , ' interposed Miss Potterson , ` if you mean that . '
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 13]: ` But I humbly do n't mean that , Miss Abbey . '
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 8]: ` Then what do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 10]: ` You really are so cruel hard upon me !
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 46]: What I was going to make inquiries was no more than , might you have any apprehensions -- leastways beliefs or suppositions -- that the company 's property might n't be altogether to be considered safe , if I used the house too regular ? '
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 10]: ` What do you want to know for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 51]: ` Well , Miss Abbey , respectfully meaning no offence to you , it would be some satisfaction to a man 's mind , to understand why the Fellowship Porters is not to be free to such as me , and is to be free to such as Gaffer . '
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 27]: The face of the hostess darkened with some shadow of perplexity , as she replied : ` Gaffer has never been where you have been . '
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 7]: ` Signifying in Quod , Miss ?
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 3]: Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 7]: But he may have merited it .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 13]: He may be suspected of far worse than ever I was . '
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 6]: ` Who suspects him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 5]: ` Many , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 6]: One , beyond all doubts .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 4]: I do . '
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 19]: ` YOU are not much , ' said Miss Abbey Potterson , knitting her brows again with disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 7]: ` But I was his pardner .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 11]: Mind you , Miss Abbey , I was his pardner .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 18]: As such I know more of the ins and outs of him than any person living does .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 3]: Notice this !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 19]: I am the man that was his pardner , and I am the man that suspects him . '
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 24]: ` Then , ' suggested Miss Abbey , though with a deeper shade of perplexity than before , ` you criminate yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 9]: ` No I do n't , Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: For how does it stand ?
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 5]: It stands this way .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 14]: When I was his pardner , I could n't never give him satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 9]: Why could n't I never give him satisfaction ?
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 16]: Because my luck was bad ; because I could n't find many enough of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 5]: How was his luck ?
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 3]: Always good .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 3]: Notice this !
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 3]: Always good !
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 34]: There 's a many games , Miss Abbey , in which there 's chance , but there 's a many others in which there 's skill too , mixed along with it . '
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 18]: ` That Gaffer has a skill in finding what he finds , who doubts , man ? '
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 5]: asked Miss Abbey . '
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 19]: A skill in purwiding what he finds , perhaps , ' said Riderhood , shaking his evil head .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 15]: Miss Abbey knitted her brow at him , as he darkly leered at her .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 53]: ` If you 're out upon the river pretty nigh every tide , and if you want to find a man or woman in the river , you 'll greatly help your luck , Miss Abbey , by knocking a man or woman on the head aforehand and pitching 'em in . '
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 5]: ` Gracious Lud ! '
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 8]: was the involuntary exclamation of Miss Potterson .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 5]: ` Mind you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 44]: returned the other , stretching forward over the half door to throw his words into the bar ; for his voice was as if the head of his boat 's mop were down his throat ; ' I say so , Miss Abbey !
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 4]: And mind you !
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 9]: I 'll follow him up , Miss Abbey !
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 4]: And mind you !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 19]: I 'll bring him to hook at last , if it 's twenty year hence , I will !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 12]: Who 's he , to he favoured along of his daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 11]: Ai n't I got a daughter of my own ! '
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 38]: With that flourish , and seeming to have talked himself rather more drunk and much more ferocious than he had begun by being , Mr Riderhood took up his pint pot and swaggered off to the taproom .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 28]: Gaffer was not there , but a pretty strong muster of Miss Abbey 's pupils were , who exhibited , when occasion required , the greatest docility .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 37]: On the clock 's striking ten , and Miss Abbey 's appearing at the door , and addressing a certain person in a faded scarlet jacket , with ` George Jones , your time 's up !
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 22]: I told your wife you should be punctual , ' Jones submissively rose , gave the company good-night , and retired .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 46]: At half-past ten , on Miss Abbey 's looking in again , and saying , ` William Williams , Bob Glamour , and Jonathan , you are all due , ' Williams , Bob , and Jonathan with similar meekness took their leave and evaporated .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 97]: Greater wonder than these , when a bottle-nosed person in a glazed hat had after some considerable hesitation ordered another glass of gin and water of the attendant potboy , and when Miss Abbey , instead of sending it , appeared in person , saying , ` Captain Joey , you have had as much as will do you good , ' not only did the captain feebly rub his knees and contemplate the fire without offering a word of protest , but the rest of the company murmured , ` Ay , ay , Captain !
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 15]: Miss Abbey 's right ; you be guided by Miss Abbey , Captain . '
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 73]: Nor , was Miss Abbey 's vigilance in anywise abated by this submission , but rather sharpened ; for , looking round on the deferential faces of her school , and descrying two other young persons in need of admonition , she thus bestowed it : ` Tom Tootle , it 's time for a young fellow who 's going to be married next month , to be at home and asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 28]: And you need n't nudge him , Mr Jack Mullins , for I know your work begins early tomorrow , and I say the same to you .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 3]: So come !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 7]: Good-night , like good lads ! '
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 58]: Upon which , the blushing Tootle looked to Mullins , and the blushing Mullins looked to Tootle , on the question who should rise first , and finally both rose together and went out on the broad grin , followed by Miss Abbey ; in whose presence the cormpany did not take the liberty of grinning likewise .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 42]: In such an establishment , the white-aproned pot-boy with his shirtsleeves arranged in a tight roll on each bare shoulder , was a mere hint of the possibility of physical force , thrown out as a matter of state and form .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 40]: Exactly at the closing hour , all the guests who were left , filed out in the best order : Miss Abbey standing at the half door of the bar , to hold a ceremony of review and dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 16]: All wished Miss Abbey good-night and Miss Abbey wished goodnight to all , except Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 33]: The sapient pot-boy , looking on officially , then had the conviction borne in upon his soul , that the man was evermore outcast and excommunicate from the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 33]: ` You Bob Gliddery , ' said Miss Abbey to this pot-boy , ` run round to Hexam 's and tell his daughter Lizzie that I want to speak to her . '
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 10]: With exemplary swiftness Bob Gliddery departed , and returned .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 39]: Lizzie , following him , arrived as one of the two female domestics of the Fellowship Porters arranged on the snug little table by the bar fire , Miss Potterson 's supper of hot sausages and mashed potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 15]: ` Come in and sit ye down , girl , ' said Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 8]: ` Can you eat a bit ? '
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 7]: ` No thank you , Miss. .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 8]: I have had my supper . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 28]: I have had mine too , I think , ' said Miss Abbey , pushing away the untasted dish , ` and more than enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 9]: I am put out , Lizzie . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 34]: I am very sorry for it , Miss. ' ` Then why , in the name of Goodness , ' quoth Miss Abbey , sharply , ` do you do it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 7]: I do it , Miss ! '
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 5]: ` There , there .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 5]: Do n't look astonished .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 23]: I ought to have begun with a word of explanation , but it 's my way to make short cuts at things .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 6]: I always was a pepperer .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 20]: You Bob Gliddery there , put the chain upon the door and get ye down to your supper . '
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 34]: With an alacrity that seemed no less referable to the pepperer fact than to the supper fact , Bob obeyed , and his boots were heard descending towards the bed of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 36]: ` Lizzie Hexam , Lizzie Hexam , ' then began Miss Potterson , ` how often have I held out to you the opportunity of getting clear of your father , and doing well ? '
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 10]: ` Very often , Miss. ' ` Very often ?
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 23]: And I might as well have spoken to the iron funnel of the strongest sea-going steamer that passes the Fellowship Porters . '
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 23]: ` No , Miss , ' Lizzie pleaded ; ` because that would not be thankful , and I am . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 41]: I vow and declare I am half ashamed of myself for taking such an interest in you , ' said Miss Abbey , pettishly , ` for I do n't believe I should do it if you were not good-looking .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: Why ai n't you ugly ? '
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 11]: Lizzie merely answered this difficult question with an apologetic glance .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 22]: ` However , you ai n't , ' resumed Miss Potterson , ` so it 's no use going into that .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 9]: I must take you as I find you .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 8]: Which indeed is what I 've done .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 11]: And you mean to say you are still obstinate ? '
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 10]: ` Not obstinate , Miss , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 12]: ` Firm -LRB- I suppose you call it -RRB- then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 5]: ` Yes , Miss. .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: Fixed like . '
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 16]: ` Never was an obstinate person yet , who would own to the word ! '
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 31]: remarked Miss Potterson , rubbing her vexed nose ; ` I 'm sure I would , if I was obstinate ; but I am a pepperer , which is different .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 9]: Lizzie Hexam , Lizzie Hexam , think again .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 10]: Do you know the worst of your father ? '
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 10]: ` Do I know the worst of father ! '
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 7]: she repeated , opening her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 14]: ` Do you know the suspicions to which your father makes himself liable ?
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 14]: Do you know the suspicions that are actually about , against him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 21]: The consciousness of what he habitually did , oppressed the girl heavily , and she slowly cast down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 5]: ` Say , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 5]: Do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 4]: urged Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 26]: ` Please to tell me what the suspicions are , Miss , ' she asked after a silence , with her eyes upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 18]: ` It 's not an easy thing to tell a daughter , but it must be told .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 25]: It is thought by some , then , that your father helps to their death a few of those that he finds dead . '
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 41]: The relief of hearing what she felt sure was a false suspicion , in place of the expected real and true one , so lightened Lizzie 's breast for the moment , that Miss Abbey was amazed at her demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 21]: She raised her eyes quickly , shook her head , and , in a kind of triumph , almost laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 11]: ` They little know father who talk like that ! '
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 15]: -LRB- ` She takes it , ' thought Miss Abbey , ` very quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 9]: She takes it with extraordinary quietness ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 34]: ` And perhaps , ' said Lizzie , as a recollection flashed upon her , ` it is some one who has a grudge against father ; some one who has threatened father !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 7]: Is it Riderhood , Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 8]: ` Well ; yes it is . '
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 18]: He was father 's partner , and father broke with him , and now he revenges himself .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: Father broke with him when I was by , and he was very angry at it .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 6]: And besides , Miss Abbey !
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 21]: -- Will you never , without strong reason , let pass your lips what I am going to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 11]: She bent forward to say it in a whisper . '
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 8]: I promise , ' said Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 21]: ` It was on the night when the Harmon murder was found out , through father , just above bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 21]: And just below bridge , as we were sculling home , Riderhood crept out of the dark in his boat .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 55]: And many and many times afterwards , when such great pains were taken to come to the bottom of the crime , and it never could be come near , I thought in my own thoughts , could Riderhood himself have done the murder , and did he purposely let father find the body ?
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 40]: It seemed a ` most wicked and cruel to so much as think such a thing ; but now that he tries to throw it upon father , I go back to it as if it was a truth .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 6]: Can it be a truth ?
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 11]: That was put into my mind by the dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 28]: She asked this question , rather of the fire than of the hostess of the Fellowship Porters , and looked round the little bar with troubled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 30]: But , Miss Potterson , as a ready schoolmistress accustomed to bring her pupils to book , set the matter in a light that was essentially of this world .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 42]: ` You poor deluded girl , ' she said , ` do n't you see that you ca n't open your mind to particular suspicions of one of the two , without opening your mind to general suspicions of the other ?
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 5]: They had worked together .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 10]: Their goings-on had been going on for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 29]: Even granting that it was as you have had in your thoughts , what the two had done together would come familiar to the mind of one . '
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 15]: ` You do n't know father , Miss , when you talk like that .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 11]: Indeed , indeed , you do n't know father . '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 10]: ` Lizzie , Lizzie , ' said Miss Potterson .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 4]: ` Leave him .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 12]: You need n't break with him altogether , but leave him .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 44]: Do well away from him ; not because of what I have told you to-night -- we 'll pass no judgment upon that , and we 'll hope it may not be -- but because of what I have urged on you before .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 23]: No matter whether it 's owing to your good looks or not , I like you and I want to serve you .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 7]: Lizzie , come under my direction .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 19]: Do n't fling yourself away , my girl , but be persuaded into being respectable and happy . '
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 33]: In the sound good feeling and good sense of her entreaty , Miss Abbey had softened into a soothing tone , and had even drawn her arm round the girl 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 13]: But , she only replied , ` Thank you , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 4]: I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 7]: I must not think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 17]: The harder father is borne upon , the more he needs me to lean on . '
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 33]: And then Miss Abbey , who , like all hard people when they do soften , felt that there was considerable compensation owing to her , underwent reaction and became frigid . '
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 19]: I have done what I can , ' she said , ` and you must go your way .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 12]: You make your bed , and you must lie on it .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 15]: But tell your father one thing : he must not come here any more .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 19]: ` Oh , Miss , will you forbid him the house where I know he 's safe ? '
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 21]: ` The Fellowships , ' returned Miss Abbey , ` has itself to look to , as well as others .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 31]: It has been hard work to establish order here , and make the Fellowships what it is , and it is daily and nightly hard work to keep it so .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 17]: The Fellowships must not have a taint upon it that may give it a bad name .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 15]: I forbid the house to Riderhood , and I forbid the house to Gaffer .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 6]: I forbid both , equally .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 30]: I find from Riderhood and you together , that there are suspicions against both men , and I 'm not going to take upon myself to decide betwixt them .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 22]: They are both tarred with a dirty brush , and I ca n't have the Fellowships tarred with the same brush .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 7]: That 's all I know . '
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 6]: ` Good-night , Miss ! '
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 6]: said Lizzie Hexam , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 3]: ` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: -- Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 10]: returned Miss Abbey with a shake of her head .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 17]: ` Believe me , Miss Abbey , I am truly grateful all the same . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 26]: I can believe a good deal , ' returned the stately Abbey , ` so I 'll try to believe that too , Lizzie . '
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 20]: No supper did Miss Potterson take that night , and only half her usual tumbler of hot Port Negus .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 46]: And the female domestics -- two robust sisters , with staring black eyes , shining flat red faces , blunt noses , and strong black curls , like dolls -- interchanged the sentiment that Missis had had her hair combed the wrong way by somebody .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 33]: And the pot-boy afterwards remarked , that he had n't been ` so rattled to bed ' , since his late mother had systematically accelerated his retirement to rest with a poker .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 24]: The chaining of the door behind her , as she went forth , disenchanted Lizzie Hexam of that first relief she had felt .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 42]: The night was black and shrill , the river-side wilderness was melancholy , and there was a sound of casting-out , in the rattling of the iron-links , and the grating of the bolts and staples under Miss Abbey 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 62]: As she came beneath the lowering sky , a sense of being involved in a murky shade of Murder dropped upon her ; and , as the tidal swell of the river broke at her feet without her seeing how it gathered , so , her thoughts startled her by rushing out of an unseen void and striking at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 12]: Of her father 's being groundlessly suspected , she felt sure .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 2]: Sure .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 2]: Sure .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 32]: And yet , repeat the word inwardly as often as she would , the attempt to reason out and prove that she was sure , always came after it and failed .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 11]: Riderhood had done the deed , and entrapped her father .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 30]: Riderhood had not done the deed , but had resolved in his malice to turn against her father , the appearances that were ready to his hand to distort .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 29]: Equally and swiftly upon either putting of the case , followed the frightful possibility that her father , being innocent , yet might come to be believed guilty .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 36]: She had heard of people suffering Death for bloodshed of which they were afterwards proved pure , and those ill-fated persons were not , first , in that dangerous wrong in which her father stood .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 24]: Then at the best , the beginning of his being set apart , whispered against , and avoided , was a certain fact .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 7]: It dated from that very night .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 70]: And as the great black river with its dreary shores was soon lost to her view in the gloom , so , she stood on the river 's brink unable to see into the vast blank misery of a life suspected , and fallen away from by good and bad , but knowing that it lay there dim before her , stretching away to the great ocean , Death .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 12]: One thing only , was clear to the girl 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 45]: Accustomed from her very babyhood promptly to do the thing that could be done -- whether to keep out weather , to ward off cold , to postpone hunger , or what not -- she started out of her meditation , and ran home .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 13]: The room was quiet , and the lamp burnt on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 12]: In the bunk in the corner , her brother lay asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 15]: She bent over him softly , kissed him , and came to the table .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 23]: ` By the time of Miss Abbey 's closing , and by the run of the tide , it must be one .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 5]: Tide 's running up .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 24]: Father at Chiswick , would n't think of coming down , till after the turn , and that 's at half after four .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 7]: I 'll call Charley at six .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 13]: I shall hear the church-clocks strike , as I sit here . '
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 24]: Very quietly , she placed a chair before the scanty fire , and sat down in it , drawing her shawl about her .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 13]: ` Charley 's hollow down by the flare is not there now .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 4]: Poor Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 32]: The clock struck two , and the clock struck three , and the clock struck four , and she remained there , with a woman 's patience and her own purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 46]: When the morning was well on between four and five , she slipped off her shoes -LRB- that her going about , might not wake Charley -RRB- , trimmed the fire sparingly , put water on to boil , and set the table for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 27]: Then she went up the ladder , lamp in hand , and came down again , and glided about and about , making a little bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 47]: Lastly , from her pocket , and from the chimney-piece , and from an inverted basin on the highest shelf she brought halfpence , a few sixpences , fewer shillings , and fell to laboriously and noiselessly counting them , and setting aside one little heap .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 16]: She was still so engaged , when she was startled by : ` Hal-loa ! '
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: From her brother , sitting up in bed .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 9]: ` You made me jump , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 3]: ` Jump !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 38]: Did n't you make ME jump , when I opened my eyes a moment ago , and saw you sitting there , like the ghost of a girl miser , in the dead of the night . '
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 12]: ` It 's not the dead of the night , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 9]: It 's nigh six in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 5]: ` Is it though ?
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 10]: But what are you up to , Liz ? '
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: ` Still telling your fortune , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 20]: ` It seems to be a precious small one , if that 's it , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 15]: ` What are you putting that little pile of money by itself for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 7]: ` For you , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 22]: ` Get out of bed , Charley , and get washed and dressed , and then I 'll tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 17]: Her composed manner , and her low distinct voice , always had an influence over him .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 27]: His head was soon in a basin of water , and out of it again , and staring at her through a storm of towelling . '
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 24]: I never , ' towelling at himself as if he were his bitterest enemy , ` saw such a girl as you are .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 8]: What IS the move , Liz ? '
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 11]: ` Are you almost ready for breakfast , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 7]: ` You can pour it out .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 2]: Hal-loa !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 3]: I say ?
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 5]: And a bundle ? '
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 8]: ` And a bundle , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 13]: ` You do n't mean it 's for me , too ? '
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 11]: ` Yes , Charley ; I do ; indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 41]: More serious of face , and more slow of action , than he had been , the boy completed his dressing , and came and sat down at the little breakfast-table , with his eyes amazedly directed to her face .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 26]: ` You see , Charley dear , I have made up my mind that this is the right time for your going away from us .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 28]: Over and above all the blessed change of by-and-bye , you 'll be much happier , and do much better , even so soon as next month .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 8]: Even so soon as next week . '
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 10]: ` How do you know I shall ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 14]: I do n't quite know how , Charley , but I do . '
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 53]: In spite of her unchanged manner of speaking , and her unchanged appearance of composure , she scarcely trusted herself to look at him , but kept her eyes employed on the cutting and buttering of his bread , and on the mixing of his tea , and other such little preparations .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 25]: ` You must leave father to me , Charley -- I will do what I can with him -- but you must go . '
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 27]: ` You do n't stand upon ceremony , I think , ' grumbled the boy , throwing his bread and butter about , in an ill-humour .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 7]: She made him no answer . '
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 48]: I tell you what , ' said the boy , then , bursting out into an angry whimpering , ` you 're a selfish jade , and you think there 's not enough for three of us , and you want to get rid of me . '
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 47]: ` If you believe so , Charley , -- yes , then I believe too , that I am a selfish jade , and that I think there 's not enough for three of us , and that I want to get rid of you . '
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 24]: It was only when the boy rushed at her , and threw his arms round her neck , that she lost her self-restraint .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 11]: But she lost it then , and wept over him .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 9]: ` Do n't cry , do n't cry !
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 14]: I am satisfied to go , Liz ; I am satisfied to go .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 11]: I know you send me away for my good . '
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 15]: ` O , Charley , Charley , Heaven above us knows I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 4]: ` Yes yes .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 7]: Do n't mind what I said .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 5]: Do n't remember it .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 4]: Kiss me . '
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 19]: After a silence , she loosed him , to dry her eyes and regain her strong quiet influence .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 7]: ` Now listen , Charley dear .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 23]: We both know it must be done , and I alone know there is good reason for its being done at once .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 39]: Go straight to the school , and say that you and I agreed upon it -- that we ca n't overcome father 's opposition -- that father will never trouble them , but will never take you back .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 29]: You are a credit to the school , and you will be a greater credit to it yet , and they will help you to get a living .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 21]: Show what clothes you have brought , and what money , and say that I will send some more money .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 28]: If I can get some in no other way , I will ask a little help of those two gentlemen who came here that night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 4]: I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 6]: cried her brother , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 18]: ` Do n't you have it of that chap that took hold of me by the chin !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 11]: Do n't you have it of that Wrayburn one ! '
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 32]: Perhaps a slight additional tinge of red flushed up into her face and brow , as with a nod she laid a hand upon his lips to keep him silently attentive .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 10]: ` And above all things mind this , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 9]: Be sure you always speak well of father .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 10]: Be sure you always give father his full due .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 44]: You ca n't deny that because father has no learning himself he is set against it in you ; but favour nothing else against him , and be sure you say -- as you know -- that your sister is devoted to him .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 24]: And if you should ever happen to hear anything said against father that is new to you , it will not be true .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 4]: Remember , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 7]: It will not be true . '
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 20]: The boy looked at her with some doubt and surprise , but she went on again without heeding it .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 6]: ` Above all things remember !
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 6]: It will not be true .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 43]: I have nothing more to say , Charley dear , except , be good , and get learning , and only think of some things in the old life here , as if you had dreamed them in a dream last night .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 6]: Good-bye , my Darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 35]: Though so young , she infused in these parting words a love that was far more like a mother 's than a sister 's , and before which the boy was quite bowed down .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 30]: After holding her to his breast with a passionate cry , he took up his bundle and darted out at the door , with an arm across his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 59]: The white face of the winter day came sluggishly on , veiled in a frosty mist ; and the shadowy ships in the river slowly changed to black substances ; and the sun , blood-red on the eastern marshes behind dark masts and yards , seemed filled with the ruins of a forest it had set on fire .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 22]: Lizzie , looking for her father , saw him coming , and stood upon the causeway that he might see her .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 14]: He had nothing with him but his boat , and came on apace .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 33]: A knot of those amphibious human-creatures who appear to have some mysterious power of extracting a subsistence out of tidal water by looking at it , were gathered together about the causeway .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 18]: As her father 's boat grounded , they became contemplative of the mud , and dispersed themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 9]: She saw that the mute avoidance had begun .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 26]: Gaffer saw it , too , in so far as that he was moved when he set foot on shore , to stare around him .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 30]: But , he promptly set to work to haul up his boat , and make her fast , and take the sculls and rudder and rope out of her .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 14]: Carrying these with Lizzie 's aid , he passed up to his dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 17]: ` Sit close to the fire , father , dear , while I cook your breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 14]: It 's all ready for cooking , and only been waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 6]: You must be frozen . '
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 16]: ` Well , Lizzie , I ai n't of a glow ; that 's certain .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 10]: And my hands seem nailed through to the sculls .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: See how dead they are ! '
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 32]: Something suggestive in their colour , and perhaps in her face , struck him as he held them up ; he turned his shoulder and held them down to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 16]: ` You were not out in the perishing night , I hope , father ? '
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 6]: ` No , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 10]: Lay aboard a barge , by a blazing coal-fire .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 7]: -- Where 's that boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 27]: ` There 's a drop of brandy for your tea , father , if you 'll put it in while I turn this bit of meat .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 23]: If the river was to get frozen , there would be a deal of distress ; would n't there , father ? '
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 56]: there 's always enough of that , ' said Gaffer , dropping the liquor into his cup from a squat black bottle , and dropping it slowly that it might seem more ; ` distress is for ever a going about , like sut in the air -- Ai n't that boy up yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 9]: ` The meat 's ready now , father .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 9]: Eat it while it 's hot and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 16]: After you have finished , we 'll turn round to the fire and talk . '
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 40]: But , he perceived that he was evaded , and , having thrown a hasty angry glance towards the bunk , plucked at a corner of her apron and asked : ` What 's gone with that boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 19]: ` Father , if you 'll begin your breakfast , I 'll sit by and tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 36]: He looked at her , stirred his tea and took two or three gulps , then cut at his piece of hot steak with his case-knife , and said , eating : ` Now then .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 8]: What 's gone with that boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 8]: ` Do n't be angry , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 15]: It seems , father , that he has quite a gift of learning . '
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 8]: ` Unnat ` ral young beggar ! '
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 11]: said the parent , shaking his knife in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 26]: ` And that having this gift , and not being equally good at other things , he has made shift to get some schooling . '
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 8]: ` Unnat ` ral young beggar ! '
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 11]: said the parent again , with his former action . '
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 37]: -- And that knowing you have nothing to spare , father , and not wishing to be a burden on you , he gradually made up his mind to go seek his fortune out of learning .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 25]: He went away this morning , father , and he cried very much at going , and he hoped you would forgive him . '
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 27]: ` Let him never come a nigh me to ask me my forgiveness , ' said the father , again emphasizing his words with the knife .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 19]: ` Let him never come within sight of my eyes , nor yet within reach of my arm .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 10]: His own father ai n't good enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 7]: He 's disowned his own father .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 21]: His own father therefore , disowns him for ever and ever , as a unnat ` ral young beggar . '
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 7]: He had pushed away his plate .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 37]: With the natural need of a strong rough man in anger , to do something forcible , he now clutched his knife overhand , and struck downward with it at the end of every succeeding sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 20]: As he would have struck with his own clenched fist if there had chanced to be nothing in it .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 7]: ` He 's welcome to go .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 10]: He 's more welcome to go than to stay .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 7]: But let him never come back .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 10]: Let him never put his head inside that door .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 39]: And let you never speak a word more in his favour , or you 'll disown your own father , likewise , and what your father says of him he 'll have to come to say of you .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 12]: Now I see why them men yonder held aloof from me .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 22]: They says to one another , `` Here comes the man as ai n't good enough for his own son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 4]: Lizzie -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 9]: But , she stopped him with a cry .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 28]: Looking at her he saw her , with a face quite strange to him , shrinking back against the wall , with her hands before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 6]: ` Father , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 11]: I ca n't bear to see you striking with it .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 5]: Put it down ! '
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 14]: He looked at the knife ; but in his astonishment still held it .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 8]: ` Father , it 's too horrible .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 10]: O put it down , put it down ! '
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 24]: Confounded by her appearance and exclamation , he tossed it away , and stood up with his open hands held out before him .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 9]: ` What 's come to you , Liz ?
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 13]: Can you think I would strike at you with a knife ? '
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 14]: ` No , father , no ; you would never hurt me . '
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 7]: ` What should I hurt ? '
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 6]: ` Nothing , dear father .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 19]: On my knees , I am certain , in my heart and soul I am certain , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 34]: But it was too dreadful to bear ; for it looked -- ' her hands covering her face again , ' O it looked -- ' ` What did it look like ? '
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 34]: The recollection of his murderous figure , combining with her trial of last night , and her trial of the morning , caused her to drop at his feet , without having answered .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 8]: He had never seen her so before .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 37]: He raised her with the utmost tenderness , calling her the best of daughters , and ` my poor pretty creetur ' , and laid her head upon his knee , and tried to restore her .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 33]: But failing , he laid her head gently down again , got a pillow and placed it under her dark hair , and sought on the table for a spoonful of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 20]: There being none left , he hurriedly caught up the empty bottle , and ran out at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 15]: He returned as hurriedly as he had gone , with the bottle still empty .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 56]: He kneeled down by her , took her head on his arm , and moistened her lips with a little water into which he dipped his fingers : saying , fiercely , as he looked around , now over this shoulder , now over that : ` Have we got a pest in the house ?
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 11]: Is there summ ` at deadly sticking to my clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 7]: What 's let loose upon us ?
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 5]: Who loosed it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 26]: Chapter 7 MR WEGG LOOKS AFTER HIMSELF Silas Wegg , being on his road to the Roman Empire , approaches it by way of Clerkenwell .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 14]: The time is early in the evening ; the weather moist and raw .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 47]: Mr Wegg finds leisure to make a little circuit , by reason that he folds his screen early , now that he combines another source of income with it , and also that he feels it due to himself to be anxiously expected at the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 34]: ` Boffin will get all the eagerer for waiting a bit , ' says Silas , screwing up , as he stumps along , first his right eye , and then his left .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 16]: Which is something superfluous in him , for Nature has already screwed both pretty tight .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 33]: ` If I get on with him as I expect to get on , ' Silas pursues , stumping and meditating , ` it would n't become me to leave it here .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 7]: It would n't he respectable . '
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 30]: Animated by this reflection , he stumps faster , and looks a long way before him , as a man with an ambitious project in abeyance often will do .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 30]: Aware of a working-jeweller population taking sanctuary about the church in Clerkenwell , Mr Wegg is conscious of an interest in , and a respect for , the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 60]: But , his sensations in this regard halt as to their strict morality , as he halts in his gait ; for , they suggest the delights of a coat of invisibility in which to walk off safely with the precious stones and watch-cases , but stop short of any compunction for the people who would lose the same .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 93]: Not , however , towards the ` shops ' where cunning artificers work in pearls and diamonds and gold and silver , making their hands so rich , that the enriched water in which they wash them is bought for the refiners ; -- not towards these does Mr Wegg stump , but towards the poorer shops of small retail traders in commodities to eat and drink and keep folks warm , and of Italian frame-makers , and of barbers , and of brokers , and of dealers in dogs and singing-birds .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 74]: From these , in a narrow and a dirty street devoted to such callings , Mr Wegg selects one dark shop-window with a tallow candle dimly burning in it , surrounded by a muddle of objects vaguely resembling pieces of leather and dry stick , but among which nothing is resolvable into anything distinct , save the candle itself in its old tin candlestick , and two preserved frogs fighting a smallsword duel .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 33]: Stumping with fresh vigour , he goes in at the dark greasy entry , pushes a little greasy dark reluctant side-door , and follows the door into the little dark greasy shop .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 41]: It is so dark that nothing can be made out in it , over a little counter , but another tallow candle in another old tin candlestick , close to the face of a man stooping low in a chair .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 12]: Mr Wegg nods to the face , ` Good evening . '
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 20]: The face looking up is a sallow face with weak eyes , surmounted by a tangle of reddish-dusty hair .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 23]: The owner of the face has no cravat on , and has opened his tumbled shirt-collar to work with the more ease .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 19]: For the same reason he has no coat on : only a loose waistcoat over his yellow linen .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 34]: His eyes are like the over-tried eyes of an engraver , but he is not that ; his expression and stoop are like those of a shoemaker , but he is not that .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 7]: ` Good evening , Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 6]: Do n't you remember ? '
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 34]: With slowly dawning remembrance , Mr Venus rises , and holds his candle over the little counter , and holds it down towards the legs , natural and artificial , of Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 6]: ` To be SURE ! '
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 5]: he says , then .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 7]: ` How do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 11]: ` Wegg , you know , ' that gentleman explains .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 10]: ` Yes , yes , ' says the other .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 5]: ` Hospital amputation ? '
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 9]: ` Just so , ' says Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 9]: ` Yes , yes , ' quoth Venus .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 6]: ` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 15]: Sit down by the fire , and warm your -- your other one . '
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 58]: ` The little counter being so short a counter that it leaves the fireplace , which would have been behind it if it had been longer , accessible , Mr Wegg sits down on a box in front of the fire , and inhales a warm and comfortable smell which is not the smell of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 54]: ` For that , ' Mr Wegg inwardly decides , as he takes a corrective sniff or two , ` is musty , leathery , feathery , cellary , gluey , gummy , and , ' with another sniff , ` as it might be , strong of old pairs of bellows . '
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 22]: ` My tea is drawing , and my muffin is on the hob , Mr Wegg ; will you partake ? '
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 20]: It being one of Mr Wegg 's guiding rules in life always to partake , he says he will .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 63]: But , the little shop is so excessively dark , is stuck so full of black shelves and brackets and nooks and corners , that he sees Mr Venus 's cup and saucer only because it is close under the candle , and does not see from what mysterious recess Mr Venus produces another for himself until it is under his nose .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 39]: Concurrently , Wegg perceives a pretty little dead bird lying on the counter , with its head drooping on one side against the rim of Mr Venus 's saucer , and a long stiff wire piercing its breast .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 36]: As if it were Cock Robin , the hero of the ballad , and Mr Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow , and Mr Wegg were the fly with his little eye .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 36]: Mr Venus dives , and produces another muffin , yet untoasted ; taking the arrow out of the breast of Cock Robin , he proceeds to toast it on the end of that cruel instrument .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 19]: When it is brown , he dives again and produces butter , with which he completes his work .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 42]: Mr Wegg , as an artful man who is sure of his supper by-and-bye , presses muffin on his host to soothe him into a compliant state of mind , or , as one might say , to grease his works .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 67]: As the muffins disappear , little by little , the black shelves and nooks and corners begin to appear , and Mr Wegg gradually acquires an imperfect notion that over against him on the chimney-piece is a Hindoo baby in a bottle , curved up with his big head tucked under him , as he would instantly throw a summersault if the bottle were large enough .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 51]: When he deems Mr Venus 's wheels sufficiently lubricated , Mr Wegg approaches his object by asking , as he lightly taps his hands together , to express an undesigning frame of mind : ` And how have I been going on , this long time , Mr Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 11]: ` Very bad , ' says Mr Venus , uncompromisingly .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 3]: ` What ?
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 7]: Am I still at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 9]: asks Wegg , with an air of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 6]: ` Always at home . '
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 22]: This would seem to be secretly agreeable to Wegg , but he veils his feelings , and observes , ` Strange .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 9]: To what do you attribute it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 35]: I do n't know , ' replies Venus , who is a haggard melancholy man , speaking in a weak voice of querulous complaint , ` to what to attribute it , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 13]: I ca n't work you into a miscellaneous one , no how .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 13]: Do what I will , you ca n't be got to fit .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 21]: Anybody with a passable knowledge would pick you out at a look , and say , -- `` No go !
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 6]: Do n't match ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 29]: ` Well , but hang it , Mr Venus , ' Wegg expostulates with some little irritation , ` that ca n't be personal and peculiar in ME .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 9]: It must often happen with miscellaneous ones . '
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 10]: ` With ribs -LRB- I grant you -RRB- always .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 4]: But not else .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 49]: When I prepare a miscellaneous one , I know beforehand that I ca n't keep to nature , and be miscellaneous with ribs , because every man has his own ribs , and no other man 's will go with them ; but elseways I can be miscellaneous .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 18]: I have just sent home a Beauty -- a perfect Beauty -- to a school of art .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 18]: One leg Belgian , one leg English , and the pickings of eight other people in it .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: Talk of not being qualified to be miscellaneous !
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 11]: By rights you OUGHT to be , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 34]: Silas looks as hard at his one leg as he can in the dim light , and after a pause sulkily opines ` that it must be the fault of the other people .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 12]: Or how do you mean to say it comes about ? '
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 5]: he demands impatiently . '
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 9]: I do n't know how it comes about .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 5]: Stand up a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 5]: Hold the light . '
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 28]: Mr Venus takes from a corner by his chair , the bones of a leg and foot , beautifully pure , and put together with exquisite neatness .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 24]: These he compares with Mr Wegg 's leg ; that gentleman looking on , as if he were being measured for a riding-boot .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 16]: ` No , I do n't know how it is , but so it is .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 16]: You have got a twist in that bone , to the best of my belief .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 9]: I never saw the likes of you . '
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 40]: Mr Wegg having looked distrustfully at his own limb , and suspiciously at the pattern with which it has been compared , makes the point : ` I 'll bet a pound that ai n't an English one ! '
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 13]: ` An easy wager , when we run so much into foreign !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 10]: No , it belongs to that French gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 68]: As he nods towards a point of darkness behind Mr Wegg , the latter , with a slight start , looks round for ` that French gentleman , ' whom he at length descries to be represented -LRB- in a very workmanlike manner -RRB- by his ribs only , standing on a shelf in another corner , like a piece of armour or a pair of stays .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 53]: says Mr Wegg , with a sort of sense of being introduced ; ' I dare say you were all right enough in your own country , but I hope no objections will be taken to my saying that the Frenchman was never yet born as I should wish to match . '
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 34]: At this moment the greasy door is violently pushed inward , and a boy follows it , who says , after having let it slam : ` Come for the stuffed canary . '
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 19]: ` It 's three and ninepence , ' returns Venus ; ` have you got the money ? '
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 6]: The boy produces four shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 20]: Mr Venus , always in exceedingly low spirits and making whimpering sounds , peers about for the stuffed canary .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 44]: On his taking the candle to assist his search , Mr Wegg observes that he has a convenient little shelf near his knees , exclusively appropriated to skeleton hands , which have very much the appearance of wanting to lay hold of him .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 19]: From these Mr Venus rescues the canary in a glass case , and shows it to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 3]: he whimpers .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: ` There 's animation !
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 11]: On a twig , making up his mind to hop !
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: Take care of him ; he 's a lovely specimen .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 7]: -- And three is four . '
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 32]: The boy gathers up his change and has pulled the door open by a leather strap nailed to it for the purpose , when Venus cries out : ` Stop him !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 7]: Come back , you young villain !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 10]: You 've got a tooth among them halfpence . '
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 11]: ` How was I to know I 'd got it ?
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 5]: You giv it me .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 18]: I do n't want none of your teeth ; I 've got enough of my own . '
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 20]: So the boy pipes , as he selects it from his change , and throws it on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 21]: ` Do n't sauce ME , in the wicious pride of your youth , ' Mr Venus retorts pathetically . '
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 11]: Do n't hit ME because you see I 'm down .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 7]: I 'm low enough without that .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 9]: It dropped into the till , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 5]: They drop into everything .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 10]: There was two in the coffee-pot at breakfast time .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 3]: Molars . '
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 20]: ` Very well , then , ' argues the boy , ` what do you call names for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 46]: To which Mr Venus only replies , shaking his shock of dusty hair , and winking his weak eyes , ` Do n't sauce ME , in the wicious pride of your youth ; do n't hit ME , because you see I 'm down .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 20]: You 've no idea how small you 'd come out , if I had the articulating of you . '
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 17]: This consideration seems to have its effect on the boy , for he goes out grumbling .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 9]: ` Oh dear me , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 22]: sighs Mr Venus , heavily , snuffing the candle , ` the world that appeared so flowery has ceased to blow !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 12]: You 're casting your eye round the shop , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 7]: Let me show you a light .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 4]: My working bench .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 6]: My young man 's bench .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 3]: A Wice .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 2]: Tools .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 4]: Bones , warious .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 4]: Skulls , warious .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 4]: Preserved Indian baby .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 3]: African ditto .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 5]: Bottled preparations , warious .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 11]: Everything within reach of your hand , in good preservation .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 5]: The mouldy ones a-top .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 15]: What 's in those hampers over them again , I do n't quite remember .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 5]: Say , human warious .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 2]: Cats .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 4]: Articulated English baby .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 2]: Dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 2]: Ducks .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 5]: Glass eyes , warious .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 3]: Mummied bird .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 5]: Dried cuticle , warious .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 5]: Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 8]: That 's the general panoramic view . '
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 42]: Having so held and waved the candle as that all these heterogeneous objects seemed to come forward obediently when they were named , and then retire again , Mr Venus despondently repeats , ` Oh dear me , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 19]: resumes his seat , and with drooping despondency upon him , falls to pouring himself out more tea .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 6]: ` Where am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 4]: asks Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 32]: ` You 're somewhere in the back shop across the yard , sir ; and speaking quite candidly , I wish I 'd never bought you of the Hospital Porter . '
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 14]: ` Now , look here , what did you give for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 56]: ` Well , ' replies Venus , blowing his tea : his head and face peering out of the darkness , over the smoke of it , as if he were modernizing the old original rise in his family : ` you were one of a warious lot , and I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 18]: Silas puts his point in the improved form of ` What will you take for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 32]: ` Well , ' replies Venus , still blowing his tea , ` I 'm not prepared , at a moment 's notice , to tell you , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 16]: According to your own account I 'm not worth much , ' Wegg reasons persuasively .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 62]: ` Not for miscellaneous working in , I grant you , Mr Wegg ; but you might turn out valuable yet , as a -- ' here Mr Venus takes a gulp of tea , so hot that it makes him choke , and sets his weak eyes watering ; ` as a Monstrosity , if you 'll excuse me . '
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 21]: Repressing an indignant look , indicative of anything but a disposition to excuse him , Silas pursues his point . '
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 19]: I think you know me , Mr Venus , and I think you know I never bargain . '
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 33]: Mr Venus takes gulps of hot tea , shutting his eyes at every gulp , and opening them again in a spasmodic manner ; but does not commit himself to assent . '
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 77]: I have a prospect of getting on in life and elevating myself by my own independent exertions , ' says Wegg , feelingly , ` and I should n't like -- I tell you openly I should NOT like -- under such circumstances , to be what I may call dispersed , a part of me here , and a part of me there , but should wish to collect myself like a genteel person . '
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 14]: ` It 's a prospect at present , is it , Mr Wegg ?
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 13]: Then you have n't got the money for a deal about you ?
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 18]: Then I 'll tell you what I 'll do with you ; I 'll hold you over .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 20]: I am a man of my word , and you need n't be afraid of my disposing of you .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: I 'll hold you over .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 5]: That 's a promise .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 8]: Oh dear me , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 49]: Fain to accept his promise , and wishing to propitiate him , Mr Wegg looks on as he sighs and pours himself out more tea , and then says , trying to get a sympathetic tone into his voice : ` You seem very low , Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 5]: Is business bad ? '
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 7]: ` Never was so good . '
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 9]: ` Is your hand out at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 7]: ` Never was so well in .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 18]: Mr Wegg , I 'm not only first in the trade , but I 'm THE trade .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 30]: You may go and buy a skeleton at the West End if you like , and pay the West End price , but it 'll be my putting together .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 32]: I 've as much to do as I can possibly do , with the assistance of my young man , and I take a pride and a pleasure in it . '
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 33]: Mr Venus thus delivers hmself , his right hand extended , his smoking saucer in his left hand , protesting as though he were going to burst into a flood of tears .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 17]: ` That ai n't a state of things to make you low , Mr Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 10]: ` Mr Wegg , I know it ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 37]: Mr Wegg , not to name myself as a workman without an equal , I 've gone on improving myself in my knowledge of Anatomy , till both by sight and by name I 'm perfect .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 61]: Mr Wegg , if you was brought here loose in a bag to be articulated , I 'd name your smallest bones blindfold equally with your largest , as fast as I could pick 'em out , and I 'd sort 'em all , and sort your wertebrae , in a manner that would equally surprise and charm you . '
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 30]: ` Well , ' remarks Silas -LRB- though not quite so readily as last time -RRB- , ` THAT ai n't a state of things to be low about .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 12]: -- Not for YOU to be low about , leastways . '
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 19]: ` Mr Wegg , I know it ai n't ; Mr Wegg , I know it ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 14]: But it 's the heart that lowers me , it is the heart !
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 13]: Be so good as take and read that card out loud . '
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 35]: Silas receives one from his hand , which Venus takes from a wonderful litter in a drawer , and putting on his spectacles , reads : ' `` Mr Venus , ' ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 5]: Go on . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 12]: `` Preserver of Animals and Birds , '' ' ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 5]: Go on . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 8]: `` Articulator of human bones . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 10]: ` That 's it , ' with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 5]: ` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 11]: Mr Wegg , I 'm thirty-two , and a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 7]: Mr Wegg , I love her .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 14]: Mr Wegg , she is worthy of being loved by a Potentate ! '
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 59]: Here Silas is rather alarmed by Mr Venus 's springing to his feet in the hurry of his spirits , and haggardly confronting him with his hand on his coat collar ; but Mr Venus , begging pardon , sits down again , saying , with the calmness of despair , ` She objects to the business . '
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 10]: ` Does she know the profits of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 24]: ` She knows the profits of it , but she do n't appreciate the art of it , and she objects to it .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 32]: `` I do not wish , '' she writes in her own handwriting , `` to regard myself , nor yet to be regarded , in that boney light '' . '
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 20]: Mr Venus pours himself out more tea , with a look and in an attitude of the deepest desolation .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 30]: ` And so a man climbs to the top of the tree , Mr Wegg , only to see that there 's no look-out when he 's up there !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 23]: I sit here of a night surrounded by the lovely trophies of my art , and what have they done for me ?
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 3]: Ruined me .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 31]: Brought me to the pass of being informed that `` she does not wish to regard herself , nor yet to be regarded , in that boney light '' ! '
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 23]: Having repeated the fatal expressions , Mr Venus drinks more tea by gulps , and offers an explanation of his doing so .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 5]: ` It lowers me .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 12]: When I 'm equally lowered all over , lethargy sets in .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 16]: By sticking to it till one or two in the morning , I get oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 10]: Do n't let me detain you , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 9]: I 'm not company for any one . '
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 23]: ` It is not on that account , ' says Silas , rising , ` but because I 've got an appointment .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 10]: It 's time I was at Harmon 's . '
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 4]: said Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 10]: ` Harmon 's , up Battle Bridge way ? '
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 11]: Mr Wegg admits that he is bound for that port .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 18]: ` You ought to be in a good thing , if you 've worked yourself in there .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 10]: There 's lots of money going , there . '
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 23]: ` To think , ' says Silas , ` that you should catch it up so quick , and know about it .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 3]: Wonderful ! '
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 8]: ` Not at all , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 40]: The old gentleman wanted to know the nature and worth of everything that was found in the dust ; and many 's the bone , and feather , and what not , that he 's brought to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 6]: ` Really , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 9]: -LRB- Oh dear me , dear me ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 12]: And he 's buried quite in this neighbourhood , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 4]: Over yonder . '
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 20]: Mr Wegg does not know , but he makes as if he did , by responsively nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 25]: He also follows with his eyes , the toss of Venus 's head : as if to seek a direction to over yonder . '
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 15]: I took an interest in that discovery in the river , ' says Venus .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 13]: -LRB- She had n't written her cutting refusal at that time . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 12]: I 've got up there -- never mind , though . '
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 29]: He had raised the candle at arm 's length towards one of the dark shelves , and Mr Wegg had turned to look , when he broke off .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 11]: ` The old gentleman was well known all round here .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 18]: There used to be stories about his having hidden all kinds of property in those dust mounds .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 8]: I suppose there was nothing in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 8]: Probably you know , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 19]: ` Nothing in 'em , ' says Wegg , who has never heard a word of this before .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 8]: ` Do n't let me detain you .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 34]: The unfortunate Mr Venus gives him a shake of the hand with a shake of his own head , and drooping down in his chair , proceeds to pour himself out more tea .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 107]: Mr Wegg , looking back over his shoulder as he pulls the door open by the strap , notices that the movement so shakes the crazy shop , and so shakes a momentary flare out of the candle , as that the babies -- Hindoo , African , and British -- the ` human warious ' , the French gentleman , the green glass-eyed cats , the dogs , the ducks , and all the rest of the collection , show for an instant as if paralytically animated ; while even poor little Cock Robin at Mr Venus 's elbow turns over on his innocent side .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 15]: Next moment , Mr Wegg is stumping under the gaslights and through the mud .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 115]: Chapter 8 MR BOFFIN IN CONSULTATION Whosoever had gone out of Fleet Street into the Temple at the date of this history , and had wandered disconsolate about the Temple until he stumbled on a dismal churchyard , and had looked up at the dismal windows commanding that churchyard until at the most dismal window of them all he saw a dismal boy , would in him have beheld , at one grand comprehensive swoop of the eye , the managing clerk , junior clerk , common-law clerk , conveyancing clerk , chancery clerk , every refinement and department of clerk , of Mr Mortimer Lightwood , erewhile called in the newspapers eminent solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 39]: Mr Boffin having been several times in communication with this clerkly essence , both on its own ground and at the Bower , had no difficulty in identifying it when he saw it up in its dusty eyrie .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 64]: To the second floor on which the window was situated , he ascended , much pre-occupied in mind by the uncertainties besetting the Roman Empire , and much regretting the death of the amiable Pertinax : who only last night had left the Imperial affairs in a state of great confusion , by falling a victim to the fury of the praetorian guards .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 8]: ` Morning , morning , morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 28]: said Mr Boffin , with a wave of his hand , as the office door was opened by the dismal boy , whose appropriate name was Blight .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 5]: ` Governor in ? '
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 15]: ` Mr Lightwood gave you an appointment , sir , I think ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 28]: I do n't want him to give it , you know , ' returned Mr Boffin ; ` I 'll pay my way , my boy . '
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 6]: ` No doubt , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 5]: Would you walk in ?
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 18]: Mr Lightwood ai n't in at the present moment , but I expect him back very shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 22]: Would you take a seat in Mr Lightwood 's room , sir , while I look over our Appointment Book ? '
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 56]: Young Blight made a great show of fetching from his desk a long thin manuscript volume with a brown paper cover , and running his finger down the day 's appointments , murmuring , ` Mr Aggs , Mr Baggs , Mr Caggs , Mr Daggs , Mr Faggs , Mr Gaggs , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: Yes , sir ; quite right .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 10]: You are a little before your time , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 8]: Mr Lightwood will be in directly . '
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 18]: ` I 'm not in a hurry , ' said Mr Boffin ` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 24]: I 'll take the opportunity , if you please , of entering your name in our Callers ' Book for the day . '
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 31]: Young Blight made another great show of changing the volume , taking up a pen , sucking it , dipping it , and running over previous entries before he wrote .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 30]: As , ` Mr Alley , Mr Balley , Mr Calley , Mr Dalley , Mr Falley , Mr Galley , Mr Halley , Mr Lalley , Mr Malley .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 5]: And Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 11]: ` Strict system here ; eh , my lad ? '
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 9]: said Mr Boffin , as he was booked .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 11]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 9]: I could n't get on without it . '
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 21]: By which he probably meant that his mind would have been shattered to pieces without this fiction of an occupation .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 58]: Wearing in his solitary confinement no fetters that he could polish , and being provided with no drinking-cup that he could carve , be had fallen on the device of ringing alphabetical changes into the two volumes in question , or of entering vast numbers of persons out of the Directory as transacting business with Mr Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 34]: It was the more necessary for his spirits , because , being of a sensitive temperament , he was apt to consider it personally disgraceful to himself that his master had no clients .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: ` How long have you been in the law , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 14]: asked Mr Boffin , with a pounce , in his usual inquisitive way .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 17]: ` I 've been in the law , now , sir , about three years . '
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 12]: ` Must have been as good as born in it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 7]: said Mr Boffin , with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 8]: ` Do you like it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 23]: I do n't mind it much , ' returned Young Blight , heaving a sigh , as if its bitterness were past .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: ` What wages do you get ? '
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 12]: ` Half what I could wish , ' replied young Blight .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 11]: ` What 's the whole that you could wish ? '
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 11]: ` Fifteen shillings a week , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 23]: ` About how long might it take you now , at a average rate of going , to be a Judge ? '
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 12]: asked Mr Boffin , after surveying his small stature in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 16]: The boy answered that he had not yet quite worked out that little calculation . '
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 14]: I suppose there 's nothing to prevent your going in for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 30]: The boy virtually replied that as he had the honour to be a Briton who never never never , there was nothing to prevent his going in for it .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 19]: Yet he seemed inclined to suspect that there might be something to prevent his coming out with it .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 13]: ` Would a couple of pound help you up at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 4]: asked Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 55]: On this head , young Blight had no doubt whatever , so Mr Boffin made him a present of that sum of money , and thanked him for his attention to his -LRB- Mr Boffin 's -RRB- affairs ; which , he added , were now , he believed , as good as settled .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 110]: Then Mr Boffin , with his stick at his ear , like a Familiar Spirit explaining the office to him , sat staring at a little bookcase of Law Practice and Law Reports , and at a window , and at an empty blue bag , and at a stick of sealing-wax , and a pen , and a box of wafers , and an apple , and a writing-pad -- all very dusty -- and at a number of inky smears and blots , and at an imperfectly-disguised gun-case pretending to be something legal , and at an iron box labelled HARMON ESTATE , until Mr Lightwood appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 24]: Mr Lightwood explained that he came from the proctor 's , with whom he had been engaged in transacting Mr Boffin 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 14]: ` And they seem to have taken a deal out of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 7]: said Mr Boffin , with commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 129]: Mr Lightwood , without explaining that his weariness was chronic , proceeded with his exposition that , all forms of law having been at length complied with , will of Harmon deceased having been proved , death of Harmon next inheriting having been proved , & c. , and so forth , Court of Chancery having been moved , & c. and so forth , he , Mr Lightwood , had now the gratification , honour , and happiness , again & c. and so forth , of congratulating Mr Boffin on coming into possession as residuary legatee , of upwards of one hundred thousand pounds , standing in the books of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , again & c. and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 20]: ` And what is particularly eligible in the property Mr Boffin , is , that it involves no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 60]: There are no estates to manage , no rents to return so much per cent upon in bad times -LRB- which is an extremely dear way of getting your name into the newspapers -RRB- , no voters to become parboiled in hot water with , no agents to take the cream off the milk before it comes to table .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 25]: You could put the whole in a cash-box to-morrow morning , and take it with you to -- say , to the Rocky Mountains .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 67]: Inasmuch as every man , ' concluded Mr Lightwood , with an indolent smile , ` appears to be under a fatal spell which obliges him , sooner or later , to mention the Rocky Mountains in a tone of extreme familiarity to some other man , I hope you 'll excuse my pressing you into the service of that gigantic range of geographical bores . '
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 25]: Without following this last remark very closely , Mr Boffin cast his perplexed gaze first at the ceiling , and then at the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 22]: ` Well , ' he remarked , ' I do n't know what to say about it , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 11]: I was a ` most as well as I was .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 11]: It 's a great lot to take care of . '
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 15]: ` My dear Mr Boffin , then DO N'T take care of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 4]: said that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 63]: ` Speaking now , ' returned Mortimer , ` with the irresponsible imbecility of a private individual , and not with the profundity of a professional adviser , I should say that if the circumstance of its being too much , weighs upon your mind , you have the haven of consolation open to you that you can easily make it less .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 34]: And if you should be apprehensive of the trouble of doing so , there is the further haven of consolation that any number of people will take the trouble off your hands . '
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 15]: I do n't quite see it , ' retorted Mr Boffin , still perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 15]: ` That 's not satisfactory , you know , what you 're a-saying . '
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 9]: ` Is Anything satisfactory , Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 8]: asked Mortimer , raising his eyebrows . '
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 17]: I used to find it so , ' answered Mr Boffin , with a wistful look .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 22]: ` While I was foreman at the Bower -- afore it WAS the Bower -- I considered the business very satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 39]: The old man was a awful Tartar -LRB- saying it , I 'm sure , without disrespect to his memory -RRB- but the business was a pleasant one to look after , from before daylight to past dark .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 28]: It 's a ` most a pity , ' said Mr Boffin , rubbing his ear , ` that he ever went and made so much money .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 18]: It would have been better for him if he had n't so given himself up to it .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 29]: You may depend upon it , ' making the discovery all of a sudden , ` that HE found it a great lot to take care of ! '
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 7]: Mr Lightwood coughed , not convinced .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 18]: ` And speaking of satisfactory , ' pursued Mr Boffin , ` why , Lord save us !
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 23]: when we come to take it to pieces , bit by bit , where 's the satisfactoriness of the money as yet ?
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 21]: When the old man does right the poor boy after all , the poor boy gets no good of it .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 27]: He gets made away with , at the moment when he 's lifting -LRB- as one may say -RRB- the cup and sarser to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 49]: Mr Lightwood , I will now name to you , that on behalf of the poor dear boy , me and Mrs Boffin have stood out against the old man times out of number , till he has called us every name be could lay his tongue to .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 62]: I have seen him , after Mrs Boffin has given him her mind respecting the claims of the nat ` ral affections , catch off Mrs Boffin 's bonnet -LRB- she wore , in general , a black straw , perched as a matter of convenience on the top of her head -RRB- , and send it spinning across the yard .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 4]: I have indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 42]: And once , when he did this in a manner that amounted to personal , I should have given him a rattler for himself , if Mrs Boffin had n't thrown herself betwixt us , and received flush on the temple .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: Which dropped her , Mr Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 4]: Dropped her . '
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 15]: Mr Lightwood murmured ` Equal honour -- Mrs Boffin 's head and heart . '
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 46]: ` You understand ; I name this , ' pursued Mr Boffin , ` to show you , now the affairs are wound up , that me and Mrs Boffin have ever stood as we were in Christian honour bound , the children 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 44]: Me and Mrs Boffin stood the poor girl 's friend ; me and Mrs Boffin stood the poor boy 's friend ; me and Mrs Boffin up and faced the old man when we momently expected to be turned out for our pains .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 46]: As to Mrs Boffin , ' said Mr Boffin lowering his voice , ` she might n't wish it mentioned now she 's Fashionable , but she went so far as to tell him , in my presence , he was a flinty-hearted rascal . '
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 20]: Mr Lightwood murmured ` Vigorous Saxon spirit -- Mrs Boffin 's ancestors -- bowmen -- Agincourt and Cressy . '
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 41]: ` The last time me and Mrs Boffin saw the poor boy , ' said Mr Boffin , warming -LRB- as fat usually does -RRB- with a tendency to melt , ` he was a child of seven year old .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 41]: For when he came back to make intercession for his sister , me and Mrs Boffin were away overlooking a country contract which was to be sifted before carted , and he was come and gone in a single hour .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 11]: I say he was a child of seven year old .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 39]: He was going away , all alone and forlorn , to that foreign school , and he come into our place , situate up the yard of the present Bower , to have a warm at our fire .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 10]: There was his little scanty travelling clothes upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 38]: There was his little scanty box outside in the shivering wind , which I was going to carry for him down to the steamboat , as the old man would n't hear of allowing a sixpence coach-money .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 98]: Mrs Boffin , then quite a young woman and pictur of a full-blown rose , stands him by her , kneels down at the fire , warms her two open hands , and falls to rubbing his cheeks ; but seeing the tears come into the child 's eyes , the tears come fast into her own , and she holds him round the neck , like as if she was protecting him , and cries to me , `` I 'd give the wide wide world , I would , to run away with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 27]: I do n't say but what it cut me , and but what it at the same time heightened my feelings of admiration for Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 31]: The poor child clings to her for awhile , as she clings to him , and then , when the old man calls , he says `` I must go !
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 5]: God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 29]: and for a moment rests his heart against her bosom , and looks up at both of us , as if it was in pain -- in agony .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 4]: Such a look !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 41]: I went aboard with him -LRB- I gave him first what little treat I thought he 'd like -RRB- , and I left him when he had fallen asleep in his berth , and I came back to Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 40]: But tell her what I would of how I had left him , it all went for nothing , for , according to her thoughts , he never changed that look that he had looked up at us two .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 8]: But it did one piece of good .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 21]: Mrs Boffin and me had no child of our own , and had sometimes wished that how we had one .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 4]: But not now .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 27]: `` We might both of us die , '' says Mrs Boffin , `` and other eyes might see that lonely look in our child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 46]: So of a night , when it was very cold , or when the wind roared , or the rain dripped heavy , she would wake sobbing , and call out in a fluster , `` Do n't you see the poor child 's face ?
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 7]: O shelter the poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 17]: -- till in course of years it gently wore out , as many things do . '
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 21]: ` My dear Mr Boffin , everything wears to rags , ' said Mortimer , with a light laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 38]: I wo n't go so far as to say everything , ' returned Mr Boffin , on whom his manner seemed to grate , ` because there 's some things that I never found among the dust .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 4]: Well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 35]: So Mrs Boffin and me grow older and older in the old man 's service , living and working pretty hard in it , till the old man is discovered dead in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 83]: Then Mrs Boffin and me seal up his box , always standing on the table at the side of his bed , and having frequently heerd tell of the Temple as a spot where lawyer 's dust is contracted for , I come down here in search of a lawyer to advise , and I see your young man up at this present elevation , chopping at the flies on the window-sill with his penknife , and I give him a Hoy !
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 19]: not then having the pleasure of your acquaintance , and by that means come to gain the honour .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 31]: Then you , and the gentleman in the uncomfortable neck-cloth under the little archway in Saint Paul 's Churchyard -- ' ` Doctors ' Commons , ' observed Lightwood . '
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 20]: I understood it was another name , ' said Mr Boffin , pausing , ` but you know best .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 67]: Then you and Doctor Scommons , you go to work , and you do the thing that 's proper , and you and Doctor S. take steps for finding out the poor boy , and at last you do find out the poor boy , and me and Mrs Boffin often exchange the observation , `` We shall see him again , under happy circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 25]: But it was never to be ; and the want of satisfactoriness is , that after all the money never gets to him . '
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 23]: ` But it gets , ' remarked Lightwood , with a languid inclination of the head , ` into excellent hands . '
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 39]: ` It gets into the hands of me and Mrs Boffin only this very day and hour , and that 's what I am working round to , having waited for this day and hour a ' purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 11]: Mr Lightwood , here has been a wicked cruel murder .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 10]: By that murder me and Mrs Boffin mysteriously profit .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 28]: For the apprehension and conviction of the murderer , we offer a reward of one tithe of the property -- a reward of Ten Thousand Pound . '
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 10]: ` Mr Boffin , it 's too much . '
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 21]: ` Mr Lightwood , me and Mrs Boffin have fixed the sum together , and we stand to it . '
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 56]: ` But let me represent to you , ' returned Lightwood , ` speaking now with professional profundity , and not with individual imbecility , that the offer of such an immense reward is a temptation to forced suspicion , forced construction of circumstances , strained accusation , a whole tool-box of edged tools . '
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 27]: ` Well , ' said Mr Boffin , a little staggered , ` that 's the sum we put o ' one side for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 34]: Whether it shall be openly declared in the new notices that must now be put about in our names -- ' ` In your name , Mr Boffin ; in your name . '
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 32]: ` Very well ; in my name , which is the same as Mrs Boffin 's , and means both of us , is to be considered in drawing 'em up .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 26]: But this is the first instruction that I , as the owner of the property , give to my lawyer on coming into it . '
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 33]: ` Your lawyer , Mr Boffin , ' returned Lightwood , making a very short note of it with a very rusty pen , ` has the gratification of taking the instruction .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 5]: There is another ? '
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 11]: ` There is just one other , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 33]: Make me as compact a little will as can be reconciled with tightness , leaving the whole of the property to `` my beloved wife , Henerietty Boffin , sole executrix '' .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 18]: Make it as short as you can , using those words ; but make it tight . '
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 20]: At some loss to fathom Mr Boffin 's notions of a tight will , Lightwood felt his way . '
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 12]: I beg your pardon , but professional profundity must be exact .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 16]: When you say tight -- ' ' I mean tight , ' Mr Boffin explained .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 4]: ` Exactly so .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 7]: And nothing can be more laudable .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 15]: But is the tightness to bind Mrs Boffin to any and what conditions ? '
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 6]: ` Bind Mrs Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 4]: interposed her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 6]: What are you thinking of !
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 24]: What I want is , to make it all hers so tight as that her hold of it ca n't be loosed . '
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 11]: ` Hers freely , to do what she likes with ?
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 4]: Hers absolutely ? '
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 4]: ` Absolutely ? '
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 10]: repeated Mr Boffin , with a short sturdy laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 3]: ` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 5]: I should think so !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 19]: It would be handsome in me to begin to bind Mrs Boffin at this time of day ! '
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 41]: So that instruction , too , was taken by Mr Lightwood ; and Mr Lightwood , having taken it , was in the act of showing Mr Boffin out , when Mr Eugene Wrayburn almost jostled him in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 69]: Consequently Mr Lightwood said , in his cool manner , ` Let me make you two known to one another , ' and further signified that Mr Wrayburn was counsel learned in the law , and that , partly in the way of business and partly in the way of pleasure , he had imparted to Mr Wrayburn some of the interesting facts of Mr Boffin 's biography .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 21]: ` Delighted , ' said Eugene -- though he did n't look so -- ` to know Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 12]: ` Thankee , sir , thankee , ' returned that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 10]: ` And how do YOU like the law ? '
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 10]: ` A -- not particularly , ' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: ` Too dry for you , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 17]: Well , I suppose it wants some years of sticking to , before you master it .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 7]: But there 's nothing like work .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 7]: Look at the bees . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 33]: I beg your pardon , ' returned Eugene , with a reluctant smile , ` but will you excuse my mentioning that I always protest against being referred to the bees ? '
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 5]: ` Do you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 5]: said Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 21]: I object on principle , ' said Eugene , ` as a biped -- ' ` As a what ? '
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 4]: asked Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 27]: ` As a two-footed creature ; -- I object on principle , as a two-footed creature , to being constantly referred to insects and four-footed creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 29]: I object to being required to model my proceedings according to the proceedings of the bee , or the dog , or the spider , or the camel .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 32]: I fully admit that the camel , for instance , is an excessively temperate person ; but he has several stomachs to entertain himself with , and I have only one .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 19]: Besides , I am not fitted up with a convenient cool cellar to keep my drink in . '
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 26]: ` But I said , you know , ' urged Mr Boffin , rather at a loss for an answer , ` the bee . '
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 3]: ` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 15]: And may I represent to you that it 's injudicious to say the bee ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 7]: For the whole case is assumed .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 59]: Conceding for a moment that there is any analogy between a bee , and a man in a shirt and pantaloons -LRB- which I deny -RRB- , and that it is settled that the man is to learn from the bee -LRB- which I also deny -RRB- , the question still remains , what is he to learn ?
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 3]: To imitate ?
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 4]: Or to avoid ?
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 44]: When your friends the bees worry themselves to that highly fluttered extent about their sovereign , and become perfectly distracted touching the slightest monarchical movement , are we men to learn the greatness of Tufthunting , or the littleness of the Court Circular ?
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 17]: I am not clear , Mr Boffin , but that the hive may be satirical . '
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: ` At all events , they work , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 22]: ` Ye-es , ' returned Eugene , disparagingly , ` they work ; but do n't you think they overdo it ?
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 45]: They work so much more than they need -- they make so much more than they can eat -- they are so incessantly boring and buzzing at their one idea till Death comes upon them -- that do n't you think they overdo it ?
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 14]: And are human labourers to have no holidays , because of the bees ?
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 16]: And am I never to have change of air , because the bees do n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 35]: Mr Boffin , I think honey excellent at breakfast ; but , regarded in the light of my conventional schoolmaster and moralist , I protest against the tyrannical humbug of your friend the bee .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 8]: With the highest respect for you . '
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: ` Thankee , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 6]: ` Morning , morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 41]: But , the worthy Mr Boffin jogged away with a comfortless impression he could have dispensed with , that there was a deal of unsatisfactoriness in the world , besides what he had recalled as appertaining to the Harmon property .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 32]: And he was still jogging along Fleet Street in this condition of mind , when he became aware that he was closely tracked and observed by a man of genteel appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 5]: ` Now then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 25]: said Mr Boffin , stopping short , with his meditations brought to an abrupt check , ` what 's the next article ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: I beg your pardon , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 7]: ` My name too , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 7]: How did you come by it ?
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 7]: I do n't know you . '
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 12]: ` No , sir , you do n't know me . '
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 16]: Mr Boffin looked full at the man , and the man looked full at him .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 41]: ` No , ' said Mr Boffin , after a glance at the pavement , as if it were made of faces and he were trying to match the man 's , ' I DO N'T know you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 27]: I am nobody , ' said the stranger , ` and not likely to be known ; but Mr Boffin 's wealth -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 10]: that 's got about already , has it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 5]: muttered Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 13]: -- And his romantic manner of acquiring it , make him conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 11]: You were pointed out to me the other day . '
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 47]: ` Well , ' said Mr Boffin , ' I should say I was a disappintment to you when I WAS pinted out , if your politeness would allow you to confess it , for I am well aware I am not much to look at .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 7]: What might you want with me ?
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 9]: Not in the law , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 11]: ` No information to give , for a reward ? '
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 25]: There may have been a momentary mantling in the face of the man as he made the last answer , but it passed directly .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 22]: ` If I do n't mistake , you have followed me from my lawyer 's and tried to fix my attention .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 3]: Say out !
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 3]: Have you ?
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 6]: Or have n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 7]: demanded Mr Boffin , rather angry .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 6]: ` Why have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 19]: ` If you will allow me to walk beside you , Mr Boffin , I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 33]: Would you object to turn aside into this place -- I think it is called Clifford 's Inn -- where we can hear one another better than in the roaring street ? '
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 45]: -LRB- ` Now , ' thought Mr Boffin , ` if he proposes a game at skittles , or meets a country gentleman just come into property , or produces any article of jewellery he has found , I 'll knock him down ! '
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 28]: With this discreet reflection , and carrying his stick in his arms much as Punch carries his , Mr Boffin turned into Clifford 's Inn aforesaid . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 23]: ` Mr Boffin , I happened to be in Chancery Lane this morning , when I saw you going along before me .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 27]: I took the liberty of following you , trying to make up my mind to speak to you , till you went into your lawyer 's .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 10]: Then I waited outside till you came out . '
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 33]: -LRB- ` Do n't quite sound like skittles , nor yet country gentleman , nor yet jewellery , ' thought Mr Boffin , ` but there 's no knowing . ' -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 29]: I am afraid my object is a bold one , I am afraid it has little of the usual practical world about it , but I venture it .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 62]: If you ask me , or if you ask yourself -- which is more likely -- what emboldens me , I answer , I have been strongly assured , that you are a man of rectitude and plain dealing , with the soundest of sound hearts , and that you are blessed in a wife distinguished by the same qualities . '
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 26]: ` Your information is true of Mrs Boffin , anyhow , ' was Mr Boffin 's answer , as he surveyed his new friend again .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 42]: There was something repressed in the strange man 's manner , and he walked with his eyes on the ground -- though conscious , for all that , of Mr Boffin 's observation -- and he spoke in a subdued voice .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 17]: But his words came easily , and his voice was agreeable in tone , albeit constrained .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 75]: ` When I add , I can discern for myself what the general tongue says of you -- that you are quite unspoiled by Fortune , and not uplifted -- I trust you will not , as a man of an open nature , suspect that I mean to flatter you , but will believe that all I mean is to excuse myself , these being my only excuses for my present intrusion . '
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 6]: -LRB- ` How much ? '
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 4]: thought Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 8]: ` It must be coming to money .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 5]: How much ? ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 18]: ` You will probably change your manner of living , Mr Boffin , in your changed circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 22]: You will probably keep a larger house , have many matters to arrange , and be beset by numbers of correspondents .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 15]: If you would try me as your Secretary -- ' ` As WHAT ? '
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 10]: cried Mr Boffin , with his eyes wide open .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 5]: ` Your Secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 20]: ` Well , ' said Mr Boffin , under his breath , ` that 's a queer thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 49]: ` Or , ' pursued the stranger , wondering at Mr Boffin 's wonder , ` if you would try me as your man of business under any name , I know you would find me faithful and grateful , and I hope you would find me useful .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 11]: You may naturally think that my immediate object is money .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 33]: Not so , for I would willingly serve you a year -- two years -- any term you might appoint -- before that should begin to be a consideration between us . '
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 8]: ` Where do you come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 5]: asked Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 18]: I come , ' returned the other , meeting his eye , ` from many countries . '
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 31]: Boffin 's acquaintances with the names and situations of foreign lands being limited in extent and somewhat confused in quality , he shaped his next question on an elastic model .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 9]: ` From -- any particular place ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 8]: I have been in many places . '
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 7]: ` What have you been ? '
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 4]: asked Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 24]: Here again he made no great advance , for the reply was , ' I have been a student and a traveller . '
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 29]: ` But if it ai n't a liberty to plump it out , ' said Mr Boffin , ` what do you do for your living ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 26]: I have mentioned , ' returned the other , with another look at him , and a smile , ` what I aspire to do .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 25]: I have been superseded as to some slight intentions I had , and I may say that I have now to begin life . '
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 66]: Not very well knowing how to get rid of this applicant , and feeling the more embarrassed because his manner and appearance claimed a delicacy in which the worthy Mr Boffin feared he himself might be deficient , that gentleman glanced into the mouldy little plantation or cat-preserve , of Clifford 's Inn , as it was that day , in search of a suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 23]: Sparrows were there , cats were there , dry-rot and wet-rot were there , but it was not otherwise a suggestive spot .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 28]: ` All this time , ' said the stranger , producing a little pocket-book and taking out a card , ' I have not mentioned my name .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 5]: My name is Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 12]: I lodge at one Mr Wilfer 's , at Holloway . '
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 5]: Mr Boffin stared again .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 8]: ` Father of Miss Bella Wilfer ? '
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 9]: ` My landlord has a daughter named Bella .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 6]: Yes ; no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 35]: Now , this name had been more or less in Mr Boffin 's thoughts all the morning , and for days before ; therefore he said : ` That 's singular , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 18]: unconsciously staring again , past all bounds of good manners , with the card in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 19]: ` Though , by-the-bye , I suppose it was one of that family that pinted me out ? '
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 13]: I have never been in the streets with one of them . '
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 11]: ` Heard me talked of among 'em , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 16]: I occupy my own rooms , and have held scarcely any communication with them . '
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 6]: ` Odder and odder ! '
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 22]: ` Well , sir , to tell you the truth , I do n't know what to say to you . '
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 21]: ` Say nothing , ' returned Mr Rokesmith ; ` allow me to call on you in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 30]: I am not so unconscionable as to think it likely that you would accept me on trust at first sight , and take me out of the very street .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 15]: Let me come to you for your further opinion , at your leisure . '
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 57]: ` That 's fair , and I do n't object , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` but it must be on condition that it 's fully understood that I no more know that I shall ever be in want of any gentleman as Secretary -- it WAS Secretary you said ; was n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 23]: Again Mr Boffin 's eyes opened wide , and he stared at the applicant from head to foot , repeating ` Queer !
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 8]: -- You 're sure it was Secretary ?
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 5]: Are you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 8]: I am sure I said so . '
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 49]: -- ` As Secretary , ' repeated Mr Boffin , meditating upon the word ; ' I no more know that I may ever want a Secretary , or what not , than I do that I shall ever be in want of the man in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 20]: Me and Mrs Boffin have not even settled that we shall make any change in our way of life .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 31]: Mrs Boffin 's inclinations certainly do tend towards Fashion ; but , being already set up in a fashionable way at the Bower , she may not make further alterations .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 32]: However , sir , as you do n't press yourself , I wish to meet you so far as saying , by all means call at the Bower if you like .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 10]: Call in the course of a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 48]: At the same time , I consider that I ought to name , in addition to what I have already named , that I have in my employment a literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- as I have no thoughts of parting from . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 32]: I regret to hear I am in some sort anticipated , ' Mr Rokesmith answered , evidently having heard it with surprise ; ` but perhaps other duties might arise ? '
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 29]: ` You see , ' returned Mr Boffin , with a confidential sense of dignity , ` as to my literary man 's duties , they 're clear .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 17]: Professionally he declines and he falls , and as a friend he drops into poetry . '
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 34]: Without observing that these duties seemed by no means clear to Mr Rokesmith 's astonished comprehension , Mr Boffin went on : ` And now , sir , I 'll wish you good-day .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 14]: You can call at the Bower any time in a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 20]: It 's not above a mile or so from you , and your landlord can direct you to it .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 34]: But as he may not know it by it 's new name of Boffin 's Bower , say , when you inquire of him , it 's Harmon 's ; will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 21]: ` Harmoon 's , ' repeated Mr Rokesmith , seeming to have caught the sound imperfectly , ` Harmarn 's .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 7]: How do you spell it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 28]: ` Why , as to the spelling of it , ' returned Mr Boffin , with great presence of mind , ` that 's YOUR look out .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 12]: Harmon 's is all you 've got to say to HIM .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 7]: Morning , morning , morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 8]: And so departed , without looking back .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 59]: Chapter 9 MR AND MRS BOFFIN IN CONSULTATION Betaking himself straight homeward , Mr Boffin , without further let or hindrance , arrived at the Bower , and gave Mrs Boffin -LRB- in a walking dress of black velvet and feathers , like a mourning coachhorse -RRB- an account of all he had said and done since breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 36]: ` This brings us round , my dear , ' he then pursued , ` to the question we left unfinished : namely , whether there 's to be any new go-in for Fashion . '
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 34]: ` Now , I 'll tell you what I want , Noddy , ' said Mrs Boffin , smoothing her dress with an air of immense enjoyment , ' I want Society . '
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 8]: ` Fashionable Society , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 12]: cried Mrs Boffin , laughing with the glee of a child .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 16]: It 's no good my being kept here like Wax-Work ; is it now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 41]: ` People have to pay to see Wax-Work , my dear , ' returned her husband , ` whereas -LRB- though you 'd be cheap at the same money -RRB- the neighbours is welcome to see YOU for nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 14]: ` But it do n't answer , ' said the cheerfial Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 13]: ` When we worked like the neighbours , we suited one another .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 16]: Now we have left work off ; we have left off suiting one another . '
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 12]: ` What , do you think of beginning work again ? '
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 4]: Mr Boffin hinted .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 6]: ` Out of the question !
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 27]: We have come into a great fortune , and we must do what 's right by our fortune ; we must act up to it . '
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 28]: Mr Boffin , who had a deep respect for his wife 's intuitive wisdom , replied , though rather pensively : ' I suppose we must . '
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 26]: ` It 's never been acted up to yet , and , consequently , no good has come of it , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 28]: ` True , to the present time , ' Mr Boffin assented , with his former pensiveness , as he took his seat upon his settle . '
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 13]: I hope good may be coming of it in the future time .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 12]: Towards which , what 's your views , old lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 38]: Mrs Boffin , a smiling creature , broad of figure and simple of nature , with her hands folded in her lap , and with buxom creases in her throat , proceeded to expound her views . '
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 23]: I say , a good house in a good neighbourhood , good things about us , good living , and good society .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 16]: I say , live like our means , without extravagance , and be happy . '
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 15]: I say be happy , too , ' assented the still pensive Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 4]: ` Lor-a-mussy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 43]: exclaimed Mrs Boffin , laughing and clapping her hands , and gaily rocking herself to and fro , ` when I think of me in a light yellow chariot and pair , with silver boxes to the wheels -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 13]: you was thinking of that , was you , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 5]: cried the delighted creature .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 21]: ` And with a footman up behind , with a bar across , to keep his legs from being poled !
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 29]: And with a coachman up in front , sinking down into a seat big enough for three of him , all covered with upholstery in green and white !
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 16]: And with two bay horses tossing their heads and stepping higher than they trot long-ways !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 14]: And with you and me leaning back inside , as grand as ninepence !
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 3]: Oh-h-h-h My !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 7]: Ha ha ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 28]: Mrs Boffin clapped her hands again , rocked herself again , beat her feet upon the floor , and wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 33]: ` And what , my old lady , ' inquired Mr Boffin , when he also had sympathetically laughed : ` what 's your views on the subject of the Bower ? '
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 5]: ` Shut it up .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 17]: Do n't part with it , but put somebody in it , to keep it . '
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 6]: ` Any other views ? '
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 67]: ` Noddy , ' said Mrs Boffin , coming from her fashionable sofa to his side on the plain settle , and hooking her comfortable arm through his , ` Next I think -- and I really have been thinking early and late -- of the disappointed girl ; her that was so cruelly disappointed , you know , both of her husband and his riches .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 11]: Do n't you think we might do something for her ?
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 7]: Have her to live with us ?
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 7]: Or something of that sort ? '
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 12]: ` Ne-ver once thought of the way of doing it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 11]: cried Mr Boffin , smiting the table in his admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 10]: ` What a thinking steam-ingein this old lady is .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 10]: And she do n't know how she does it .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: Neither does the ingein ! '
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 40]: Mrs Boffin pulled his nearest ear , in acknowledgment of this piece of philosophy , and then said , gradually toning down to a motherly strain : ` Last , and not least , I have taken a fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 13]: You remember dear little John Harmon , before he went to school ?
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 10]: Over yonder across the yard , at our fire ?
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 46]: Now that he is past all benefit of the money , and it 's come to us , I should like to find some orphan child , and take the boy and adopt him and give him John 's name , and provide for him .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 11]: Somehow , it would make me easier , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 21]: Say it 's only a whim -- ' ` But I do n't say so , ' interposed her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 27]: ` No , but deary , if you did -- ' ' I should be a Beast if I did , ' her husband interposed again .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 11]: ` That 's as much as to say you agree ?
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 12]: Good and kind of you , and like you , deary !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 74]: And do n't you begin to find it pleasant now , ' said Mrs Boffin , once more radiant in her comely way from head to foot , and once more smoothing her dress with immense enjoyment , ` do n't you begin to find it pleasant already , to think that a child will be made brighter , and better , and happier , because of that poor sad child that day ?
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 23]: And is n't it pleasant to know that the good will be done with the poor sad child 's own money ? '
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 38]: ` Yes ; and it 's pleasant to know that you are Mrs Boffin , ' said her husband , ` and it 's been a pleasant thing to know this many and many a year ! '
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 26]: It was ruin to Mrs Boffin 's aspirations , but , having so spoken , they sat side by side , a hopelessly Unfashionable pair .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 30]: These two ignorant and unpolished people had guided themselves so far on in their journey of life , by a religious sense of duty and desire to do right .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 29]: Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both ; ten thousand vanities additional , possibly , in the breast of the woman .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 55]: But the hard wrathful and sordid nature that had wrung as much work out of them as could be got in their best days , for as little money as could be paid to hurry on their worst , had never been so warped but that it knew their moral straightness and respected it .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 19]: In its own despite , in a constant conflict with itself and them , it had done so .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 7]: And this is the eternal law .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 21]: For , Evil often stops short at itself and dies with the doer of it ; but Good , never .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 24]: Through his most inveterate purposes , the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail had known these two faithful servants to be honest and true .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 49]: While he raged at them and reviled them for opposing him with the speech of the honest and true , it had scratched his stony heart , and he had perceived the powerlessness of all his wealth to buy them if he had addressed himself to the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 27]: So , even while he was their griping taskmaster and never gave them a good word , he had written their names down in his will .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 63]: So , even while it was his daily declaration that he mistrusted all mankind -- and sorely indeed he did mistrust all who bore any resemblance to himself -- he was as certain that these two people , surviving him , would be trustworthy in all things from the greatest to the least , as he was that he must surely die .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 29]: Mr and Mrs Boffin , sitting side by side , with Fashion withdrawn to an immeasurable distance , fell to discussing how they could best find their orphan .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 42]: Mrs Boffin suggested advertisement in the newspapers , requesting orphans answering annexed description to apply at the Bower on a certain day ; but Mr Boffin wisely apprehending obstruction of the neighbouring thoroughfares by orphan swarms , this course was negatived .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 13]: Mrs Boffin next suggested application to their clergyman for a likely orphan .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 33]: Mr Boffin thinking better of this scheme , they resolved to call upon the reverend gentleman at once , and to take the same opportunity of making acquaintance with Miss Bella Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 19]: In order that these visits might be visits of state , Mrs Boffin 's equipage was ordered out .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 45]: This consisted of a long hammer-headed old horse , formerly used in the business , attached to a four-wheeled chaise of the same period , which had long been exclusively used by the Harmony Jail poultry as the favourite laying-place of several discreet hens .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 74]: An unwonted application of corn to the horse , and of paint and varnish to the carriage , when both fell in as a part of the Boffin legacy , had made what Mr Boffin considered a neat turn-out of the whole ; and a driver being added , in the person of a long hammer-headed young man who was a very good match for the horse , left nothing to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 38]: He , too , had been formerly used in the business , but was now entombed by an honest jobbing tailor of the district in a perfect Sepulchre of coat and gaiters , sealed with ponderous buttons .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 48]: Behind this domestic , Mr and Mrs Boffin took their seats in the back compartment of the vehicle : which was sufficiently commodious , but had an undignified and alarming tendency , in getting over a rough crossing , to hiccup itself away from the front compartment .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 25]: On their being descried emerging from the gates of the Bower , the neighbourhood turned out at door and window to salute the Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 35]: Among those who were ever and again left behind , staring after the equipage , were many youthful spirits , who hailed it in stentorian tones with such congratulations as ` Nod-dy Bof-fin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 6]: ` Bof-fin 's mon-ey ! '
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 9]: ` Down with the dust , Bof-fin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 5]: and other similar compliments .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 57]: These , the hammer-headed young man took in such ill part that he often impaired the majesty of the progress by pulling up short , and making as though he would alight to exterminate the offenders ; a purpose from which he only allowed himself to be dissuaded after long and lively arguments with his employers .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 21]: At length the Bower district was left behind , and the peaceful dwelling of the Reverend Frank Milvey was gained .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 21]: The Reverend Frank Milvey 's abode was a very modest abode , because his income was a very modest income .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 23]: He was officially accessible to every blundering old woman who had incoherence to bestow upon him , and readily received the Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 26]: He was quite a young man , expensively educated and wretchedly paid , with quite a young wife and half a dozen quite young children .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 45]: He was under the necessity of teaching and translating from the classics , to eke out his scanty means , yet was generally expected to have more time to spare than the idlest person in the parish , and more money than the richest .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 48]: He accepted the needless inequalities and inconsistencies of his life , with a kind of conventional submission that was almost slavish ; and any daring layman who would have adjusted such burdens as his , more decently and graciously , would have had small help from him .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 80]: With a ready patient face and manner , and yet with a latent smile that showed a quick enough observation of Mrs Boffin 's dress , Mr Milvey , in his little book-room -- charged with sounds and cries as though the six children above were coming down through the ceiling , and the roasting leg of mutton below were coming up through the floor -- listened to Mrs Boffin 's statement of her want of an orphan . '
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 26]: I think , ' said Mr Milvey , ` that you have never had a child of your own , Mr and Mrs Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 2]: Never .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 22]: ` But , like the Kings and Queens in the Fairy Tales , I suppose you have wished for one ? '
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 7]: In a general way , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 22]: Mr Milvey smiled again , as he remarked to himself ` Those kings and queens were always wishing for children . '
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 25]: It occurring to him , perhaps , that if they had been Curates , their wishes might have tended in the opposite direction . '
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 18]: I think , ' he pursued , ` we had better take Mrs Milvey into our Council .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 6]: She is indispensable to me .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 10]: If you please , I 'll call her . '
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 13]: So , Mr Milvey called , ` Margaretta , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 6]: and Mrs Milvey came down .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 53]: A pretty , bright little woman , something worn by anxiety , who had repressed many pretty tastes and bright fancies , and substituted in their stead , schools , soup , flannel , coals , and all the week-day cares and Sunday coughs of a large population , young and old .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 36]: As gallantly had Mr Milvey repressed much in himself that naturally belonged to his old studies and old fellow-students , and taken up among the poor and their children with the hard crumbs of life .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 18]: ` Mr and Mrs Boffin , my dear , whose good fortune you have heard of . '
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 22]: Mrs Milvey , with the most unaffected grace in the world , congratulated them , and was glad to see them .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 24]: Yet her engaging face , being an open as well as a perceptive one , was not without her husband 's latent smile .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 14]: ` Mrs Boffin wishes to adopt a little boy , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 19]: Mrs Milvey , looking rather alarmed , her husband added : ` An orphan , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 11]: said Mrs Milvey , reassured for her own little boys .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 20]: ` And I was thinking , Margaretta , that perhaps old Mrs Goody 's grandchild might answer the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 6]: ` Oh my DEAR Frank !
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 9]: I DO N'T think that would do ! '
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 5]: ` Oh NO ! '
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 43]: The smiling Mrs Boffin , feeling it incumbent on her to take part in the conversation , and being charmed with the emphatic little wife and her ready interest , here offered her acknowledgments and inquired what there was against him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 43]: I DO N'T think , ' said Mrs Milvey , glancing at the Reverend Frank ' -- and I believe my husband will agree with me when he considers it again -- that you could possibly keep that orphan clean from snuff .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 15]: Because his grandmother takes so MANY ounces , and drops it over him . '
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 19]: ` But he would not be living with his grandmother then , Margaretta , ' said Mr Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 36]: ` No , Frank , but it would be impossible to keep her from Mrs Boffin 's house ; and the MORE there was to eat and drink there , the oftener she would go .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: And she IS an inconvenient woman .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 25]: I HOPE it 's not uncharitable to remember that last Christmas Eve she drank eleven cups of tea , and grumbled all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 10]: And she is NOT a grateful woman , Frank .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 46]: You recollect her addressing a crowd outside this house , about her wrongs , when , one night after we had gone to bed , she brought back the petticoat of new flannel that had been given her , because it was too short . '
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 11]: ` That 's true , ' said Mr Milvey . '
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 8]: I do n't think that would do .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 11]: Would little Harrison -- ' ` Oh , FRANK ! '
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 5]: remonstrated his emphatic wife .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 10]: ` He has no grandmother , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 20]: ` No , but I DO N'T think Mrs Boffin would like an orphan who squints so MUCH . '
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 16]: ` That 's true again , ' said Mr Milvey , becoming haggard with perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 23]: ` If a little girl would do -- ' ` But , my DEAR Frank , Mrs Boffin wants a boy . '
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 11]: ` That 's true again , ' said Mr Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 12]: ` Tom Bocker is a nice boy ' -LRB- thoughtfully -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 37]: ` But I DOUBT , Frank , ' Mrs Milvey hinted , after a little hesitation , ` if Mrs Boffin wants an orphan QUITE nineteen , who drives a cart and waters the roads . '
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 40]: Mr Milvey referred the point to Mrs Boffin in a look ; on that smiling lady 's shaking her black velvet bonnet and bows , he remarked , in lower spirits , ` that 's true again . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 50]: I am sure , ' said Mrs Boffin , concerned at giving so much trouble , ` that if I had known you would have taken so much pains , sir -- and you too , ma ' am -- I do n't think I would have come . '
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 8]: ` PRAY do n't say that ! '
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 4]: urged Mrs Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 29]: ` No , do n't say that , ' assented Mr Milvey , ` because we are so much obliged to you for giving us the preference . '
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 27]: Which Mrs Milvey confirmed ; and really the kind , conscientious couple spoke , as if they kept some profitable orphan warehouse and were personally patronized .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 19]: ` But it is a responsible trust , ' added Mr Milvey , ` and difficult to discharge .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 58]: At the same time , we are naturally very unwilling to lose the chance you so kindly give us , and if you could afford us a day or two to look about us , -- you know , Margaretta , we might carefully examine the workhouse , and the Infant School , and your District . '
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 6]: ` To be SURE ! '
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 6]: said the emphatic little wife .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 84]: ` We have orphans , I know , ' pursued Mr Milvey , quite with the air as if he might have added , ` in stock , ' and quite as anxiously as if there were great competition in the business and he were afraid of losing an order , ` over at the clay-pits ; but they are employed by relations or friends , and I am afraid it would come at last to a transaction in the way of barter .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 28]: And even if you exchanged blankets for the child -- or books and firing -- it would be impossible to prevent their being turned into liquor . '
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 37]: Accordingly , it was resolved that Mr and Mrs Milvey should search for an orphan likely to suit , and as free as possible from the foregoing objections , and should communicate again with Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 53]: Then , Mr Boffin took the liberty of mentioning to Mr Milvey that if Mr Milvey would do him the kindness to be perpetually his banker to the extent of ' a twenty-pound note or so , ' to be expended without any reference to him , he would be heartily obliged .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 52]: At this , both Mr Milvey and Mrs Milvey were quite as much pleased as if they had no wants of their own , but only knew what poverty was , in the persons of other people ; and so the interview terminated with satisfaction and good opinion on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 39]: ` Now , old lady , ' said Mr Boffin , as they resumed their seats behind the hammer-headed horse and man : ` having made a very agreeable visit there , we 'll try Wilfer 's . '
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 61]: It appeared , on their drawing up at the family gate , that to try Wilfer 's was a thing more easily projected than done , on account of the extreme difficulty of getting into that establishment ; three pulls at the bell producing no external result ; though each was attended by audible sounds of scampering and rushing within .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 40]: At the fourth tug -- vindictively administered by the hammer-headed young man -- Miss Lavinia appeared , emerging from the house in an accidental manner , with a bonnet and parasol , as designing to take a contemplative walk .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 20]: The young lady was astonished to find visitors at the gate , and expressed her feelings in appropriate action .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 9]: ` Here 's Mr and Mrs Boffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 40]: growled the hammer-headed young man through the bars of the gate , and at the same time shaking it , as if he were on view in a Menagerie ; ` they 've been here half an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 7]: ` Who did you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 4]: asked Miss Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 16]: ` Mr and Mrs BOFFIN ' returned the young man , rising into a roar .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 29]: Miss Lavinia tripped up the steps to the house-door , tripped down the steps with the key , tripped across the little garden , and opened the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 13]: ` Please to walk in , ' said Miss Lavinia , haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 7]: ` Our servant is out . '
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 36]: Mr and Mrs Boffin complying , and pausing in the little hall until Miss Lavinia came up to show them where to go next , perceived three pairs of listening legs upon the stairs above .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 16]: Mrs Wilfer 's legs , Miss Bella 's legs , Mr George Sampson 's legs .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 10]: ` Mr and Mrs Boffin , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 8]: said Lavinia , in a warning voice .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 24]: Strained attention on the part of Mrs Wilfer 's legs , of Miss Bella 's legs , of Mr George Sampson 's legs .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 24]: ` Yes , Miss. ' ` If you 'll step this way -- down these stairs -- I 'll let Ma know . '
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 21]: Excited flight of Mrs Wilfer 's legs , of Miss Bella 's legs , of Mr George Sampson 's legs .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 77]: After waiting some quarter of an hour alone in the family sittingroom , which presented traces of having been so hastily arranged after a meal , that one might have doubted whether it was made tidy for visitors , or cleared for blindman 's buff , Mr and Mrs Boffin became aware of the entrance of Mrs Wilfer , majestically faint , and with a condescending stitch in her side : which was her company manner .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 44]: ` Pardon me , ' said Mrs Wilfer , after the first salutations , and as soon as she had adjusted the handkerchief under her chin , and waved her gloved hands , ` to what am I indebted for this honour ? '
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 39]: ` To make short of it , ma'am , ' returned Mr Boffin , ` perhaps you may be acquainted with the names of me and Mrs Boffin , as having come into a certain property . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 27]: I have heard , sir , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , with a dignified bend of her head , ` of such being the case . '
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 36]: ` And I dare say , ma'am , ' pursued Mr Boffin , while Mrs Boffin added confirmatory nods and smiles , ` you are not very much inclined to take kindly to us ? '
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 10]: ` Pardon me , ' said Mrs Wilfer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 19]: Twere unjust to visit upon Mr and Mrs Boffin , a calamity which was doubtless a dispensation . '
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 15]: These words were rendered the more effective by a serenely heroic expression of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 58]: ` That 's fairly meant , I am sure , ' remarked the honest Mr Boffin ; ` Mrs Boffin and me , ma'am , are plain people , and we do n't want to pretend to anything , nor yet to go round and round at anything because there 's always a straight way to everything .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 51]: Consequently , we make this call to say , that we shall be glad to have the honour and pleasure of your daughter 's acquaintance , and that we shall be rejoiced if your daughter will come to consider our house in the light of her home equally with this .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 29]: In short , we want to cheer your daughter , and to give her the opportunity of sharing such pleasures as we are a going to take ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 19]: We want to brisk her up , and brisk her about , and give her a change . '
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 6]: ` That 's it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 6]: said the open-hearted Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 3]: ` Lor !
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 6]: Let 's be comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 27]: Mrs Wilfer bent her head in a distant manner to her lady visitor , and with majestic monotony replied to the gentleman : ` Pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 5]: I have several daughters .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 23]: Which of my daughters am I to understand is thus favoured by the kind intentions of Mr Boffin and his lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: ` Do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 7]: the ever-smiling Mrs Boffin put in .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 10]: ` Naturally , Miss Bella , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 4]: ` Oh-h ! '
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 10]: said Mrs Wilfer , with a severely unconvinced look .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 13]: ` My daughter Bella is accessible and shall speak for herself . '
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 32]: Then opening the door a little way , simultaneously with a sound of scuttling outside it , the good lady made the proclamation , ` Send Miss Bella to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 65]: which proclamation , though grandly formal , and one might almost say heraldic , to hear , was in fact enunciated with her maternal eyes reproachfully glaring on that young lady in the flesh -- and in so much of it that she was retiring with difficulty into the small closet under the stairs , apprehensive of the emergence of Mr and Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 53]: ` The avocations of R. W. , my husband , ' Mrs Wilfer explained , on resuming her seat , ` keep him fully engaged in the City at this time of the day , or he would have had the honour of participating in your reception beneath our humble roof . '
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 6]: ` Very pleasant premises ! '
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 6]: said Mr Boffin , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 26]: ` Pardon me , sir , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , correcting him , ` it is the abode of conscious though independent Poverty . '
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 69]: Finding it rather difficult to pursue the conversation down this road , Mr and Mrs Boffin sat staring at mid-air , and Mrs Wilfer sat silently giving them to understand that every breath she drew required to be drawn with a self-denial rarely paralleled in history , until Miss Bella appeared : whom Mrs Wilfer presented , and to whom she explained the purpose of the visitors . '
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 37]: I am much obliged to you , I am sure , ' said Miss Bella , coldly shaking her curls , ` but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all . '
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 4]: ` Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 14]: Mrs Wilfer admonished her ; ` Bella , you must conquer this . '
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 46]: ` Yes , do what your Ma says , and conquer it , my dear , ' urged Mrs Boffin , ` because we shall be so glad to have you , and because you are much too pretty to keep yourself shut up . '
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 37]: With that , the pleasant creature gave her a kiss , and patted her on her dimpled shoulders ; Mrs Wilfer sitting stiffly by , like a functionary presiding over an interview previous to an execution .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 58]: ` We are going to move into a nice house , ' said Mrs Boffin , who was woman enough to compromise Mr Boffin on that point , when he could n't very well contest it ; ` and we are going to set up a nice carriage , and we 'll go everywhere and see everything .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 43]: And you must n't , ' seating Bella beside her , and patting her hand , ` you must n't feel a dislike to us to begin with , because we could n't help it , you know , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 34]: With the natural tendency of youth to yield to candour and sweet temper , Miss Bella was so touched by the simplicity of this address that she frankly returned Mrs Boffin 's kiss .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 33]: Not at all to the satisfaction of that good woman of the world , her mother , who sought to hold the advantageous ground of obliging the Boffins instead of being obliged .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 24]: ` My youngest daughter , Lavinia , ' said Mrs Wilfer , glad to make a diversion , as that young lady reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 12]: ` Mr George Sampson , a friend of the family . '
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 26]: The friend of the family was in that stage of tender passion which bound him to regard everybody else as the foe of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 21]: He put the round head of his cane in his mouth , like a stopper , when he sat down .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 13]: As if he felt himself full to the throat with affronting sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 9]: And he eyed the Boffins with implacable eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 31]: ` If you like to bring your sister with you when you come to stay with us , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` of course we shall be glad .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 17]: The better you please yourself , Miss Bella , the better you 'll please us . '
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 16]: ` Oh , my consent is of no consequence at all , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 4]: cried Miss Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 25]: ` Lavvy , ' said her sister , in a low voice , ` have the goodness to be seen and not heard . '
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 13]: ` No , I wo n't , ' replied the sharp Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 16]: ` I 'm not a child , to be taken notice of by strangers . '
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 7]: ` You ARE a child . '
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 16]: ` I 'm not a child , and I wo n't be taken notice of .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 9]: `` Bring your sister , '' indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 4]: ` Lavinia ! '
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 3]: ` Hold !
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 29]: I will not allow you to utter in my presence the absurd suspicion that any strangers -- I care not what their names -- can patronize my child .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 59]: Do you dare to suppose , you ridiculous girl , that Mr and Mrs Boffin would enter these doors upon a patronizing errand ; or , if they did , would remain within them , only for one single instant , while your mother had the strength yet remaining in her vital frame to request them to depart ?
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 13]: You little know your mother if you presume to think so . '
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 21]: ` It 's all very fine , ' Lavinia began to grumble , when Mrs Wilfer repeated : ` Hold !
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 6]: I will not allow this .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: Do you not know what is due to guests ?
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 43]: Do you not comprehend that in presuming to hint that this lady and gentleman could have any idea of patronizing any member of your family -- I care not which -- you accuse them of an impertinence little less than insane ? '
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 24]: ` Never mind me and Mrs Boffin , ma'am , ' said Mr Boffin , smilingly : ` we do n't care . '
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 13]: ` Pardon me , but I do , ' returned Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 18]: Miss Lavinia laughed a short laugh as she muttered , ` Yes , to be sure . '
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 88]: ` And I require my audacious child , ' proceeded Mrs Wilfer , with a withering look at her youngest , on whom it had not the slightest effect , ` to please to be just to her sister Bella ; to remember that her sister Bella is much sought after ; and that when her sister Bella accepts an attention , she considers herself to be conferring qui-i-ite as much honour , ' -- this with an indignant shiver , -- ` as she receives . '
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 23]: But , here Miss Bella repudiated , and said quietly , ' I can speak for myself ; you know , ma .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 10]: You need n't bring ME in , please . '
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 38]: ` And it 's all very well aiming at others through convenient me , ' said the irrepressible Lavinia , spitefully ; ` but I should like to ask George Sampson what he says to it . '
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 68]: ` Mr Sampson , ' proclaimed Mrs Wilfer , seeing that young gentleman take his stopper out , and so darkly fixing him with her eyes as that he put it in again : ` Mr Sampson , as a friend of this family and a frequenter of this house , is , I am persuaded , far too well-bred to interpose on such an invitation . '
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 73]: This exaltation of the young gentleman moved the conscientious Mrs Boffin to repentance for having done him an injustice in her mind , and consequently to saying that she and Mr Boffin would at any time be glad to see him ; an attention which he handsomely acknowledged by replying , with his stopper unremoved , ` Much obliged to you , but I 'm always engaged , day and night . '
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 67]: However , Bella compensating for all drawbacks by responding to the advances of the Boffins in an engaging way , that easy pair were on the whole well satisfied , and proposed to the said Bella that as soon as they should be in a condition to receive her in a manner suitable to their desires , Mrs Boffin should return with notice of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 41]: This arrangement Mrs Wilfer sanctioned with a stately inclination of her head and wave of her gloves , as who should say , ` Your demerits shall be overlooked , and you shall be mercifully gratified , poor people . '
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 25]: ` By-the-bye , ma'am , ' said Mr Boffin , turning back as he was going , ` you have a lodger ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 22]: A gentleman , ' Mrs Wilfer answered , qualifying the low expression , ` undoubtedly occupies our first floor . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 13]: I may call him Our Mutual Friend , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 13]: ` What sort of a fellow IS Our Mutual Friend , now ?
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 6]: Do you like him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 16]: ` Mr Rokesmith is very punctual , very quiet , a very eligible inmate . '
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 32]: ` Because , ' Mr Boffin explained , ` you must know that I 'm not particularly well acquainted with Our Mutual Friend , for I have only seen him once .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 8]: You give a good account of him .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 6]: Is he at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 30]: ` Mr Rokesmith is at home , ' said Mrs Wilfer ; ` indeed , ' pointing through the window , ` there he stands at the garden gate .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 7]: Waiting for you , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 9]: ` Perhaps so , ' replied Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 9]: ` Saw me come in , maybe . '
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 9]: Bella had closely attended to this short dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 14]: Accompanying Mrs Boffin to the gate , she as closely watched what followed .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 12]: ` How are you , sir , how are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 6]: ` This is Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 13]: Mr Rokesmith , that I told you of ; my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 26]: She gave him good day , and he bestirred himself and helped her to her seat , and the like , with a ready hand .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 20]: ` Good-bye for the present , Miss Bella , ' said Mrs Boffin , calling out a hearty parting .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 7]: ` We shall meet again soon !
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 16]: And then I hope I shall have my little John Harmon to show you . '
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 45]: Mr Rokesmith , who was at the wheel adjusting the skirts of her dress , suddenly looked behind him , and around him , and then looked up at her , with a face so pale that Mrs Boffin cried : ` Gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 14]: And after a moment , ` What 's the matter , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: ` How can you show her the Dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 4]: returned Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 8]: ` It 's only an adopted child .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 7]: One I have told her of .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 11]: One I 'm going to give the name to ! '
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 36]: ` You took me by surprise , ' said Mr Rokesmith , ` and it sounded like an omen , that you should speak of showing the Dead to one so young and blooming . '
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 13]: Now , Bella suspected by this time that Mr Rokesmith admired her .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 75]: Whether the knowledge -LRB- for it was rather that than suspicion -RRB- caused her to incline to him a little more , or a little less , than she had done at first ; whether it rendered her eager to find out more about him , because she sought to establish reason for her distrust , or because she sought to free him from it ; was as yet dark to her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 24]: But at most times he occupied a great amount of her attention , and she had set her attention closely on this incident .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 30]: That he knew it as well as she , she knew as well as he , when they were left together standing on the path by the garden gate .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 10]: ` Those are worthy people , Miss Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 8]: ` Do you know them well ? '
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 3]: asked Bella .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 41]: He smiled , reproaching her , and she coloured , reproaching herself -- both , with the knowledge that she had meant to entrap him into an answer not true -- when he said ' I know OF them . '
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 14]: ` Truly , he told us he had seen you but once . '
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 9]: ` Truly , I supposed he did . '
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 15]: Bella was nervous now , and would have been glad to recall her question .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 37]: ` You thought it strange that , feeling much interested in you , I should start at what sounded like a proposal to bring you into contact with the murdered man who lies in his grave .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 22]: I might have known -- of course in a moment should have known -- that it could not have that meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 6]: But my interest remains . '
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 23]: Re-entering the family-room in a meditative state , Miss Bella was received by the irrepressible Lavinia with : ` There , Bella !
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 15]: At last I hope you have got your wishes realized -- by your Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 11]: You 'll be rich enough now -- with your Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 14]: You can have as much flirting as you like -- at your Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 22]: But you wo n't take ME to your Boffins , I can tell you -- you and your Boffins too ! '
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 99]: ` If , ' quoth Mr George Sampson , moodily pulling his stopper out , ` Miss Bella 's Mr Boffin comes any more of his nonsense to ME , I only wish him to understand , as betwixt man and man , that he does it at his per -- ' and was going to say peril ; but Miss Lavinia , having no confidence in his mental powers , and feeling his oration to have no definite application to any circumstances , jerked his stopper in again , with a sharpness that made his eyes water .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 45]: And now the worthy Mrs Wilfer , having used her youngest daughter as a lay-figure for the edification of these Boffins , became bland to her , and proceeded to develop her last instance of force of character , which was still in reserve .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 41]: This was , to illuminate the family with her remarkable powers as a physiognomist ; powers that terrified R. W. when ever let loose , as being always fraught with gloom and evil which no inferior prescience was aware of .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 49]: And this Mrs Wilfer now did , be it observed , in jealousy of these Boffins , in the very same moments when she was already reflecting how she would flourish these very same Boffins and the state they kept , over the heads of her Boffinless friends .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: ` Of their manners , ' said Mrs Wilfer , ' I say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 8]: Of their appearance , I say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 13]: Of the disinterestedness of their intentions towards Bella , I say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 25]: But the craft , the secrecy , the dark deep underhanded plotting , written in Mrs Boffin 's countenance , make me shudder . '
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 19]: As an incontrovertible proof that those baleful attributes were all there , Mrs Wilfer shuddered on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 13]: Chapter 10 A MARRIAGE CONTRACT There is excitement in the Veneering mansion .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 40]: The mature young lady is going to be married -LRB- powder and all -RRB- to the mature young gentleman , and she is to be married from the Veneering house , and the Veneerings are to give the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 58]: The Analytical , who objects as a matter of principle to everything that occurs on the premises , necessarily objects to the match ; but his consent has been dispensed with , and a spring-van is delivering its load of greenhouse plants at the door , in order that to-morrow 's feast may be crowned with flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 10]: The mature young lady is a lady of property .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 10]: The mature young gentleman is a gentleman of property .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 5]: He invests his property .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 27]: He goes , in a condescending amateurish way , into the City , attends meetings of Directors , and has to do with traffic in Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 27]: As is well known to the wise in their generation , traffic in Shares is the one thing to have to do with in this world .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 20]: Have no antecedents , no established character , no cultivation , no ideas , no manners ; have Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 26]: Have Shares enough to be on Boards of Direction in capital letters , oscillate on mysterious business between London and Paris , and be great .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 6]: Where does he come from ?
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 2]: Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 6]: Where is he going to ?
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 2]: Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 5]: What are his tastes ?
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 2]: Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 5]: Has he any principles ?
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 2]: Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 6]: What squeezes him into Parliament ?
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 2]: Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 18]: Perhaps he never of himself achieved success in anything , never originated anything , never produced anything ?
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 7]: Sufficient answer to all ; Shares .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 4]: O mighty Shares !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 72]: To set those blaring images so high , and to cause us smaller vermin , as under the influence of henbane or opium , to cry out , night and day , ` Relieve us of our money , scatter it for us , buy us and sell us , ruin us , only we beseech ye take rank among the powers of the earth , and fatten on us ' !
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 29]: While the Loves and Graces have been preparing this torch for Hymen , which is to be kindled to-morrow , Mr Twemlow has suffered much in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 22]: It would seem that both the mature young lady and the mature young gentleman must indubitably be Veneering 's oldest friends .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 6]: Wards of his , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 13]: Yet that can scarcely be , for they are older than himself .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 19]: Veneering has been in their confidence throughout , and has done much to lure them to the altar .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 22]: He has mentioned to Twemlow how he said to Mrs Veneering , ` Anastatia , this must be a match . '
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 39]: He has mentioned to Twemlow how he regards Sophronia Akershem -LRB- the mature young lady -RRB- in the light of a sister , and Alfred Lammle -LRB- the mature young gentleman -RRB- in the light of a brother .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 15]: Twemlow has asked him whether he went to school as a junior with Alfred ?
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 9]: He has answered , ` Not exactly . '
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 8]: Whether Sophronia was adopted by his mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 10]: He has answered , ` Not precisely so . '
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 13]: Twemlow 's hand has gone to his forehead with a lost air .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 98]: But , two or three weeks ago , Twemlow , sitting over his newspaper , and over his dry-toast and weak tea , and over the stable-yard in Duke Street , St James 's , received a highly-perfumed cocked-hat and monogram from Mrs Veneering , entreating her dearest Mr T. , if not particularly engaged that day , to come like a charining soul and make a fourth at dinner with dear Mr Podsnap , for the discussion of an interesting family topic ; the last three words doubly underlined and pointed with a note of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 51]: And Twemlow replying , ` Not engaged , and more than delighted , ' goes , and this takes place : ` My dear Twemlow , ' says Veneering , ` your ready response to Anastatia 's unceremonious invitation is truly kind , and like an old , old friend .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 8]: You know our dear friend Podsnap ? '
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 28]: Twemlow ought to know the dear friend Podsnap who covered him with so much confusion , and he says he does know him , and Podsnap reciprocates .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 31]: Apparently , Podsnap has been so wrought upon in a short time , as to believe that he has been intimate in the house many , many , many years .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 27]: In the friendliest manner he is making himself quite at home with his back to the fire , executing a statuette of the Colossus at Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 20]: Twemlow has before noticed in his feeble way how soon the Veneering guests become infected with the Veneering fiction .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 17]: Not , however , that he has the least notion of its being his own case .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 39]: ` Our friends , Alfred and Sophronia , ' pursues Veneering the veiled prophet : ` our friends Alfred and Sophronia , you will be glad to hear , my dear fellows , are going to be married .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 36]: As my wife and I make it a family affair the entire direction of which we take upon ourselves , of course our first step is to communicate the fact to our family friends . '
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 5]: -LRB- ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 27]: thinks Twemlow , with his eyes on Podsnap , ` then there are only two of us , and he 's the other . ' -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 32]: I did hope , ' Veneering goes on , ` to have had Lady Tippins to meet you ; but she is always in request , and is unfortunately engaged . '
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 5]: -LRB- ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 24]: thinks Twemlow , with his eyes wandering , ` then there are three of us , and SHE 'S the other . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 64]: ` Mortimer Lightwood , ' resumes Veneering , ` whom you both know , is out of town ; but he writes , in his whimsical manner , that as we ask him to be bridegroom 's best man when the ceremony takes place , he will not refuse , though he does n't see what he has to do with it . '
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 5]: -LRB- ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 24]: thinks Twemlow , with his eyes rolling , ` then there are four of us , and HE 'S the other . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 30]: ` Boots and Brewer , ' observes Veneering , ` whom you also know , I have not asked to-day ; but I reserve them for the occasion . '
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 41]: -LRB- ` Then , ' thinks Twemlow , with his eyes shut , ` there are si -- ' But here collapses and does not completely recover until dinner is over and the Analytical has been requested to withdraw . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 24]: ` We now come , ' says Veneering , ` to the point , the real point , of our little family consultation .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 18]: Sophronia , having lost both father and mother , has no one to give her away . '
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 10]: ` Give her away yourself , ' says Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 7]: ` My dear Podsnap , no .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 4]: For three reasons .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 20]: Firstly , because I could n't take so much upon myself when I have respected family friends to remember .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 17]: Secondly , because I am not so vain as to think that I look the part .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 29]: Thirdly , because Anastatia is a little superstitious on the subject and feels averse to my giving away anybody until baby is old enough to be married . '
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 9]: ` What would happen if he did ? '
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 6]: Podsnap inquires of Mrs Veneering .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 36]: ` My dear Mr Podsnap , it 's very foolish I know , but I have an instinctive presentiment that if Hamilton gave away anybody else first , he would never give away baby . '
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 39]: Thus Mrs Veneering ; with her open hands pressed together , and each of her eight aquiline fingers looking so very like her one aquiline nose that the bran-new jewels on them seem necessary for distinction 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 46]: ` But , my dear Podsnap , ' quoth Veneering , ` there IS a tried friend of our family who , I think and hope you will agree with me , Podsnap , is the friend on whom this agreeable duty almost naturally devolves .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 26]: That friend , ' saying the words as if the company were about a hundred and fifty in number , ` is now among us .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 6]: That friend is Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 4]: ` Certainly ! '
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 3]: From Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 18]: ` That friend , ' Veneering repeats with greater firmness , ` is our dear good Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 85]: And I can not sufficiently express to you , my dear Podsnap , the pleasure I feel in having this opinion of mine and Anastatia 's so readily confirmed by you , that other equally familiar and tried friend who stands in the proud position -- I mean who proudly stands in the position -- or I ought rather to say , who places Anastatia and myself in the proud position of himself standing in the simple position -- of baby 's godfather . '
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 22]: And , indeed , Veneering is much relieved in mind to find that Podsnap betrays no jealousy of Twemlow 's elevation .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 40]: So , it has come to pass that the spring-van is strewing flowers on the rosy hours and on the staircase , and that Twemlow is surveying the ground on which he is to play his distinguished part tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 59]: He has already been to the church , and taken note of the various impediments in the aisle , under the auspices of an extremely dreary widow who opens the pews , and whose left hand appears to be in a state of acute rheumatism , but is in fact voluntarily doubled up to act as a money-box .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 108]: And now Veneering shoots out of the Study wherein he is accustomed , when contemplative , to give his mind to the carving and gilding of the Pilgrims going to Canterbury , in order to show Twemlow the little flourish he has prepared for the trumpets of fashion , describing how that on the seventeenth instant , at St James 's Church , the Reverend Blank Blank , assisted by the Reverend Dash Dash , united in the bonds of matrimony , Alfred Lammle Esquire , of Sackville Street , Piccadilly , to Sophronia , only daughter of the late Horatio Akershem , Esquire , of Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 47]: Also how the fair bride was married from the house of Hamilton Veneering , Esquire , of Stucconia , and was given away by Melvin Twemlow , Esquire , of Duke Street , St James 's , second cousin to Lord Snigsworth , of Snigsworthy Park .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 54]: While perusing which composition , Twemlow makes some opaque approach to perceiving that if the Reverend Blank Blank and the Reverend Dash Dash fail , after this introduction , to become enrolled in the list of Veneering 's dearest and oldest friends , they will have none but themselves to thank for it .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 31]: After which , appears Sophronia -LRB- whom Twemlow has seen twice in his lifetime -RRB- , to thank Twemlow for counterfeiting the late Horatio Akershem Esquire , broadly of Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 51]: And after her , appears Alfred -LRB- whom Twemlow has seen once in his lifetime -RRB- , to do the same and to make a pasty sort of glitter , as if he were constructed for candle-light only , and had been let out into daylight by some grand mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 63]: And after that , comes Mrs Veneering , in a pervadingly aquiline state of figure , and with transparent little knobs on her temper , like the little transparent knob on the bridge of her nose , ` Worn out by worry and excitement , ' as she tells her dear Mr Twemlow , and reluctantly revived with curacoa by the Analytical .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 48]: And after that , the bridesmaids begin to come by railroad from various parts of the country , and to come like adorable recruits enlisted by a sergeant not present ; for , on arriving at the Veneering depot , they are in a barrack of strangers .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 81]: So , Twemlow goes home to Duke Street , St James 's , to take a plate of mutton broth with a chop in it , and a look at the marriageservice , in order that he may cut in at the right place to-morrow ; and he is low , and feels it dull over the livery stable-yard , and is distinctly aware of a dint in his heart , made by the most adorable of the adorable bridesmaids .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 109]: For , the poor little harmless gentleman once had his fancy , like the rest of us , and she did n't answer -LRB- as she often does not -RRB- , and he thinks the adorable bridesmaid is like the fancy as she was then -LRB- which she is not at all -RRB- , and that if the fancy had not married some one else for money , but had married him for love , he and she would have been happy -LRB- which they would n't have been -RRB- , and that she has a tenderness for him still -LRB- whereas her toughness is a proverb -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 31]: Brooding over the fire , with his dried little head in his dried little hands , and his dried little elbows on his dried little knees , Twemlow is melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 10]: ` No Adorable to bear me company here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 3]: thinks he .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 7]: ` No Adorable at the club !
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 13]: A waste , a waste , a waste , my Twemlow ! '
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 13]: And so drops asleep , and has galvanic starts all over him .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 52]: Betimes next morning , that horrible old Lady Tippins -LRB- relict of the late Sir Thomas Tippins , knighted in mistake for somebody else by His Majesty King George the Third , who , while performing the ceremony , was graciously pleased to observe , ` What , what , what ?
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 6]: Who , who , who ?
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 8]: Why , why , why ? ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 11]: begins to be dyed and varnished for the interesting occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 31]: She has a reputation for giving smart accounts of things , and she must be at these people 's early , my dear , to lose nothing of the fun .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 75]: Whereabout in the bonnet and drapery announced by her name , any fragment of the real woman may be concealed , is perhaps known to her maid ; but you could easily buy all you see of her , in Bond Street ; or you might scalp her , and peel her , and scrape her , and make two Lady Tippinses out of her , and yet not penetrate to the genuine article .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 17]: She has a large gold eye-glass , has Lady Tippins , to survey the proceedings with .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 22]: If she had one in each eye , it might keep that other drooping lid up , and look more uniform .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 17]: But perennial youth is in her artificial flowers , and her list of lovers is full .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 28]: ` Mortimer , you wretch , ' says Lady Tippins , turning the eyeglass about and about , ` where is your charge , the bridegroom ? '
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 23]: ` Give you my honour , ' returns Mortimer , ' I do n't know , and I do n't care . '
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 3]: ` Miserable !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 10]: Is that the way you do your duty ? '
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 45]: ` Beyond an impression that he is to sit upon my knee and be seconded at some point of the solemnities , like a principal at a prizefight , I assure you I have no notion what my duty is , ' returns Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 27]: Eugene is also in attendance , with a pervading air upon him of having presupposed the ceremony to be a funeral , and of being disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 29]: The scene is the Vestry-room of St James 's Church , with a number of leathery old registers on shelves , that might be bound in Lady Tippinses .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 4]: But , hark !
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 28]: A carriage at the gate , and Mortimer 's man arrives , looking rather like a spurious Mephistopheles and an unacknowledged member of that gentleman 's family .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 46]: Whom Lady Tippins , surveying through her eye-glass , considers a fine man , and quite a catch ; and of whom Mortimer remarks , in the lowest spirits , as he approaches , ' I believe this is my fellow , confound him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 14]: More carriages at the gate , and lo the rest of the characters .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 18]: Whom Lady Tippins , standing on a cushion , surveying through the eye-glass , thus checks off .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 21]: ` Bride ; five-and-forty if a day , thirty shillings a yard , veil fifteen pound , pocket-handkerchief a present .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 40]: Bridesmaids ; kept down for fear of outshining bride , consequently not girls , twelve and sixpence a yard , Veneering 's flowers , snubnosed one rather pretty but too conscious of her stockings , bonnets three pound ten .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 29]: Twemlow ; blessed release for the dear man if she really was his daughter , nervous even under the pretence that she is , well he may be .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 36]: Mrs Veneering ; never saw such velvet , say two thousand pounds as she stands , absolute jeweller 's window , father must have been a pawnbroker , or how could these people do it ?
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 6]: Attendant unknowns ; pokey . '
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 37]: Ceremony performed , register signed , Lady Tippins escorted out of sacred edifice by Veneering , carriages rolling back to Stucconia , servants with favours and flowers , Veneering 's house reached , drawing-rooms most magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 30]: Here , the Podsnaps await the happy party ; Mr Podsnap , with his hair-brushes made the most of ; that imperial rocking-horse , Mrs Podsnap , majestically skittish .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 52]: Here , too , are Boots and Brewer , and the two other Buffers ; each Buffer with a flower in his button-hole , his hair curled , and his gloves buttoned on tight , apparently come prepared , if anything had happened to the bridegroom , to be married instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 31]: Here , too , the bride 's aunt and next relation ; a widowed female of a Medusa sort , in a stoney cap , glaring petrifaction at her fellowcreatures .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 25]: Here , too , the bride 's trustee ; an oilcake-fed style of business-gentleman with mooney spectacles , and an object of much interest .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 46]: Veneering launching himself upon this trustee as his oldest friend -LRB- which makes seven , Twemlow thought -RRB- , and confidentially retiring with him into the conservatory , it is understood that Veneering is his co-trustee , and that they are arranging about the fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 10]: Buffers are even overheard to whisper Thir-ty Thou-sand Pou-nds !
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 13]: with a smack and a relish suggestive of the very finest oysters .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 28]: Pokey unknowns , amazed to find how intimately they know Veneering , pluck up spirit , fold their arms , and begin to contradict him before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 31]: What time Mrs Veneering , carrying baby dressed as a bridesmaid , flits about among the company , emitting flashes of many-coloured lightning from diamonds , emeralds , and rubies .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 37]: The Analytical , in course of time achieving what he feels to be due to himself in bringing to a dignified conclusion several quarrels he has on hand with the pastrycook 's men , announces breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 19]: Dining-room no less magnificent than drawing-room ; tables superb ; all the camels out , and all laden .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 14]: Splendid cake , covered with Cupids , silver , and true-lovers ' knots .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 18]: Splendid bracelet , produced by Veneering before going down , and clasped upon the arrn of bride .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 33]: Yet nobody seems to think much more of the Veneerings than if they were a tolerable landlord and landlady doing the thing in the way of business at so much a head .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 84]: The bride and bridegroom talk and laugh apart , as has always been their manner ; and the Buffers work their way through the dishes with systematic perseverance , as has always been THEIR manner ; and the pokey unknowns are exceedingly benevolent to one another in invitations to take glasses of champagne ; but Mrs Podsnap , arching her mane and rocking her grandest , has a far more deferential audience than Mrs Veneering ; and Podsnap all but does the honours .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 35]: Another dismal circumstance is , that Veneering , having the captivating Tippins on one side of him and the bride 's aunt on the other , finds it immensely difficult to keep the peace .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 50]: For , Medusa , besides unmistakingly glaring petrifaction at the fascinating Tippins , follows every lively remark made by that dear creature , with an audible snort : which may be referable to a chronic cold in the head , but may also be referable to indignation and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 43]: And this snort being regular in its reproduction , at length comes to be expected by the company , who make embarrassing pauses when it is falling due , and by waiting for it , render it more emphatic when it comes .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 37]: The stoney aunt has likewise an injurious way of rejecting all dishes whereof Lady Tippins partakes : saying aloud when they are proffered to her , ` No , no , no , not for me .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 5]: Take it away ! '
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 32]: As with a set purpose of implying a misgiving that if nourished upon similar meats , she might come to be like that charmer , which would be a fatal consummation .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 37]: Aware of her enemy , Lady Tippins tries a youthful sally or two , and tries the eyeglass ; but , from the impenetrable cap and snorting armour of the stoney aunt all weapons rebound powerless .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 16]: Another objectionable circumstance is , that the pokey unknowns support each other in being unimpressible .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 25]: They persist in not being frightened by the gold and silver camels , and they are banded together to defy the elaborately chased ice-pails .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 35]: They even seem to unite in some vague utterance of the sentiment that the landlord and landlady will make a pretty good profit out of this , and they almost carry themselves like customers .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 120]: Nor is there compensating influence in the adorable bridesmaids ; for , having very little interest in the bride , and none at all in one another , those lovely beings become , each one of her own account , depreciatingly contemplative of the millinery present ; while the bridegroom 's man , exhausted , in the back of his chair , appears to be improving the occasion by penitentially contemplating all the wrong he has ever done ; the difference between him and his friend Eugene , being , that the latter , in the back of HIS chair , appears to be contemplating all the wrong he would like to do -- particularly to the present company .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 33]: In which state of affairs , the usual ceremonies rather droop and flag , and the splendid cake when cut by the fair hand of the bride has but an indigestible appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 63]: However , all the things indispensable to be said are said , and all the things indispensable to be done are done -LRB- including Lady Tippins 's yawning , falling asleep , and waking insensible -RRB- , and there is hurried preparation for the nuptial journey to the Isle of Wight , and the outer air teems with brass bands and spectators .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 22]: In full sight of whom , the malignant star of the Analytical has pre-ordained that pain and ridicule shall befall him .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 68]: For he , standing on the doorsteps to grace the departure , is suddenly caught a most prodigious thump on the side of his head with a heavy shoe , which a Buffer in the hall , champagne-flushed and wild of aim , has borrowed on the spur of the moment from the pastrycook 's porter , to cast after the departing pair as an auspicious omen .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 50]: So they all go up again into the gorgeous drawing-rooms -- all of them flushed with breakfast , as having taken scarlatina sociably -- and there the combined unknowns do malignant things with their legs to ottomans , and take as much as possible out of the splendid furniture .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 77]: And so , Lady Tippins , quite undetermined whether today is the day before yesterday , or the day after to-morrow , or the week after next , fades away ; and Mortimer Lightwood and Eugene fade away , and Twemlow fades away , and the stoney aunt goes away -- she declines to fade , proving rock to the last -- and even the unknowns are slowly strained off , and it is all over .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 13]: All over , that is to say , for the time being .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 37]: But , there is another time to come , and it comes in about a fortnight , and it comes to Mr and Mrs Lammle on the sands at Shanklin , in the Isle of Wight .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 80]: Mr and Mrs Lammle have walked for some time on the Shanklin sands , and one may see by their footprints that they have not walked arm in arm , and that they have not walked in a straight track , and that they have walked in a moody humour ; for , the lady has prodded little spirting holes in the damp sand before her with her parasol , and the gentleman has trailed his stick after him .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 18]: As if he were of the Mephistopheles family indeed , and had walked with a drooping tail .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 31]: ` Do you mean to tell me , then , Sophronia -- ' Thus he begins after a long silence , when Sophronia flashes fiercely , and turns upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 10]: ` Do n't put it upon ME , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 12]: I ask you , do YOU mean to tell me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 12]: Mr Lammle falls silent again , and they walk as before .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 40]: Mrs Lammle opens her nostrils and bites her under-lip ; Mr Lammle takes his gingerous whiskers in his left hand , and , bringing them together , frowns furtively at his beloved , out of a thick gingerous bush .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 8]: ` Do I mean to say ! '
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 10]: Mrs Lammle after a time repeats , with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 6]: ` Putting it on me !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 5]: The unmanly disingenuousness ! '
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 13]: Mr Lammle stops , releases his whiskers , and looks at her .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 5]: ` The what ? '
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 13]: Mrs Lammle haughtily replies , without stopping , and without looking back .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 5]: ` The meanness . '
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 24]: He is at her side again in a pace or two , and he retorts , ` That is not what you said .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 5]: You said disingenuousness . '
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 7]: ` What if I did ? '
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 11]: ` There is no `` if '' in the case .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 5]: You did . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 5]: I did , then .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 6]: And what of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 6]: ` What of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 4]: says Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 13]: ` Have you the face to utter the word to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 7]: ` The face , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 11]: replied Mrs Lammle , staring at him with cold scorn .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 17]: ` Pray , how dare you , sir , utter the word to me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 5]: I never did . '
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 32]: As this happens to be true , Mrs Lammle is thrown on the feminine resource of saying , ' I do n't care what you uttered or did not utter . '
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 17]: After a little more walking and a little more silence , Mr Lammle breaks the latter .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 9]: ` You shall proceed in your own way .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 14]: You claim a right to ask me do I mean to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 9]: Do I mean to tell you what ? '
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 10]: ` That you are a man of property ? '
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 10]: ` Then you married me on false pretences ? '
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 5]: ` So be it .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 8]: Next comes what you mean to say .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 13]: Do you mean to say you are a woman of property ? '
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 10]: ` Then you married me on false pretences . '
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 40]: ` If you were so dull a fortune-hunter that you deceived yourself , or if you were so greedy and grasping that you were over-willing to be deceived by appearances , is it my fault , you adventurer ? '
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 9]: the lady demands , with great asperity . '
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 13]: I asked Veneering , and he told me you were rich . '
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 4]: ` Veneering ! '
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 5]: with great contempt . '
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 9]: And what does Veneering know about me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 8]: ` Was he not your trustee ? '
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 19]: I have no trustee , but the one you saw on the day when you fraudulently married me .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 23]: And his trust is not a very difficult one , for it is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 17]: I think there are some odd shillings or pence , if you are very particular . '
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 27]: Mr Lammle bestows a by no means loving look upon the partner of his joys and sorrows , and he mutters something ; but checks himself .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 5]: ` Question for question .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 9]: It is my turn again , Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 11]: What made you suppose me a man of property ? '
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 8]: ` You made me suppose you so .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 16]: Perhaps you will deny that you always presented yourself to me in that character ? '
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 8]: ` But you asked somebody , too .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 9]: Come , Mrs Lammle , admission for admission .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 6]: You asked somebody ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 5]: I asked Veneering . '
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 22]: ` And Veneering knew as much of me as he knew of you , or as anybody knows of him . '
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 28]: After more silent walking , the bride stops short , to say in a passionate manner : ' I never will forgive the Veneerings for this ! '
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 10]: ` Neither will I , ' returns the bridegroom .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 24]: With that , they walk again ; she , making those angry spirts in the sand ; he , dragging that dejected tail .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 18]: The tide is low , and seems to have thrown them together high on the bare shore .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 11]: A gull comes sweeping by their heads and flouts them .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 20]: There was a golden surface on the brown cliffs but now , and behold they are only damp earth .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 33]: A taunting roar comes from the sea , and the far-out rollers mount upon one another , to look at the entrapped impostors , and to join in impish and exultant gambols .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 45]: ` Do you pretend to believe , ' Mrs Lammle resumes , sternly , ` when you talk of my marrying you for worldly advantages , that it was within the bounds of reasonable probability that I would have married you for yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 13]: ` Again there are two sides to the question , Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 8]: What do you pretend to believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 12]: ` So you first deceive me and then insult me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 9]: cries the lady , with a heaving bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 5]: ` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 5]: I have originated nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 7]: The double-edged question was yours . '
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 5]: ` Was mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 13]: the bride repeats , and her parasol breaks in her angry hand .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 43]: His colour has turned to a livid white , and ominous marks have come to light about his nose , as if the finger of the very devil himself had , within the last few moments , touched it here and there .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 11]: But he has repressive power , and she has none .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 28]: ` Throw it away , ' he coolly recommends as to the parasol ; ` you have made it useless ; you look ridiculous with it . '
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 30]: Whereupon she calls him in her rage , ' A deliberate villain , ' and so casts the broken thing from her as that it strikes him in falling .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 17]: The finger-marks are something whiter for the instant , but he walks on at her side .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 20]: She bursts into tears , declaring herself the wretchedest , the most deceived , the worst-used , of women .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 18]: Then she says that if she had the courage to kill herself , she would do it .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 7]: Then she calls him vile impostor .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 32]: Then she asks him , why , in the disappointment of his base speculation , he does not take her life with his own hand , under the present favourable circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 5]: Then she cries again .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 13]: Then she is enraged again , and makes some mention of swindlers .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 27]: Finally , she sits down crying on a block of stone , and is in all the known and unknown humours of her sex at once .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 36]: Pending her changes , those aforesaid marks in his face have come and gone , now here now there , like white steps of a pipe on which the diabolical performer has played a tune .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 17]: Also his livid lips are parted at last , as if he were breathless with running .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 5]: Yet he is not .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 16]: ` Now , get up , Mrs Lammle , and let us speak reasonably . '
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 13]: She sits upon her stone , and takes no heed of him .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: ` Get up , I tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 19]: Raising her head , she looks contemptuously in his face , and repeats , ` You tell me !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 6]: Tell me , forsooth ! '
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 30]: She affects not to know that his eyes are fastened on her as she droops her head again ; but her whole figure reveals that she knows it uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 5]: ` Enough of this .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 4]: Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 4]: Get up . '
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 26]: Yielding to his hand , she rises , and they walk again ; but this time with their faces turned towards their place of residence .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 17]: ` Mrs Lammle , we have both been deceiving , and we have both been deceived .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 13]: We have both been biting , and we have both been bitten .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 13]: In a nut-shell , there 's the state of the case . '
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 10]: ` You sought me out -- ' ` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 7]: Let us have done with that .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 8]: WE know very well how it was .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 18]: Why should you and I talk about it , when you and I ca n't disguise it ?
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 3]: To proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 10]: I am disappointed and cut a poor figure . '
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 7]: ` Am I no one ? '
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 18]: ` Some one -- and I was coming to you , if you had waited a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 13]: You , too , are disappointed and cut a poor figure . '
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 6]: ` An injured figure ! '
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 35]: ` You are now cool enough , Sophronia , to see that you ca n't be injured without my being equally injured ; and that therefore the mere word is not to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 28]: When I look back , I wonder how I can have been such a fool as to take you to so great an extent upon trust . '
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 14]: ` And when I look back -- ' the bride cries , interrupting .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 22]: ` And when you look back , you wonder how you can have been -- you 'll excuse the word ? '
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 10]: ` Most certainly , with so much reason . '
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 16]: -- Such a fool as to take ME to so great an extent upon trust .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 9]: But the folly is committed on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 16]: I can not get rid of you ; you can not get rid of me .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 4]: What follows ? '
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 12]: ` Shame and misery , ' the bride bitterly replies . '
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 14]: A mutual understanding follows , and I think it may carry us through .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 25]: Here I split my discourse -LRB- give me your arm , Sophronia -RRB- , into three heads , to make it shorter and plainer .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 21]: Firstly , it 's enough to have been done , without the mortification of being known to have been done .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 10]: So we agree to keep the fact to ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 4]: You agree ? '
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 10]: ` If it is possible , I do . '
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 3]: ` Possible !
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 9]: We have pretended well enough to one another .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 11]: Ca n't we , united , pretend to the world ?
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 2]: Agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 33]: Secondly , we owe the Veneerings a grudge , and we owe all other people the grudge of wishing them to be taken in , as we ourselves have been taken in .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 3]: Agreed ? '
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 3]: Agreed . '
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 7]: ` We come smoothly to thirdly .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 9]: You have called me an adventurer , Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 4]: So I am .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 9]: In plain uncomplimentary English , so I am .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 7]: So are you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 5]: So are many people .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 20]: We agree to keep our own secret , and to work together in furtherance of our own schemes . '
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 5]: ` What schemes ? '
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 9]: ` Any scheme that will bring us money .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 11]: By our own schemes , I mean our joint interest .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 3]: Agreed ? '
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 13]: She answers , after a little hesitation , ' I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 3]: Agreed . '
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 8]: ` Carried at once , you see !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 11]: Now , Sophronia , only half a dozen words more .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 6]: We know one another perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 51]: Do n't be tempted into twitting me with the past knowledge that you have of me , because it is identical with the past knowledge that I have of you , and in twitting me , you twit yourself , and I do n't want to hear you do it .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 14]: With this good understanding established between us , it is better never done .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 14]: To wind up all : -- You have shown temper today , Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 20]: Do n't be betrayed into doing so again , because I have a Devil of a temper myself . '
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 22]: So , the happy pair , with this hopeful marriage contract thus signed , sealed , and delivered , repair homeward .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 59]: If , when those infernal finger-marks were on the white and breathless countenance of Alfred Lammle , Esquire , they denoted that he conceived the purpose of subduing his dear wife Mrs Alfred Lammle , by at once divesting her of any lingering reality or pretence of self-respect , the purpose would seem to have been presently executed .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 35]: The mature young lady has mighty little need of powder , now , for her downcast face , as he escorts her in the light of the setting sun to their abode of bliss .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 20]: Chapter 11 PODSNAPPERY Mr Podsnap was well to do , and stood very high in Mr Podsnap 's opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 28]: Beginning with a good inheritance , he had married a good inheritance , and had thriven exceedingly in the Marine Insurance way , and was quite satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 42]: He never could make out why everybody was not quite satisfied , and he felt conscious that he set a brilliant social example in being particularly well satisfied with most things , and , above all other things , with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 25]: Thus happily acquainted with his own merit and importance , Mr Podsnap settled that whatever he put behind him he put out of existence .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 40]: There was a dignified conclusiveness -- not to add a grand convenience -- in this way of getting rid of disagreeables which had done much towards establishing Mr Podsnap in his lofty place in Mr Podsnap 's satisfaction . '
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 24]: I do n't want to know about it ; I do n't choose to discuss it ; I do n't admit it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 42]: Mr Podsnap had even acquired a peculiar flourish of his right arm in often clearing the world of its most difficult problems , by sweeping them behind him -LRB- and consequently sheer away -RRB- with those words and a flushed face .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 5]: For they affronted him .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 60]: Mr Podsnap 's world was not a very large world , morally ; no , nor even geographically : seeing that although his business was sustained upon commerce with other countries , he considered other countries , with that important reservation , a mistake , and of their manners and customs would conclusively observe , ` Not English ! '
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 4]: when , PRESTO !
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 19]: with a flourish of the arm , and a flush of the face , they were swept away .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 37]: Elsewhere , the world got up at eight , shaved close at a quarter-past , breakfasted at nine , went to the City at ten , came home at half-past five , and dined at seven .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 16]: Mr Podsnap 's notions of the Arts in their integrity might have been stated thus .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 42]: Literature ; large print , respectfully descriptive of getting up at eight , shaving close at a quarter past , breakfasting at nine , going to the City at ten , coming home at half-past five , and dining at seven .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 44]: Painting and Sculpture ; models and portraits representing Professors of getting up at eight , shaving close at a quarter past , breakfasting at nine , going to the City at ten , coming home at half-past five , and dining at seven .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 52]: Music ; a respectable performance -LRB- without variations -RRB- on stringed and wind instruments , sedately expressive of getting up at eight , shaving close at a quarter past , breakfasting at nine , going to the City at ten , coming home at half-past five , and dining at seven .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 17]: Nothing else to be permitted to those same vagrants the Arts , on pain of excommunication .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 7]: Nothing else To Be -- anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 24]: As a so eminently respectable man , Mr Podsnap was sensible of its being required of him to take Providence under his protection .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 9]: Consequently he always knew exactly what Providence meant .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 21]: Inferior and less respectable men might fall short of that mark , but Mr Podsnap was always up to it .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 25]: And it was very remarkable -LRB- and must have been very comfortable -RRB- that what Providence meant , was invariably what Mr Podsnap meant .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 31]: These may be said to have been the articles of a faith and school which the present chapter takes the liberty of calling , after its representative man , Podsnappery .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 39]: They were confined within close bounds , as Mr Podsnap 's own head was confined by his shirtcollar ; and they were enunciated with a sounding pomp that smacked of the creaking of Mr Podsnap 's own boots .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 6]: There was a Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 23]: And this young rocking-horse was being trained in her mother 's art of prancing in a stately manner without ever getting on .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 80]: But the high parental action was not yet imparted to her , and in truth she was but an undersized damsel , with high shoulders , low spirits , chilled elbows , and a rasped surface of nose , who seemed to take occasional frosty peeps out of childhood into womanhood , and to shrink back again , overcome by her mother 's head-dress and her father from head to foot -- crushed by the mere dead-weight of Podsnappery .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 30]: A certain institution in Mr Podsnap 's mind which he called ` the young person ' may be considered to have been embodied in Miss Podsnap , his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 23]: It was an inconvenient and exacting institution , as requiring everything in the universe to be filed down and fitted to it .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 19]: The question about everything was , would it bring a blush into the cheek of the young person ?
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 32]: And the inconvenience of the young person was , that , according to Mr Podsnap , she seemed always liable to burst into blushes when there was no need at all .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 23]: There appeared to be no line of demarcation between the young person 's excessive innocence , and another person 's guiltiest knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 35]: Take Mr Podsnap 's word for it , and the soberest tints of drab , white , lilac , and grey , were all flaming red to this troublesome Bull of a young person .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 11]: The Podsnaps lived in a shady angle adjoining Portman Square .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 17]: They were a kind of people certain to dwell in the shade , wherever they dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 61]: Miss Podsnap 's life had been , from her first appearance on this planet , altogether of a shady order ; for , Mr Podsnap 's young person was likely to get little good out of association with other young persons , and had therefore been restricted to companionship with not very congenial older persons , and with massive furniture .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 119]: Miss Podsnap 's early views of life being principally derived from the reflections of it in her father 's boots , and in the walnut and rosewood tables of the dim drawingrooms , and in their swarthy giants of looking-glasses , were of a sombre cast ; and it was not wonderful that now , when she was on most days solemnly tooled through the Park by the side of her mother in a great tall custard-coloured phaeton , she showed above the apron of that vehicle like a dejected young person sitting up in bed to take a startled look at things in general , and very strongly desiring to get her head under the counterpane again .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 14]: Said Mr Podsnap to Mrs Podsnap , ` Georgiana is almost eighteen . '
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 14]: Said Mrs Podsnap to Mr Podsnap , assenting , ` Almost eighteen . '
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 23]: Said Mr Podsnap then to Mrs Podsnap , ` Really I think we should have some people on Georgiana 's birthday . '
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 24]: Said Mrs Podsnap then to Mr Podsnap , ` Which will enable us to clear off all those people who are due . '
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 131]: So it came to pass that Mr and Mrs Podsnap requested the honour of the company of seventeen friends of their souls at dinner ; and that they substituted other friends of their souls for such of the seventeen original friends of their souls as deeply regretted that a prior engagement prevented their having the honour of dining with Mr and Mrs Podsnap , in pursuance of their kind invitation ; and that Mrs Podsnap said of all these inconsolable personages , as she checked them off with a pencil in her list , ` Asked , at any rate , and got rid of ; ' and that they successfully disposed of a good many friends of their souls in this way , and felt their consciences much lightened .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 38]: There were still other friends of their souls who were not entitled to be asked to dinner , but had a claim to be invited to come and take a haunch of mutton vapour-bath at half-past nine .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 41]: For the clearing off of these worthies , Mrs Podsnap added a small and early evening to the dinner , and looked in at the music-shop to bespeak a well-conducted automaton to come and play quadrilles for a carpet dance .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 35]: Mr and Mrs Veneering , and Mr and Mrs Veneering 's bran-new bride and bridegroom , were of the dinner company ; but the Podsnap establishment had nothing else in common with the Veneerings .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 26]: Mr Podsnap could tolerate taste in a mushroom man who stood in need of that sort of thing , but was far above it himself .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 10]: Hideous solidity was the characteristic of the Podsnap plate .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 21]: Everything was made to look as heavy as it could , and to take up as much room as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 48]: Everything said boastfully , ` Here you have as much of me in my ugliness as if I were only lead ; but I am so many ounces of precious metal worth so much an ounce ; -- would n't you like to melt me down ? '
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 37]: A corpulent straddling epergne , blotched all over as if it had broken out in an eruption rather than been ornamented , delivered this address from an unsightly silver platform in the centre of the table .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 44]: Four silver wine-coolers , each furnished with four staring heads , each head obtrusively carrying a big silver ring in each of its ears , conveyed the sentiment up and down the table , and handed it on to the potbellied silver salt-cellars .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 30]: All the big silver spoons and forks widened the mouths of the company expressly for the purpose of thrusting the sentiment down their throats with every morsel they ate .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 20]: The majority of the guests were like the plate , and included several heavy articles weighing ever so much .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 70]: But there was a foreign gentleman among them : whom Mr Podsnap had invited after much debate with himself -- believing the whole European continent to be in mortal alliance against the young person -- and there was a droll disposition , not only on the part of Mr Podsnap but of everybody else , to treat him as if he were a child who was hard of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 56]: As a delicate concession to this unfortunately-born foreigner , Mr Podsnap , in receiving him , had presented his wife as ` Madame Podsnap ; ' also his daughter as ` Mademoiselle Podsnap , ' with some inclination to add ` ma fille , ' in which bold venture , however , he checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 34]: The Veneerings being at that time the only other arrivals , he had added -LRB- in a condescendingly explanatory manner -RRB- , ` Monsieur Vey-nair-reeng , ' and had then subsided into English .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 8]: ` How Do You Like London ? '
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 37]: Mr Podsnap now inquired from his station of host , as if he were administering something in the nature of a powder or potion to the deaf child ; ` London , Londres , London ? '
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 6]: The foreign gentleman admired it .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 8]: ` You find it Very Large ? '
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 6]: said Mr Podsnap , spaciously .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 8]: The foreign gentleman found it very large .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 6]: ` And Very Rich ? '
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 12]: The foreign gentleman found it , without doubt , enormement riche .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 17]: ` Enormously Rich , We say , ' returned Mr Podsnap , in a condescending manner .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 28]: ` Our English adverbs do Not terminate in Mong , and We Pronounce the `` ch '' as if there were a `` t '' before it .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 5]: We say Ritch . '
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 9]: ` Reetch , ' remarked the foreign gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 43]: ` And Do You Find , Sir , ' pursued Mr Podsnap , with dignity , ` Many Evidences that Strike You , of our British Constitution in the Streets Of The World 's Metropolis , London , Londres , London ? '
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 14]: The foreign gentleman begged to be pardoned , but did not altogether understand .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 21]: ` The Constitution Britannique , ' Mr Podsnap explained , as if he were teaching in an infant school . '
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 24]: We Say British , But You Say Britannique , You Know ' -LRB- forgivingly , as if that were not his fault -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 7]: ` The Constitution , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 15]: The foreign gentleman said , ` Mais , yees ; I know eem . '
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 46]: A youngish sallowish gentleman in spectacles , with a lumpy forehead , seated in a supplementary chair at a corner of the table , here caused a profound sensation by saying , in a raised voice , ` ESKER , ' and then stopping dead .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 14]: ` Mais oui , ' said the foreign gentleman , turning towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 4]: ` Est-ce que ?
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 4]: Quoi donc ? '
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 30]: But the gentleman with the lumpy forehead having for the time delivered himself of all that he found behind his lumps , spake for the time no more . '
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 58]: I Was Inquiring , ' said Mr Podsnap , resuming the thread of his discourse , ` Whether You Have Observed in our Streets as We should say , Upon our Pavvy as You would say , any Tokens -- ' The foreign gentleman , with patient courtesy entreated pardon ; ` But what was tokenz ? '
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 19]: ` Marks , ' said Mr Podsnap ; ` Signs , you know , Appearances -- Traces . '
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 5]: Of a Orse ? '
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 5]: inquired the foreign gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 14]: ` We call it Horse , ' said Mr Podsnap , with forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 22]: ` In England , Angleterre , England , We Aspirate the `` H , '' and We Say `` Horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 10]: Only our Lower Classes Say `` Orse ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 16]: ` Pardon , ' said the foreign gentleman ; ' I am alwiz wrong ! '
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 22]: ` Our Language , ' said Mr Podsnap , with a gracious consciousness of being always right , ` is Difficult .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 11]: Ours is a Copious Language , and Trying to Strangers .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 8]: I will not Pursue my Question . '
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 25]: But the lumpy gentleman , unwilling to give it up , again madly said , ` ESKER , ' and again spake no more .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 24]: ` It merely referred , ' Mr Podsnap explained , with a sense of meritorious proprietorship , ` to Our Constitution , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 11]: We Englishmen are Very Proud of our Constitution , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 8]: It Was Bestowed Upon Us By Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 11]: No Other Country is so Favoured as This Country . '
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 5]: ` And ozer countries ?
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 16]: -- ' the foreign gentleman was beginning , when Mr Podsnap put him right again .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 37]: ` We do not say Ozer ; we say Other : the letters are `` T '' and `` H ; '' You say Tay and Aish , You Know ; -LRB- still with clemency -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 12]: The sound is `` th '' -- `` th ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 11]: ` And OTHER countries , ' said the foreign gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 6]: ` They do how ? '
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 35]: ` They do , Sir , ' returned Mr Podsnap , gravely shaking his head ; ` they do -- I am sorry to be obliged to say it -- AS they do . '
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 26]: ` It was a little particular of Providence , ' said the foreign gentleman , laughing ; ` for the frontier is not large . '
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 14]: ` Undoubtedly , ' assented Mr Podsnap ; ` But So it is .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 8]: It was the Charter of the Land .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 24]: This Island was Blest , Sir , to the Direct Exclusion of such Other Countries as -- as there may happen to be .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 87]: And if we were all Englishmen present , I would say , ' added Mr Podsnap , looking round upon his compatriots , and sounding solemnly with his theme , ` that there is in the Englishman a combination of qualities , a modesty , an independence , a responsibility , a repose , combined with an absence of everything calculated to call a blush into the cheek of a young person , which one would seek in vain among the Nations of the Earth . '
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 60]: Having delivered this little summary , Mr Podsnap 's face flushed , as he thought of the remote possibility of its being at all qualified by any prejudiced citizen of any other country ; and , with his favourite right-arm flourish , he put the rest of Europe and the whole of Asia , Africa , and America nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 30]: The audience were much edified by this passage of words ; and Mr Podsnap , feeling that he was in rather remarkable force to-day , became smiling and conversational .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 20]: ` Has anything more been heard , Veneering , ' he inquired , ` of the lucky legatee ? '
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 20]: ` Nothing more , ' returned Veneering , ` than that he has come into possession of the property .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 11]: I am told people now call him The Golden Dustman .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 29]: I mentioned to you some time ago , I think , that the young lady whose intended husband was murdered is daughter to a clerk of mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 71]: ` Yes , you told me that , ' said Podsnap ; ` and by-the-bye , I wish you would tell it again here , for it 's a curious coincidence -- curious that the first news of the discovery should have been brought straight to your table -LRB- when I was there -RRB- , and curious that one of your people should have been so nearly interested in it .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 8]: Just relate that , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 40]: Veneering was more than ready to do it , for he had prospered exceedingly upon the Harmon Murder , and had turned the social distinction it conferred upon him to the account of making several dozen of bran-new bosom-friends .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 19]: Indeed , such another lucky hit would almost have set him up in that way to his satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 42]: So , addressing himself to the most desirable of his neighbours , while Mrs Veneering secured the next most desirable , he plunged into the case , and emerged from it twenty minutes afterwards with a Bank Director in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 32]: In the mean time , Mrs Veneering had dived into the same waters for a wealthy Ship-Broker , and had brought him up , safe and sound , by the hair .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 36]: Then Mrs Veneering had to relate , to a larger circle , how she had been to see the girl , and how she was really pretty , and -LRB- considering her station -RRB- presentable .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 55]: And this she did with such a successful display of her eight aquiline fingers and their encircling jewels , that she happily laid hold of a drifting General Officer , his wife and daughter , and not only restored their animation which had become suspended , but made them lively friends within an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 48]: Although Mr Podsnap would in a general way have highly disapproved of Bodies in rivers as ineligible topics with reference to the cheek of the young person , he had , as one may say , a share in this affair which made him a part proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 30]: As its returns were immediate , too , in the way of restraining the company from speechless contemplation of the wine-coolers , it paid , and he was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 62]: And now the haunch of mutton vapour-bath having received a gamey infusion , and a few last touches of sweets and coffee , was quite ready , and the bathers came ; but not before the discreet automaton had got behind the bars of the piano music-desk , and there presented the appearance of a captive languishing in a rosewood jail .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 43]: And who now so pleasant or so well assorted as Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle , he all sparkle , she all gracious contentment , both at occasional intervals exchanging looks like partners at cards who played a game against All England .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 27]: There was not much youth among the bathers , but there was no youth -LRB- the young person always excepted -RRB- in the articles of Podsnappery .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 78]: Bald bathers folded their arms and talked to Mr Podsnap on the hearthrug ; sleek-whiskered bathers , with hats in their hands , lunged at Mrs Podsnap and retreated ; prowling bathers , went about looking into ornamental boxes and bowls as if they had suspicions of larceny on the part of the Podsnaps , and expected to find something they had lost at the bottom ; bathers of the gentler sex sat silently comparing ivory shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 59]: All this time and always , poor little Miss Podsnap , whose tiny efforts -LRB- if she had made any -RRB- were swallowed up in the magnificence of her mother 's rocking , kept herself as much out of sight and mind as she could , and appeared to be counting on many dismal returns of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 24]: It was somehow understood , as a secret article in the state proprieties of Podsnappery that nothing must be said about the day .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 34]: Consequently this young damsel 's nativity was hushed up and looked over , as if it were agreed on all hands that it would have been better that she had never been born .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 72]: The Lammles were so fond of the dear Veneerings that they could not for some time detach themselves from those excellent friends ; but at length , either a very open smile on Mr Lammle 's part , or a very secret elevation of one of his gingerous eyebrows -- certainly the one or the other -- seemed to say to Mrs Lammle , ` Why do n't you play ? '
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 23]: And so , looking about her , she saw Miss Podsnap , and seeming to say responsively , ` That card ? '
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 16]: and to be answered , ` Yes , ' went and sat beside Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 15]: Mrs Lammle was overjoyed to escape into a corner for a little quiet talk .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 20]: It promised to be a very quiet talk , for Miss Podsnap replied in a flutter , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 19]: Indeed , it 's very kind of you , but I am afraid I DO N'T talk . '
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 19]: ` Let us make a beginning , ' said the insinuating Mrs Lammle , with her best smile .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 10]: I am afraid you 'll find me very dull .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 5]: But Ma talks ! '
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 28]: That was plainly to be seen , for Ma was talking then at her usual canter , with arched head and mane , opened eyes and nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 7]: ` Fond of reading perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 16]: At least I -- do n't mind that so much , ' returned Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 4]: 'M - m-m-m-music .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 22]: So insinuating was Mrs Lammle that she got half a dozen ms into the word before she got it out . '
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 11]: I have n't nerve to play even if I could .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 4]: Ma plays . '
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 32]: -LRB- At exactly the same canter , and with a certain flourishing appearance of doing something , Ma did , in fact , occasionally take a rock upon the instrument . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 8]: ` Of course you like dancing ? '
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 13]: ` Oh no , I do n't , ' said Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 3]: ` No ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 6]: With your youth and attractions ?
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 11]: Truly , my dear , you surprise me ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 50]: I ca n't say , ' observed Miss Podsnap , after hesitating considerably , and stealing several timid looks at Mrs Lammle 's carefully arranged face , ` how I might have liked it if I had been a -- you wo n't mention it , WILL you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 4]: ` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 3]: Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 10]: ` No , I am sure you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 22]: I ca n't say then how I should have liked it , if I had been a chimney-sweep on May-day . '
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 4]: ` Gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 10]: was the exclamation which amazement elicited from Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 6]: I knew you 'd wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 11]: But you wo n't mention it , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 44]: ` Upon my word , my love , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` you make me ten times more desirous , now I talk to you , to know you well than I was when I sat over yonder looking at you .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 9]: How I wish we could be real friends !
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 7]: Try me as a real friend .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 35]: Do n't fancy me a frumpy old married woman , my dear ; I was married but the other day , you know ; I am dressed as a bride now , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 5]: About the chimney-sweeps ? '
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 5]: Ma 'll hear . '
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 11]: ` She ca n't hear from where she sits . '
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 20]: ` Do n't you be too sure of that , ' said Miss Podsnap , in a lower voice .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 16]: ` Well , what I mean is , that they seem to enjoy it . '
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 19]: ` And that perhaps you would have enjoyed it , if you had been one of them ? '
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 5]: Miss Podsnap nodded significantly .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 10]: ` Then you do n't enjoy it now ? '
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 7]: ` How is it possible ? '
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 4]: said Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 9]: ` Oh it is such a dreadful thing !
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 21]: If I was wicked enough -- and strong enough -- to kill anybody , it should be my partner . '
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 27]: This was such an entirely new view of the Terpsichorean art as socially practised , that Mrs Lammle looked at her young friend in some astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 23]: Her young friend sat nervously twiddling her fingers in a pinioned attitude , as if she were trying to hide her elbows .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 22]: But this latter Utopian object -LRB- in short sleeves -RRB- always appeared to be the great inoffensive aim of her existence .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 10]: ` It sounds horrid , do n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 9]: said Miss Podsnap , with a penitential face .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 20]: Mrs Lammle , not very well knowing what to answer , resolved herself into a look of smiling encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 23]: ` But it is , and it always has been , ' pursued Miss Podsnap , ` such a trial to me !
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 6]: I so dread being awful .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 6]: And it is so awful !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 35]: No one knows what I suffered at Madame Sauteuse 's , where I learnt to dance and make presentation-curtseys , and other dreadful things -- or at least where they tried to teach me .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 6]: Ma can do it . '
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 21]: ` At any rate , my love , ' said Mrs Lammle , soothingly , ` that 's over . '
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 21]: ` Yes , it 's over , ' returned Miss Podsnap , ` but there 's nothing gained by that .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 11]: It 's worse here , than at Madame Sauteuse 's .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 29]: Ma was there , and Ma 's here ; but Pa was n't there , and company was n't there , and there were not real partners there .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 12]: Oh there 's Ma speaking to the man at the piano !
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 9]: Oh there 's Ma going up to somebody !
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 12]: Oh I know she 's going to bring him to me !
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 13]: Oh please do n't , please do n't , please do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 11]: Oh keep away , keep away , keep away ! '
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 20]: These pious ejaculations Miss Podsnap uttered with her eyes closed , and her head leaning back against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 39]: But the Ogre advanced under the pilotage of Ma , and Ma said , ` Georgiana , Mr Grompus , ' and the Ogre clutched his victim and bore her off to his castle in the top couple .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 77]: Then the discreet automaton who had surveyed his ground , played a blossomless tuneless ` set , ' and sixteen disciples of Podsnappery went through the figures of -- 1 , Getting up at eight and shaving close at a quarter past -- 2 , Breakfasting at nine -- 3 , Going to the City at ten -- 4 , Coming home at half-past five -- 5 , Dining at seven , and the grand chain .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 49]: While these solemnities were in progress , Mr Alfred Lammle -LRB- most loving of husbands -RRB- approached the chair of Mrs Alfred Lammle -LRB- most loving of wives -RRB- , and bending over the back of it , trifled for some few seconds with Mrs Lammle 's bracelet .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 45]: Slightly in contrast with this brief airy toying , one might have noticed a certain dark attention in Mrs Lammle 's face as she said some words with her eyes on Mr Lammle 's waistcoat , and seemed in return to receive some lesson .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 13]: But it was all done as a breath passes from a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 32]: And now , the grand chain riveted to the last link , the discreet automaton ceased , and the sixteen , two and two , took a walk among the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 82]: And herein the unconsciousness of the Ogre Grompus was pleasantly conspicuous ; for , that complacent monster , believing that he was giving Miss Podsnap a treat , prolonged to the utmost stretch of possibility a peripatetic account of an archery meeting ; while his victim , heading the procession of sixteen as it slowly circled about , like a revolving funeral , never raised her eyes except once to steal a glance at Mrs Lammle , expressive of intense despair .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 61]: At length the procession was dissolved by the violent arrival of a nutmeg , before which the drawing-room door bounced open as if it were a cannon-ball ; and while that fragrant article , dispersed through several glasses of coloured warm water , was going the round of society , Miss Podsnap returned to her seat by her new friend .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 10]: ` Oh my goodness , ' said Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 5]: ` THAT 'S over !
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 10]: I hope you did n't look at me . '
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 8]: ` My dear , why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 13]: ` Oh I know all about myself , ' said Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 35]: ` I 'll tell you something I know about you , my dear , ' returned Mrs Lammle in her winning way , ` and that is , you are most unnecessarily shy . '
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 11]: ` Ma ai n't , ' said Miss Podsnap . '
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 5]: -- I detest you !
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 4]: Go along ! '
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 21]: This shot was levelled under her breath at the gallant Grompus for bestowing an insinuating smile upon her in passing .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 24]: ` Pardon me if I scarcely see , my dear Miss Podsnap , ' Mrs Lammle was beginning when the young lady interposed .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 34]: ` If we are going to be real friends -LRB- and I suppose we are , for you are the only person who ever proposed it -RRB- do n't let us be awful .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 14]: It 's awful enough to BE Miss Podsnap , without being called so .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 5]: Call me Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 10]: ` Dearest Georgiana , ' Mrs Lammle began again .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 9]: ` Thank you , ' said Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 31]: ` Dearest Georgiana , pardon me if I scarcely see , my love , why your mamma 's not being shy , is a reason why you should be . '
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 9]: ` Do n't you really see that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 28]: asked Miss Podsnap , plucking at her fingers in a troubled manner , and furtively casting her eyes now on Mrs Lammle , now on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 8]: ` Then perhaps it is n't ? '
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 15]: ` My dearest Georgiana , you defer much too readily to my poor opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 21]: Indeed it is not even an opinion , darling , for it is only a confession of my dullness . '
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 13]: ` Oh YOU are not dull , ' returned Miss Podsnap . '
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 17]: I am dull , but you could n't have made me talk if you were . '
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 49]: Some little touch of conscience answering this perception of her having gained a purpose , called bloom enough into Mrs Lammle 's face to make it look brighter as she sat smiling her best smile on her dear Georgiana , and shaking her head with an affectionate playfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 14]: Not that it meant anything , but that Georgiana seemed to like it .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 81]: ` What I mean is , ' pursued Georgiana , ` that Ma being so endowed with awfulness , and Pa being so endowed with awfulness , and there being so much awfulness everywhere -- I mean , at least , everywhere where I am -- perhaps it makes me who am so deficient in awfulness , and frightened at it -- I say it very badly -- I do n't know whether you can understand what I mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 7]: ` Perfectly , dearest Georgiana ! '
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 28]: Mrs Lammle was proceeding with every reassuring wile , when the head of that young lady suddenly went back against the wall again and her eyes closed .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 16]: ` Oh there 's Ma being awful with somebody with a glass in his eye !
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 11]: Oh I know she 's going to bring him here !
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 11]: Oh do n't bring him , do n't bring him !
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 13]: Oh he 'll be my partner with his glass in his eye !
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 7]: Oh what shall I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 24]: This time Georgiana accompanied her ejaculations with taps of her feet upon the floor , and was altogether in quite a desperate condition .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 68]: But , there was no escape from the majestic Mrs Podsnap 's production of an ambling stranger , with one eye screwed up into extinction and the other framed and glazed , who , having looked down out of that organ , as if he descried Miss Podsnap at the bottom of some perpendicular shaft , brought her to the surface , and ambled off with her .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 53]: And then the captive at the piano played another ` set , ' expressive of his mournful aspirations after freedom , and other sixteen went through the former melancholy motions , and the ambler took Miss Podsnap for a furniture walk , as if he had struck out an entirely original conception .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 68]: In the mean time a stray personage of a meek demeanour , who had wandered to the hearthrug and got among the heads of tribes assembled there in conference with Mr Podsnap , eliminated Mr Podsnap 's flush and flourish by a highly unpolite remark ; no less than a reference to the circumstance that some half-dozen people had lately died in the streets , of starvation .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 7]: It was clearly ill-timed after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 12]: It was not adapted to the cheek of the young person .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 8]: It was not in good taste . '
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 16]: I do n't believe it , ' said Mr Podsnap , putting it behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 23]: The meek man was afraid we must take it as proved , because there were the Inquests and the Registrar 's returns .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 13]: ` Then it was their own fault , ' said Mr Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 13]: Veneering and other elders of tribes commended this way out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 10]: At once a short cut and a broad road .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 80]: The man of meek demeanour intimated that truly it would seem from the facts , as if starvation had been forced upon the culprits in question -- as if , in their wretched manner , they had made their weak protests against it -- as if they would have taken the liberty of staving it off if they could -- as if they would rather not have been starved upon the whole , if perfectly agreeable to all parties .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 41]: ` There is not , ' said Mr Podsnap , flushing angrily , ` there is not a country in the world , sir , where so noble a provision is made for the poor as in this country . '
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 30]: The meek man was quite willing to concede that , but perhaps it rendered the matter even worse , as showing that there must be something appallingly wrong somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 4]: said Mr Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 20]: The meek man hinted Would n't it be well to try , very seriously , to find out where ?
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 4]: said Mr Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 13]: ` Easy to say somewhere ; not so easy to say where !
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 9]: But I see what you are driving at .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 7]: I knew it from the first .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 2]: Centralization .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 5]: Never with my consent .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 4]: Not English . '
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 19]: An approving murmur arose from the heads of tribes ; as saying , ` There you have him !
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 4]: Hold him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 20]: He was not aware -LRB- the meek man submitted of himself -RRB- that he was driving at any ization .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 10]: He had no favourite ization that he knew of .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 22]: But he certainly was more staggered by these terrible occurrences than he was by names , of howsoever so many syllables .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 13]: Might he ask , was dying of destitution and neglect necessarily English ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 18]: ` You know what the population of London is , I suppose , ' said Mr Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 25]: The meek man supposed he did , but supposed that had absolutely nothing to do with it , if its laws were well administered .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 36]: ` And you know ; at least I hope you know ; ' said Mr Podsnap , with severity , ` that Providence has declared that you shall have the poor always with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: The meek man also hoped he knew that . '
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 17]: I am glad to hear it , ' said Mr Podsnap with a portentous air . '
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 7]: I am glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 15]: It will render you cautious how you fly in the face of Providence . '
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 58]: In reference to that absurd and irreverent conventional phrase , the meek man said , for which Mr Podsnap was not responsible , he the meek man had no fear of doing anything so impossible ; but -- But Mr Podsnap felt that the time had come for flushing and flourishing this meek man down for good .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 14]: So he said : ' I must decline to pursue this painful discussion .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 15]: It is not pleasant to my feelings ; it is repugnant to my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: I have said that I do not admit these things .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 25]: I have also said that if they do occur -LRB- not that I admit it -RRB- , the fault lies with the sufferers themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 42]: It is not for ME ' -- Mr Podsnap pointed ` me ' forcibly , as adding by implication though it may be all very well for YOU -- ` it is not for me to impugn the workings of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 20]: I know better than that , I trust , and I have mentioned what the intentions of Providence are .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 31]: Besides , ' said Mr Podsnap , flushing high up among his hairbrushes , with a strong consciousness of personal affront , ` the subject is a very disagreeable one .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 14]: I will go so far as to say it is an odious one .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 45]: It is not one to be introduced among our wives and young persons , and I -- ' He finished with that flourish of his arm which added more expressively than any words , And I remove it from the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 44]: Simultaneously with this quenching of the meek man 's ineffectual fire ; Georgiana having left the ambler up a lane of sofa , in a No Thoroughfare of back drawing-room , to find his own way out , came back to Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 12]: And who should be with Mrs Lammle , but Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 5]: So fond of her !
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 11]: ` Alfred , my love , here is my friend .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 14]: Georgiana , dearest girl , you must like my husband next to me .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 19]: Mr Lammle was proud to be so soon distinguished by this special commendation to Miss Podsnap 's favour .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 27]: But if Mr Lammle were prone to be jealous of his dear Sophronia 's friendships , he would be jealous of her feeling towards Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 11]: ` Say Georgiana , darling , ' interposed his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 6]: ` Towards -- shall I ?
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 4]: -- Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 20]: Mr Lammle uttered the name , with a delicate curve of his right hand , from his lips outward .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 32]: ` For never have I known Sophronia -LRB- who is not apt to take sudden likings -RRB- so attracted and so captivated as she is by -- shall I once more ?
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: -- Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 34]: The object of this homage sat uneasily enough in receipt of it , and then said , turning to Mrs Lammle , much embarrassed : ' I wonder what you like me for !
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 9]: I am sure I ca n't think . '
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 7]: ` Dearest Georgiana , for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 9]: For your difference from all around you . '
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 4]: That may be .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 23]: For I think I like you for your difference from all around me , ' said Georgiana with a smile of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 26]: ` We must be going with the rest , ' observed Mrs Lammle , rising with a show of unwillingness , amidst a general dispersal .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: ` We are real friends , Georgiana dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 4]: ` Real . '
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 8]: ` Good night , dear girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 43]: She had established an attraction over the shrinking nature upon which her smiling eyes were fixed , for Georgiana held her hand while she answered in a secret and half-frightened tone : ` Do n't forget me when you are gone away .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 5]: And come again soon .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 22]: Charming to see Mr and Mrs Lammle taking leave so gracefully , and going down the stairs so lovingly and sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 24]: Not quite so charming to see their smiling faces fall and brood as they dropped moodily into separate corners of their little carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 24]: But to he sure that was a sight behind the scenes , which nobody saw , and which nobody was meant to see .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 48]: Certain big , heavy vehicles , built on the model of the Podsnap plate , took away the heavy articles of guests weighing ever so much ; and the less valuable articles got away after their various manners ; and the Podsnap plate was put to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 88]: As Mr Podsnap stood with his back to the drawing-room fire , pulling up his shirtcollar , like a veritable cock of the walk literally pluming himself in the midst of his possessions , nothing would have astonished him more than an intimation that Miss Podsnap , or any other young person properly born and bred , could not be exactly put away like the plate , brought out like the plate , polished like the plate , counted , weighed , and valued like the plate .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 73]: That such a young person could possibly have a morbid vacancy in the heart for anything younger than the plate , or less monotonous than the plate ; or that such a young person 's thoughts could try to scale the region bounded on the north , south , east , and west , by the plate ; was a monstrous imagination which he would on the spot have flourished into space .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 40]: This perhaps in some sort arose from Mr Podsnap 's blushing young person being , so to speak , all cheek ; whereas there is a possibility that there may be young persons of a rather more complex organization .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 44]: If Mr Podsnap , pulling up his shirt-collar , could only have beard himself called ` that fellow ' in a certain short dialogue , which passed between Mr and Mrs Lammle in their opposite corners of their little carriage , rolling home !
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 8]: ` Sophronia , are you awake ? '
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 11]: ` Am I likely to be asleep , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 14]: ` Very likely , I should think , after that fellow 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 11]: Attend to what I am going to say . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 14]: I have attended to what you have already said , have I not ?
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 10]: What else have I been doing all to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 23]: ` Attend , I tell you , ' -LRB- in a raised voice -RRB- ` to what I am going to say .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 7]: Keep close to that idiot girl .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 6]: Keep her under your thumb .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 14]: You have her fast , and you are not to let her go .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 6]: Do you hear ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 6]: I hear you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 20]: I foresee there is money to be made out of this , besides taking that fellow down a peg .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 10]: We owe each other money , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 38]: Mrs Lammle winced a little at the reminder , but only enough to shake her scents and essences anew into the atmosphere of the little carriage , as she settled herself afresh in her own dark corner .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 28]: Chapter 12 THE SWEAT OF AN HONEST MAN 'S BROW Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr Eugene Wrayburn took a coffeehouse dinner together in Mr Lightwood 's office .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 12]: They had newly agreed to set up a joint establishment together .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 44]: They had taken a bachelor cottage near Hampton , on the brink of the Thames , with a lawn , and a boat-house ; and all things fitting , and were to float with the stream through the summer and the Long Vacation .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 51]: It was not summer yet , but spring ; and it was not gentle spring ethereally mild , as in Thomson 's Seasons , but nipping spring with an easterly wind , as in Johnson 's , Jackson 's , Dickson 's , Smith 's , and Jones 's Seasons .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 20]: The grating wind sawed rather than blew ; and as it sawed , the sawdust whirled about the sawpit .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 27]: Every street was a sawpit , and there were no top-sawyers ; every passenger was an under-sawyer , with the sawdust blinding him and choking him .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 20]: That mysterious paper currency which circulates in London when the wind blows , gyrated here and there and everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 10]: Whence can it come , whither can it go ?
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 51]: It hangs on every bush , flutters in every tree , is caught flying by the electric wires , haunts every enclosure , drinks at every pump , cowers at every grating , shudders upon every plot of grass , seeks rest in vain behind the legions of iron rails .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 37]: In Paris , where nothing is wasted , costly and luxurious city though it be , but where wonderful human ants creep out of holes and pick up every scrap , there is no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 8]: There , it blows nothing but dust .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 20]: There , sharp eyes and sharp stomachs reap even the east wind , and get something out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 9]: The wind sawed , and the sawdust whirled .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 63]: The shrubs wrung their many hands , bemoaning that they had been over-persuaded by the sun to bud ; the young leaves pined ; the sparrows repented of their early marriages , like men and women ; the colours of the rainbow were discernible , not in floral spring , but in the faces of the people whom it nibbled and pinched .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 11]: And ever the wind sawed , and the sawdust whirled .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 38]: When the spring evenings are too long and light to shut out , and such weather is rife , the city which Mr Podsnap so explanatorily called London , Londres , London , is at its worst .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 55]: Such a black shrill city , combining the qualities of a smoky house and a scolding wife ; such a gritty city ; such a hopeless city , with no rent in the leaden canopy of its sky ; such a beleaguered city , invested by the great Marsh Forces of Essex and Kent .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 24]: So the two old schoolfellows felt it to be , as , their dinner done , they turned towards the fire to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 30]: Young Blight was gone , the coffeehouse waiter was gone , the plates and dishes were gone , the wine was going -- but not in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 24]: ` The wind sounds up here , ' quoth Eugene , stirring the fire , ` as if we were keeping a lighthouse .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 6]: I wish we were . '
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 11]: ` Do n't you think it would bore us ? '
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 3]: Lightwood asked .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 8]: ` Not more than any other place .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 9]: And there would be no Circuit to go .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 12]: But that 's a selfish consideration , personal to me . '
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 11]: ` And no clients to come , ' added Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 15]: ` Not that that 's a selfish consideration at all personal to ME . '
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 48]: ` If we were on an isolated rock in a stormy sea , ' said Eugene , smoking with his eyes on the fire , ` Lady Tippins could n't put off to visit us , or , better still , might put off and get swamped .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 9]: People could n't ask one to wedding breakfasts .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 19]: There would be no Precedents to hammer at , except the plain-sailing Precedent of keeping the light up .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 11]: It would be exciting to look out for wrecks . '
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 22]: ` But otherwise , ' suggested Lightwood , ` there might be a degree of sameness in the life . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 42]: I have thought of that also , ' said Eugene , as if he really had been considering the subject in its various bearings with an eye to the business ; ` but it would be a defined and limited monotony .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 8]: It would not extend beyond two people .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 39]: Now , it 's a question with me , Mortimer , whether a monotony defined with that precision and limited to that extent , might not be more endurable than the unlimited monotony of one 's fellow-creatures . '
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 29]: As Lightwood laughed and passed the wine , he remarked , ` We shall have an opportunity , in our boating summer , of trying the question . '
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 19]: ` An imperfect one , ' Eugene acquiesced , with a sigh , ` but so we shall .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 13]: I hope we may not prove too much for one another . '
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 38]: ` Now , regarding your respected father , ' said Lightwood , bringing him to a subject they had expressly appointed to discuss : always the most slippery eel of eels of subjects to lay hold of .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 19]: ` Yes , regarding my respected father , ' assented Eugene , settling himself in his arm-chair . '
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 36]: I would rather have approached my respected father by candlelight , as a theme requiring a little artificial brilliancy ; but we will take him by twilight , enlivened with a glow of Wallsend . '
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 17]: He stirred the fire again as he spoke , and having made it blaze , resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 21]: ` My respected father has found , down in the parental neighbourhood , a wife for his not-generally-respected son . '
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 9]: ` With some money , of course ? '
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 16]: ` With some money , of course , or he would not have found her .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 31]: My respected father -- let me shorten the dutiful tautology by substituting in future M. R. F. , which sounds military , and rather like the Duke of Wellington . '
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 11]: ` What an absurd fellow you are , Eugene ! '
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 9]: ` Not at all , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 92]: M. R. F. having always in the clearest manner provided -LRB- as he calls it -RRB- for his children by pre-arranging from the hour of the birth of each , and sometimes from an earlier period , what the devoted little victim 's calling and course in life should be , M. R. F. pre-arranged for myself that I was to be the barrister I am -LRB- with the slight addition of an enormous practice , which has not accrued -RRB- , and also the married man I am not . '
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 10]: ` The first you have often told me . '
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 9]: ` The first I have often told you .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 18]: Considering myself sufficiently incongruous on my legal eminence , I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 14]: You know M. R. F. , but not as well as I do .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 16]: If you knew him as well as I do , he would amuse you . '
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 7]: ` Filially spoken , Eugene ! '
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 19]: ` Perfectly so , believe me ; and with every sentiment of affectionate deference towards M. R. F .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 12]: But if he amuses me , I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 51]: When my eldest brother was born , of course the rest of us knew -LRB- I mean the rest of us would have known , if we had been in existence -RRB- that he was heir to the Family Embarrassments -- we call it before the company the Family Estate .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 31]: But when my second brother was going to be born by-and-by , `` this , '' says M. R. F. , `` is a little pillar of the church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 16]: WAS born , and became a pillar of the church ; a very shaky one .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 34]: My third brother appeared , considerably in advance of his engagement to my mother ; but M. R. F. , not at all put out by surprise , instantly declared him a Circumnavigator .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 11]: Was pitch-forked into the Navy , but has not circumnavigated .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 16]: I announced myself and was disposed of with the highly satisfactory results embodied before you .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 25]: When my younger brother was half an hour old , it was settled by M. R. F. that he should have a mechanical genius .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 4]: And so on .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 11]: Therefore I say that M. R. F. amuses me . '
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 8]: ` Touching the lady , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 21]: ` There M. R. F. ceases to be amusing , because my intentions are opposed to touching the lady . '
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 7]: ` Do you know her ? '
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 7]: ` Not in the least . '
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 9]: ` Had n't you better see her ? '
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 11]: ` My dear Mortimer , you have studied my character .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 11]: Could I possibly go down there , labelled `` ELIGIBLE .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 12]: ON VIEW , '' and meet the lady , similarly labelled ?
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 22]: Anything to carry out M. R. F. 's arrangements , I am sure , with the greatest pleasure -- except matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 6]: Could I possibly support it ?
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 13]: I , so soon bored , so constantly , so fatally ? '
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 12]: ` But you are not a consistent fellow , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 24]: ` In susceptibility to boredom , ' returned that worthy , ' I assure you I am the most consistent of mankind . '
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 21]: ` Why , it was but now that you were dwelling in the advantages of a monotony of two . '
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 5]: ` In a lighthouse .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 9]: Do me the justice to remember the condition .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 5]: In a lighthouse . '
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 66]: Mortimer laughed again , and Eugene , having laughed too for the first time , as if he found himself on reflection rather entertaining , relapsed into his usual gloom , and drowsily said , as he enjoyed his cigar , ` No , there is no help for it ; one of the prophetic deliveries of M. R. F. must for ever remain unfulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 15]: With every disposition to oblige him , he must submit to a failure . '
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 22]: It had grown darker as they talked , and the wind was sawing and the sawdust was whirling outside paler windows .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 25]: The underlying churchyard was already settling into deep dim shade , and the shade was creeping up to the housetops among which they sat .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 18]: ` As if , ' said Eugene , ` as if the churchyard ghosts were rising . '
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 57]: He had walked to the window with his cigar in his mouth , to exalt its flavour by comparing the fireside with the outside , when he stopped midway on his return to his arm-chair , and said : ` Apparently one of the ghosts has lost its way , and dropped in to be directed .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 6]: Look at this phantom ! '
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 51]: Lightwood , whose back was towards the door , turned his head , and there , in the darkness of the entry , stood a something in the likeness of a man : to whom he addressed the not irrelevant inquiry , ` Who the devil are you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 29]: I ask your pardons , Governors , ' replied the ghost , in a hoarse double-barrelled whisper , ` but might either on you be Lawyer Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 13]: ` What do you mean by not knocking at the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 4]: demanded Mortimer . '
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 28]: I ask your pardons , Governors , ' replied the ghost , as before , ` but probable you was not aware your door stood open . '
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 7]: ` What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 30]: Hereunto the ghost again hoarsely replied , in its double-barrelled manner , ' I ask your pardons , Governors , but might one on you be Lawyer Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 14]: ` One of us is , ' said the owner of that name .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 23]: ` All right , Governors Both , ' returned the ghost , carefully closing the room door ; '' tickler business . '
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 5]: Mortimer lighted the candles .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 51]: They showed the visitor to be an illlooking visitor with a squinting leer , who , as he spoke , fumbled at an old sodden fur cap , formless and mangey , that looked like a furry animal , dog or cat , puppy or kitten , drowned and decaying .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 13]: ` Now , ' said Mortimer , ` what is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 30]: ` Governors Both , ' returned the man , in what he meant to be a wheedling tone , ` which on you might be Lawyer Lightwood ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 4]: I am . '
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 38]: ` Lawyer Lightwood , ' ducking at him with a servile air , ' I am a man as gets my living , and as seeks to get my living , by the sweat of my brow .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 30]: Not to risk being done out of the sweat of my brow , by any chances , I should wish afore going further to be swore in . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 12]: I am not a swearer in of people , man . '
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 18]: The visitor , clearly anything but reliant on this assurance , doggedly muttered ` Alfred David . '
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 7]: ` Is that your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 3]: asked Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 5]: ` My name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 4]: returned the man .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 12]: ` No ; I want to take a Alfred David . '
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 16]: -LRB- Which Eugene , smoking and contemplating him , interpreted as meaning Affidavit . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 28]: I tell you , my good fellow , ' said Lightwood , with his indolent laugh , ` that I have nothing to do with swearing . '
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 17]: ` He can swear AT you , ' Eugene explained ; ` and so can I .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 10]: But we ca n't do more for you . '
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 46]: Much discomfited by this information , the visitor turned the drowned dog or cat , puppy or kitten , about and about , and looked from one of the Governors Both to the other of the Governors Both , while he deeply considered within himself .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 14]: At length he decided : ` Then I must be took down . '
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 3]: asked Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 8]: ` Here , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 7]: ` In pen and ink . '
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 13]: ` First , let us know what your business is about . '
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 39]: ` It 's about , ' said the man , taking a step forward , dropping his hoarse voice , and shading it with his hand , ` it 's about from five to ten thousand pound reward .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 7]: That 's what it 's about .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 5]: It 's about Murder .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 8]: That 's what it 's about . '
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 6]: ` Come nearer the table .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 3]: Sit down .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 9]: Will you have a glass of wine ? '
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 22]: ` Yes , I will , ' said the man ; ` and I do n't deceive you , Governors . '
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 5]: It was given him .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 35]: Making a stiff arm to the elbow , he poured the wine into his mouth , tilted it into his right cheek , as saying , ` What do you think of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 19]: tilted it into his left cheek , as saying , ` What do YOU think of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 18]: jerked it into his stomach , as saying , ` What do YOU think of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 21]: To conclude , smacked his lips , as if all three replied , ` We think well of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 7]: ` Will you have another ? '
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 21]: ` Yes , I will , ' he repeated , ` and I do n't deceive you , Governors . '
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 7]: And also repeated the other proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 14]: ` Now , ' began Lightwood , ` what 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 21]: ` Why , there you 're rather fast , Lawyer Lightwood , ' he replied , in a remonstrant manner .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 9]: ` Do n't you see , Lawyer Lightwood ?
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 8]: There you 're a little bit fast .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 53]: I 'm going to earn from five to ten thousand pound by the sweat of my brow ; and as a poor man doing justice to the sweat of my brow , is it likely I can afford to part with so much as my name without its being took down ? '
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 32]: Deferring to the man 's sense of the binding powers of pen and ink and paper , Lightwood nodded acceptance of Eugene 's nodded proposal to take those spells in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 15]: Eugene , bringing them to the table , sat down as clerk or notary .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 14]: ` Now , ' said Lightwood , ` what 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 17]: But further precaution was still due to the sweat of this honest fellow 's brow . '
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 27]: I should wish , Lawyer Lightwood , ' he stipulated , ` to have that T'other Governor as my witness that what I said I said .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 20]: Consequent , will the T'other Governor be so good as chuck me his name and where he lives ? '
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 15]: Eugene , cigar in mouth and pen in hand , tossed him his card .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 29]: After spelling it out slowly , the man made it into a little roll , and tied it up in an end of his neckerchief still more slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 47]: ` Now , ' said Lightwood , for the third time , ` if you have quite completed your various preparations , my friend , and have fully ascertained that your spirits are cool and not in any way hurried , what 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 5]: ` Roger Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 4]: ` Dwelling-place ? '
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 5]: ` Lime'us Hole . '
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 6]: ` Calling or occupation ? '
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 25]: Not quite so glib with this answer as with the previous two , Mr Riderhood gave in the definition , ` Waterside character . '
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 6]: ` Anything against you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 9]: Eugene quietly put in , as he wrote .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 31]: Rather baulked , Mr Riderhood evasively remarked , with an innocent air , that he believed the T'other Governor had asked him summa ` t. ` Ever in trouble ? '
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 3]: said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 4]: ` Once . '
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 13]: -LRB- Might happen to any man , Mr Riderhood added incidentally . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 17]: ` On suspicion of -- ' ` Of seaman 's pocket , ' said Mr Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 21]: ` Whereby I was in reality the man 's best friend , and tried to take care of him . '
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 9]: ` With the sweat of your brow ? '
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 3]: asked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 12]: 'Till it poured down like rain , ' said Roger Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 29]: Eugene leaned back in his chair , and smoked with his eyes negligently turned on the informer , and his pen ready to reduce him to more writing .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 13]: Lightwood also smoked , with his eyes negligently turned on the informer .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 44]: ` Now let me be took down again , ' said Riderhood , when he had turned the drowned cap over and under , and had brushed it the wrong way -LRB- if it had a right way -RRB- with his sleeve . '
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 22]: I give information that the man that done the Harmon Murder is Gaffer Hexam , the man that found the body .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 24]: The hand of Jesse Hexam , commonly called Gaffer on the river and along shore , is the hand that done that deed .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 7]: His hand and no other . '
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 17]: The two friends glanced at one another with more serious faces than they had shown yet .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 16]: ` Tell us on what grounds you make this accusation , ' said Mortimer Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 38]: ` On the grounds , ' answered Riderhood , wiping his face with his sleeve , ` that I was Gaffer 's pardner , and suspected of him many a long day and many a dark night .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 9]: On the grounds that I knowed his ways .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 63]: On the grounds that I broke the pardnership because I see the danger ; which I warn you his daughter may tell you another story about that , for anythink I can say , but you know what it 'll be worth , for she 'd tell you lies , the world round and the heavens broad , to save her father .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 19]: On the grounds that it 's well understood along the cause'ays and the stairs that he done it .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 15]: On the grounds that he 's fell off from , because he done it .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 11]: On the grounds that I will swear he done it .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 19]: On the grounds that you may take me where you will , and get me sworn to it .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: I do n't want to back out of the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 7]: I have made up MY mind .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 5]: Take me anywheres . '
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 10]: ` All this is nothing , ' said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 4]: ` Nothing ? '
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 7]: repeated Riderhood , indignantly and amazedly .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 4]: ` Merely nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 15]: It goes to no more than that you suspect this man of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 28]: You may do so with some reason , or you may do so with no reason , but he can not be convicted on your suspicion . '
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 64]: ` Have n't I said -- I appeal to the T'other Governor as my witness -- have n't I said from the first minute that I opened my mouth in this here world-without-end-everlasting chair ' -LRB- he evidently used that form of words as next in force to an affidavit -RRB- , ` that I was willing to swear that he done it ?
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 14]: Have n't I said , Take me and get me sworn to it ?
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 7]: Do n't I say so now ?
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 10]: You wo n't deny it , Lawyer Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 29]: ` Surely not ; but you only offer to swear to your suspicion , and I tell you it is not enough to swear to your suspicion . '
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 12]: ` Not enough , ai n't it , Lawyer Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 4]: he cautiously demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 5]: ` Positively not . '
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 9]: ` And did I say it WAS enough ?
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 9]: Now , I appeal to the T'other Governor .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 4]: Now , fair !
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 6]: Did I say so ? '
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 34]: ` He certainly has not said that he had no more to tell , ' Eugene observed in a low voice without looking at him , ` whatever he seemed to imply . '
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 5]: - ` Hah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 22]: cried the informer , triumphantly perceiving that the remark was generally in his favour , though apparently not closely understanding it .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 12]: ` Fort ` nate for me I had a witness ! '
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 10]: ` Go on , then , ' said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 9]: ` Say out what you have to say .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 4]: No after-thought . '
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 9]: ` Let me be took down then ! '
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 8]: cried the informer , eagerly and anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 21]: ` Let me be took down , for by George and the Draggin I 'm a coming to it now !
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 20]: Do n't do nothing to keep back from a honest man the fruits of the sweat of his brow !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 15]: I give information , then , that he told me that he done it .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 5]: Is THAT enough ? '
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 14]: ` Take care what you say , my friend , ' returned Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 26]: ` Lawyer Lightwood , take care , you , what I say ; for I judge you 'll be answerable for follering it up ! '
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 62]: Then , slowly and emphatically beating it all out with his open right hand on the palm of his left ; ` I , Roger Riderhood , Lime'us Hole , Waterside character , tell you , Lawyer Lightwood , that the man Jesse Hexam , commonly called upon the river and along-shore Gaffer , told me that he done the deed .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 17]: What 's more , he told me with his own lips that he done the deed .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 12]: What 's more , he said that he done the deed .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 7]: And I 'll swear it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 9]: ` Where did he tell you so ? '
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 79]: ` Outside , ' replied Riderhood , always beating it out , with his head determinedly set askew , and his eyes watchfully dividing their attention between his two auditors , ` outside the door of the Six Jolly Fellowships , towards a quarter after twelve o'clock at midnight -- but I will not in my conscience undertake to swear to so fine a matter as five minutes -- on the night when he picked up the body .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 9]: The Six Jolly Fellowships wo n't run away .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 24]: If it turns out that he war n't at the Six Jolly Fellowships that night at midnight , I 'm a liar . '
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 7]: ` What did he say ? '
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 19]: ` I 'll tell you -LRB- take me down , T'other Governor , I ask no better -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 10]: He come out first ; I come out last .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 37]: I might be a minute arter him ; I might be half a minute , I might be a quarter of a minute ; I can not swear to that , and therefore I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 15]: That 's knowing the obligations of a Alfred David , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 6]: ` Go on . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 10]: I found him a waiting to speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 44]: He says to me , `` Rogue Riderhood '' -- for that 's the name I 'm mostly called by -- not for any meaning in it , for meaning it has none , but because of its being similar to Roger . '
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 7]: ` Never mind that . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 33]: Scuse ME , Lawyer Lightwood , it 's a part of the truth , and as such I do mind it , and I must mind it and I will mind it .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 19]: `` Rogue Riderhood , '' he says , `` words passed betwixt us on the river tonight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 8]: Which they had ; ask his daughter !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 33]: `` I threatened you , '' he says , `` to chop you over the fingers with my boat 's stretcher , or take a aim at your brains with my boathook .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 38]: I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in tow , as if you was suspicious , and on accounts of your holding on to the gunwale of my boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 13]: I says to him , `` Gaffer , I know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 50]: He says to me , `` Rogue Riderhood , you are a man in a dozen '' -- I think he said in a score , but of that I am not positive , so take the lowest figure , for precious be the obligations of a Alfred David .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 32]: `` And , '' he says , `` when your fellow-men is up , be it their lives or be it their watches , sharp is ever the word with you .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 5]: Had you suspicions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 18]: I says , `` Gaffer , I had ; and what 's more , I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 14]: He falls a shaking , and he says , `` Of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 9]: I says , `` Of foul play . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 17]: He falls a shaking worse , and he says , `` There WAS foul play then .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 7]: I done it for his money .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 6]: Do n't betray me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 10]: Those were the words as ever he used . '
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 17]: There was a silence , broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 31]: An opportunity which the informer improved by smearing himself all over the head and neck and face with his drowned cap , and not at all improving his own appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 5]: ` What more ? '
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 3]: asked Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 11]: ` Of him , d'ye mean , Lawyer Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 8]: ` Of anything to the purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 33]: ` Now , I 'm blest if I understand you , Governors Both , ' said the informer , in a creeping manner : propitiating both , though only one had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 3]: ` What ?
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 6]: Ai n't THAT enough ? '
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 21]: ` Did you ask him how he did it , where he did it , when he did it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 10]: ` Far be it from me , Lawyer Lightwood !
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 39]: I was so troubled in my mind , that I would n't have knowed more , no , not for the sum as I expect to earn from you by the sweat of my brow , twice told !
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 9]: I had put an end to the pardnership .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 6]: I had cut the connexion .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 30]: I could n't undo what was done ; and when he begs and prays , `` Old pardner , on my knees , do n't split upon me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 21]: I only makes answer `` Never speak another word to Roger Riderhood , nor look him in the face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 7]: and I shuns that man . '
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 50]: Having given these words a swing to make them mount the higher and go the further , Rogue Riderhood poured himself out another glass of wine unbidden , and seemed to chew it , as , with the halfemptied glass in his hand , he stared at the candles .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 21]: Mortimer glanced at Eugene , but Eugene sat glowering at his paper , and would give him no responsive glance .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 27]: Mortimer again turned to the informer , to whom he said : ` You have been troubled in your mind a long time , man ? '
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 23]: Giving his wine a final chew , and swallowing it , the informer answered in a single word : ` Hages ! '
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 33]: ` When all that stir was made , when the Government reward was offered , when the police were on the alert , when the whole country rang with the crime ! '
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 5]: said Mottimer , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 4]: ` Hah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 17]: Mr Riderhood very slowly and hoarsely chimed in , with several retrospective nods of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 11]: ` War n't I troubled in my mind then ! '
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 34]: ` When conjecture ran wild , when the most extravagant suspicions were afloat , when half a dozen innocent people might have been laid by the heels any hour in the day ! '
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: said Mortimer , almost warming .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 4]: ` Hah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 8]: Mr Riderhood chimed in , as before .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 13]: ` War n't I troubled in my mind through it all ! '
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 39]: ` But he had n't , ' said Eugene , drawing a lady 's head upon his writing-paper , and touching it at intervals , ` the opportunity then of earning so much money , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 11]: ` The T'other Governor hits the nail , Lawyer Lightwood !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 7]: It was that as turned me .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 25]: I had many times and again struggled to relieve myself of the trouble on my mind , but I could n't get it off .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 53]: I had once very nigh got it off to Miss Abbey Potterson which keeps the Six Jolly Fellowships -- there is the ` ouse , it wo n't run away , -- there lives the lady , she ai n't likely to be struck dead afore you get there -- ask her !
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 8]: -- but I could n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 44]: At last , out comes the new bill with your own lawful name , Lawyer Lightwood , printed to it , and then I asks the question of my own intellects , Am I to have this trouble on my mind for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 8]: Am I never to throw it off ?
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 14]: Am I always to think more of Gaffer than of my own self ?
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 15]: If he 's got a daughter , ai n't I got a daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 7]: ` And echo answered -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 4]: Eugene suggested . '
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 15]: `` You have , '' ' said Mr Riderhood , in a firm tone .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 13]: ` Incidentally mentioning , at the same time , her age ? '
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 3]: inquired Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 5]: ` Yes , governor .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 4]: Two-and-twenty last October .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 13]: And then I put it to myself , `` Regarding the money .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 8]: It is a pot of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 21]: For it IS a pot , ' said Mr Riderhood , with candour , ` and why deny it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 4]: ` Hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 9]: from Eugene as he touched his drawing . '
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 56]: `` It is a pot of money ; but is it a sin for a labouring man that moistens every crust of bread he earns , with his tears -- or if not with them , with the colds he catches in his head -- is it a sin for that man to earn it ?
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 9]: Say there is anything again earning it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 30]: This I put to myself strong , as in duty bound ; `` how can it be said without blaming Lawyer Lightwood for offering it to be earned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 10]: And was it for ME to blame Lawyer Lightwood ?
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 3]: No . '
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 11]: ` Certainly not , Governor , ' Mr Riderhood acquiesced .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 31]: ` So I made up my mind to get my trouble off my mind , and to earn by the sweat of my brow what was held out to me .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 19]: And what 's more , he added , suddenly turning bloodthirsty , ' I mean to have it !
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 38]: And now I tell you , once and away , Lawyer Lightwood , that Jesse Hexam , commonly called Gaffer , his hand and no other , done the deed , on his own confession to me .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 14]: And I give him up to you , and I want him took .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 4]: This night ! '
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 63]: After another silence , broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate , which attracted the informer 's attention as if it were the chinking of money , Mortimer Lightwood leaned over his friend , and said in a whisper : ' I suppose I must go with this fellow to our imperturbable friend at the police-station . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 16]: I suppose , ' said Eugene , ` there is no help for it . '
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 8]: ` Do you believe him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 9]: I believe him to be a thorough rascal .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 19]: But he may tell the truth , for his own purpose , and for this occasion only . '
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 9]: ` It does n't look like it . '
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: ` HE does n't , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 16]: ` But neither is his late partner , whom he denounces , a prepossessing person .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 10]: The firm are cut-throat Shepherds both , in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 10]: I should like to ask him one thing . '
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 35]: The subject of this conference sat leering at the ashes , trying with all his might to overhear what was said , but feigning abstraction as the ` Governors Both ' glanced at him .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 22]: ` You mentioned -LRB- twice , I think -RRB- a daughter of this Hexam 's , ' said Eugene , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 18]: ` You do n't mean to imply that she had any guilty knowledge of the crime ? '
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 35]: The honest man , after considering -- perhaps considering how his answer might affect the fruits of the sweat of his brow -- replied , unreservedly , ` No , I do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 9]: ` And you implicate no other person ? '
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 23]: ` It ai n't what I implicate , it 's what Gaffer implicated , ' was the dogged and determined answer . '
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 21]: I do n't pretend to know more than that his words to me was , `` I done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 7]: Those was his words . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 14]: I must see this out , Mortimer , ' whispered Eugene , rising .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 7]: ` How shall we go ? '
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 21]: ` Let us walk , ' whispered Lightwood , ` and give this fellow time to think of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 19]: Having exchanged the question and answer , they prepared themselves for going out , and Mr Riderhood rose .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 40]: While extinguishing the candles , Lightwood , quite as a matter of course took up the glass from which that honest gentleman had drunk , and coolly tossed it under the grate , where it fell shivering into fragments .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 22]: ` Now , if you will take the lead , ' said Lightwood , ` Mr Wrayburn and I will follow .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 11]: You know where to go , I suppose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 9]: I suppose I do , Lawyer Lightwood . '
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 8]: ` Take the lead , then . '
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 61]: The waterside character pulled his drowned cap over his ears with both hands , and making himself more round-shouldered than nature had made him , by the sullen and persistent slouch with which he went , went down the stairs , round by the Temple Church , across the Temple into Whitefriars , and so on by the waterside streets .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 13]: ` Look at his hang-dog air , ' said Lightwood , following .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 14]: ` It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air , ' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 9]: ` He has undeniable intentions that way . '
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 8]: They said little else as they followed .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 32]: He went on before them as an ugly Fate might have done , and they kept him in view , and would have been glad enough to lose sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 18]: But on he went before them , always at the same distance , and the same rate .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 31]: Aslant against the hard implacable weather and the rough wind , he was no more to be driven back than hurried forward , but held on like an advancing Destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 32]: There came , when they were about midway on their journey , a heavy rush of hail , which in a few minutes pelted the streets clear , and whitened them .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 7]: It made no difference to him .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 29]: A man 's life being to be taken and the price of it got , the hailstones to arrest the purpose must lie larger and deeper than those .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 36]: He crnshed through them , leaving marks in the fastmelting slush that were mere shapeless holes ; one might have fancied , following , that the very fashion of humanity had departed from his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 33]: The blast went by , and the moon contended with the fast-flying clouds , and the wild disorder reigning up there made the pitiful little tumults in the streets of no account .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 55]: It was not that the wind swept all the brawlers into places of shelter , as it had swept the hail still lingering in heaps wherever there was refuge for it ; but that it seemed as if the streets were absorbed by the sky , and the night were all in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 36]: ` If he has had time to think of it , ' said Eugene , he has not had time to think better of it -- or differently of it , if that 's better .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 31]: There is no sign of drawing back in him ; and as I recollect this place , we must be close upon the corner where we alighted that night . '
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 55]: In fact , a few abrupt turns brought them to the river side , where they had slipped about among the stones , and where they now slipped more ; the wind coming against them in slants and flaws , across the tide and the windings of the river , in a furious way .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 39]: With that habit of getting under the lee of any shelter which waterside characters acquire , the waterside character at present in question led the way to the leeside of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters before he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 13]: ` Look round here , Lawyer Lightwood , at them red curtains .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 17]: It 's the Fellowships , the ` ouse as I told you would n't run away .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 7]: And has it run away ? '
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 25]: Not showing himself much impressed by this remarkable confirmation of the informer 's evidence , Lightwood inquired what other business they had there ? '
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 45]: I wished you to see the Fellowships for yourself , Lawyer Lightwood , that you might judge whether I 'm a liar ; and now I 'll see Gaffer 's window for myself , that we may know whether he 's at home . '
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 7]: With that , he crept away .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 10]: ` He 'll come back , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 3]: murmured Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 3]: ` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 10]: and go through with it , ' murmured Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 10]: He came back after a very short interval indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 11]: ` Gaffer 's out , and his boat 's out .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 12]: His daughter 's at home , sitting alooking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 13]: But there 's some supper getting ready , so Gaffer 's expected .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 15]: I can find what move he 's upon , easy enough , presently . '
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 54]: Then he beckoned and led the way again , and they came to the police-station , still as clean and cool and steady as before , saving that the flame of its lamp -- being but a lamp-flame , and only attached to the Force as an outsider -- flickered in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 15]: Also , within doors , Mr Inspector was at his studies as of yore .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 19]: He recognized the friends the instant they reappeared , but their reappearance had no effect on his composure .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 60]: Not even the circumstance that Riderhood was their conductor moved him , otherwise than that as he took a dip of ink he seemed , by a settlement of his chin in his stock , to propound to that personage , without looking at him , the question , ` What have YOU been up to , last ? '
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 16]: Mortimer Lightwood asked him , would he be so good as look at those notes ?
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 5]: Handing him Eugene 's .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 42]: Having read the first few lines , Mr Inspector mounted to that -LRB- for him -RRB- extraordinary pitch of emotion that he said , ` Does either of you two gentlemen happen to have a pinch of snuff about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 17]: Finding that neither had , he did quite as well without it , and read on .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 8]: ` Have you heard these read ? '
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 8]: he then demanded of the honest man .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 9]: ` Then you had better hear them . '
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 11]: And so read them aloud , in an official manner .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 24]: ` Are these notes correct , now , as to the information you bring here and the evidence you mean to give ? '
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 9]: he asked , when he had finished reading .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 4]: ` They are .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 15]: They are as correct , ' returned Mr Riderhood , ` as I am .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 11]: I ca n't say more than that for 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 17]: ` I 'll take this man myself , sir , ' said Mr Inspector to Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 10]: Then to Riderhood , ` Is he at home ?
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 4]: Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 5]: What 's he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 16]: You have made it your business to know all ahout him , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 22]: Riderhood said what he did know , and promised to find out in a few minutes what he did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 22]: ` Stop , ' said Mr Inspector ; ` not till I tell you : We must n't look like business .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 22]: Would you two gentlemen object to making a pretence of taking a glass of something in my company at the Fellowships ?
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 9]: Well-conducted house , and highly respectable landlady . '
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 32]: They replied that they would be happy to substitute a reality for the pretence , which , in the main , appeared to be as one with Mr Inspector 's meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 31]: ` Very good , ' said he , taking his hat from its peg , and putting a pair of handcuffs in his pocket as if they were his gloves .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 4]: ` Reserve ! '
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 3]: Reserve saluted .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 9]: ` You know where to find me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 4]: Reserve again saluted .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 31]: ` Riderhood , when you have found out concerning his coming home , come round to the window of Cosy , tap twice at it , and wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 5]: Now , gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 30]: As the three went out together , and Riderhood slouched off from under the trembling lamp his separate way , Lightwood asked the officer what he thought of this ?
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 30]: Mr Inspector replied , with due generality and reticence , that it was always more likely that a man had done a bad thing than that he had n't .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 26]: That he himself had several times ` reckoned up ' Gaffer , but had never been able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 14]: That if this story was true , it was only in part true .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 40]: That the two men , very shy characters , would have been jointly and pretty equally ` in it ; ' but that this man had ` spotted ' the other , to save himself and get the money .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 32]: ` And I think , ' added Mr Inspector , in conclusion , ` that if all goes well with him , he 's in a tolerable way of getting it .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 20]: But as this is the Fellowships , gentlemen , where the lights are , I recommend dropping the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 38]: You ca n't do better than be interested in some lime works anywhere down about Northfleet , and doubtful whether some of your lime do n't get into bad company as it comes up in barges . '
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 6]: ` You hear Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 7]: said Lightwood , over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 9]: ` You are deeply interested in lime . '
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 23]: ` Without lime , ' returned that unmoved barrister-at-law , ` my existence would be unilluminated by a ray of hope . '
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 64]: Chapter 13 TRACKING THE BIRD OF PREY The two lime merchants , with their escort , entered the dominions of Miss Abbey Potterson , to whom their escort -LRB- presenting them and their pretended business over the half-door of the bar , in a confidential way -RRB- preferred his figurative request that ' a mouthful of fire ' might be lighted in Cosy .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 30]: Always well disposed to assist the constituted authorities , Miss Abbey bade Bob Gliddery attend the gentlemen to that retreat , and promptly enliven it with fire and gaslight .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 48]: Of this commission the bare-armed Bob , leading the way with a flaming wisp of paper , so speedily acquitted himself , that Cosy seemed to leap out of a dark sleep and embrace them warmly , the moment they passed the lintels of its hospitable door .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 20]: ` They burn sherry very well here , ' said Mr Inspector , as a piece of local intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 10]: ` Perhaps you gentlemen might like a bottle ? '
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 34]: The answer being By all means , Bob Gliddery received his instructions from Mr Inspector , and departed in a becoming state of alacrity engendered by reverence for the majesty of the law .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 64]: ` It 's a certain fact , ' said Mr Inspector , ` that this man we have received our information from , ' indicating Riderhood with his thumb over his shoulder , ` has for some time past given the other man a bad name arising out of your lime barges , and that the other man has been avoided in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 17]: I do n't say what it means or proves , but it 's a certain fact .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 37]: I had it first from one of the opposite sex of my acquaintance , ' vaguely indicating Miss Abbey with his thumb over his shoulder , ` down away at a distance , over yonder . '
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 14]: Then probably Mr Inspector was not quite unprepared for their visit that evening ?
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 3]: Lightwood hinted .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 20]: ` Well you see , ' said Mr Inspector , ` it was a question of making a move .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 16]: It 's of no use moving if you do n't know what your move is .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 8]: You had better by far keep still .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 27]: In the matter of this lime , I certainly had an idea that it might lie betwixt the two men ; I always had that idea .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 22]: Still I was forced to wait for a start , and I was n't so lucky as to get a start .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 34]: This man that we have received our information from , has got a start , and if he do n't meet with a check he may make the running and come in first .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 31]: There may turn out to be something considerable for him that comes in second , and I do n't mention who may or who may not try for that place .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 26]: There 's duty to do , and I shall do it , under any circumstances ; to the best of my judgment and ability . '
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 12]: ` Speaking as a shipper of lime -- ' began Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 22]: ` Which no man has a better right to do than yourself , you know , ' said Mr Inspector . '
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 109]: I hope not , ' said Eugene ; ` my father having been a shipper of lime before me , and my grandfather before him -- in fact we having been a family immersed to the crowns of our heads in lime during several generations -- I beg to observe that if this missing lime could be got hold of without any young female relative of any distinguished gentleman engaged in the lime trade -LRB- which I cherish next to my life -RRB- being present , I think it might be a more agreeable proceeding to the assisting bystanders , that is to say , lime-burners . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 22]: I also , ' said Lightwood , pushing his friend aside with a laugh , ` should much prefer that . '
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 23]: ` It shall be done , gentlemen , if it can be done conveniently , ' said Mr Inspector , with coolness .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 16]: ` There is no wish on my part to cause any distress in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 10]: Indeed , I am sorry for that quarter . '
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 13]: ` There was a boy in that quarter , ' remarked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 7]: ` He is still there ? '
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 9]: ` No , ' said Mr Inspector . '
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 6]: He has quitted those works .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 7]: He is otherwise disposed of . '
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 9]: ` Will she be left alone then ? '
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 3]: asked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 15]: ` She will be left , ' said Mr Inspector , ` alone . '
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 12]: Bob 's reappearance with a steaming jug broke off the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 35]: But although the jug steamed forth a delicious perfume , its contents had not received that last happy touch which the surpassing finish of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters imparted on such momentous occasions .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 56]: Bob carried in his left hand one of those iron models of sugar-loaf hats , before mentioned , into which he emptied the jug , and the pointed end of which he thrust deep down into the fire , so leaving it for a few moments while he disappeared and reappeared with three bright drinking-glasses .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 57]: Placing these on the table and bending over the fire , meritoriously sensible of the trying nature of his duty , he watched the wreaths of steam , until at the special instant of projection he caught up the iron vessel and gave it one delicate twirl , causing it to send forth one gentle hiss .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 43]: Then he restored the contents to the jug ; held over the steam of the jug , each of the three bright glasses in succession ; finally filled them all , and with a clear conscience awaited the applause of his fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 19]: It was bestowed -LRB- Mr Inspector having proposed as an appropriate sentiment ` The lime trade ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 17]: and Bob withdrew to report the commendations of the guests to Miss Abbey in the bar .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 37]: It may be here in confidence admitted that , the room being close shut in his absence , there had not appeared to be the slightest reason for the elaborate maintenance of this same lime fiction .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 31]: Only it had been regarded by Mr Inspector as so uncommonly satisfactory , and so fraught with mysterious virtues , that neither of his clients had presumed to question it .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 12]: Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 21]: Mr Inspector , hastily fortifying himself with another glass , strolled out with a noiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 17]: As one might go to survey the weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 18]: ` This is becoming grim , Mortimer , ' said Eugene , in a low voice . '
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 7]: I do n't like this . '
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 7]: ` Nor I ' said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 6]: ` Shall we go ? '
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 8]: ` Being here , let us stay .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 14]: You ought to see it out , and I wo n't leave you .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 14]: Besides , that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 27]: It was little more than a glimpse we had of her that last time , and yet I almost see her waiting by the fire to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 19]: Do you feel like a dark combination of traitor and pickpocket when you think of that girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 7]: ` Rather , ' returned Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 5]: ` Do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 6]: ` Very much so . '
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 9]: Their escort strolled back again , and reported .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 182]: Divested of its various lime-lights and shadows , his report went to the effect that Gaffer was away in his boat , supposed to be on his old look-out ; that he had been expected last high-water ; that having missed it for some reason or other , he was not , according to his usual habits at night , to be counted on before next high-water , or it might be an hour or so later ; that his daughter , surveyed through the window , would seem to be so expecting him , for the supper was not cooking , but set out ready to be cooked ; that it would be highwater at about one , and that it was now barely ten ; that there was nothing to be done but watch and wait ; that the informer was keeping watch at the instant of that present reporting , but that two heads were better than one -LRB- especially when the second was Mr Inspector 's -RRB- ; and that the reporter meant to share the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 71]: And forasmuch as crouching under the lee of a hauled-up boat on a night when it blew cold and strong , and when the weather was varied with blasts of hail at times , might be wearisome to amateurs , the reporter closed with the recommendation that the two gentlemen should remain , for a while at any rate , in their present quarters , which were weather-tight and warm .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 24]: They were not inclined to dispute this recommendation , but they wanted to know where they could join the watchers when so disposed .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 47]: Rather than trust to a verbal description of the place , which might mislead , Eugene -LRB- with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had -RRB- would go out with Mr Inspector , note the spot , and come back .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 81]: On the shelving bank of the river , among the slimy stones of a causeway -- not the special causeway of the Six Jolly Fellowships , which had a landing-place of its own , but another , a little removed , and very near to the old windmill which was the denounced man 's dwelling-place -- were a few boats ; some , moored and already beginning to float ; others , hauled up above the reach of the tide .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 11]: Under one of these latter , Eugene 's companion disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 52]: And when Eugene had observed its position with reference to the other boats , and had made sure that he could not miss it , he turned his eyes upon the building where , as he had been told , the lonely girl with the dark hair sat by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 13]: He could see the light of the fire shining through the window .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 9]: Perhaps it drew him on to look in .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 10]: Perhaps he had come out with the express intention .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 55]: That part of the bank having rank grass growing on it , there was no difficulty in getting close , without any noise of footsteps : it was but to scramble up a ragged face of pretty hard mud some three or four feet high and come upon the grass and to the window .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 9]: He came to the window by that means .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 12]: She had no other light than the light of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 8]: The unkindled lamp stood on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 19]: She sat on the ground , looking at the brazier , with her face leaning on her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 37]: There was a kind of film or flicker on her face , which at first he took to be the fitful firelight ; but , on a second look , he saw that she was weeping .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 19]: A sad and solitary spectacle , as shown him by the rising and the falling of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 28]: It was a little window of but four pieces of glass , and was not curtained ; he chose it because the larger window near it was .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 23]: It showed him the room , and the bills upon the wall respecting the drowned people starting out and receding by turns .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 16]: But he glanced slightly at them , though he looked long and steadily at her .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 38]: A deep rich piece of colour , with the brown flush of her cheek and the shining lustre of her hair , though sad and solitary , weeping by the rising and the falling of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 4]: She started up .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 36]: He had been so very still that he felt sure it was not he who had disturbed her , so merely withdrew from the window and stood near it in the shadow of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 22]: She opened the door , and said in an alarmed tone , ` Father , was that you calling me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 7]: And again , ` Father ! '
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 10]: And once again , after listening , ` Father !
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 11]: I thought I heard you call me twice before ! '
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 3]: No response .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 51]: As she re-entered at the door , he dropped over the bank and made his way back , among the ooze and near the hidingplace , to Mortimer Lightwood : to whom he told what he had seen of the girl , and how this was becoming very grim indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 23]: ` If the real man feels as guilty as I do , ' said Eugene , ` he is remarkably uncomfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 10]: ` Influence of secrecy , ' suggested Lightwood . '
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 30]: I am not at all obliged to it for making me Guy Fawkes in the vault and a Sneak in the area both at once , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 10]: ` Give me some more of that stuff . '
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 22]: Lightwood helped him to some more of that stuff , but it had been cooling , and did n't answer now .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 14]: ` Pooh , ' said Eugene , spitting it out among the ashes .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 10]: ` Tastes like the wash of the river . '
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 17]: ` Are you so familiar with the flavour of the wash of the river ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 6]: I seem to be to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 18]: I feel as if I had been half drowned , and swallowing a gallon of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 9]: ` Influence of locality , ' suggested Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 16]: ` You are mighty learned to-night , you and your influences , ' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 9]: ` How long shall we stay here ? '
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 8]: ` How long do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 31]: ` If I could choose , I should say a minute , ' replied Eugene , ` for the Jolly Fellowship Porters are not the jolliest dogs I have known .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 22]: But I suppose we are best here until they turn us out with the other suspicious characters , at midnight . '
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 15]: Thereupon he stirred the fire , and sat down on one side of it .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 13]: It struck eleven , and he made believe to compose himself patiently .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 79]: But gradually he took the fidgets in one leg , and then in the other leg , and then in one arm , and then in the other arm , and then in his chin , and then in his back , and then in his forehead , and then in his hair , and then in his nose ; and then he stretched himself recumbent on two chairs , and groaned ; and then he started up .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 11]: ` Invisible insects of diabolical activity swarm in this place .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 8]: I am tickled and twitched all over .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 25]: Mentally , I have now committed a burglary under the meanest circumstances , and the myrmidons of justice are at my heels . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 39]: I am quite as bad , ' said Lightwood , sitting up facing him , with a tumbled head ; after going through some wonderful evolutions , in which his head had been the lowest part of him .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 10]: ` This restlessness began with me , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 19]: All the time you were out , I felt like Gulliver with the Lilliputians firing upon him . '
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 8]: ` It wo n't do , Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 18]: We must get into the air ; we must join our dear friend and brother , Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 10]: And let us tranquillize ourselves by making a compact .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 24]: Next time -LRB- with a view to our peace of mind -RRB- we 'll commit the crime , instead of taking the criminal .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 5]: You swear it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 4]: ` Certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 3]: ` Sworn !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 6]: Let Tippins look to it .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 7]: Her life 's in danger . '
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 38]: Mortimer rang the bell to pay the score , and Bob appeared to transact that business with him : whom Eugene , in his careless extravagance , asked if he would like a situation in the lime-trade ?
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 11]: ` Thankee sir , no sir , ' said Bob .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 11]: ` I 've a good sitiwation here , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 34]: ` If you change your mind at any time , ' returned Eugene , ` come to me at my works , and you 'll always find an opening in the limekiln . '
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 8]: ` Thankee sir , ' said Bob .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 21]: ` This is my partner , ' said Eugene , ` who keeps the books and attends to the wages .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 19]: A fair day 's wages for a fair day 's work is ever my partner 's motto . '
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 50]: ` And a very good ` un it is , gentlemen , ' said Bob , receiving his fee , and drawing a bow out of his head with his right hand , very much as he would have drawn a pint of beer out of the beer engine .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 27]: ` Eugene , ' Mortimer apostrophized him , laughing quite heartily when they were alone again , ` how CAN you be so ridiculous ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 18]: I am in a ridiculous humour , ' quoth Eugene ; ' I am a ridiculous fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 4]: Everything is ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 4]: Come along ! '
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 45]: It passed into Mortimer Lightwood 's mind that a change of some sort , best expressed perhaps as an intensification of all that was wildest and most negligent and reckless in his friend , had come upon him in the last half-hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 23]: Thoroughly used to him as he was , he found something new and strained in him that was for the moment perplexing .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 17]: This passed into his mind , and passed out again ; but he remembered it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 30]: ` There 's where she sits , you see , ' said Eugene , when they were standing under the bank , roared and riven at by the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 10]: ` There 's the light of her fire . '
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 14]: ` I 'll take a peep through the window , ' said Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 7]: ` No , do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 7]: Eugene caught him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 10]: ` Best , not make a show of her .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 7]: Come to our honest friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 44]: He led him to the post of watch , and they both dropped down and crept under the lee of the boat ; a better shelter than it had seemed before , being directly contrasted with the blowing wind and the bare night .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 7]: ` Mr Inspector at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 3]: whispered Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: ` Here I am , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 15]: ` And our friend of the perspiring brow is at the far corner there ?
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 2]: Good .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 4]: Anything happened ? '
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 27]: ` His daughter has been out , thinking she heard him calling , unless it was a sign to him to keep out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 6]: It might have been . '
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 18]: ` It might have been Rule Britannia , ' muttered Eugene , ` but it was n't .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: Mortimer ! '
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 4]: ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 10]: -LRB- On the other side of Mr Inspector . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 10]: ` Two burglaries now , and a forgery ! '
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 14]: With this indication of his depressed state of mind , Eugene fell silent .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 9]: They were all silent for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 28]: As it got to be flood-tide , and the water came nearer to them , noises on the river became more frequent , and they listened more .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 48]: To the turning of steampaddles , to the clinking of iron chain , to the creaking of blocks , to the measured working of oars , to the occasional violent barking of some passing dog on shipboard , who seemed to scent them lying in their hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 60]: The night was not so dark but that , besides the lights at bows and mastheads gliding to and fro , they could discern some shadowy bulk attached ; and now and then a ghostly lighter with a large dark sail , like a warning arm , would start up very near them , pass on , and vanish .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 25]: At this time of their watch , the water close to them would be often agitated by some impulsion given it from a distance .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 52]: Often they believed this beat and plash to be the boat they lay in wait for , running in ashore ; and again and again they would have started up , but for the immobility with which the informer , well used to the river , kept quiet in his place .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 41]: The wind carried away the striking of the great multitude of city church clocks , for those lay to leeward of them ; but there were bells to windward that told them of its being One -- Two -- Three .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 47]: Without that aid they would have known how the night wore , by the falling of the tide , recorded in the appearance of an everwidening black wet strip of shore , and the emergence of the paved causeway from the river , foot by foot .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 17]: As the time so passed , this slinking business became a more and more precarious one .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 24]: It would seem as if the man had had some intimation of what was in hand against him , or had taken fright ?
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 22]: His movements might have been planned to gain for him , in getting beyond their reach , twelve hours ' advantage ?
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 37]: The honest man who had expended the sweat of his brow became uneasy , and began to complain with bitterness of the proneness of mankind to cheat him -- him invested with the dignity of Labour !
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 19]: Their retreat was so chosen that while they could watch the river , they could watch the house .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 18]: No one had passed in or out , since the daughter thought she heard the father calling .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 11]: No one could pass in or out without being seen .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 23]: ` But it will be light at five , ' said Mr Inspector , ` and then WE shall be seen . '
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 16]: ` Look here , ' said Riderhood , ` what do you say to this ?
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 25]: He may have been lurking in and out , and just holding his own betwixt two or three bridges , for hours back . '
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 9]: ` What do you make of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 4]: said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 5]: Stoical , but contradictory .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 12]: ` He may be doing so at this present time . '
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 9]: ` What do you make of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 4]: said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 13]: ` My boat 's among them boats here at the cause'ay . '
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 11]: ` And what do you make of your boat ? '
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 4]: said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 14]: ` What if I put off in her and take a look round ?
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 12]: I know his ways , and the likely nooks he favours .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 24]: I know where he 'd be at such a time of the tide , and where he 'd be at such another time .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 7]: Ai n't I been his pardner ?
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 6]: None of you need show .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 6]: None of you need stir .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 23]: I can shove her off without help ; and as to me being seen , I 'm about at all times . '
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 18]: ` You might have given a worse opinion , ' said Mr Inspector , after brief consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 5]: ` Try it . '
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 5]: ` Stop a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 6]: Let 's work it out .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 19]: If I want you , I 'll drop round under the Fellowships and tip you a whistle . '
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 58]: ` If I might so far presume as to offer a suggestion to my honourable and gallant friend , whose knowledge of naval matters far be it from me to impeach , ' Eugene struck in with great deliberation , ` it would be , that to tip a whistle is to advertise mystery and invite speculation .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 37]: My honourable and gallant friend will , I trust , excuse me , as an independent member , for throwing out a remark which I feel to be due to this house and the country . '
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 12]: ` Was that the T'other Governor , or Lawyer Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 3]: asked Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 17]: For , they spoke as they crouched or lay , without seeing one another 's faces .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 69]: ` In reply to the question put by my honourable and gallant friend , ' said Eugene , who was lying on his back with his hat on his face , as an attitude highly expressive of watchfulness , ' I can have no hesitation in replying -LRB- it not being inconsistent with the public service -RRB- that those accents were the accents of the T'other Governor . '
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 13]: ` You 've tolerable good eyes , ai n't you , Governor ?
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 12]: You 've all tolerable good eyes , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 4]: demanded the informer .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 2]: All .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 18]: ` Then if I row up under the Fellowship and lay there , no need to whistle .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 33]: You 'll make out that there 's a speck of something or another there , and you 'll know it 's me , and you 'll come down that cause'ay to me .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 4]: Understood all ? '
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 3]: Understood all .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 7]: ` Off she goes then ! '
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 39]: In a moment , with the wind cutting keenly at him sideways , he was staggering down to his boat ; in a few moments he was clear , and creeping up the river under their own shore .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 16]: Eugene had raised himself on his elbow to look into the darkness after him . '
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 38]: I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend , ' he murmured , lying down again and speaking into his hat , ` may be endowed with philanthropy enough to turn bottom-upward and extinguish him !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 4]: -- Mortimer . '
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 6]: ` My honourable friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 13]: ` Three burglaries , two forgeries , and a midnight assassination . '
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 26]: Yet in spite of having those weights on his conscience , Eugene was somewhat enlivened by the late slight change in the circumstances of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 6]: So were his two companions .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 7]: Its being a change was everything .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 20]: The suspense seemed to have taken a new lease , and to have begun afresh from a recent date .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 8]: There was something additional to look for .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 23]: They were all three more sharply on the alert , and less deadened by the miserable influences of the place and time .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 43]: More than an hour had passed , and they were even dozing , when one of the three -- each said it was he , and he had NOT dozed -- made out Riderhood in his boat at the spot agreed on .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 16]: They sprang up , came out from their shelter , and went down to him .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 41]: When he saw them coming , he dropped alongside the causeway ; so that they , standing on the causeway , could speak with him in whispers , under the shadowy mass of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 10]: ` Blest if I can make it out ! '
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 7]: said he , staring at them .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 5]: ` Make what out ?
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 6]: Have you seen him ? '
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 7]: ` What HAVE you seen ? '
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 3]: asked Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 12]: For , he was staring at them in the strangest way .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 8]: ` I 've seen his boat . '
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 5]: ` Not empty ? '
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 5]: ` Yes , empty .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 8]: And what 's more , -- adrift .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 11]: And what 's more , -- with one scull gone .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 20]: And what 's more , -- with t ` other scull jammed in the thowels and broke short off .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 21]: And what 's more , -- the boat 's drove tight by the tide ` atwixt two tiers of barges .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 20]: And what 's more , -- he 's in luck again , by George if he ai n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 69]: Chapter 14 THE BIRD OF PREY BROUGHT DOWN Cold on the shore , in the raw cold of that leaden crisis in the fourand-twenty hours when the vital force of all the noblest and prettiest things that live is at its lowest , the three watchers looked each at the blank faces of the other two , and all at the blank face of Riderhood in his boat .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 16]: ` Gaffer 's boat , Gaffer in luck again , and yet no Gaffer ! '
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 7]: So spake Riderhood , staring disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 22]: As if with one accord , they all turned their eyes towards the light of the fire shining through the window .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 6]: It was fainter and duller .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 35]: Perhaps fire , like the higher animal and vegetable life it helps to sustain , has its greatest tendency towards death , when the night is dying and the day is not yet born .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 43]: ` If it was me that had the law of this here job in hand , ' growled Riderhood with a threatening shake of his head , ` blest if I would n't lay hold of HER , at any rate ! '
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 13]: ` Ay , but it is not you , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 32]: With something so suddenly fierce in him that the informer returned submissively ; ` Well , well , well , t ` other governor , I did n't say it was .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 6]: A man may speak . '
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 11]: ` And vermin may be silent , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 9]: ` Hold your tongue , you water-rat ! '
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 26]: Astonished by his friend 's unusual heat , Lightwood stared too , and then said : ` What can have become of this man ? '
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 5]: ` Ca n't imagine .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 6]: Unless he dived overboard . '
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 20]: The informer wiped his brow ruefully as he said it , sitting in his boat and always staring disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 9]: ` Did you make his boat fast ? '
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 11]: ` She 's fast enough till the tide runs back .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 10]: I could n't make her faster than she is .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 12]: Come aboard of mine , and see for your own-selves . '
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 74]: There was a little backwardness in complying , for the freight looked too much for the boat ; but on Riderhood 's protesting ` that he had had half a dozen , dead and alive , in her afore now , and she was nothing deep in the water nor down in the stern even then , to speak of ; ' they carefully took their places , and trimmed the crazy thing .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 12]: While they were doing so , Riderhood still sat staring disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 4]: ` All right .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 4]: Give way ! '
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 3]: said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 8]: ` Give way , by George ! '
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 7]: repeated Riderhood , before shoving off .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 26]: ` If he 's gone and made off any how Lawyer Lightwood , it 's enough to make me give way in a different manner .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 10]: But he always WAS a cheat , con-found him !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 10]: He always was a infernal cheat , was Gaffer .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 10]: Nothing straightfor ` ard , nothing on the square .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 6]: So mean , so underhanded .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 16]: Never going through with a thing , nor carrying it out like a man ! '
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 3]: ` Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 3]: Steady ! '
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 58]: cried Eugene -LRB- he had recovered immediately on embarking -RRB- , as they bumped heavily against a pile ; and then in a lower voice reversed his late apostrophe by remarking -LRB- ' I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend may be endowed with philanthropy enough not to turn bottom-upward and extinguish us ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 4]: Steady , steady !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 5]: Sit close , Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 6]: Here 's the hail again .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 19]: See how it flies , like a troop of wild cats , at Mr Riderhood 's eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 54]: Indeed he had the full benefit of it , and it so mauled him , though he bent his head low and tried to present nothing but the mangy cap to it , that he dropped under the lee of a tier of shipping , and they lay there until it was over .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 39]: The squall had come up , like a spiteful messenger before the morning ; there followed in its wake a ragged tear of light which ripped the dark clouds until they showed a great grey hole of day .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 35]: They were all shivering , and everything about them seemed to be shivering ; the river itself ; craft , rigging , sails , such early smoke as there yet was on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 38]: Black with wet , and altered to the eye by white patches of hail and sleet , the huddled buildings looked lower than usual , as if they were cowering , and had shrunk with the cold .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 48]: Very little life was to be seen on either bank , windows and doors were shut , and the staring black and white letters upon wharves and warehouses ` looked , ' said Eugene to Mortimer , ` like inscriptions over the graves of dead businesses . '
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 63]: As they glided slowly on , keeping under the shore and sneaking in and out among the shipping by back-alleys of water , in a pilfering way that seemed to be their boatman 's normal manner of progression , all the objects among which they crept were so huge in contrast with their wretched boat , as to threaten to crush it .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 36]: Not a ship 's hull , with its rusty iron links of cable run out of hawseholes long discoloured with the iron 's rusty tears , but seemed to be there with a fell intention .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 16]: Not a figure-head but had the menacing look of bursting forward to run them down .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 50]: Not a sluice gate , or a painted scale upon a post or wall , showing the depth of water , but seemed to hint , like the dreadfully facetious Wolf in bed in Grandmamma 's cottage , ` That 's to drown YOU in , my dears ! '
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 31]: Not a lumbering black barge , with its cracked and blistered side impending over them , but seemed to suck at the river with a thirst for sucking them under .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 48]: And everything so vaunted the spoiling influences of water -- discoloured copper , rotten wood , honeycombed stone , green dank deposit -- that the after-consequences of being crushed , sucked under , and drawn down , looked as ugly to the imagination as the main event .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 45]: Some half-hour of this work , and Riderhood unshipped his sculls , stood holding on to a barge , and hand over hand long-wise along the barge 's side gradually worked his boat under her head into a secret little nook of scummy water .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 36]: And driven into that nook , and wedged as he had described , was Gaffer 's boat ; that boat with the stain still in it , bearing some resemblance to a muffled human form .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 10]: ` Now tell me I 'm a liar ! '
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 5]: said the honest man .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 27]: -LRB- ` With a morbid expectation , ' murmured Eugene to Lightwood , ` that somebody is always going to tell him the truth . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 13]: ` This is Hexam 's boat , ' said Mr Inspector . '
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 6]: I know her well . '
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 7]: ` Look at the broken scull .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 9]: Look at the t ` other scull gone .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 9]: NOW tell me I am a liar ! '
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 5]: said the honest man .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 7]: Mr Inspector stepped into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: Eugene and Mortimer looked on .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 6]: ` And see now ! '
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 18]: added Riderhood , creeping aft , and showing a stretched rope made fast there and towing overboard .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 13]: ` Did n't I tell you he was in luck again ? '
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: ` Haul in , ' said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 11]: ` Easy to say haul in , ' answered Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 6]: ` Not so easy done .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 12]: His luck 's got fouled under the keels of the barges .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 13]: I tried to haul in last time , but I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 9]: See how taut the line is ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 12]: I must have it up , ' said Mr Inspector . '
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 16]: I am going to take this boat ashore , and his luck along with it .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 5]: Try easy now . '
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 15]: He tried easy now ; but the luck resisted ; would n't come . '
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 20]: I mean to have it , and the boat too , ' said Mr Inspector , playing the line .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 10]: But still the luck resisted ; would n't come .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 8]: ` Take care , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 5]: ` You 'll disfigure .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 7]: Or pull asunder perhaps . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 27]: I am not going to do either , not even to your Grandmother , ' said Mr Inspector ; ` but I mean to have it .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 37]: he added , at once persuasively and with authority to the hidden object in the water , as he played the line again ; ` it 's no good this sort of game , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 5]: You MUST come up .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 7]: I mean to have you . '
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 29]: There was so much virtue in this distinctly and decidedly meaning to have it , that it yielded a little , even while the line was played . '
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 26]: I told you so , ' quoth Mr Inspector , pulling off his outer coat , and leaning well over the stern with a will .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 38]: It was an awful sort of fishing , but it no more disconcerted Mr Inspector than if he had been fishing in a punt on a summer evening by some soothing weir high up the peaceful river .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 45]: After certain minutes , and a few directions to the rest to ` ease her a little for ` ard , ' and ` now ease her a trifle aft , ' and the like , he said composedly , ` All clear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 10]: and the line and the boat came free together .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 43]: Accepting Lightwood 's proffered hand to help him up , he then put on his coat , and said to Riderhood , ` Hand me over those spare sculls of yours , and I 'll pull this in to the nearest stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 21]: Go ahead you , and keep out in pretty open water , that I may n't get fouled again . '
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 21]: His directions were obeyed , and they pulled ashore directly ; two in one boat , two in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 44]: ` Now , ' said Mr Inspector , again to Riderhood , when they were all on the slushy stones ; ` you have had more practice in this than I have had , and ought to be a better workman at it .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 13]: Undo the towrope , and we 'll help you haul in . '
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 7]: Riderhood got into the boat accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 49]: It appeared as if he had scarcely had a moment 's time to touch the rope or look over the stern , when he came scrambling back , as pale as the morning , and gasped out : ` By the Lord , he 's done me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 4]: they all demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 24]: He pointed behind him at the boat , and gasped to that degree that he dropped upon the stones to get his breath .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 6]: ` Gaffer 's done me .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 5]: It 's Gaffer ! '
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 11]: They ran to the rope , leaving him gasping there .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 35]: Soon , the form of the bird of prey , dead some hours , lay stretched upon the shore , with a new blast storming at it and clotting the wet hair with hailstones .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 8]: Father , was that you calling me ?
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 2]: Father !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 10]: I thought I heard you call me twice before !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 15]: Words never to be answered , those , upon the earth-side of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 50]: The wind sweeps jeeringly over Father , whips him with the frayed ends of his dress and his jagged hair , tries to turn him where he lies stark on his back , and force his face towards the rising sun , that he may be shamed the more .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 34]: A lull , and the wind is secret and prying with him ; lifts and lets falls a rag ; hides palpitating under another rag ; runs nimbly through his hair and beard .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 11]: Then , in a rush , it cruelly taunts him .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 8]: Father , was that you calling me ?
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 10]: Was it you , the voiceless and the dead ?
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 14]: Was it you , thus buffeted as you lie here in a heap ?
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 19]: Was it you , thus baptized unto Death , with these flying impurities now flung upon your face ?
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 6]: Why not speak , Father ?
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 15]: Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here , is your own shape .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 12]: Did you never see such a shape soaked into your boat ?
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 4]: Speak , Father .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 13]: Speak to us , the winds , the only listeners left you !
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 53]: ` Now see , ' said Mr Inspector , after mature deliberation : kneeling on one knee beside the body , when they had stood looking down on the drowned man , as he had many a time looked down on many another man : ` the way of it was this .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 19]: Of course you gentlemen hardly failed to observe that he was towing by the neck and arms . '
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 13]: They had helped to release the rope , and of course not .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 44]: ` And you will have observed before , and you will observe now , that this knot , which was drawn chock-tight round his neck by the strain of his own arms , is a slip-knot ' : holding it up for demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 3]: Plain enough .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 21]: ` Likewise you will have observed how he had run the other end of this rope to his boat . '
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 18]: It had the curves and indentations in it still , where it had been twined and bound .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 18]: ` Now see , ' said Mr Inspector , ` see how it works round upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 35]: It 's a wild tempestuous evening when this man that was , ' stooping to wipe some hailstones out of his hair with an end of his own drowned jacket , ' -- there !
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 30]: Now he 's more like himself ; though he 's badly bruised , -- when this man that was , rows out upon the river on his usual lay .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 9]: He carries with him this coil of rope .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 10]: He always carries with him this coil of rope .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 12]: It 's as well known to me as he was himself .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 10]: Sometimes it lay in the bottom of his boat .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 9]: Sometimes he hung it loose round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 13]: He was a light-dresser was this man ; -- you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 45]: lifting the loose neckerchief over his breast , and taking the opportunity of wiping the dead lips with it -- ` and when it was wet , or freezing , or blew cold , he would hang this coil of line round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 6]: Last evening he does this .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 4]: Worse for him !
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 16]: He dodges about in his boat , does this man , till he gets chilled .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 21]: His hands , ' taking up one of them , which dropped like a leaden weight , ` get numbed .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 14]: He sees some object that 's in his way of business , floating .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 8]: He makes ready to secure that object .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 35]: He unwinds the end of his coil that he wants to take some turns on in his boat , and he takes turns enough on it to secure that it sha n't run out .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 10]: He makes it too secure , as it happens .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 15]: He is a little longer about this than usual , his hands being numbed .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 13]: His object drifts up , before he is quite ready for it .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 74]: He catches at it , thinks he 'll make sure of the contents of the pockets anyhow , in case he should be parted from it , bends right over the stern , and in one of these heavy squalls , or in the cross-swell of two steamers , or in not being quite prepared , or through all or most or some , gets a lurch , overbalances and goes head-foremost overboard .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 3]: Now see !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 14]: He can swim , can this man , and instantly he strikes out .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 20]: But in such striking-out he tangles his arms , pulls strong on the slip-knot , and it runs home .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 34]: The object he had expected to take in tow , floats by , and his own boat tows him dead , to where we found him , all entangled in his own line .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 12]: You 'll ask me how I make out about the pockets ?
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 14]: First , I 'll tell you more ; there was silver in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 7]: How do I make that out ?
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 4]: Simple and satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 8]: Because he 's got it here . '
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 10]: The lecturer held up the tightly clenched right hand .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 11]: ` What is to be done with the remains ? '
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 3]: asked Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 69]: ` If you would n't object to standing by him half a minute , sir , ' was the reply , ` I 'll find the nearest of our men to come and take charge of him ; -- I still call it HIM , you see , ' said Mr Inspector , looking back as he went , with a philosophical smile upon the force of habit .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 33]: ` Eugene , ' said Lightwood and was about to add ` we may wait at a little distance , ' when turning his head he found that no Eugene was there .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 9]: He raised his voice and called ` Eugene !
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 3]: Holloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 5]: But no Eugene replied .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 11]: It was broad daylight now , and he looked about .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 9]: But no Eugene was in all the view .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 26]: Mr Inspector speedily returning down the wooden stairs , with a police constable , Lightwood asked him if he had seen his friend leave them ?
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 21]: Mr Inspector could not exactly say that he had seen him go , but had noticed that he was restless .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 13]: ` Singular and entertaining combination , sir , your friend . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 33]: I wish it had not been a part of his singular entertaining combination to give me the slip under these dreary circumstances at this time of the morning , ' said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 10]: ` Can we get anything hot to drink ? '
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 7]: We could , and we did .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 9]: In a public-house kitchen with a large fire .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 13]: We got hot brandy and water , and it revived us wonderfully .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 65]: Mr Inspector having to Mr Riderhood announced his official intention of ` keeping his eye upon him ' , stood him in a corner of the fireplace , like a wet umbrella , and took no further outward and visible notice of that honest man , except ordering a separate service of brandy and water for him : apparently out of the public funds .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 152]: As Mortimer Lightwood sat before the blazing fire , conscious of drinking brandy and water then and there in his sleep , and yet at one and the same time drinking burnt sherry at the Six Jolly Fellowships , and lying under the boat on the river shore , and sitting in the boat that Riderhood rowed , and listening to the lecture recently concluded , and having to dine in the Temple with an unknown man , who described himself as M. H. F. Eugene Gaffer Harmon , and said he lived at Hailstorm , -- as he passed through these curious vicissitudes of fatigue and slumber , arranged upon the scale of a dozen hours to the second , he became aware of answering aloud a communication of pressing importance that had never been made to him , and then turned it into a cough on beholding Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 29]: For , he felt , with some natural indignation , that that functionary might otherwise suspect him of having closed his eyes , or wandered in his attention .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 15]: ` Here just before us , you see , ' said Mr Inspector . '
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 10]: I see , ' said Lightwood , with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 28]: ` And had hot brandy and water too , you see , ' said Mr Inspector , ` and then cut off at a great rate . '
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 4]: ` Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 3]: said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 9]: ` Your friend , you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 11]: I know , ' he replied , again with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 97]: After hearing , in a mist through which Mr Inspector loomed vague and large , that the officer took upon himself to prepare the dead man 's daughter for what had befallen in the night , and generally that he took everything upon himself , Mortimer Lightwood stumbled in his sleep to a cab-stand , called a cab , and had entered the army and committed a capital military offence and been tried by court martial and found guilty and had arranged his affairs and been marched out to be shot , before the door banged .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 62]: Hard work rowing the cab through the City to the Temple , for a cup of from five to ten thousand pounds value , given by Mr Boffin ; and hard work holding forth at that immeasurable length to Eugene -LRB- when he had been rescued with a rope from the running pavement -RRB- for making off in that extraordinary manner !
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 35]: But he offered such ample apologies , and was so very penitent , that when Lightwood got out of the cab , he gave the driver a particular charge to he careful of him .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 17]: Which the driver -LRB- knowing there was no other fare left inside -RRB- stared at prodigiously .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 26]: In short , the night 's work had so exhausted and worn out this actor in it , that he had become a mere somnambulist .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 26]: He was too tired to rest in his sleep , until he was even tired out of being too tired , and dropped into oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 28]: Late in the afternoon he awoke , and in some anxiety sent round to Eugene 's lodging hard by , to inquire if he were up yet ?
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 7]: Oh yes , he was up .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 10]: In fact , he had not been to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 6]: He had just come home .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 14]: And here he was , close following on the heels of the message .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 13]: ` Why what bloodshot , draggled , dishevelled spectacle is this ! '
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 3]: cried Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 10]: ` Are my feathers so very much rumpled ? '
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 10]: said Eugene , coolly going up to the looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 7]: They ARE rather out of sorts .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 3]: But consider .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 7]: Such a night for plumage ! '
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 6]: ` Such a night ? '
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 3]: repeated Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 10]: ` What became of you in the morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 46]: ` My dear fellow , ' said Eugene , sitting on his bed , ' I felt that we had bored one another so long , that an unbroken continuance of those relations must inevitably terminate in our flying to opposite points of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 14]: I also felt that I had committed every crime in the Newgate Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 16]: So , for mingled considerations of friendship and felony , I took a walk . '
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 22]: Chapter 15 TWO NEW SERVANTS Mr and Mrs Boffin sat after breakfast , in the Bower , a prey to prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 9]: Mr Boffin 's face denoted Care and Complication .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 40]: Many disordered papers were before him , and he looked at them about as hopefully as an innocent civilian might look at a crowd of troops whom he was required at five minutes ' notice to manoeuvre and review .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 66]: He had been engaged in some attempts to make notes of these papers ; but being troubled -LRB- as men of his stamp often are -RRB- with an exceedingly distrustful and corrective thumb , that busy member had so often interposed to smear his notes , that they were little more legible than the various impressions of itself ; which blurred his nose and forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 32]: It is curious to consider , in such a case as Mr Boffin 's , what a cheap article ink is , and how far it may be made to go .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 63]: As a grain of musk will scent a drawer for many years , and still lose nothing appreciable of its original weight , so a halfpenny-worth of ink would blot Mr Boffin to the roots of his hair and the calves of his legs , without inscribing a line on the paper before him , or appearing to diminish in the inkstand .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 44]: Mr Boffin was in such severe literary difficulties that his eyes were prominent and fixed , and his breathing was stertorous , when , to the great relief of Mrs Boffin , who observed these symptoms with alarm , the yard bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 9]: ` Who 's that , I wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 4]: said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 64]: Mr Boffin drew a long breath , laid down his pen , looked at his notes as doubting whether he had the pleasure of their acquaintance , and appeared , on a second perusal of their countenances , to be confirmed in his impression that he had not , when there was announced by the hammer-headed young man : ` Mr Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 4]: ` Oh indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 11]: Our and the Wilfers ' Mutual Friend , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 7]: Ask him to come in . '
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 4]: Mr Rokesmith appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 16]: ` Sit down , sir , ' said Mr Boffin , shaking hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 9]: ` Mrs Boffin you 're already acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 44]: Well , sir , I am rather unprepared to see you , for , to tell you the truth , I 've been so busy with one thing and another , that I 've not had time to turn your offer over . '
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 26]: ` That 's apology for both of us : for Mr Boffin , and for me as well , ' said the smiling Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 4]: ` But Lor !
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 12]: we can talk it over now ; ca n't us ? '
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 13]: Mr Rokesmith bowed , thanked her , and said he hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 18]: ` Let me see then , ' resumed Mr Boffin , with his hand to his chin .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 14]: ` It was Secretary that you named ; was n't it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 9]: I said Secretary , ' assented Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 74]: ` It rather puzzled me at the time , ' said Mr Boffin , ` and it rather puzzled me and Mrs Boffin when we spoke of it afterwards , because -LRB- not to make a mystery of our belief -RRB- we have always believed a Secretary to be a piece of furniture , mostly of mahogany , lined with green baize or leather , with a lot of little drawers in it .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 21]: Now , you wo n't think I take a liberty when I mention that you certainly ai n't THAT . '
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 7]: Certainly not , said Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 12]: But he had used the word in the sense of Steward .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 39]: ` Why , as to Steward , you see , ' returned Mr Boffin , with his hand still to his chin , ` the odds are that Mrs Boffin and me may never go upon the water .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 22]: Being both bad sailors , we should want a Steward if we did ; but there 's generally one provided . '
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 30]: Mr Rokesmith again explained ; defining the duties he sought to undertake , as those of general superintendent , or manager , or overlooker , or man of business .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 9]: ` Now , for instance -- come ! '
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 9]: said Mr Boffin , in his pouncing way .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 14]: ` If you entered my employment , what would you do ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 15]: I would keep exact accounts of all the expenditure you sanctioned , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: I would write your letters , under your direction .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 13]: I would transact your business with people in your pay or employment .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 34]: I would , ' with a glance and a half-smile at the table , ` arrange your papers -- ' Mr Boffin rubbed his inky ear , and looked at his wife . '
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 29]: -- And so arrange them as to have them always in order for immediate reference , with a note of the contents of each outside it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 52]: I tell you what , ' said Mr Boffin , slowly crumpling his own blotted note in his hand ; ` if you 'll turn to at these present papers , and see what you can make of 'em , I shall know better what I can make of you . '
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 6]: No sooner said than done .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 86]: Relinquishing his hat and gloves , Mr Rokesmith sat down quietly at the table , arranged the open papers into an orderly heap , cast his eyes over each in succession , folded it , docketed it on the outside , laid it in a second heap , and , when that second heap was complete and the first gone , took from his pocket a piece of string and tied it together with a remarkably dexterous hand at a running curve and a loop .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 4]: ` Very good !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 17]: Now let us hear what they 're all about ; will you be so good ? '
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 7]: John Rokesmith read his abstracts aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 8]: They were all about the new house .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 7]: Decorator 's estimate , so much .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 6]: Furniture estimate , so much .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 9]: Estimate for furniture of offices , so much .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 7]: Coach-maker 's estimate , so much .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 7]: Horse-dealer 's estimate , so much .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 7]: Harnessmaker 's estimate , so much .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 7]: Goldsmith 's estimate , so much .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 6]: Total , so very much .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 4]: Then came correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 17]: Acceptance of Mr Boffin 's offer of such a date , and to such an effect .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 16]: Rejection of Mr Boffin 's proposal of such a date and to such an effect .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 14]: Concerning Mr Boffin 's scheme of such another date to such another effect .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 5]: All compact and methodical .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 5]: ` Apple-pie order ! '
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 19]: said Mr Boffin , after checking off each inscription with his hand , like a man beating time .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 25]: ` And whatever you do with your ink , I ca n't think , for you 're as clean as a whistle after it .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 7]: Now , as to a letter .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 26]: Let 's , ' said Mr Boffin , rubbing his hands in his pleasantly childish admiration , ` let 's try a letter next . '
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 12]: ` To whom shall it be addressed , Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 3]: ` Anyone .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 3]: Yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 45]: Mr Rokesmith quickly wrote , and then read aloud : ' `` Mr Boffin presents his compliments to Mr John Rokesmith , and begs to say that he has decided on giving Mr John Rokesmith a trial in the capacity he desires to fill .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 22]: Mr Boffin takes Mr John Rokesmith at his word , in postponing to some indefinite period , the consideration of salary .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 16]: It is quite understood that Mr Boffin is in no way committed on that point .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 24]: Mr Boffin has merely to add , that he relies on Mr John Rokesmith 's assurance that he will be faithful and serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 13]: Mr John Rokesmith will please enter on his duties immediately . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 5]: Now , Noddy ! '
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 16]: cried Mrs Boffin , clapping her hands , ` That IS a good one ! '
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 39]: Mr Boffin was no less delighted ; indeed , in his own bosom , he regarded both the composition itself and the device that had given birth to it , as a very remarkable monument of human ingenuity .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 65]: ` And I tell you , my deary , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` that if you do n't close with Mr Rokesmith now at once , and if you ever go a muddling yourself again with things never meant nor made for you , you 'll have an apoplexy -- besides iron-moulding your linen -- and you 'll break my heart . '
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 35]: Mr Boffin embraced his spouse for these words of wisdom , and then , congratulating John Rokesmith on the brilliancy of his achievements , gave him his hand in pledge of their new relations .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 5]: So did Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 52]: ` Now , ' said Mr Boffin , who , in his frankness , felt that it did not become him to have a gentleman in his employment five minutes , without reposing some confidence in him , ` you must be let a little more into our affairs , Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 49]: I mentioned to you , when I made your acquaintance , or I might better say when you made mine , that Mrs Boffin 's inclinations was setting in the way of Fashion , but that I did n't know how fashionable we might or might not grow .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 20]: Mrs Boffin has carried the day , and we 're going in neck and crop for Fashion . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 27]: I rather inferred that , sir , ' replied John Rokesmith , ` from the scale on which your new establishment is to be maintained . '
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 16]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Boffin , ` it 's to be a Spanker .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 38]: The fact is , my literary man named to me that a house with which he is , as I may say , connected -- in which he has an interest -- ' ` As property ? '
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 4]: inquired John Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 22]: ` Why no , ' said Mr Boffin , ` not exactly that ; a sort of a family tie . '
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 4]: ` Association ? '
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 4]: the Secretary suggested .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 3]: ` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 26]: Anyhow , he named to me that the house had a board up , `` This Eminently Aristocratic Mansion to be let or sold . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 40]: Me and Mrs Boffin went to look at it , and finding it beyond a doubt Eminently Aristocratic -LRB- though a trifle high and dull , which after all may be part of the same thing -RRB- took it .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 40]: My literary man was so friendly as to drop into a charming piece of poetry on that occasion , in which he complimented Mrs Boffin on coming into possession of -- how did it go , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 26]: Mrs Boffin replied : ' `` The gay , the gay and festive scene , The halls , the halls of dazzling light . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 5]: ` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 30]: And it was made neater by there really being two halls in the house , a front ` un and a back ` un , besides the servants ' .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 50]: He likewise dropped into a very pretty piece of poetry to be sure , respecting the extent to which he would be willing to put himself out of the way to bring Mrs Boffin round , in case she should ever get low in her spirits in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 7]: Mrs Boffin has a wonderful memory .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 9]: Will you repeat it , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 25]: Mrs Boffin complied , by reciting the verses in which this obliging offer had been made , exactly as she had received them . '
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 37]: `` I 'll tell thee how the maiden wept , Mrs Boffin , When her true love was slain ma'am , And how her broken spirit slept , Mrs Boffin , And never woke again ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 50]: I 'll tell thee -LRB- if agreeable to Mr Boffin -RRB- how the steed drew nigh , And left his lord afar ; And if my tale -LRB- which I hope Mr Boffin might excuse -RRB- should make you sigh , I 'll strike the light guitar . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 7]: ` Correct to the letter ! '
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 18]: ` And I consider that the poetry brings us both in , in a beautiful manner . '
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 30]: The effect of the poem on the Secretary being evidently to astonish him , Mr Boffin was confirmed in his high opinion of it , and was greatly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 28]: ` Now , you see , Rokesmith , ' he went on , ' a literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- is liable to jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 33]: I shall therefore cast about for comfortable ways and means of not calling up Wegg 's jealousy , but of keeping you in your department , and keeping him in his . '
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 4]: ` Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 4]: cried Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 17]: ` What I say is , the world 's wide enough for all of us ! '
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 18]: ` So it is , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin , ` when not literary .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 7]: But when so , not so .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 31]: And I am bound to bear in mind that I took Wegg on , at a time when I had no thought of being fashionable or of leaving the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 34]: To let him feel himself anyways slighted now , would be to be guilty of a meanness , and to act like having one 's head turned by the halls of dazzling light .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 4]: Which Lord forbid !
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 14]: Rokesmith , what shall we say about your living in the house ? '
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 6]: ` In this house ? '
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 9]: I have got other plans for this house .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 6]: In the new house ? '
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 11]: ` That will be as you please , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 8]: I hold myself quite at your disposal .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 9]: You know where I live at present . '
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 26]: said Mr Boffin , after considering the point ; ` suppose you keep as you are for the present , and we 'll decide by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 24]: You 'll begin to take charge at once , of all that 's going on in the new house , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 4]: ` Most willingly .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 7]: I will begin this very day .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 8]: Will you give me the address ? '
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 15]: Mr Boffin repeated it , and the Secretary wrote it down in his pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 25]: Mrs Boffin took the opportunity of his being so engaged , to get a better observation of his face than she had yet taken .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 22]: It impressed her in his favour , for she nodded aside to Mr Boffin , ' I like him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 14]: I will see directly that everything is in train , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 5]: ` Thank ` ee .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 16]: Being here , would you care at all to look round the Bower ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 6]: I should greatly like it .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 10]: I have heard so much of its story . '
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 9]: And he and Mrs Boffin led the way .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 27]: A gloomy house the Bower , with sordid signs on it of having been , through its long existence as Harmony Jail , in miserly holding .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 22]: Bare of paint , bare of paper on the walls , bare of furniture , bare of experience of human life .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 27]: Whatever is built by man for man 's occupation , must , like natural creations , fulfil the intention of its existence , or soon perish .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 22]: This old house had wasted -- more from desuetude than it would have wasted from use , twenty years for one .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 27]: A certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life -LRB- as if they were nourished upon it -RRB- , which was very noticeable here .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 39]: The staircase , balustrades , and rails , had a spare look -- an air of being denuded to the bone -- which the panels of the walls and the jambs of the doors and windows also bore .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 53]: The scanty moveables partook of it ; save for the cleanliness of the place , the dust -- into which they were all resolving would have lain thick on the floors ; and those , both in colour and in grain , were worn like old faces that had kept much alone .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 22]: The bedroom where the clutching old man had lost his grip on life , was left as he had left it .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 30]: There was the old grisly four-post bedstead , without hangings , and with a jail-like upper rim of iron and spikes ; and there was the old patch-work counterpane .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 45]: There was the tight-clenched old bureau , receding atop like a bad and secret forehead ; there was the cumbersome old table with twisted legs , at the bed-side ; and there was the box upon it , in which the will had lain .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 36]: A few old chairs with patch-work covers , under which the more precious stuff to be preserved had slowly lost its quality of colour without imparting pleasure to any eye , stood against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 10]: A hard family likeness was on all these things .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 22]: ` The room was kept like this , Rokesmith , ' said Mr Boffin , ` against the son 's return .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 23]: In short , everything in the house was kept exactly as it came to us , for him to see and approve .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 17]: Even now , nothing is changed but our own room below-stairs that you have just left .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 37]: When the son came home for the last time in his life , and for the last time in his life saw his father , it was most likely in this room that they met . '
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 19]: As the Secretary looked all round it , his eyes rested on a side door in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 20]: ` Another staircase , ' said Mr Boffin , unlocking the door , ` leading down into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 24]: We 'll go down this way , as you may like to see the yard , and it 's all in the road .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 25]: When the son was a little child , it was up and down these stairs that he mostly came and went to his father .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 8]: He was very timid of his father .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 21]: I 've seen him sit on these stairs , in his shy way , poor child , many a time .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 20]: Mr and Mrs Boffin have comforted him , sitting with his little book on these stairs , often . '
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 11]: And his poor sister too , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 19]: ` And here 's the sunny place on the white wall where they one day measured one another .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 31]: Their own little hands wrote up their names here , only with a pencil ; but the names are here still , and the poor dears gone for ever . '
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 17]: ` We must take care of the names , old lady , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 9]: ` We must take care of the names .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 25]: They sha n't be rubbed out in our time , nor yet , if we can help it , in the time after us .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 5]: Poor little children ! '
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 8]: ` Ah , poor little children ! '
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 4]: said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 41]: They had opened the door at the bottom of the staircase giving on the yard , and they stood in the sunlight , looking at the scrawl of the two unsteady childish hands two or three steps up the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 25]: There was something in this simple memento of a blighted childhood , and in the tenderness of Mrs Boffin , that touched the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 35]: Mr Boffin then showed his new man of business the Mounds , and his own particular Mound which had been left him as his legacy under the will before he acquired the whole estate .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 34]: ` It would have been enough for us , ' said Mr Boffin , ` in case it had pleased God to spare the last of those two young lives and sorrowful deaths .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 8]: We did n't want the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 47]: At the treasures of the yard , and at the outside of the house , and at the detached building which Mr Boffin pointed out as the residence of himself and his wife during the many years of their service , the Secretary looked with interest .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 27]: It was not until Mr Boffin had shown him every wonder of the Bower twice over , that he remembered his having duties to discharge elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 19]: ` You have no instructions to give me , Mr Boffin , in reference to this place ? '
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 6]: ` Not any , Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 3]: No . '
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 19]: ` Might I ask , without seeming impertinent , whether you have any intention of selling it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 4]: ` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 32]: In remembrance of our old master , our old master 's children , and our old service , me and Mrs Boffin mean to keep it up as it stands . '
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 38]: The Secretary 's eyes glanced with so much meaning in them at the Mounds , that Mr Boffin said , as if in answer to a remark : ` Ay , ay , that 's another thing .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 19]: I may sell THEM , though I should be sorry to see the neighbourhood deprived of 'em too .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 12]: It 'll look but a poor dead flat without the Mounds .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 25]: Still I do n't say that I 'm going to keep 'em always there , for the sake of the beauty of the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 15]: There 's no hurry about it ; that 's all I say at present .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 20]: I ai n't a scholar in much , Rokesmith , but I 'm a pretty fair scholar in dust .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 33]: I can price the Mounds to a fraction , and I know how they can be best disposed of ; and likewise that they take no harm by standing where they do .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 13]: You 'll look in to-morrow , will you be so kind ? '
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 4]: ` Every day .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 24]: And the sooner I can get you into your new house , complete , the better you will be pleased , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 42]: ` Well , it ai n't that I 'm in a mortal hurry , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` only when you DO pay people for looking alive , it 's as well to know that they ARE looking alive .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 7]: Ai n't that your opinion ? '
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 4]: ` Quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 8]: replied the Secretary ; and so withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 39]: ` Now , ' said Mr Boffin to himself ; subsiding into his regular series of turns in the yard , ` if I can make it comfortable with Wegg , my affairs will be going smooth . '
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 20]: The man of low cunning had , of course , acquired a mastery over the man of high simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 16]: The mean man had , of course , got the better of the generous man .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 29]: How long such conquests last , is another matter ; that they are achieved , is every-day experience , not even to be flourished away by Podsnappery itself .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 32]: The undesigning Boffin had become so far immeshed by the wily Wegg that his mind misgave him he was a very designing man indeed in purposing to do more for Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 35]: It seemed to him -LRB- so skilful was Wegg -RRB- that he was plotting darkly , when he was contriving to do the very thing that Wegg was plotting to get him to do .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 38]: And thus , while he was mentally turning the kindest of kind faces on Wegg this morning , he was not absolutely sure but that he might somehow deserve the charge of turning his back on him .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 26]: For these reasons Mr Boffin passed but anxious hours until evening came , and with it Mr Wegg , stumping leisurely to the Roman Empire .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 48]: At about this period Mr Boffin had become profoundly interested in the fortunes of a great military leader known to him as Bully Sawyers , but perhaps better known to fame and easier of identification by the classical student , under the less Britannic name of Belisarius .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 71]: Even this general 's career paled in interest for Mr Boffin before the clearing of his conscience with Wegg ; and hence , when that literary gentleman had according to custom eaten and drunk until he was all a-glow , and when he took up his book with the usual chirping introduction , ` And now , Mr Boffin , sir , we 'll decline and we 'll fall ! '
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 5]: Mr Boffin stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 24]: ` You remember , Wegg , when I first told you that I wanted to make a sort of offer to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 23]: ` Let me get on my considering cap , sir , ' replied that gentleman , turning the open book face downward .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 18]: ` When you first told me that you wanted to make a sort of offer to me ?
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 6]: Now let me think . '
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 21]: -LRB- as if there were the least necessity -RRB- ` Yes , to be sure I do , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 6]: It was at my corner .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 6]: To be sure it was !
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 22]: You had first asked me whether I liked your name , and Candour had compelled a reply in the negative case .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 18]: I little thought then , sir , how familiar that name would come to be ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 12]: I hope it will be more familiar still , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 7]: ` Do you , Mr Boffin ?
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 9]: Much obliged to you , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 15]: Is it your pleasure , sir , that we decline and we fall ? '
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 9]: with a feint of taking up the book .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 8]: ` Not just yet awhile , Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 13]: In fact , I have got another offer to make you . '
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 26]: Mr Wegg -LRB- who had had nothing else in his mind for several nights -RRB- took off his spectacles with an air of bland surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 12]: ` And I hope you 'll like it , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 13]: ` Thank you , sir , ' returned that reticent individual . '
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 7]: I hope it may prove so .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 9]: On all accounts , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: -LRB- This , as a philanthropic aspiration . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 22]: ` What do you think , ' said Mr Boffin , ` of not keeping a stall , Wegg ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 28]: I think , sir , ' replied Wegg , ` that I should like to be shown the gentleman prepared to make it worth my while ! '
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 10]: ` Here he is , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 24]: Mr Wegg was going to say , My Benefactor , and had said My Bene , when a grandiloquent change came over him .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 10]: ` No , Mr Boffin , not you sir .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 4]: Anybody but you .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 24]: Do not fear , Mr Boffin , that I shall contaminate the premises which your gold has bought , with MY lowly pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 25]: I am aware , sir , that it would not become me to carry on my little traffic under the windows of your mansion .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 12]: I have already thought of that , and taken my measures .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 9]: No need to be bought out , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 7]: Would Stepney Fields be considered intrusive ?
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 10]: If not remote enough , I can go remoter .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 58]: In the words of the poet 's song , which I do not quite remember : Thrown on the wide world , doom 'd to wander and roam , Bereft of my parents , bereft of a home , A stranger to something and what 's his name joy , Behold little Edmund the poor Peasant boy .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 29]: -- And equally , ' said Mr Wegg , repairing the want of direct application in the last line , ` behold myself on a similar footing ! '
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 15]: ` Now , Wegg , Wegg , Wegg , ' remonstrated the excellent Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 8]: ` You are too sensitive . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 16]: I know I am , sir , ' returned Wegg , with obstinate magnanimity . '
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 7]: I am acquainted with my faults .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 12]: I always was , from a child , too sensitive . '
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 17]: ` But listen , ' pursued the Golden Dustman ; ` hear me out , Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 16]: You have taken it into your head that I mean to pension you off . '
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 16]: ` True , sir , ' returned Wegg , still with an obstinate magnanimity . '
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: I am acquainted with my faults .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 9]: Far be it from me to deny them .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 9]: I HAVE taken it into my head . '
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 9]: ` But I DO N'T mean it . '
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 18]: The assurance seemed hardly as comforting to Mr Wegg , as Mr Boffin intended it to be .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 26]: Indeed , an appreciable elongation of his visage might have been observed as he replied : ` Do n't you , indeed , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 32]: ` No , ' pursued Mr Boffin ; ` because that would express , as I understand it , that you were not going to do anything to deserve your money .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 8]: But you are ; you are . '
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 22]: ` That , sir , ' replied Mr Wegg , cheering up bravely , ` is quite another pair of shoes .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 11]: Now , my independence as a man is again elevated .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 51]: Now , I no longer Weep for the hour , When to Boffinses bower , The Lord of the valley with offers came ; Neither does the moon hide her light From the heavens to-night , And weep behind her clouds o'er any individual in the present Company 's shame .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 9]: -- Please to proceed , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 27]: ` Thank ` ee , Wegg , both for your confidence in me and for your frequent dropping into poetry ; both of which is friendly .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 33]: Well , then ; my idea is , that you should give up your stall , and that I should put you into the Bower here , to keep it for us .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 25]: It 's a pleasant spot ; and a man with coals and candles and a pound a week might be in clover here . '
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 3]: ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 55]: Would that man , sir -- we will say that man , for the purposes of argueyment ; ' Mr Wegg made a smiling demonstration of great perspicuity here ; ` would that man , sir , be expected to throw any other capacity in , or would any other capacity be considered extra ?
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 32]: Now let us -LRB- for the purposes of argueyment -RRB- suppose that man to be engaged as a reader : say -LRB- for the purposes of argunyment -RRB- in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 42]: Would that man 's pay as a reader in the evening , be added to the other amount , which , adopting your language , we will call clover ; or would it merge into that amount , or clover ? '
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 18]: ` Well , ' said Mr Boffin , ' I suppose it would be added . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 7]: I suppose it would , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 6]: You are right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 9]: Exactly my own views , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 20]: Here Wegg rose , and balancing himself on his wooden leg , fluttered over his prey with extended hand .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 8]: ` Mr Boffin , consider it done .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 11]: Say no more , sir , not a word more .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 9]: My stall and I are for ever parted .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 49]: The collection of ballads will in future be reserved for private study , with the object of making poetry tributary ' -- Wegg was so proud of having found this word , that he said it again , with a capital letter -- ` Tributary , to friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 25]: Mr Boffin , do n't allow yourself to be made uncomfortable by the pang it gives me to part from my stock and stall .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 25]: Similar emotion was undergone by my own father when promoted for his merits from his occupation as a waterman to a situation under Government .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 6]: His Christian name was Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 43]: His words at the time -LRB- I was then an infant , but so deep was their impression on me , that I committed them to memory -RRB- were : Then farewell my trim-built wherry , Oars and coat and badge farewell !
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 13]: Never more at Chelsea Ferry , Shall your Thomas take a spell !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 36]: -- My father got over it , Mr Boffin , and so shall I. ' While delivering these valedictory observations , Wegg continually disappointed Mr Boffin of his hand by flourishing it in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 47]: He now darted it at his patron , who took it , and felt his mind relieved of a great weight : observing that as they had arranged their joint affairs so satisfactorily , he would now he glad to look into those of Bully Sawyers .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 33]: Which , indeed , had been left over-night in a very unpromising posture , and for whose impending expedition against the Persians the weather had been by no means favourable all day .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 7]: Mr Wegg resumed his spectacles therefore .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 72]: But Sawyers was not to be of the party that night ; for , before Wegg had found his place , Mrs Boffin 's tread was heard upon the stairs , so unusually heavy and hurried , that Mr Boffin would have started up at the sound , anticipating some occurrence much out of the common course , even though she had not also called to him in an agitated tone .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 23]: Mr Boffin hurried out , and found her on the dark staircase , panting , with a lighted candle in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 11]: ` What 's the matter , my dear ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 19]: I do n't know ; I do n't know ; but I wish you 'd come up-stairs . '
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 36]: Much surprised , Mr Boffin went up stairs and accompanied Mrs Boffin into their own room : a second large room on the same floor as the room in which the late proprietor had died .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 30]: Mr Boffin looked all round him , and saw nothing more unusual than various articles of folded linen on a large chest , which Mrs Boffin had been sorting .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 8]: ` What is it , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 6]: Why , you 're frightened !
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 5]: YOU frightened ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 40]: I am not one of that sort certainly , ' said Mrs Boffin , as she sat down in a chair to recover herself , and took her husband 's arm ; ` but it 's very strange ! '
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 8]: ` What is , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 21]: ` Noddy , the faces of the old man and the two children are all over the house to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 5]: ` My dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 13]: But not without a certain uncomfortable sensation gliding down his back . '
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 14]: I know it must sound foolish , and yet it is so . '
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 11]: ` Where did you think you saw them ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 12]: I do n't know that I think I saw them anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 5]: I felt them . '
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 5]: ` Touched them ? '
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 6]: Felt them in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 43]: I was sorting those things on the chest , and not thinking of the old man or the children , but singing to myself , when all in a moment I felt there was a face growing out of the dark . '
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 5]: ` What face ? '
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 8]: asked her husband , looking about him .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 17]: ` For a moment it was the old man 's , and then it got younger .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 16]: For a moment it was both the children 's , and then it got older .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 18]: For a moment it was a strange face , and then it was all the faces . '
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 8]: ` And then it was gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 10]: ` Yes ; and then it was gone . '
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 10]: ` Where were you then , old lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 7]: ` Here , at the chest .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 21]: Well ; I got the better of it , and went on sorting , and went on singing to myself .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 4]: `` Lor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 23]: I says , `` I 'll think of something else -- something comfortable -- and put it out of my head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 52]: So I thought of the new house and Miss Bella Wilfer , and was thinking at a great rate with that sheet there in my hand , when all of a sudden , the faces seemed to be hidden in among the folds of it and I let it drop . '
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 24]: As it still lay on the floor where it had fallen , Mr Boffin picked it up and laid it on the chest .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 9]: ` And then you ran down stairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 13]: I thought I 'd try another room , and shake it off .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 37]: I says to myself , `` I 'll go and walk slowly up and down the old man 's room three times , from end to end , and then I shall have conquered it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 27]: I went in with the candle in my hand ; but the moment I came near the bed , the air got thick with them . '
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 6]: ` With the faces ? '
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 29]: ` Yes , and I even felt that they were in the dark behind the sidedoor , and on the little staircase , floating away into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 7]: Then , I called you . '
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 12]: Mr Boffin , lost in amazement , looked at Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 20]: Mrs Boffin , lost in her own fluttered inability to make this out , looked at Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 61]: I think , my dear , ' said the Golden Dustman , ` I 'll at once get rid of Wegg for the night , because he 's coming to inhabit the Bower , and it might be put into his head or somebody else 's , if he heard this and it got about that the house is haunted .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 5]: Whereas we know better .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 6]: Do n't we ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 30]: I never had the feeling in the house before , ' said Mrs Boffin ; ` and I have been about it alone at all hours of the night .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 40]: I have been in the house when Death was in it , and I have been in the house when Murder was a new part of its adventures , and I never had a fright in it yet . '
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 14]: ` And wo n't again , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 17]: ` Depend upon it , it comes of thinking and dwelling on that dark spot . '
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 12]: ` Yes ; but why did n't it come before ? '
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 4]: asked Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 30]: This draft on Mr Boffin 's philosophy could only be met by that gentleman with the remark that everything that is at all , must begin at some time .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 30]: Then , tucking his wife 's arm under his own , that she might not be left by herself to be troubled again , he descended to release Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 40]: Who , being something drowsy after his plentiful repast , and constitutionally of a shirking temperament , was well enough pleased to stump away , without doing what he had come to do , and was paid for doing .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 52]: Mr Boffin then put on his hat , and Mrs Boffin her shawl ; and the pair , further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern , went all over the dismal house -- dismal everywhere , but in their own two rooms -- from cellar to cock-loft .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 28]: Not resting satisfied with giving that much chace to Mrs Boffin 's fancies , they pursued them into the yard and outbuildings , and under the Mounds .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 47]: And setting the lantern , when all was done , at the foot of one of the Mounds , they comfortably trotted to and fro for an evening walk , to the end that the murky cobwebs in Mrs Boffin 's brain might be blown away .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 6]: There , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 10]: said Mr Boffin when they came in to supper .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 9]: ` That was the treatment , you see .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 9]: Completely worked round , have n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 15]: ` Yes , deary , ' said Mrs Boffin , laying aside her shawl .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 8]: ` I 'm not nervous any more .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 8]: I 'm not a bit troubled now .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 12]: I 'd go anywhere about the house the same as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 7]: But -- ' ` Eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 11]: ` But I 've only to shut my eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 6]: ` And what then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 31]: ` Why then , ' said Mrs Boffin , speaking with her eyes closed , and her left hand thoughtfully touching her brow , ` then , there they are !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 11]: The old man 's face , and it gets younger .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 11]: The two children 's faces , and they get older .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 8]: A face that I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 7]: And then all the faces ! '
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 44]: Opening her eyes again , and seeing her husband 's face across the table , she leaned forward to give it a pat on the cheek , and sat down to supper , declaring it to be the best face in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 31]: Chapter 16 MINDERS AND RE-MINDERS The Secretary lost no time in getting to work , and his vigilance and method soon set their mark on the Golden Dustman 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 34]: His earnestness in determining to understand the length and breadth and depth of every piece of work submitted to him by his employer , was as special as his despatch in transacting it .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 21]: He accepted no information or explanation at second hand , but made himself the master of everything confided to him .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 32]: One part of the Secretary 's conduct , underlying all the rest , might have been mistrusted by a man with a better knowledge of men than the Golden Dustman had .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 32]: The Secretary was as far from being inquisitive or intrusive as Secretary could be , but nothing less than a complete understanding of the whole of the affairs would content him .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 36]: It soon became apparent -LRB- from the knowledge with which he set out -RRB- that he must have been to the office where the Harmon will was registered , and must have read the will .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 30]: He anticipated Mr Boffin 's consideration whether he should be advised with on this or that topic , by showing that he already knew of it and understood it .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 33]: He did this with no attempt at concealment , seeming to be satisfied that it was part of his duty to have prepared himself at all attainable points for its utmost discharge .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 24]: This might -- let it be repeated -- have awakened some little vague mistrust in a man more worldly-wise than the Golden Dustman .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 27]: On the other hand , the Secretary was discerning , discreet , and silent , though as zealous as if the affairs had been his own .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 21]: He showed no love of patronage or the command of money , but distinctly preferred resigning both to Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 29]: If , in his limited sphere , he sought power , it was the power of knowledge ; the power derivable from a perfect comprehension of his business .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 23]: As on the Secretary 's face there was a nameless cloud , so on his manner there was a shadow equally indefinable .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 30]: It was not that he was embarrassed , as on that first night with the Wilfer family ; he was habitually unembarrassed now , and yet the something remained .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 29]: It was not that his manner was bad , as on that occasion ; it was now very good , as being modest , gracious , and ready .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 7]: Yet the something never left it .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 46]: It has been written of men who have undergone a cruel captivity , or who have passed through a terrible strait , or who in self-preservation have killed a defenceless fellowcreature , that the record thereof has never faded from their countenances until they died .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 7]: Was there any such record here ?
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 25]: He established a temporary office for himself in the new house , and all went well under his hand , with one singular exception .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 11]: He manifestly objected to communicate with Mr Boffin 's solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 48]: Two or three times , when there was some slight occasion for his doing so , he transferred the task to Mr Boffin ; and his evasion of it soon became so curiously apparent , that Mr Boffin spoke to him on the subject of his reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 11]: ` It is so , ' the Secretary admitted . '
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 6]: I would rather not . '
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 10]: Had he any personal objection to Mr Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 7]: I do n't know him . '
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 6]: Had he suffered from law-suits ?
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 13]: ` Not more than other men , ' was his short answer .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 9]: Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers ?
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 24]: But while I am in your employment , sir , I would rather he excused from going between the lawyer and the client .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 16]: Of course if you press it , Mr Boffin , I am ready to comply .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 20]: But I should take it as a great favour if you would not press it without urgent occasion . '
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 46]: Now , it could not be said that there WAS urgent occasion , for Lightwood retained no other affairs in his hands than such as still lingered and languished about the undiscovered criminal , and such as arose out of the purchase of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 44]: Many other matters that might have travelled to him , now stopped short at the Secretary , under whose administration they were far more expeditiously and satisfactorily disposed of than they would have been if they had got into Young Blight 's domain .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 7]: This the Golden Dustman quite understood .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 78]: Even the matter immediately in hand was of very little moment as requiring personal appearance on the Secretary 's part , for it amounted to no more than this : -- The death of Hexam rendering the sweat of the honest man 's brow unprofitable , the honest man had shufflingly decided to moisten his brow for nothing , with that severe exertion which is known in legal circles as swearing your way through a stone wall .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 10]: Consequently , that new light had gone sputtering out .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 48]: But , the airing of the old facts had led some one concerned to suggest that it would be well before they were reconsigned to their gloomy shelf -- now probably for ever -- to induce or compel that Mr Julius Handford to reappear and be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 25]: And all traces of Mr Julius Handford being lost , Lightwood now referred to his client for authority to seek him through public advertisement .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 13]: ` Does your objection go to writing to Lightwood , Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 9]: ` Not in the least , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 21]: ` Then perhaps you 'll write him a line , and say he is free to do what he likes .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 9]: I do n't think it promises . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 12]: I do n't think it promises , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 12]: ` Still , he may do what he likes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 5]: I will write immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 12]: Let me thank you for so considerately yielding to my disinclination .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 29]: It may seem less unreasonable , if I avow to you that although I do n't know Mr Lightwood , I have a disagreeable association connected with him .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 25]: It is not his fault ; he is not at all to blame for it , and does not even know my name . '
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 11]: Mr Boffin dismissed the matter with a nod or two .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 15]: The letter was written , and next day Mr Julius Handford was advertised for .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 54]: He was requested to place himself in communication with Mr Mortimer Lightwood , as a possible means of furthering the ends of justice , and a reward was offered to any one acquainted with his whereabout who would communicate the same to the said Mr Mortimer Lightwood at his office in the Temple .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 56]: Every day for six weeks this advertisement appeared at the head of all the newspapers , and every day for six weeks the Secretary , when he saw it , said to himself ; in the tone in which he had said to his employer , -- ' I do n't think it promises ! '
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 18]: Among his first occupations the pursuit of that orphan wanted by Mrs Boffin held a conspicuous place .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 37]: From the earliest moment of his engagement he showed a particular desire to please her , and , knowing her to have this object at heart , he followed it up with unwearying alacrity and interest .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 12]: Mr and Mrs Milvey had found their search a difficult one .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 63]: Either an eligible orphan was of the wrong sex -LRB- which almost always happened -RRB- or was too old , or too young , or too sickly , or too dirty , or too much accustomed to the streets , or too likely to run away ; or , it was found impossible to complete the philanthropic transaction without buying the orphan .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 31]: For , the instant it became known that anybody wanted the orphan , up started some affectionate relative of the orphan who put a price upon the orphan 's head .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 24]: The suddenness of an orphan 's rise in the market was not to be paralleled by the maddest records of the Stock Exchange .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 40]: He would be at five thousand per cent discount out at nurse making a mud pie at nine in the morning , and -LRB- being inquired for -RRB- would go up to five thousand per cent premium before noon .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 11]: The market was ` rigged ' in various artful ways .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 6]: Counterfeit stock got into circulation .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 14]: Parents boldly represented themselves as dead , and brought their orphans with them .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 9]: Genuine orphan-stock was surreptitiously withdrawn from the market .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 50]: It being announced , by emissaries posted for the purpose , that Mr and Mrs Milvey were coming down the court , orphan scrip would be instantly concealed , and production refused , save on a condition usually stated by the brokers as ' a gallon of beer ' .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 27]: Likewise , fluctuations of a wild and South-Sea nature were occasioned , by orphan-holders keeping back , and then rushing into the market a dozen together .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 31]: But , the uniform principle at the root of all these various operations was bargain and sale ; and that principle could not be recognized by Mr and Mrs Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 20]: At length , tidings were received by the Reverend Frank of a charming orphan to be found at Brentford .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 44]: One of the deceased parents -LRB- late his parishioners -RRB- had a poor widowed grandmother in that agreeable town , and she , Mrs Betty Higden , had carried off the orphan with maternal care , but could not afford to keep him .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 37]: The Secretary proposed to Mrs Boffin , either to go down himself and take a preliminary survey of this orphan , or to drive her down , that she might at once form her own opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 25]: Mrs Boffin preferring the latter course , they set off one morning in a hired phaeton , conveying the hammer-headed young man behind them .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 43]: The abode of Mrs Betty Higden was not easy to find , lying in such complicated back settlements of muddy Brentford that they left their equipage at the sign of the Three Magpies , and went in search of it on foot .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 57]: After many inquiries and defeats , there was pointed out to them in a lane , a very small cottage residence , with a board across the open doorway , hooked on to which board by the armpits was a young gentleman of tender years , angling for mud with a headless wooden horse and line .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 23]: In this young sportsman , distinguished by a crisply curling auburn head and a bluff countenance , the Secretary descried the orphan .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 34]: It unfortunately happened as they quickened their pace , that the orphan , lost to considerations of personal safety in the ardour of the moment , overbalanced himself and toppled into the street .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 26]: Being an orphan of a chubby conformation , he then took to rolling , and had rolled into the gutter before they could come up .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 51]: From the gutter he was rescued by John Rokesmith , and thus the first meeting with Mrs Higden was inaugurated by the awkward circumstance of their being in possession -- one would say at first sight unlawful possession -- of the orphan , upside down and purple in the countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 55]: The board across the doorway too , acting as a trap equally for the feet of Mrs Higden coming out , and the feet of Mrs Boffin and John Rokesmith going in , greatly increased the difficulty of the situation : to which the cries of the orphan imparted a lugubrious and inhuman character .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 50]: At first , it was impossible to explain , on account of the orphan 's ` holding his breath ' : a most terrific proceeding , super-inducing in the orphan lead-colour rigidity and a deadly silence , compared with which his cries were music yielding the height of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 26]: But as he gradually recovered , Mrs Boffin gradually introduced herself ; and smiling peace was gradually wooed back to Mrs Betty Higden 's home .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 53]: It was then perceived to be a small home with a large mangle in it , at the handle of which machine stood a very long boy , with a very little head , and an open mouth of disproportionate capacity that seemed to assist his eyes in staring at the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 77]: In a corner below the mangle , on a couple of stools , sat two very little children : a boy and a girl ; and when the very long boy , in an interval of staring , took a turn at the mangle , it was alarming to see how it lunged itself at those two innocents , like a catapult designed for their destruction , harmlessly retiring when within an inch of their heads .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 7]: The room was clean and neat .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 47]: It had a brick floor , and a window of diamond panes , and a flounce hanging below the chimney-piece , and strings nailed from bottom to top outside the window on which scarlet-beans were to grow in the coming season if the Fates were propitious .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 45]: However propitious they might have been in the seasons that were gone , to Betty Higden in the matter of beans , they had not been very favourable in the matter of coins ; for it was easy to see that she was poor .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 93]: She was one of those old women , was Mrs Betty Higden , who by dint of an indomitable purpose and a strong constitution fight out many years , though each year has come with its new knock-down blows fresh to the fight against her , wearied by it ; an active old woman , with a bright dark eye and a resolute face , yet quite a tender creature too ; not a logically-reasoning woman , but God is good , and hearts may count in Heaven as high as heads .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 5]: ` Yes sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 30]: said she , when the business was opened , ` Mrs Milvey had the kindness to write to me , ma'am , and I got Sloppy to read it .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 6]: It was a pretty letter .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 8]: But she 's an affable lady . '
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 28]: The visitors glanced at the long boy , who seemed to indicate by a broader stare of his mouth and eyes that in him Sloppy stood confessed .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 32]: ` For I aint , you must know , ' said Betty , ` much of a hand at reading writing-hand , though I can read my Bible and most print .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 7]: And I do love a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 16]: You might n't think it , but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 9]: He do the Police in different voices . '
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 40]: The visitors again considered it a point of politeness to look at Sloppy , who , looking at them , suddenly threw back his head , extended his mouth to its utmost width , and laughed loud and long .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 32]: At this the two innocents , with their brains in that apparent danger , laughed , and Mrs Higden laughed , and the orphan laughed , and then the visitors laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 7]: Which was more cheerful than intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 41]: Then Sloppy seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury , turned to at the mangle , and impelled it at the heads of the innocents with such a creaking and rumbling , that Mrs Higden stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 11]: ` The gentlefolks ca n't hear themselves speak , Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 9]: Bide a bit , bide a bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 11]: ` Is that the dear child in your lap ? '
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 4]: said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 10]: ` Yes , ma'am , this is Johnny . '
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 6]: ` Johnny , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 13]: cried Mrs Boffin , turning to the Secretary ; ` already Johnny !
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 11]: Only one of the two names left to give him !
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 7]: He 's a pretty boy . '
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 46]: With his chin tucked down in his shy childish manner , he was looking furtively at Mrs Boffin out of his blue eyes , and reaching his fat dimpled hand up to the lips of the old woman , who was kissing it by times .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 31]: ` Yes , ma'am , he 's a pretty boy , he 's a dear darling boy , he 's the child of my own last left daughter 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 12]: But she 's gone the way of all the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 10]: ` Those are not his brother and sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 4]: said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 8]: ` Oh , dear no , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 5]: Those are Minders . '
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 4]: ` Minders ? '
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 4]: the Secretary repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 8]: ` Left to he Minded , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: I keep a Minding-School .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 12]: I can take only three , on account of the Mangle .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 12]: But I love children , and Fourpence a week is Four-pence .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 8]: Come here , Toddles and Poddles . '
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 13]: Toddles was the pet-name of the boy ; Poddles of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 62]: At their little unsteady pace , they came across the floor , hand-in-hand , as if they were traversing an extremely difficult road intersected by brooks , and , when they had had their heads patted by Mrs Betty Higden , made lunges at the orphan , dramatically representing an attempt to bear him , crowing , into captivity and slavery .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 21]: All the three children enjoyed this to a delightful extent , and the sympathetic Sloppy again laughed long and loud .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 40]: When it was discreet to stop the play , Betty Higden said ` Go to your seats Toddles and Poddles , ' and they returned hand-in-hand across country , seeming to find the brooks rather swollen by late rains .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 10]: ` And Master -- or Mister -- Sloppy ? '
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 17]: said the Secretary , in doubt whether he was man , boy , or what . '
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 22]: A love-child , ' returned Betty Higden , dropping her voice ; ` parents never known ; found in the street .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 20]: He was brought up in the -- ' with a shiver of repugnance , ' -- the House . '
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 5]: ` The Poor-house ? '
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 4]: said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 15]: Mrs Higden set that resolute old face of hers , and darkly nodded yes .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 9]: ` You dislike the mention of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 8]: ` Dislike the mention of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 5]: answered the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 9]: ` Kill me sooner than take me there .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 18]: Throw this pretty child under carthorses feet and a loaded waggon , sooner than take him there .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 43]: Come to us and find us all a-dying , and set a light to us all where we lie and let us all blaze away with the house into a heap of cinders sooner than move a corpse of us there ! '
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 27]: A surprising spirit in this lonely woman after so many years of hard working , and hard living , my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards !
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 12]: What is it that we call it in our grandiose speeches ?
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 6]: British independence , rather perverted ?
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 14]: Is that , or something like it , the ring of the cant ?
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 28]: ` Do I never read in the newspapers , ' said the dame , fondling the child -- ` God help me and the like of me !
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 29]: -- how the worn-out people that do come down to that , get driven from post to pillar and pillar to post , a-purpose to tire them out !
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 44]: Do I never read how they are put off , put off , put off -- how they are grudged , grudged , grudged , the shelter , or the doctor , or the drop of physic , or the bit of bread ?
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 35]: Do I never read how they grow heartsick of it and give it up , after having let themsleves drop so low , and how they after all die out for want of help ?
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 23]: Then I say , I hope I can die as well as another , and I 'll die without that disgrace . '
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 26]: Absolutely impossible my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards , by any stretch of legislative wisdom to set these perverse people right in their logic ?
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 39]: ` Johnny , my pretty , ' continued old Betty , caressing the child , and rather mourning over it than speaking to it , ` your old Granny Betty is nigher fourscore year than threescore and ten .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 16]: She never begged nor had a penny of the Union money in all her life .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 27]: She paid scot and she paid lot when she had money to pay ; she worked when she could , and she starved when she must .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 78]: You pray that your Granny may have strength enough left her at the last -LRB- she 's strong for an old one , Johnny -RRB- , to get up from her bed and run and hide herself and swown to death in a hole , sooner than fall into the hands of those Cruel Jacks we read of that dodge and drive , and worry and weary , and scorn and shame , the decent poor . '
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 27]: A brilliant success , my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards to have brought it to this in the minds of the best of the poor !
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 14]: Under submission , might it be worth thinking of at any odd time ?
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 28]: The fright and abhorrence that Mrs Betty Higden smoothed out of her strong face as she ended this diversion , showed how seriously she had meant it .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 9]: ` And does he work for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 15]: asked the Secretary , gently bringing the discourse back to Master or Mister Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 16]: ` Yes , ' said Betty with a good-humoured smile and nod of the head .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 6]: ` And well too . '
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 7]: ` Does he live here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 8]: ` He lives more here than anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 20]: He was thought to be no better than a Natural , and first come to me as a Minder .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 32]: I made interest with Mr Blogg the Beadle to have him as a Minder , seeing him by chance up at church , and thinking I might do something with him .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 10]: For he was a weak ricketty creetur then . '
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 10]: ` Is he called by his right name ? '
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 16]: ` Why , you see , speaking quite correctly , he has no right name .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 16]: I always understood he took his name from being found on a Sloppy night . '
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 8]: ` He seems an amiable fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 24]: ` Bless you , sir , there 's not a bit of him , ' returned Betty , ` that 's not amiable .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 18]: So you may judge how amiable he is , by running your eye along his heighth . '
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 7]: Of an ungainly make was Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 21]: Too much of him longwise , too little of him broadwise , and too many sharp angles of him anglewise .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 35]: One of those shambling male human creatures , born to be indiscreetly candid in the revelation of buttons ; every button he had about him glaring at the public to a quite preternatural extent .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 47]: A considerable capital of knee and elbow and wrist and ankle , had Sloppy , and he did n't know how to dispose of it to the best advantage , but was always investing it in wrong securities , and so getting himself into embarrassed circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 31]: Full-Private Number One in the Awkward Squad of the rank and file of life , was Sloppy , and yet had his glimmering notions of standing true to the Colours .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 14]: ` And now , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` concerning Johnny . '
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 60]: As Johnny , with his chin tucked in and lips pouting , reclined in Betty 's lap , concentrating his blue eyes on the visitors and shading them from observation with a dimpled arm , old Betty took one of his fresh fat hands in her withered right , and fell to gently beating it on her withered left .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 5]: ` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 4]: Concerning Johnny . '
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 45]: ` If you trust the dear child to me , ' said Mrs Boffin , with a face inviting trust , ` he shall have the best of homes , the best of care , the best of education , the best of friends .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 14]: Please God I will be a true good mother to him ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 24]: I am thankful to you , ma'am , and the dear child would be thankful if he was old enough to understand . '
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 11]: Still lightly beating the little hand upon her own . '
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 28]: I would n't stand in the dear child 's light , not if I had all my life before me instead of a very little of it .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 32]: But I hope you wo n't take it ill that I cleave to the child closer than words can tell , for he 's the last living thing left me . '
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 9]: ` Take it ill , my dear soul ?
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 4]: Is it likely ?
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 15]: And you so tender of him as to bring him home here ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 28]: I have seen , ' said Betty , still with that light beat upon her hard rough hand , ` so many of them on my lap .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 9]: And they are all gone but this one !
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 16]: I am ashamed to seem so selfish , but I do n't really mean it .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 20]: It 'll be the making of his fortune , and he 'll be a gentleman when I am dead .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 12]: I -- I -- do n't know what comes over me .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 6]: I -- try against it .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 6]: Do n't notice me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 24]: The light beat stopped , the resolute mouth gave way , and the fine strong old face broke up into weakness and tears .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 42]: Now , greatly to the relief of the visitors , the emotional Sloppy no sooner beheld his patroness in this condition , than , throwing back his head and throwing open his mouth , he lifted up his voice and bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 48]: This alarming note of something wrong instantly terrified Toddles and Poddles , who were no sooner heard to roar surprisingly , than Johnny , curving himself the wrong way and striking out at Mrs Boffin with a pair of indifferent shoes , became a prey to despair .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 12]: The absurdity of the situation put its pathos to the rout .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 48]: Mrs Betty Higden was herself in a moment , and brought them all to order with that speed , that Sloppy , stopping short in a polysyllabic bellow , transferred his energy to the mangle , and had taken several penitential turns before he could be stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 8]: ` There , there , there ! '
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 16]: said Mrs Boffin , almost regarding her kind self as the most ruthless of women .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 8]: ` Nothing is going to be done .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 5]: Nobody need be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 13]: We 're all comfortable ; ai n't we , Mrs Higden ? '
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 11]: ` Sure and certain we are , ' returned Betty .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 20]: ` And there really is no hurry , you know , ' said Mrs Boffin in a lower voice .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 13]: ` Take time to think of it , my good creature ! '
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 24]: ` Do n't you fear ME no more , ma'am , ' said Betty ; ' I thought of it for good yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 19]: I do n't know what come over me just now , but it 'll never come again . '
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 33]: ` Well , then , Johnny shall have more time to think of it , ' returned Mrs Boffin ; ` the pretty child shall have time to get used to it .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 22]: And you 'll get him more used to it , if you think well of it ; wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 8]: Betty undertook that , cheerfully and readily .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 24]: ` Lor , ' cried Mrs Boffin , looking radiantly about her , ` we want to make everybody happy , not dismal !
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 27]: -- And perhaps you would n't mind letting me know how used to it you begin to get , and how it all goes on ? '
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 11]: ` I 'll send Sloppy , ' said Mrs Higden .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 21]: ` And this gentleman who has come with me will pay him for his trouble , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 35]: ` And Mr Sloppy , whenever you come to my house , be sure you never go away without having had a good dinner of meat , beer , vegetables , and pudding . '
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 40]: This still further brightened the face of affairs ; for , the highly sympathetic Sloppy , first broadly staring and grinning , and then roaring with laughter , Toddles and Poddles followed suit , and Johnny trumped the trick .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 67]: T and P considering these favourable circumstances for the resumption of that dramatic descent upon Johnny , again came across-country hand-in-hand upon a buccaneermg expedition ; and this having been fought out in the chimney corner behind Mrs Higden 's chair , with great valour on both sides , those desperate pirates returned hand-in-hand to their stools , across the dry bed of a mountain torrent .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 31]: ` You must tell me what I can do for you , Betty my friend , ' said Mrs Boffin confidentially , ` if not to-day , next time . '
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 16]: ` Thank you all the same , ma'am , but I want nothing for myself .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 4]: I can work .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 4]: I 'm strong .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 13]: I can walk twenty mile if I 'm put to it . '
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 16]: Old Betty was proud , and said it with a sparkle in her bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 23]: ` Yes , but there are some little comforts that you would n't be the worse for , ' returned Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 16]: ` Bless ye , I was n't born a lady any more than you . '
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 33]: ` It seems to me , ' said Betty , smiling , ` that you were born a lady , and a true one , or there never was a lady born .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 12]: But I could n't take anything from you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 9]: I never did take anything from any one .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 18]: It ai n't that I 'm not grateful , but I love to earn it better . '
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 5]: returned Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 17]: I only spoke of little things , or I would n't have taken the liberty . '
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 17]: Betty put her visitor 's hand to her lips , in acknowledgment of the delicate answer .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 24]: Wonderfully upright her figure was , and wonderfully self-reliant her look , as , standing facing her visitor , she explained herself further .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 41]: ` If I could have kept the dear child , without the dread that 's always upon me of his coming to that fate I have spoken of , I could never have parted with him , even to you .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 13]: For I love him , I love him , I love him !
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 37]: I love my husband long dead and gone , in him ; I love my children dead and gone , in him ; I love my young and hopeful days dead and gone , in him .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 16]: I could n't sell that love , and look you in your bright kind face .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 6]: It 's a free gift .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 7]: I am in want of nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 22]: When my strength fails me , if I can but die out quick and quiet , I shall be quite content .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 26]: I have stood between my dead and that shame I have spoken of ; and it has been kept off from every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 24]: Sewed into my gown , ' with her hand upon her breast , ` is just enough to lay me in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 51]: Only see that it 's rightly spent , so as I may rest free to the last from that cruelty and disgrace , and you 'll have done much more than a little thing for me , and all that in this present world my heart is set upon . '
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 9]: Mrs Betty Higden 's visitor pressed her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 14]: There was no more breaking up of the strong old face into weakness .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 23]: My Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards , it really was as composed as our own faces , and almost as dignified .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 19]: And now , Johnny was to be inveigled into occupying a temporary position on Mrs Boffin 's lap .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 82]: It was not until he had been piqued into competition with the two diminutive Minders , by seeing them successively raised to that post and retire from it without injury , that he could be by any means induced to leave Mrs Betty Higden 's skirts ; towards which he exhibited , even when in Mrs Boffin 's embrace , strong yearnings , spiritual and bodily ; the former expressed in a very gloomy visage , the latter in extended arms .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 63]: However , a general description of the toy-wonders lurking in Mr Boffin 's house , so far conciliated this worldly-minded orphan as to induce him to stare at her frowningly , with a fist in his mouth , and even at length to chuckle when a richly-caparisoned horse on wheels , with a miraculous gift of cantering to cake-shops , was mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 19]: This sound being taken up by the Minders , swelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 20]: So , the interview was considered very successful , and Mrs Boffin was pleased , and all were satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 32]: Not least of all , Sloppy , who undertook to conduct the visitors back by the best way to the Three Magpies , and whom the hammer-headed young man much despised .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 31]: This piece of business thus put in train , the Secretary drove Mrs Boffin back to the Bower , and found employment for himself at the new house until evening .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 44]: Whether , when evening came , he took a way to his lodgings that led through fields , with any design of finding Miss Bella Wilfer in those fields , is not so certain as that she regularly walked there at that hour .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 12]: And , moreover , it is certain that there she was .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 18]: No longer in mourning , Miss Bella was dressed in as pretty colours as she could muster .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 23]: There is no denying that she was as pretty as they , and that she and the colours went very prettily together .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 36]: She was reading as she walked , and of course it is to be inferred , from her showing no knowledge of Mr Rokesmith 's approach , that she did not know he was approaching .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 17]: said Miss Bella , raising her eyes from her book , when he stopped before her .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 5]: It 's you . '
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 4]: ` Only I .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 5]: A fine evening ! '
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 5]: ` Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 8]: said Bella , looking coldly round . '
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 10]: I suppose it is , now you mention it .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 10]: I have not been thinking of the evening . '
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 8]: ` So intent upon your book ? '
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 14]: ` Ye-e-es , ' replied Bella , with a drawl of indifference . '
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 8]: A love story , Miss Wilfer ? '
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 13]: ` Oh dear no , or I should n't be reading it .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 10]: It 's more about money than anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 13]: ` And does it say that money is better than anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 30]: ` Upon my word , ' returned Bella , ' I forget what it says , but you can find out for yourself if you like , Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 9]: I do n't want it any more . '
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 24]: The Secretary took the book -- she had fluttered the leaves as if it were a fan -- and walked beside her . '
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 13]: I am charged with a message for you , Miss Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 7]: ` Impossible , I think ! '
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 7]: said Bella , with another drawl .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 5]: ` From Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 30]: She desired me to assure you of the pleasure she has in finding that she will be ready to receive you in another week or two at furthest . '
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 18]: Bella turned her head towards him , with her prettily-insolent eyebrows raised , and her eyelids drooping .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 19]: As much as to say , ` How did YOU come by the message , pray ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 20]: I have been waiting for an opportunity of telling you that I am Mr Boffin 's Secretary . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 25]: I am as wise as ever , ' said Miss Bella , loftily , ` for I do n't know what a Secretary is .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 6]: Not that it signifies . '
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 6]: ` Not at all . '
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 27]: A covert glance at her face , as he walked beside her , showed him that she had not expected his ready assent to that proposition .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 14]: ` Then are you going to be always there , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 11]: she inquired , as if that would be a drawback .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 3]: ` Always ?
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 4]: Very much there ?
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 9]: drawled Bella , in a tone of mortification .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 17]: ` But my position there as Secretary , will be very different from yours as guest .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 9]: You will know little or nothing about me .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 12]: I shall transact the business : you will transact the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 21]: I shall have my salary to earn ; you will have nothing to do but to enjoy and attract . '
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 6]: ` Attract , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 15]: said Bella , again with her eyebrows raised , and her eyelids drooping . '
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 7]: I do n't understand you . '
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 11]: Without replying on this point , Mr Rokesmith went on .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 20]: ` Excuse me ; when I first saw you in your black dress -- ' -LRB- ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 7]: was Miss Bella 's mental exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 10]: ` What did I say to them at home ?
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 8]: Everybody noticed that ridiculous mourning . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 27]: ` When I first saw you in your black dress , I was at a loss to account for that distinction between yourself and your family .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 13]: I hope it was not impertinent to speculate upon it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 15]: I hope not , I am sure , ' said Miss Bella , haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 14]: ` But you ought to know best how you speculated upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 14]: Mr Rokesmith inclined his head in a deprecatory manner , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 22]: ` Since I have been entrusted with Mr Boffin 's affairs , I have necessarily come to understand the little mystery .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 17]: I venture to remark that I feel persuaded that much of your loss may be repaired .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 13]: I speak , of course , merely of wealth , Miss Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 27]: The loss of a perfect stranger , whose worth , or worthlessness , I can not estimate -- nor you either -- is beside the question .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 33]: But this excellent gentleman and lady are so full of simplicity , so full of generosity , so inclined towards you , and so desirous to -- how shall I express it ?
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 17]: -- to make amends for their good fortune , that you have only to respond . '
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 25]: As he watched her with another covert look , he saw a certain ambitious triumph in her face which no assumed coldness could conceal .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 38]: ` As we have been brought under one roof by an accidental combination of circumstances , which oddly extends itself to the new relations before us , I have taken the liberty of saying these few words .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 10]: You do n't consider them intrusive I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 6]: said the Secretary with deference .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 21]: ` Really , Mr Rokesmith , I ca n't say what I consider them , ' returned the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 19]: ` They are perfectly new to me , and may be founded altogether on your own imagination . '
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 6]: ` You will see . '
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 9]: These same fields were opposite the Wilfer premises .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 33]: The discreet Mrs Wilfer now looking out of window and beholding her daughter in conference with her lodger , instantly tied up her head and came out for a casual walk . '
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 42]: I have been telling Miss Wilfer , ' said John Rokesmith , as the majestic lady came stalking up , ` that I have become , by a curious chance , Mr Boffin 's Secretary or man of business . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 53]: I have not , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , waving her gloves in her chronic state of dignity , and vague ill-usage , ` the honour of any intimate acquaintance with Mr Boffin , and it is not for me to congratulate that gentleman on the acquisition he has made . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 9]: A poor one enough , ' said Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 50]: ` Pardon me , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , ` the merits of Mr Boffin may be highly distinguished -- may be more distinguished than the countenance of Mrs Boffin would imply -- but it were the insanity of humility to deem him worthy of a better assistant . '
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 6]: ` You are very good .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 21]: I have also been telling Miss Wilfer that she is expected very shortly at the new residence in town . '
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 45]: ` Having tacitly consented , ' said Mrs Wilfer , with a grand shrug of her shoulders , and another wave of her gloves , ` to my child 's acceptance of the proffered attentions of Mrs Boffin , I interpose no objection . '
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 18]: Here Miss Bella offered the remonstrance : ` Do n't talk nonsense , ma , please . '
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 4]: ` Peace ! '
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 15]: ` No , ma , I am not going to be made so absurd .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 5]: Interposing objections ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 25]: I say , ' repeated Mrs Wilfer , with a vast access of grandeur , ` that I am NOT going to interpose objections .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 61]: If Mrs Boffin -LRB- to whose countenance no disciple of Lavater could possibly for a single moment subscribe -RRB- , ' with a shiver , ` seeks to illuminate her new residence in town with the attractions of a child of mine , I am content that she should be favoured by the company of a child of mine . '
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 35]: ` You use the word , ma'am , I have myself used , ' said Rokesmith , with a glance at Bella , ` when you speak of Miss Wilfer 's attractions there . '
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 21]: ` Pardon me , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , with dreadful solemnity , ` but I had not finished . '
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 7]: ` Pray excuse me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 51]: I was about to say , ' pursued Mrs Wilfer , who clearly had not had the faintest idea of saying anything more : ` that when I use the term attractions , I do so with the qualification that I do not mean it in any way whatever . '
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 24]: The excellent lady delivered this luminous elucidation of her views with an air of greatly obliging her hearers , and greatly distinguishing herself .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 25]: Whereat Miss Bella laughed a scornful little laugh and said : ` Quite enough about this , I am sure , on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 21]: Have the goodness , Mr Rokesmith , to give my love to Mrs Boffin -- ' ` Pardon me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 4]: cried Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 4]: ` Compliments . '
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 4]: ` Love ! '
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 11]: repeated Bella , with a little stamp of her foot .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 6]: said Mrs Wilfer , monotonously .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 4]: ` Compliments . '
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 24]: -LRB- ` Say Miss Wilfer 's love , and Mrs Wilfer 's compliments , ' the Secretary proposed , as a compromise . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 16]: ` And I shall be very glad to come when she is ready for me .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 7]: The sooner , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 20]: ` One last word , Bella , ' said Mrs Wilfer , ` before descending to the family apartment .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 56]: I trust that as a child of mine you will ever be sensible that it will be graceful in you , when associating with Mr and Mrs Boffin upon equal terms , to remember that the Secretary , Mr Rokesmith , as your father 's lodger , has a claim on your good word . '
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 29]: The condescension with which Mrs Wilfer delivered this proclamation of patronage , was as wonderful as the swiftness with which the lodger had lost caste in the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 19]: He smiled as the mother retired down stairs ; but his face fell , as the daughter followed .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 27]: ` So insolent , so trivial , so capricious , so mercenary , so careless , so hard to touch , so hard to turn ! '
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 5]: he said , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 7]: And added as he went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 10]: ` And yet so pretty , so pretty ! '
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 14]: And added presently , as he walked to and fro in his room .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 7]: ` And if she knew ! '
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 52]: She knew that he was shaking the house by his walking to and fro ; and she declared it another of the miseries of being poor , that you could n't get rid of a haunting Secretary , stump -- stump -- stumping overhead in the dark , like a Ghost .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 52]: Chapter 17 A DISMAL SWAMP And now , in the blooming summer days , behold Mr and Mrs Boffin established in the eminently aristocratic family mansion , and behold all manner of crawling , creeping , fluttering , and buzzing creatures , attracted by the gold dust of the Golden Dustman !
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 40]: Foremost among those leaving cards at the eminently aristocratic door before it is quite painted , are the Veneerings : out of breath , one might imagine , from the impetuosity of their rush to the eminently aristocratic steps .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 37]: One copper-plate Mrs Veneering , two copper-plate Mr Veneerings , and a connubial copper-plate Mr and Mrs Veneering , requesting the honour of Mr and Mrs Boffin 's company at dinner with the utmost Analytical solemnities .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 8]: The enchanting Lady Tippins leaves a card .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 4]: Twemlow leaves cards .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 32]: A tall custard-coloured phaeton tooling up in a solemn manner leaves four cards , to wit , a couple of Mr Podsnaps , a Mrs Podsnap , and a Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 11]: All the world and his wife and daughter leave cards .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 85]: Sometimes the world 's wife has so many daughters , that her card reads rather like a Miscellaneous Lot at an Auction ; comprising Mrs Tapkins , Miss Tapkins , Miss Frederica Tapkins , Miss Antonina Tapkins , Miss Malvina Tapkins , and Miss Euphemia Tapkins ; at the same time , the same lady leaves the card of Mrs Henry George Alfred Swoshle , NEE Tapkins ; also , a card , Mrs Tapkins at Home , Wednesdays , Music , Portland Place .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 18]: Miss Bella Wilfer becomes an inmate , for an indefinite period , of the eminently aristocratic dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 20]: Mrs Boffin bears Miss Bella away to her Milliner 's and Dressmaker 's , and she gets beautifully dressed .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 16]: The Veneerings find with swift remorse that they have omitted to invite Miss Bella Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 25]: One Mrs Veneering and one Mr and Mrs Veneering requesting that additional honour , instantly do penance in white cardboard on the hall table .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 41]: Mrs Tapkins likewise discovers her omission , and with promptitude repairs it ; for herself ; for Miss Tapkins , for Miss Frederica Tapkins , for Miss Antonina Tapkins , for Miss Malvina Tapkins , and for Miss Euphemia Tapkins .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 11]: Likewise , for Mrs Henry George Alfred Swoshle NEE Tapkins .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 15]: Likewise , for Mrs Tapkins at Home , Wednesdays , Music , Portland Place .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 20]: Tradesmen 's books hunger , and tradesmen 's mouths water , for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 35]: As Mrs Boffin and Miss Wilfer drive out , or as Mr Boffin walks out at his jog-trot pace , the fishmonger pulls off his hat with an air of reverence founded on conviction .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 21]: His men cleanse their fingers on their woollen aprons before presuming to touch their foreheads to Mr Boffin or Lady .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 35]: The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab seem to turn up their eyes sideways , as they would turn up their hands if they had any , in worshipping admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 41]: The butcher , though a portly and a prosperous man , does n't know what to do with himself ; so anxious is he to express humility when discovered by the passing Boffins taking the air in a mutton grove .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 24]: Presents are made to the Boffin servants , and bland strangers with businesscards meeting said servants in the street , offer hypothetical corruption .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 45]: As , ` Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from Mr Boffin , my dear friend , it would be worth my while ' -- to do a certain thing that I hope might not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 32]: But no one knows so well as the Secretary , who opens and reads the letters , what a set is made at the man marked by a stroke of notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 21]: Oh the varieties of dust for ocular use , offered in exchange for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman !
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 36]: Fifty-seven churches to be erected with half-crowns , forty-two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings , seven-and-twenty organs to be built with halfpence , twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 37]: Not that a half-crown , shilling , halfpenny , or postage stamp , would be particularly acceptable from Mr Boffin , but that it is so obvious he is the man to make up the deficiency .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 9]: And then the charities , my Christian brother !
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 20]: And mostly in difficulties , yet mostly lavish , too , in the expensive articles of print and paper .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 11]: Large fat private double letter , sealed with ducal coronet .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 6]: ` Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 76]: My Dear Sir , -- Having consented to preside at the forthcoming Annual Dinner of the Family Party Fund , and feeling deeply impressed with the immense usefulness of that noble Institution and the great importance of its being supported by a List of Stewards that shall prove to the public the interest taken in it by popular and distinguished men , I have undertaken to ask you to become a Steward on that occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 22]: Soliciting your favourable reply before the 14th instant , I am , My Dear Sir , Your faithful Servant , LINSEED .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 2]: P.S. .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 11]: The Steward 's fee is limited to three Guineas . '
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 44]: Friendly this , on the part of the Duke of Linseed -LRB- and thoughtful in the postscript -RRB- , only lithographed by the hundred and presenting but a pale individuality of an address to Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , in quite another hand .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 70]: It takes two noble Earls and a Viscount , combined , to inform Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , in an equally flattering manner , that an estimable lady in the West of England has offered to present a purse containing twenty pounds , to the Society for Granting Annuities to Unassuming Members of the Middle Classes , if twenty individuals will previously present purses of one hundred pounds each .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 60]: And those benevolent noblemen very kindly point out that if Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , should wish to present two or more purses , it will not be inconsistent with the design of the estimable lady in the West of England , provided each purse be coupled with the name of some member of his honoured and respected family .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 6]: These are the corporate beggars .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 28]: But there are , besides , the individual beggars ; and how does the heart of the Secretary fail him when he has to cope with THEM !
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 51]: And they must be coped with to some extent , because they all enclose documents -LRB- they call their scraps documents ; but they are , as to papers deserving the name , what minced veal is to a calf -RRB- , the non-return of which would be their ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 19]: That is say , they are utterly ruined now , but they would be more utterly ruined then .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 92]: Among these correspondents are several daughters of general officers , long accustomed to every luxury of life -LRB- except spelling -RRB- , who little thought , when their gallant fathers waged war in the Peninsula , that they would ever have to appeal to those whom Providence , in its inscrutable wisdom , has blessed with untold gold , and from among whom they select the name of Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , for a maiden effort in this wise , understanding that he has such a heart as never was .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 103]: The Secretary learns , too , that confidence between man and wife would seem to obtain but rarely when virtue is in distress , so numerous are the wives who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted husbands , who would never permit it ; while , on the other hand , so numerous are the husbands who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted wives , who would instantly go out of their senses if they had the least suspicion of the circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 8]: There are the inspired beggars , too .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 65]: These were sitting , only yesterday evening , musing over a fragment of candle which must soon go out and leave them in the dark for the rest of their nights , when surely some Angel whispered the name of Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , to their souls , imparting rays of hope , nay confidence , to which they had long been strangers !
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 8]: Akin to these are the suggestively-befriended beggars .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 70]: They were partaking of a cold potato and water by the flickering and gloomy light of a lucifer-match , in their lodgings -LRB- rent considerably in arrear , and heartless landlady threatening expulsion ` like a dog ' into the streets -RRB- , when a gifted friend happening to look in , said , ` Write immediately to Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , ' and would take no denial .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 8]: There are the nobly independent beggars too .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 133]: These , in the days of their abundance , ever regarded gold as dross , and have not yet got over that only impediment in the way of their amassing wealth , but they want no dross from Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire ; No , Mr Boffin ; the world may term it pride , paltry pride if you will , but they would n't take it if you offered it ; a loan , sir -- for fourteen weeks to the day , interest calculated at the rate of five per cent per annum , to be bestowed upon any charitable institution you may name -- is all they want of you , and if you have the meanness to refuse it , count on being despised by these great spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: There are the beggars of punctual business-habits too .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 69]: These will make an end of themselves at a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday , if no Postoffice order is in the interim received from Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire ; arriving after a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday , it need not be sent , as they will then -LRB- having made an exact memorandum of the heartless circumstances -RRB- be ` cold in death . '
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 18]: There are the beggars on horseback too , in another sense from the sense of the proverb .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 13]: These are mounted and ready to start on the highway to affluence .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 71]: The goal is before them , the road is in the best condition , their spurs are on , the steed is willing , but , at the last moment , for want of some special thing -- a clock , a violin , an astronomical telescope , an electrifying machine -- they must dismount for ever , unless they receive its equivalent in money from Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 12]: Less given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 66]: These , usually to be addressed in reply under initials at a country post-office , inquire in feminine hands , Dare one who can not disclose herself to Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , but whose name might startle him were it revealed , solicit the immediate advance of two hundred pounds from unexpected riches exercising their noblest privilege in the trust of a common humanity ?
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 21]: In such a Dismal Swamp does the new house stand , and through it does the Secretary daily struggle breast-high .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 53]: Not to mention all the people alive who have made inventions that wo n't act , and all the jobbers who job in all the jobberies jobbed ; though these may be regarded as the Alligators of the Dismal Swamp , and are always lying by to drag the Golden Dustman under .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 5]: But the old house .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 10]: There are no designs against the Golden Dustman there ?
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 13]: There are no fish of the shark tribe in the Bower waters ?
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 3]: Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 26]: Still , Wegg is established there , and would seem , judged by his secret proceedings , to cherish a notion of making a discovery .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 64]: For , when a man with a wooden leg lies prone on his stomach to peep under bedsteads ; and hops up ladders , like some extinct bird , to survey the tops of presses and cupboards ; and provides himself an iron rod which he is always poking and prodding into dust-mounds ; the probability is that he expects to find something .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 65]: BOOK THE SECOND BIRDS OF A FEATHER Chapter 1 OF AN EDUCATIONAL CHARACTER The school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a book -- the streets being , for pupils of his degree , the great Preparatory Establishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned without and before book -- was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 65]: Its atmosphere was oppressive and disagreeable ; it was crowded , noisy , and confusing ; half the pupils dropped asleep , or fell into a state of waking stupefaction ; the other half kept them in either condition by maintaining a monotonous droning noise , as if they were performing , out of time and tune , on a ruder sort of bagpipe .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 27]: The teachers , animated solely by good intentions , had no idea of execution , and a lamentable jumble was the upshot of their kind endeavours .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 13]: It was a school for all ages , and for both sexes .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 16]: The latter were kept apart , and the former were partitioned off into square assortments .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 20]: But , all the place was pervaded by a grimly ludicrous pretence that every pupil was childish and innocent .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 15]: This pretence , much favoured by the lady-visitors , led to the ghastliest absurdities .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 112]: Young women old in the vices of the commonest and worst life , were expected to profess themselves enthralled by the good child 's book , the Adventures of Little Margery , who resided in the village cottage by the mill ; severely reproved and morally squashed the miller , when she was five and he was fifty ; divided her porridge with singing birds ; denied herself a new nankeen bonnet , on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets , neither did the sheep who ate them ; who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations to all comers , at all sorts of unseasonable times .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 58]: So , unwieldy young dredgers and hulking mudlarks were referred to the experiences of Thomas Twopence , who , having resolved not to rob -LRB- under circumstances of uncommon atrocity -RRB- his particular friend and benefactor , of eighteenpence , presently came into supernatural possession of three and sixpence , and lived a shining light ever afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 12]: -LRB- Note , that the benefactor came to no good . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 50]: Several swaggering sinners had written their own biographies in the same strain ; it always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons , that you were to do good , not because it WAS good , but because you were to make a good thing of it .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 64]: Contrariwise , the adult pupils were taught to read -LRB- if they could learn -RRB- out of the New Testament ; and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn , were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history , as if they had never seen or heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 33]: An exceedingly and confoundingly perplexing jumble of a school , in fact , where black spirits and grey , red spirits and white , jumbled jumbled jumbled jumbled , jumbled every night .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 6]: And particularly every Sunday night .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 32]: For then , an inclined plane of unfortunate infants would be handed over to the prosiest and worst of all the teachers with good intentions , whom nobody older would endure .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 27]: Who , taking his stand on the floor before them as chief executioner , would be attended by a conventional volunteer boy as executioner 's assistant .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 58]: When and where it first became the conventional system that a weary or inattentive infant in a class must have its face smoothed downward with a hot hand , or when and where the conventional volunteer boy first beheld such system in operation , and became inflamed with a sacred zeal to administer it , matters not .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 68]: It was the function of the chief executioner to hold forth , and it was the function of the acolyte to dart at sleeping infants , yawning infants , restless infants , whimpering infants , and smooth their wretched faces ; sometimes with one hand , as if he were anointing them for a whisker ; sometimes with both hands , applied after the fashion of blinkers .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 110]: And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a mortal hour ; the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr , let us say , for example , about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre ; and repeating the word Sepulchre -LRB- commonly used among infants -RRB- five hundred times , and never once hinting what it meant ; the conventional boy smoothing away right and left , as an infallible commentary ; the whole hot-bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles , rashes , whooping-cough , fever , and stomach disorders , as if they were assembled in High Market for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 57]: Even in this temple of good intentions , an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn , could learn something , and , having learned it , could impart it much better than the teachers ; as being more knowing than they , and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards the shrewder pupils .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 32]: In this way it had come about that Charley Hexam had risen in the jumble , taught in the jumble , and been received from the jumble into a better school .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 14]: ` So you want to go and see your sister , Hexam ? '
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 10]: ` If you please , Mr Headstone . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 10]: I have half a mind to go with you .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 7]: Where does your sister live ? '
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 12]: ` Why , she is not settled yet , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 23]: I 'd rather you did n't see her till she is settled , if it was all the same to you . '
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 7]: ` Look here , Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 31]: Mr Bradley Headstone , highly certificated stipendiary schoolmaster , drew his right forefinger through one of the buttonholes of the boy 's coat , and looked at it attentively . '
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 12]: I hope your sister may be good company for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 12]: ` Why do you doubt it , Mr Headstone ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 9]: I did not say I doubted it . '
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 12]: ` No , sir ; you did n't say so . '
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 31]: Bradley Headstone looked at his finger again , took it out of the buttonhole and looked at it closer , bit the side of it and looked at it again .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 13]: ` You see , Hexam , you will be one of us .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 17]: In good time you are sure to pass a creditable examination and become one of us .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 53]: Then the question is -- ' The boy waited so long for the question , while the schoolmaster looked at a new side of his finger , and bit it , and looked at it again , that at length the boy repeated : ` The question is , sir -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 11]: ` Whether you had not better leave well alone . '
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 15]: ` Is it well to leave my sister alone , Mr Headstone ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 12]: I do not say so , because I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 6]: I put it to you .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 8]: I ask you to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 6]: I want you to consider .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 10]: You know how well you are doing here . '
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 18]: ` After all , she got me here , ' said the boy , with a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 23]: ` Perceiving the necessity of it , ' acquiesced the schoolmaster , ` and making up her mind fully to the separation .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 23]: The boy , with a return of that former reluctance or struggle or whatever it was , seemed to debate with himself .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 35]: At length he said , raising his eyes to the master 's face : ' I wish you 'd come with me and see her , Mr Headstone , though she is not settled .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 22]: I wish you 'd come with me , and take her in the rough , and judge her for yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 20]: ` You are sure you would not like , ' asked the schoolmaster , ` to prepare her ? '
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 20]: ` My sister Lizzie , ' said the boy , proudly , ` wants no preparing , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 13]: What she is , she is , and shows herself to be .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 9]: There 's no pretending about my sister . '
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 20]: His confidence in her , sat more easily upon him than the indecision with which he had twice contended .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 22]: It was his better nature to be true to her , if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 11]: And as yet the better nature had the stronger hold .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 15]: ` Well , I can spare the evening , ' said the schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 9]: I am ready to walk with you . '
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 8]: And I am ready to go . '
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 55]: Bradley Headstone , in his decent black coat and waistcoat , and decent white shirt , and decent formal black tie , and decent pantaloons of pepper and salt , with his decent silver watch in his pocket and its decent hair-guard round his neck , looked a thoroughly decent young man of six-and-twenty .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 44]: He was never seen in any other dress , and yet there was a certain stiffness in his manner of wearing this , as if there were a want of adaptation between him and it , recalling some mechanics in their holiday clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 12]: He had acquired mechanically a great store of teacher 's knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 26]: He could do mental arithmetic mechanically , sing at sight mechanically , blow various wind instruments mechanically , even play the great church organ mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 16]: From his early childhood up , his mind had been a place of mechanical stowage .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 105]: The arrangement of his wholesale warehouse , so that it might be always ready to meet the demands of retail dealers history here , geography there , astronomy to the right , political economy to the left -- natural history , the physical sciences , figures , music , the lower mathematics , and what not , all in their several places -- this care had imparted to his countenance a look of care ; while the habit of questioning and being questioned had given him a suspicious manner , or a manner that would be better described as one of lying in wait .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 11]: There was a kind of settled trouble in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 35]: It was the face belonging to a naturally slow or inattentive intellect that had toiled hard to get what it had won , and that had to hold it now that it was gotten .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 23]: He always seemed to be uneasy lest anything should be missing from his mental warehouse , and taking stock to assure himself .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 22]: Suppression of so much to make room for so much , had given him a constrained manner , over and above .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 61]: Yet there was enough of what was animal , and of what was fiery -LRB- though smouldering -RRB- , still visible in him , to suggest that if young Bradley Headstone , when a pauper lad , had chanced to be told off for the sea , he would not have been the last man in a ship 's crew .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 21]: Regarding that origin of his , he was proud , moody , and sullen , desiring it to be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 7]: And few people knew of it .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 16]: In some visits to the Jumble his attention had been attracted to this boy Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 22]: An undeniable boy for a pupil-teacher ; an undeniable boy to do credit to the master who should bring him on .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 21]: Combined with this consideration , there may have been some thought of the pauper lad now never to be mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 36]: Be that how it might , he had with pains gradually worked the boy into his own school , and procured him some offices to discharge there , which were repaid with food and lodging .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 19]: Such were the circumstances that had brought together , Bradley Headstone and young Charley Hexam that autumn evening .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 22]: Autumn , because full half a year had come and gone since the bird of prey lay dead upon the river-shore .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 47]: The schools -- for they were twofold , as the sexes -- were down in that district of the flat country tending to the Thames , where Kent and Surrey meet , and where the railways still bestride the marketgardens that will soon die under them .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 39]: The schools were newly built , and there were so many like them all over the country , that one might have thought the whole were but one restless edifice with the locomotive gift of Aladdin 's palace .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 109]: They were in a neighbourhood which looked like a toy neighbourhood taken in blocks out of a box by a child of particularly incoherent mind , and set up anyhow ; here , one side of a new street ; there , a large solitary public-house facing nowhere ; here , another unfinished street already in ruins ; there , a church ; here , an immense new warehouse ; there , a dilapidated old country villa ; then , a medley of black ditch , sparkling cucumber-frame , rank field , richly cultivated kitchen-garden , brick viaduct , arch-spanned canal , and disorder of frowziness and fog .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 16]: As if the child had given the table a kick , and gone to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 48]: But , even among school-buildings , school-teachers , and schoolpupils , all according to pattern and all engendered in the light of the latest Gospel according to Monotony , the older pattern into which so many fortunes have been shaped for good and evil , comes out .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 20]: It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress , watering her flowers , as Mr Bradley Headstone walked forth .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 44]: It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress , watering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official residence , with little windows like the eyes in needles , and little doors like the covers of school-books .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 20]: Small , shining , neat , methodical , and buxom was Miss Peecher ; cherry-cheeked and tuneful of voice .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 35]: A little pincushion , a little housewife , a little book , a little workbox , a little set of tables and weights and measures , and a little woman , all in one .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 43]: She could write a little essay on any subject , exactly a slate long , beginning at the left-hand top of one side and ending at the right-hand bottom of the other , and the essay should be strictly according to rule .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 39]: If Mr Bradley Headstone had addressed a written proposal of marriage to her , she would probably have replied in a complete little essay on the theme exactly a slate long , but would certainly have replied Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 5]: For she loved him .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 24]: The decent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent silver watch was an object of envy to her .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 15]: So would Miss Peecher have gone round his neck and taken care of him .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 5]: Of him , insensible .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 8]: Because he did not love Miss Peecher .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 51]: Miss Peecher 's favourite pupil , who assisted her in her little household , was in attendance with a can of water to replenish her little watering-pot , and sufficiently divined the state of Miss Peecher 's affections to feel it necessary that she herself should love young Charley Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 28]: So , there was a double palpitation among the double stocks and double wall-flowers , when the master and the boy looked over the little gate . '
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 13]: A fine evening , Miss Peecher , ' said the Master . '
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 13]: A very fine evening , Mr Headstone , ' said Miss Peecher .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 8]: ` Are you taking a walk ? '
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 13]: ` Hexam and I are going to take a long walk . '
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 15]: ` Charming weather , ' remarked Miss Peecher , FOR a long walk . '
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 15]: ` Ours is rather on business than mere pleasure , ' said the Master .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 54]: Miss Peecher inverting her watering-pot , and very carefully shaking out the few last drops over a flower , as if there were some special virtue in them which would make it a Jack 's beanstalk before morning , called for replenishment to her pupil , who had been speaking to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 11]: ` Good-night , Miss Peecher , ' said the Master .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 11]: ` Good-night , Mr Headstone , ' said the Mistress .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 62]: The pupil had been , in her state of pupilage , so imbued with the class-custom of stretching out an arm , as if to hail a cab or omnibus , whenever she found she had an observation on hand to offer to Miss Peecher , that she often did it in their domestic relations ; and she did it now .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 7]: ` Well , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 4]: said Miss Peecher .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 18]: ` If you please , ma'am , Hexam said they were going to see his sister . '
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 27]: ` But that ca n't be , I think , ' returned Miss Peecher : ` because Mr Headstone can have no business with HER . '
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 5]: Mary Anne again hailed .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 7]: ` Well , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 15]: ` If you please , ma'am , perhaps it 's Hexam 's business ? '
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 11]: ` That may be , ' said Miss Peecher . '
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 7]: I did n't think of that .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 8]: Not that it matters at all . '
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 5]: Mary Anne again hailed .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 7]: ` Well , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 9]: ` They say she 's very handsome . '
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 10]: ` Oh , Mary Anne , Mary Anne ! '
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 39]: returned Miss Peecher , slightly colouring and shaking her head , a little out of humour ; ` how often have I told you not to use that vague expression , not to speak in that general way ?
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 11]: When you say THEY say , what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 6]: Part of speech They ? '
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 26]: Mary Anne hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand , as being under examination , and replied : ` Personal pronoun . '
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 6]: ` Person , They ? '
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 5]: ` Third person . '
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 6]: ` Number , They ? '
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 5]: ` Plural number . '
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 11]: ` Then how many do you mean , Mary Anne ?
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 2]: Two ?
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 5]: Or more ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 37]: I beg your pardon , ma'am , ' said Mary Anne , disconcerted now she came to think of it ; ` but I do n't know that I mean more than her brother himself . '
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 11]: As she said it , she unhooked her arm . '
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 14]: I felt convinced of it , ' returned Miss Peecher , smiling again .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 12]: ` Now pray , Mary Anne , be careful another time .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 11]: He says is very different from they say , remember .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 8]: Difference between he says and they say ?
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 5]: Give it me . '
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 43]: Mary Anne immediately hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand -- an attitude absolutely necessary to the situation -- and replied : ` One is indicative mood , present tense , third person singular , verb active to say .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 18]: Other is indicative mood , present tense , third person plural , verb active to say . '
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 9]: ` Why verb active , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 17]: ` Because it takes a pronoun after it in the objective case , Miss Peecher . '
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 13]: ` Very good indeed , ' remarked Miss Peecher , with encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 9]: ` In fact , could not be better .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 14]: Do n't forget to apply it , another time , Mary Anne . '
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 58]: This said , Miss Peecher finished the watering of her flowers , and went into her little official residence , and took a refresher of the principal rivers and mountains of the world , their breadths , depths , and heights , before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for her own personal occupation .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 29]: Bradley Headstone and Charley Hexam duly got to the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge , and crossed the bridge , and made along the Middlesex shore towards Millbank .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 63]: In this region are a certain little street called Church Street , and a certain little blind square , called Smith Square , in the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church with four towers at the four corners , generally resembling some petrified monster , frightful and gigantic , on its back with its legs in the air .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 29]: They found a tree near by in a corner , and a blacksmith 's forge , and a timber yard , and a dealer 's in old iron .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 34]: What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying half-buried in the dealer 's forecourt , nobody seemed to know or to want to know .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 25]: Like the Miller of questionable jollity in the song , They cared for Nobody , no not they , and Nobody cared for them .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 60]: After making the round of this place , and noting that there was a deadly kind of repose on it , more as though it had taken laudanum than fallen into a natural rest , they stopped at the point where the street and the square joined , and where there were some little quiet houses in a row .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 16]: To these Charley Hexam finally led the way , and at one of these stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 11]: ` This must be where my sister lives , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 17]: This is where she came for a temporary lodging , soon after father 's death . '
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 10]: ` How often have you seen her since ? '
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 30]: ` Why , only twice , sir , ' returned the boy , with his former reluctance ; ` but that 's as much her doing as mine . '
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 8]: ` How does she support herself ? '
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 20]: ` She was always a fair needlewoman , and she keeps the stockroom of a seaman 's outfitter . '
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 12]: ` Does she ever work at her own lodging here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 22]: ` Sometimes ; but her regular hours and regular occupation are at their place of business , I believe , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 6]: This is the number . '
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 19]: The boy knocked at a door , and the door promptly opened with a spring and a click .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 44]: A parlour door within a small entry stood open , and disclosed a child -- a dwarf -- a girl -- a something -- sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair , which had a kind of little working bench before it . '
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 24]: I ca n't get up , ' said the child , ` because my back 's bad , and my legs are queer .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 10]: But I 'm the person of the house . '
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 8]: ` Who else is at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 6]: asked Charley Hexam , staring .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 29]: ` Nobody 's at home at present , ' returned the child , with a glib assertion of her dignity , ` except the person of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 10]: What did you want , young man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 8]: I wanted to see my sister . '
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 12]: ` Many young men have sisters , ' returned the child .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 10]: ` Give me your name , young man ? '
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 33]: The queer little figure , and the queer but not ugly little face , with its bright grey eyes , were so sharp , that the sharpness of the manner seemed unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 15]: As if , being turned out of that mould , it must be sharp .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 7]: ` Hexam is my name . '
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 6]: ` Ah , indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 8]: said the person of the house . '
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 6]: I thought it might be .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 14]: Your sister will be in , in about a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 8]: I am very fond of your sister .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 6]: She 's my particular friend .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 4]: Take a seat .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 7]: And this gentleman 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 8]: ` Mr Headstone , my schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 5]: ` Take a seat .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 11]: And would you please to shut the street door first ?
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 24]: I ca n't very well do it myself ; because my back 's so bad , and my legs are so queer . '
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 40]: They complied in silence , and the little figure went on with its work of gumming or gluing together with a camel 's - hair brush certain pieces of cardboard and thin wood , previously cut into various shapes .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 51]: The scissors and knives upon the bench showed that the child herself had cut them ; and the bright scraps of velvet and silk and ribbon also strewn upon the bench showed that when duly stuffed -LRB- and stuffing too was there -RRB- , she was to cover them smartly .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 50]: The dexterity of her nimble fingers was remarkable , and , as she brought two thin edges accurately together by giving them a little bite , she would glance at the visitors out of the corners of her grey eyes with a look that out-sharpened all her other sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 28]: ` You ca n't tell me the name of my trade , I 'll be bound , ' she said , after taking several of these observations .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 9]: ` You make pincushions , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 8]: ` What else do I make ? '
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 8]: ` Pen-wipers , ' said Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 6]: What else do I make ?
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 13]: You 're a schoolmaster , but you ca n't tell me . '
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 30]: ` You do something , ' he returned , pointing to a corner of the little bench , ` with straw ; but I do n't know what . '
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 6]: ` Well done you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 8]: cried the person of the house . '
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 13]: I only make pincushions and pen-wipers , to use up my waste .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 10]: But my straw really does belong to my business .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 3]: Try again .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 9]: What do I make with my straw ? '
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 5]: ` Dinner-mats ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 7]: A schoolmaster , and says dinner-mats !
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 16]: I 'll give you a clue to my trade , in a game of forfeits .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 53]: I love my love with a B because she 's Beautiful ; I hate my love with a B because she is Brazen ; I took her to the sign of the Blue Boar , and I treated her with Bonnets ; her name 's Bouncer , and she lives in Bedlam .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 12]: -- Now , what do I make with my straw ? '
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 6]: ` Ladies ' bonnets ? '
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 16]: ` Fine ladies ' , ' said the person of the house , nodding assent .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 4]: ` Dolls ' .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 9]: I 'm a Doll 's Dressmaker . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 9]: I hope it 's a good business ? '
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 13]: The person of the house shrugged her shoulders and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 3]: Poorly paid .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 9]: And I 'm often so pressed for time !
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 17]: I had a doll married , last week , and was obliged to work all night .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 23]: And it 's not good for me , on account of my back being so bad and my legs so queer . '
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 31]: They looked at the little creature with a wonder that did not diminish , and the schoolmaster said : ' I am sorry your fine ladies are so inconsiderate . '
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 21]: ` It 's the way with them , ' said the person of the house , shrugging her shoulders again .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 21]: ` And they take no care of their clothes , and they never keep to the same fashions a month .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 9]: I work for a doll with three daughters .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 12]: Bless you , she 's enough to ruin her husband ! '
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 25]: The person of the house gave a weird little laugh here , and gave them another look out of the corners of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 25]: She had an elfin chin that was capable of great expression ; and whenever she gave this look , she hitched this chin up .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 14]: As if her eyes and her chin worked together on the same wires .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 12]: ` Are you always as busy as you are now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 3]: ` Busier .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 6]: I 'm slack just now .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 11]: I finished a large mourning order the day before yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 10]: Doll I work for , lost a canary-bird . '
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 32]: The person of the house gave another little laugh , and then nodded her head several times , as who should moralize , ` Oh this world , this world ! '
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 8]: ` Are you alone all day ? '
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 4]: asked Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 11]: ` Do n't any of the neighbouring children -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 6]: ` Ah , lud ! '
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 20]: cried the person of the house , with a little scream , as if the word had pricked her .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 7]: ` Do n't talk of children .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 6]: I ca n't bear children .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 9]: I know their tricks and their manners . '
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 17]: She said this with an angry little shake of her tight fist close before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 28]: Perhaps it scarcely required the teacher-habit , to perceive that the doll 's dressmaker was inclined to be bitter on the difference between herself and other children .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 9]: But both master and pupil understood it so .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 24]: ` Always running about and screeching , always playing and fighting , always skip-skip-skipping on the pavement and chalking it for their games !
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 9]: I know their tricks and their manners ! '
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 7]: Shaking the little fist as before .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 7]: ` And that 's not all .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 21]: Ever so often calling names in through a person 's keyhole , and imitating a person 's back and legs .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 8]: I know their tricks and their manners .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 14]: And I 'll tell you what I 'd do , to punish 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 18]: There 's doors under the church in the Square -- black doors , leading into black vaults .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 34]: I 'd open one of those doors , and I 'd cram 'em all in , and then I 'd lock the door and through the keyhole I 'd blow in pepper . '
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 12]: ` What would be the good of blowing in pepper ? '
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 4]: asked Charley Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 21]: ` To set 'em sneezing , ' said the person of the house , ` and make their eyes water .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 17]: And when they were all sneezing and inflamed , I 'd mock 'em through the keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 21]: Just as they , with their tricks and their manners , mock a person through a person 's keyhole ! '
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 39]: An uncommonly emphatic shake of her little fist close before her eyes , seemed to ease the mind of the person of the house ; for she added with recovered composure , ` No , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 5]: No children for me .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 5]: Give me grown-ups . '
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 34]: It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature , for her poor figure furnished no clue to it , and her face was at once so young and so old .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 15]: Twelve , or at the most thirteen , might be near the mark . '
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 19]: I always did like grown-ups , ' she went on , ` and always kept company with them .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 3]: So sensible .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 4]: Sit so quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 8]: Do n't go prancing and capering about !
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 14]: And I mean always to keep among none but grown-ups till I marry .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 17]: I suppose I must make up my mind to marry , one of these days . '
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 21]: She listened to a step outside that caught her ear , and there was a soft knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 33]: Pulling at a handle within her reach , she said , with a pleased laugh : ` Now here , for instance , is a grown-up that 's my particular friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 11]: and Lizzie Hexam in a black dress entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 3]: You ! '
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 24]: Taking him to her arms in the old way -- of which he seemed a little ashamed -- she saw no one else .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 14]: ` There , there , there , Liz , all right my dear .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 2]: See !
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 9]: Here 's Mr Headstone come with me . '
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 33]: Her eyes met those of the schoolmaster , who had evidently expected to see a very different sort of person , and a murmured word or two of salutation passed between them .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 19]: She was a little flurried by the unexpected visit , and the schoolmaster was not at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 8]: But he never was , quite . '
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 30]: I told Mr Headstone you were not settled , Liz , but he was so kind as to take an interest in coming , and so I brought him .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 6]: How well you look ! '
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 6]: Bradley seemed to think so .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 9]: Do n't she , do n't she ? '
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 19]: cried the person of the house , resuming her occupation , though the twilight was falling fast . '
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 6]: I believe you she does !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 26]: But go on with your chat , one and all : You one two three , My com-pa-nie , And do n't mind me . '
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 14]: -- pointing this impromptu rhyme with three points of her thin forefinger . '
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 17]: I did n't expect a visit from you , Charley , ' said his sister . '
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 31]: I supposed that if you wanted to see me you would have sent to me , appointing me to come somewhere near the school , as I did last time .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 33]: I saw my brother near the school , sir , ' to Bradley Headstone , ` because it 's easier for me to go there , than for him to come here .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 10]: I work about midway between the two places . '
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 21]: ` You do n't see much of one another , ' said Bradley , not improving in respect of ease .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 9]: With a rather sad shake of her head .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 10]: ` Charley always does well , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 7]: ` He could not do better .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 12]: I regard his course as quite plain before him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 4]: I hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 5]: I am so thankful .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 9]: So well done of you , Charley dear !
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 21]: It is better for me not to come -LRB- except when he wants me -RRB- between him and his prospects .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 8]: You think so , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 49]: Conscious that his pupil-teacher was looking for his answer , that he himself had suggested the boy 's keeping aloof from this sister , now seen for the first time face to face , Bradley Headstone stammered : ` Your brother is very much occupied , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 6]: He has to work hard .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 22]: One can not but say that the less his attention is diverted from his work , the better for his future .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 18]: When he shall have established himself , why then -- it will be another thing then . '
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 24]: Lizzie shook her head again , and returned , with a quiet smile : ' I always advised him as you advise him .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 7]: Did I not , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 13]: ` Well , never mind that now , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 8]: ` How are you getting on ? '
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 6]: ` Very well , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 6]: I want for nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 9]: ` You have your own room here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 4]: ` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 2]: Upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 12]: And it 's quiet , and pleasant , and airy . '
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 50]: ` And she always has the use of this room for visitors , ' said the person of the house , screwing up one of her little bony fists , like an opera-glass , and looking through it , with her eyes and her chin in that quaint accordance .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 15]: ` Always this room for visitors ; have n't you , Lizzie dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 25]: It happened that Bradley Headstone noticed a very slight action of Lizzie Hexam 's hand , as though it checked the doll 's dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 44]: And it happened that the latter noticed him in the same instant ; for she made a double eyeglass of her two hands , looked at him through it , and cried , with a waggish shake of her head : ` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 8]: Caught you spying , did I ? '
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 48]: It might have fallen out so , any way ; but Bradley Headstone also noticed that immediately after this , Lizzie , who had not taken off her bonnet , rather hurriedly proposed that as the room was getting dark they should go out into the air .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 38]: They went out ; the visitors saying good-night to the doll 's dressmaker , whom they left , leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed , singing to herself in a sweet thoughtful little voice .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 13]: ` I 'll saunter on by the river , ' said Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 10]: ` You will be glad to talk together . '
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 39]: As his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows , the boy said to his sister , petulantly : ` When are you going to settle yourself in some Christian sort of place , Liz ?
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 13]: I thought you were going to do it before now . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 11]: I am very well where I am , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 7]: ` Very well where you are !
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 11]: I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with me .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 15]: How came you to get into such company as that little witch 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 12]: ` By chance at first , as it seemed , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 28]: But I think it must have been by something more than chance , for that child -- You remember the bills upon the walls at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 10]: ` Confound the bills upon the walls at home !
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 29]: I want to forget the bills upon the walls at home , and it would be better for you to do the same , ' grumbled the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 8]: ` Well ; what of them ? '
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 12]: ` This child is the grandchild of the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 6]: ` What old man ? '
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 16]: ` The terrible drunken old man , in the list slippers and the nightcap . '
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 35]: The boy asked , rubbing his nose in a manner that half expressed vexation at hearing so much , and half curiosity to hear more : ` How came you to make that out ?
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 7]: What a girl you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 25]: ` The child 's father is employed by the house that employs me ; that 's how I came to know it , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 21]: The father is like his own father , a weak wretched trembling creature , falling to pieces , never sober .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 12]: But a good workman too , at the work he does .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 5]: The mother is dead .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 31]: This poor ailing little creature has come to be what she is , surrounded by drunken people from her cradle -- if she ever had one , Charley . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 21]: I do n't see what you have to do with her , for all that , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 8]: ` Do n't you , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 8]: The boy looked doggedly at the river .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 13]: They were at Millbank , and the river rolled on their left .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 14]: His sister gently touched him on the shoulder , and pointed to it .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 16]: ` Any compensation -- restitution -- never mind the word , you know my meaning .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 5]: Father 's grave . '
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 9]: But he did not respond with any tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 44]: After a moody silence he broke out in an ill-used tone : ` It 'll be a very hard thing , Liz , if , when I am trying my best to get up in the world , you pull me back . '
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 6]: ` I , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 7]: ` Yes , you , Liz .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 9]: Why ca n't you let bygones be bygones ?
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 22]: Why ca n't you , as Mr Headstone said to me this very evening about another matter , leave well alone ?
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 25]: What we have got to do , is , to turn our faces full in our new direction , and keep straight on . '
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 6]: ` And never look back ?
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 10]: Not even to try to make some amends ? '
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 17]: ` You are such a dreamer , ' said the boy , with his former petulance .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 36]: ` It was all very well when we sat before the fire -- when we looked into the hollow down by the flare -- but we are looking into the real world , now . '
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 16]: ` Ah , we were looking into the real world then , Charley ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 16]: I understand what you mean by that , but you are not justified in it .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 16]: I do n't want , as I raise myself to shake you off , Liz .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 9]: I want to carry you up with me .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 13]: That 's what I want to do , and mean to do .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 7]: I know what I owe you .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 20]: I said to Mr Headstone this very evening , `` After all , my sister got me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 4]: Well , then .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 11]: Do n't pull me back , and hold me down .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 14]: That 's all I ask , and surely that 's not unconscionable . '
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 24]: She had kept a steadfast look upon him , and she answered with composure : ' I am not here selfishly , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 14]: To please myself I could not be too far from that river . '
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 13]: ` Nor could you be too far from it to please me .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 8]: Let us get quit of it equally .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 11]: Why should you linger about it any more than I ?
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 9]: I give it a wide berth . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 22]: I ca n't get away from it , I think , ' said Lizzie , passing her hand across her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 15]: ` It 's no purpose of mine that I live by it still . '
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 7]: ` There you go , Liz !
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 3]: Dreaming again !
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 56]: You lodge yourself of your own accord in a house with a drunken -- tailor , I suppose -- or something of the sort , and a little crooked antic of a child , or old person , or whatever it is , and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 8]: Now , do be more practical . '
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 35]: She had been practical enough with him , in suffering and striving for him ; but she only laid her hand upon his shoulder -- not reproachfully -- and tapped it twice or thrice .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 24]: She had been used to do so , to soothe him when she carried him about , a child as heavy as herself .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 6]: Tears started to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 39]: ` Upon my word , Liz , ' drawing the back of his hand across them , ' I mean to be a good brother to you , and to prove that I know what I owe you .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 20]: All I say is , that I hope you 'll control your fancies a little , on my account .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 31]: I 'll get a school , and then you must come and live with me , and you 'll have to control your fancies then , so why not now ?
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 10]: Now , say I have n't vexed you . '
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 12]: ` You have n't , Charley , you have n't . '
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 10]: ` And say I have n't hurt you . '
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 8]: ` You have n't , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 7]: But this answer was less ready .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 11]: ` Say you are sure I did n't mean to .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 23]: There 's Mr Headstone stopping and looking over the wall at the tide , to hint that it 's time to go .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 18]: Kiss me , and tell me that you know I did n't mean to hurt you . '
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 19]: She told him so , and they embraced , and walked on and came up with the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 22]: ` But we go your sister 's way , ' he remarked , when the boy told him he was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 14]: And with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stiffly offered her his arm .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 13]: Her hand was just within it , when she drew it back .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 25]: He looked round with a start , as if he thought she had detected something that repelled her , in the momentary touch . '
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 12]: I will not go in just yet , ' said Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 17]: ` And you have a distance before you , and will walk faster without me . '
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 48]: Being by this time close to Vauxhall Bridge , they resolved , in consequence , to take that way over the Thames , and they left her ; Bradley Headstone giving her his hand at parting , and she thanking him for his care of her brother .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 12]: The master and the pupil walked on , rapidly and silently .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 34]: They had nearly crossed the bridge , when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards them , with a cigar in his mouth , his coat thrown back , and his hands behind him .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 41]: Something in the careless manner of this person , and in a certain lazily arrogant air with which he approached , holding possession of twice as much pavement as another would have claimed , instantly caught the boy 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 20]: As the gentleman passed the boy looked at him narrowly , and then stood still , looking after him .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 10]: ` Who is it that you stare after ? '
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 3]: asked Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 4]: ` Why ! '
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 22]: said the boy , with a confused and pondering frown upon his face , ` It IS that Wrayburn one ! '
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 16]: Bradley Headstone scrutinized the boy as closely as the boy had scrutinized the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 23]: I beg your pardon , Mr Headstone , but I could n't help wondering what in the world brought HIM here ! '
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 49]: Though he said it as if his wonder were past -- at the same time resuming the walk -- it was not lost upon the master that he looked over his shoulder after speaking , and that the same perplexed and pondering frown was heavy on his face .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 14]: ` You do n't appear to like your friend , Hexam ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 11]: I DO N'T like him , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 28]: ` He took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way , the first time I ever saw him , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 6]: ` Again , why ? '
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 4]: ` For nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 25]: Or -- it 's much the same -- because something I happened to say about my sister did n't happen to please him . '
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 8]: ` Then he knows your sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 17]: ` He did n't at that time , ' said the boy , still moodily pondering .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 5]: ` Does now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 44]: The boy had so lost himself that he looked at Mr Bradley Headstone as they walked on side by side , without attempting to reply until the question had been repeated ; then he nodded and answered , ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 11]: ` Going to see her , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 7]: ` It ca n't be ! '
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 6]: said the boy , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 9]: ` He does n't know her well enough .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 10]: I should like to catch him at it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 45]: When they had walked on for a time , more rapidly than before , the master said , clasping the pupil 's arm between the elbow and the shoulder with his hand : ` You were going to tell me something about that person .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 9]: What did you say his name was ? '
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 3]: ` Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 4]: Mr Eugene Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 13]: He is what they call a barrister , with nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 16]: The first time be came to our old place was when my father was alive .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 28]: He came on business ; not that it was HIS business -- HE never had any business -- he was brought by a friend of his . '
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 7]: ` And the other times ? '
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 12]: ` There was only one other time that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 17]: When my father was killed by accident , he chanced to be one of the finders .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 22]: He was mooning about , I suppose , taking liberties with people 's chins ; but there he was , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 29]: He brought the news home to my sister early in the morning , and brought Miss Abbey Potterson , a neighbour , to help break it to her .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 42]: He was mooning about the house when I was fetched home in the afternoon -- they did n't know where to find me till my sister could be brought round sufficiently to tell them -- and then he mooned away . '
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 7]: ` And is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 8]: ` That 's all , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 25]: Bradley Headstone gradually released the boy 's arm , as if he were thoughtful , and they walked on side by side as before .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 13]: After a long silence between them , Bradley resumed the talk . '
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 28]: I suppose -- your sister -- ' with a curious break both before and after the words , ` has received hardly any teaching , Hexam ? '
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 7]: ` Hardly any , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 12]: ` Sacrificed , no doubt , to her father 's objections .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 7]: I remember them in your case .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 15]: Yet -- your sister -- scarcely looks or speaks like an ignorant person . '
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 13]: ` Lizzie has as much thought as the best , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 8]: Too much , perhaps , without teaching .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 36]: I used to call the fire at home , her books , for she was always full of fancies -- sometimes quite wise fancies , considering -- when she sat looking at it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 11]: I do n't like that , ' said Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 34]: His pupil was a little surprised by this striking in with so sudden and decided and emotional an objection , but took it as a proof of the master 's interest in himself .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 107]: It emboldened him to say : ' I have never brought myself to mention it openly to you , Mr Headstone , and you 're my witness that I could n't even make up my mind to take it from you before we came out to-night ; but it 's a painful thing to think that if I get on as well as you hope , I shall be -- I wo n't say disgraced , because I do n't mean disgraced -- but -- rather put to the blush if it was known -- by a sister who has been very good to me . '
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 39]: ` Yes , ' said Bradley Headstone in a slurring way , for his mind scarcely seemed to touch that point , so smoothly did it glide to another , ` and there is this possibility to consider .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 71]: Some man who had worked his way might come to admire -- your sister -- and might even in time bring himself to think of marrying -- your sister -- and it would be a sad drawback and a heavy penalty upon him , if ; overcoming in his mind other inequalities of condition and other considerations against it , this inequality and this consideration remained in full force . '
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 11]: ` That 's much my own meaning , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 19]: ` Ay , ay , ' said Bradley Headstone , ` but you spoke of a mere brother .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 40]: Now , the case I have supposed would be a much stronger case ; because an admirer , a husband , would form the connexion voluntarily , besides being obliged to proclaim it : which a brother is not .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 36]: After all , you know , it must be said of you that you could n't help yourself : while it would be said of him , with equal reason , that he could . '
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 7]: ` That 's true , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 29]: Sometimes since Lizzie was left free by father 's death , I have thought that such a young woman might soon acquire more than enough to pass muster .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 39]: And sometimes I have even thought that perhaps Miss Peecher -- ' ` For the purpose , I would advise Not Miss Peecher , ' Bradley Headstone struck in with a recurrence of his late decision of manner .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 18]: ` Would you be so kind as to think of it for me , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 7]: ` Yes , Hexam , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 6]: I 'll think of it .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 7]: I 'll think maturely of it .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 8]: I 'll think well of it . '
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 16]: Their walk was almost a silent one afterwards , until it ended at the school-house .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 56]: There , one of neat Miss Peecher 's little windows , like the eyes in needles , was illuminated , and in a corner near it sat Mary Anne watching , while Miss Peecher at the table stitched at the neat little body she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 22]: N.B. Miss Peecher and Miss Peecher 's pupils were not much encouraged in the unscholastic art of needlework , by Government .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 14]: Mary Anne with her face to the window , held her arm up .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 7]: ` Well , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 9]: ` Mr Headstone coming home , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 10]: In about a minute , Mary Anne again hailed .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 7]: ` Yes , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 11]: ` Gone in and locked his door , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 42]: Miss Peecher repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed , and transfixed that part of her dress where her heart would have been if she had had the dress on , with a sharp , sharp needle .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 39]: Chapter 2 STILL EDUCATIONAL The person of the house , doll 's dressmaker and manufacturer of ornamental pincushions and pen-wipers , sat in her quaint little low arm-chair , singing in the dark , until Lizzie came back .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 27]: The person of the house had attained that dignity while yet of very tender years indeed , through being the only trustworthy person IN the house .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 14]: ` Well Lizzie-Mizzie-Wizzie , ' said she , breaking off in her song .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 10]: ` what 's the news out of doors ? '
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 9]: ` What 's the news in doors ? '
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 25]: returned Lizzie , playfully smoothing the bright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the head of the doll 's dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 10]: ` Let me see , said the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 17]: Why the last news is , that I do n't mean to marry your brother . '
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 11]: ` No-o , ' shaking her head and her chin .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 8]: ` Do n't like the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 11]: ` What do you say to his master ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 10]: I say that I think he 's bespoke . '
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 18]: Lizzie finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen shoulders , and then lighted a candle .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 14]: It showed the little parlour to be dingy , but orderly and clean .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 42]: She stood it on the mantelshelf , remote from the dressmaker 's eyes , and then put the room door open , and the house door open , and turned the little low chair and its occupant towards the outer air .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 20]: It was a sultry night , and this was a fine-weather arrangement when the day 's work was done .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 33]: To complete it , she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair , and protectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 26]: ` This is what your loving Jenny Wren calls the best time in the day and night , ' said the person of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 25]: Her real name was Fanny Cleaver ; but she had long ago chosen to bestow upon herself the appellation of Miss Jenny Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 44]: I have been thinking , ' Jenny went on , ` as I sat at work to-day , what a thing it would be , if I should be able to have your company till I am married , or at least courted .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 21]: Because when I am courted , I shall make Him do some of the things that you do for me .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 50]: He could n't brush my hair like you do , or help me up and down stairs like you do , and he could n't do anything like you do ; but he could take my work home , and he could call for orders in his clumsy way .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 5]: And he shall too .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 12]: I 'LL trot him about , I can tell him ! '
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 42]: Jenny Wren had her personal vanities -- happily for her -- and no intentions were stronger in her breast than the various trials and torments that were , in the fulness of time , to be inflicted upon ` him . '
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 43]: ` Wherever he may happen to be just at present , or whoever he may happen to be , ' said Miss Wren , ' I know his tricks and his manners , and I give him warning to look out . '
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 13]: ` Do n't you think you are rather hard upon him ? '
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 11]: asked her friend , smiling , and smoothing her hair .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 19]: ` Not a bit , ' replied the sage Miss Wren , with an air of vast experience .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 22]: ` My dear , they do n't care for you , those fellows , if you 're NOT hard upon 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 14]: But I was saying If I should be able to have your company .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 5]: What a large If !
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 6]: Ai n't it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 11]: I have no intention of parting company , Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 13]: ` Do n't say that , or you 'll go directly . '
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 11]: ` Am I so little to be relied upon ? '
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 14]: ` You 're more to be relied upon than silver and gold . '
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 24]: As she said it , Miss Wren suddenly broke off , screwed up her eyes and her chin , and looked prodigiously knowing .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 3]: ` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 4]: Who comes here ?
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 3]: A Grenadier .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 5]: What does he want ?
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 5]: A pot of beer .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 11]: And nothing else in the world , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 13]: A man 's figure paused on the pavement at the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 10]: ` Mr Eugene Wrayburn , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 4]: said Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 11]: ` So I am told , ' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 13]: ` You may come in , if you 're good . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 17]: I am not good , ' said Eugene , ` but I 'll come in . '
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 28]: He gave his hand to Jenny Wren , and he gave his hand to Lizzie , and he stood leaning by the door at Lizzie 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 42]: He had been strolling with his cigar , he said , -LRB- it was smoked out and gone by this time , -RRB- and he had strolled round to return in that direction that he might look in as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 8]: Had she not seen her brother tonight ?
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 14]: ` Yes , ' said Lizzie , whose manner was a little troubled .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 8]: Gracious condescension on our brother 's part !
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 15]: Mr Eugene Wrayburn thought he had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 7]: Who was his friend with him ?
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 5]: ` The schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 5]: ` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 5]: Looked like it . '
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 31]: Lizzie sat so still , that one could not have said wherein the fact of her manner being troubled was expressed ; and yet one could not have doubted it .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 53]: Eugene was as easy as ever ; but perhaps , as she sat with her eyes cast down , it might have been rather more perceptible that his attention was concentrated upon her for certain moments , than its concentration upon any subject for any short time ever was , elsewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 12]: I have nothing to report , Lizzie , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 45]: ` But , having promised you that an eye should be always kept on Mr Riderhood through my friend Lightwood , I like occasionally to renew my assurance that I keep my promise , and keep my friend up to the mark . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 10]: I should not have doubted it , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 24]: ` Generally , I confess myself a man to be doubted , ' returned Eugene , coolly , ` for all that . '
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 6]: ` Why are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 6]: asked the sharp Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 21]: ` Because , my dear , ' said the airy Eugene , ' I am a bad idle dog . '
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 14]: ` Then why do n't you reform and be a good dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 4]: inquired Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 21]: ` Because , my dear , ' returned Eugene , ` there 's nobody who makes it worth my while .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 9]: Have you considered my suggestion , Lizzie ? '
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 30]: This in a lower voice , but only as if it were a graver matter ; not at all to the exclusion of the person of the house . '
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 25]: I have thought of it , Mr Wrayburn , but I have not been able to make up my mind to accept it . '
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 5]: ` False pride ! '
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 4]: said Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 7]: I think not , Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 5]: I hope not . '
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 5]: ` False pride ! '
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 3]: repeated Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 8]: ` Why , what else is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 8]: The thing is worth nothing in itself .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 8]: The thing is worth nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 8]: What can it be worth to me ?
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 9]: You know the most I make of it .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 81]: I propose to be of some use to somebody -- which I never was in this world , and never shall be on any other occasion -- by paying some qualified person of your own sex and age , so many -LRB- or rather so few -RRB- contemptible shillings , to come here , certain nights in the week , and give you certain instruction which you would n't want if you had n't been a self-denying daughter and sister .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 25]: You know that it 's good to have it , or you would never have so devoted yourself to your brother 's having it .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 19]: Then why not have it : especially when our friend Miss Jenny here would profit by it too ?
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 17]: If I proposed to be the teacher , or to attend the lessons -- obviously incongruous !
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 27]: -- but as to that , I might as well be on the other side of the globe , or not on the globe at all .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 5]: False pride , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 16]: Because true pride would n't shame , or be shamed by , your thankless brother .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 19]: True pride would n't have schoolmasters brought here , like doctors , to look at a bad case .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 10]: True pride would go to work and do it .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 36]: You know that , well enough , for you know that your own true pride would do it to-morrow , if you had the ways and means which false pride wo n't let me supply .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 7]: I add no more than this .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 16]: Your false pride does wrong to yourself and does wrong to your dead father . '
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 10]: ` How to my father , Mr Wrayburn ? '
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 8]: she asked , with an anxious face .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 6]: ` How to your father ?
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 4]: Can you ask !
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 11]: By perpetuating the consequences of his ignorant and blind obstinacy .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 12]: By resolving not to set right the wrong he did you .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 26]: By determining that the deprivation to which he condemned you , and which he forced upon you , shall always rest upon his head . '
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 23]: It chanced to be a subtle string to sound , in her who had so spoken to her brother within the hour .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 36]: It sounded far more forcibly , because of the change in the speaker for the moment ; the passing appearance of earnestness , complete conviction , injured resentment of suspicion , generous and unselfish interest .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 28]: All these qualities , in him usually so light and careless , she felt to be inseparable from some touch of their opposites in her own breast .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 41]: She thought , had she , so far below him and so different , rejected this disinterestedness , because of some vain misgiving that he sought her out , or heeded any personal attractions that he might descry in her ?
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 17]: The poor girl , pure of heart and purpose , could not bear to think it .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 35]: Sinking before her own eyes , as she suspected herself of it , she drooped her head as though she had done him some wicked and grievous injury , and broke into silent tears .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 16]: ` Do n't be distressed , ' said Eugene , very , very kindly . '
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 11]: I hope it is not I who have distressed you .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 31]: I meant no more than to put the matter in its true light before you ; though I acknowledge I did it selfishly enough , for I am disappointed . '
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 7]: Disappointed of doing her a service .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 7]: How else COULD he be disappointed ?
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 28]: ` It wo n't break my heart , ' laughed Eugene ; ` it wo n't stay by me eight-and-forty hours ; but I am genuinely disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 19]: I had set my fancy on doing this little thing for you and for our friend Miss Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 15]: The novelty of my doing anything in the least useful , had its charms .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 13]: I see , now , that I might have managed it better .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 27]: I might have affected to do it wholly for our friend Miss J. I might have got myself up , morally , as Sir Eugene Bountiful .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 20]: But upon my soul I ca n't make flourishes , and I would rather be disappointed than try . '
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 18]: If he meant to follow home what was in Lizzie 's thoughts , it was skilfully done .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 17]: If he followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence , it was done by an evil chance .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 13]: ` It opened out so naturally before me , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 12]: ` The ball seemed so thrown into my hands by accident !
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 22]: I happen to be originally brought into contact with you , Lizzie , on those two occasions that you know of .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 21]: I happen to be able to promise you that a watch shall be kept upon that false accuser , Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 29]: I happen to be able to give you some little consolation in the darkest hour of your distress , by assuring you that I do n't believe him .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 64]: On the same occasion I tell you that I am the idlest and least of lawyers , but that I am better than none , in a case I have noted down with my own hand , and that you may be always sure of my best help , and incidentally of Lightwood 's too , in your efforts to clear your father .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 16]: So , it gradually takes my fancy that I may help you -- so easily !
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 26]: -- to clear your father of that other blame which I mentioned a few minutes ago , and which is a just and real one .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 17]: I hope I have explained myself ; for I am heartily sorry to have distressed you .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 28]: I hate to claim to mean well , but I really did mean honestly and simply well , and I want you to know it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 23]: I have never doubted that , Mr Wrayburn , ' said Lizzie ; the more repentant , the less he claimed . '
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 8]: I am very glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 20]: Though if you had quite understood my whole meaning at first , I think you would not have refused .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 7]: Do you think you would ? '
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 14]: ` I -- do n't know that I should , Mr Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 10]: Then why refuse now you do understand it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 40]: ` It 's not easy for me to talk to you , ' returned Lizzie , in some confusion , ` for you see all the consequences of what I say , as soon as I say it . '
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 17]: ` Take all the consequences , ' laughed Eugene , ` and take away my disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 36]: Lizzie Hexam , as I truly respect you , and as I am your friend and a poor devil of a gentleman , I protest I do n't even now understand why you hesitate . '
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 56]: There was an appearance of openness , trustfulness , unsuspecting generosity , in his words and manner , that won the poor girl over ; and not only won her over , but again caused her to feel as though she had been influenced by the opposite qualities , with vanity at their head . '
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 10]: I will not hesitate any longer , Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 16]: I hope you will not think the worse of me for having hesitated at all .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 17]: For myself and for Jenny -- you let me answer for you , Jenny dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 28]: The little creature had been leaning back , attentive , with her elbows resting on the elbows of her chair , and her chin upon her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 12]: Without changing her attitude , she answered , ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 17]: so suddenly that it rather seemed as if she had chopped the monosyllable than spoken it .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 15]: ` For myself and for Jenny , I thankfully accept your kind offer . '
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 3]: ` Agreed !
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 3]: Dismissed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 22]: said Eugene , giving Lizzie his hand before lightly waving it , as if he waved the whole subject away . '
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 17]: I hope it may not be often that so much is made of so little ! '
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 11]: Then he fell to talking playfully with Jenny Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 15]: I think of setting up a doll , Miss Jenny , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 11]: ` You had better not , ' replied the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 8]: ` You are sure to break it .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 6]: All you children do . '
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 18]: ` But that makes good for trade , you know , Miss Wren , ' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 23]: ` Much as people 's breaking promises and contracts and bargains of all sorts , makes good for MY trade . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 33]: I do n't know about that , ' Miss Wren retorted ; ` but you had better by half set up a pen-wiper , and turn industrious , and use it . '
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 36]: ` Why , if we were all as industrious as you , little Busy-Body , we should begin to work as soon as we could crawl , and there would be a bad thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 28]: ` Do you mean , ' returned the little creature , with a flush suffusing her face , ` bad for your backs and your legs ? '
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 27]: ` No , no , no , ' said Eugene ; shocked -- to do him justice -- at the thought of trifling with her infirmity .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 9]: ` Bad for business , bad for business .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 27]: If we all set to work as soon as we could use our hands , it would be all over with the dolls ' dressmakers . '
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 26]: ` There 's something in that , ' replied Miss Wren ; ` you have a sort of an idea in your noddle sometimes . '
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 57]: Then , in a changed tone ; ` Talking of ideas , my Lizzie , ' they were sitting side by side as they had sat at first , ' I wonder how it happens that when I am work , work , working here , all alone in the summer-time , I smell flowers . '
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 39]: ` As a commonplace individual , I should say , ' Eugene suggested languidly -- for he was growing weary of the person of the house -- ` that you smell flowers because you DO smell flowers . '
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 43]: ` No I do n't , ' said the little creature , resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair , resting her chin upon that hand , and looking vacantly before her ; ` this is not a flowery neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 6]: It 's anything but that .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 14]: And yet as I sit at work , I smell miles of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 21]: I smell roses , till I think I see the rose-leaves lying in heaps , bushels , on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 21]: I smell fallen leaves , till I put down my hand -- so -- and expect to make them rustle .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 23]: I smell the white and the pink May in the hedges , and all sorts of flowers that I never was among .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 14]: For I have seen very few flowers indeed , in my life . '
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 10]: ` Pleasant fancies to have , Jenny dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 28]: said her friend : with a glance towards Eugene as if she would have asked him whether they were given the child in compensation for her losses .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 13]: ` So I think , Lizzie , when they come to me .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 6]: And the birds I hear !
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 19]: cried the little creature , holding out her hand and looking upward , ` how they sing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 17]: There was something in the face and action for the moment , quite inspired and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 11]: Then the chin dropped musingly upon the hand again . '
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 20]: I dare say my birds sing better than other birds , and my flowers smell better than other flowers .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 42]: For when I was a little child , ' in a tone as though it were ages ago , ` the children that I used to see early in the morning were very different from any others that I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 24]: They were not like me ; they were not chilled , anxious , ragged , or beaten ; they were never in pain .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 30]: They were not like the children of the neighbours ; they never made me tremble all over , by setting up shrill noises , and they never mocked me .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 6]: Such numbers of them too !
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 37]: All in white dresses , and with something shining on the borders , and on their heads , that I have never been able to imitate with my work , though I know it so well .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 23]: They used to come down in long bright slanting rows , and say all together , `` Who is this in pain !
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 7]: Who is this in pain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 19]: When I told them who it was , they answered , `` Come and play with us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 8]: When I said `` I never play !
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 6]: I ca n't play ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 14]: they swept about me and took me up , and made me light .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 31]: Then it was all delicious ease and rest till they laid me down , and said , all together , `` Have patience , and we will come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 39]: Whenever they came back , I used to know they were coming before I saw the long bright rows , by hearing them ask , all together a long way off , `` Who is this in pain !
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 7]: Who is this in pain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 18]: And I used to cry out , `` O my blessed children , it 's poor me .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 5]: Have pity on me .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 10]: Take me up and make me light ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 27]: By degrees , as she progressed in this remembrance , the hand was raised , the late ecstatic look returned , and she became quite beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 24]: Having so paused for a moment , silent , with a listening smile upon her face , she looked round and recalled herself .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 15]: ` What poor fun you think me ; do n't you , Mr Wrayburn ?
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 8]: You may well look tired of me .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 14]: But it 's Saturday night , and I wo n't detain you . '
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 29]: ` That is to say , Miss Wren , ' observed Eugene , quite ready to profit by the hint , ` you wish me to go ? '
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 19]: ` Well , it 's Saturday night , ' she returned , and my child 's coming home .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 17]: And my child is a troublesome bad child , and costs me a world of scolding .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 12]: I would rather you did n't see my child . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 4]: A doll ? '
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 12]: said Eugene , not understanding , and looking for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 23]: But Lizzie , with her lips only , shaping the two words , ` Her father , ' he delayed no longer .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 6]: He took his leave immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 24]: At the corner of the street he stopped to light another cigar , and possibly to ask himself what he was doing otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 10]: If so , the answer was indefinite and vague .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 14]: Who knows what he is doing , who is careless what he does !
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 16]: A man stumbled against him as he turned away , who mumbled some maudlin apology .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 22]: Looking after this man , Eugene saw him go in at the door by which he himself had just come out .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 15]: On the man 's stumbling into the room , Lizzie rose to leave it .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 23]: ` Do n't go away , Miss Hexam , ' he said in a submissive manner , speaking thickly and with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 13]: ` Do n't fly from unfortunate man in shattered state of health .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 8]: Give poor invalid honour of your company .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 9]: It ai n't -- ai n't catching . '
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 18]: Lizzie murmured that she had something to do in her own room , and went away upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 7]: ` How 's my Jenny ? '
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 6]: said the man , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 18]: ` How 's my Jenny Wren , best of children , object dearest affections broken-hearted invalid ? '
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 29]: To which the person of the house , stretching out her arm in an attitude of command , replied with irresponsive asperity : ` Go along with you !
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 6]: Go along into your corner !
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 7]: Get into your corner directly ! '
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 41]: The wretched spectacle made as if he would have offered some remonstrance ; but not venturing to resist the person of the house , thought better of it , and went and sat down on a particular chair of disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 4]: ` Oh-h-h ! '
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 18]: cried the person of the house , pointing her little finger , ` You bad old boy !
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 7]: Oh-h-h you naughty , wicked creature !
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 8]: WHAT do you mean by it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 29]: The shaking figure , unnerved and disjointed from head to foot , put out its two hands a little way , as making overtures of peace and reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 16]: Abject tears stood in its eyes , and stained the blotched red of its cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 11]: The swollen lead-coloured under lip trembled with a shameful whine .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 18]: The whole indecorous threadbare ruin , from the broken shoes to the prematurely-grey scanty hair , grovelled .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 37]: Not with any sense worthy to be called a sense , of this dire reversal of the places of parent and child , but in a pitiful expostulation to be let off from a scolding . '
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 14]: I know your tricks and your manners , ' cried Miss Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 9]: I know where you 've been to ! '
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 12]: -LRB- which indeed it did not require discernment to discover -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 9]: ` Oh , you disgraceful old chap ! '
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 23]: The very breathing of the figure was contemptible , as it laboured and rattled in that operation , like a blundering clock .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 26]: ` Slave , slave , slave , from morning to night , ' pursued the person of the house , ` and all for this !
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 8]: WHAT do you mean by it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 16]: There was something in that emphasized ` What , ' which absurdly frightened the figure .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 34]: As often as the person of the house worked her way round to it -- even as soon as he saw that it was coming -- he collapsed in an extra degree . '
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 21]: I wish you had been taken up , and locked up , ' said the person of the house . '
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 22]: I wish you had been poked into cells and black holes , and run over by rats and spiders and beetles .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 16]: I know their tricks and their manners , and they 'd have tickled you nicely .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 8]: Ai n't you ashamed of yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 11]: ` Yes , my dear , ' stammered the father .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 38]: ` Then , ' said the person of the house , terrifying him by a grand muster of her spirits and forces before recurring to the emphatic word , ` WHAT do you mean by it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 18]: ` Circumstances over which had no control , ' was the miserable creature 's plea in extenuation .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 31]: ` I 'LL circumstance you and control you too , ' retorted the person of the house , speaking with vehement sharpness , ` if you talk in that way .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 41]: I 'll give you in charge to the police , and have you fined five shillings when you ca n't pay , and then I wo n't pay the money for you , and you 'll be transported for life .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 11]: How should you like to be transported for life ? '
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 6]: ` Should n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 4]: Poor shattered invalid .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 10]: Trouble nobody long , ' cried the wretched figure .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 6]: ` Come , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 35]: said the person of the house , tapping the table near her in a business-like manner , and shaking her head and her chin ; ` you know what you 've got to do .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 8]: Put down your money this instant . '
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 10]: The obedient figure began to rummage in its pockets .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 15]: ` Spent a fortune out of your wages , I 'll be bound ! '
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 7]: said the person of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 5]: ` Put it here !
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 6]: All you 've got left !
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 4]: Every farthing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 54]: Such a business as he made of collecting it from his dogs ' - eared pockets ; of expecting it in this pocket , and not finding it ; of not expecting it in that pocket , and passing it over ; of finding no pocket where that other pocket ought to be !
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 6]: ` Is this all ? '
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 20]: demanded the person of the house , when a confused heap of pence and shillings lay on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 19]: ` Got no more , ' was the rueful answer , with an accordant shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 6]: ` Let me make sure .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 9]: You know what you 've got to do .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 13]: Turn all your pockets inside out , and leave 'em so ! '
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 7]: cried the person of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 3]: He obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 26]: And if anything could have made him look more abject or more dismally ridiculous than before , it would have been his so displaying himself .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 10]: ` Here 's but seven and eightpence halfpenny ! '
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 11]: exclaimed Miss Wren , after reducing the heap to order .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 8]: ` Oh , you prodigal old son !
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 7]: Now you shall be starved . '
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 14]: ` No , do n't starve me , ' he urged , whimpering .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 42]: ` If you were treated as you ought to be , ' said Miss Wren , ` you 'd be fed upon the skewers of cats ' meat ; -- only the skewers , after the cats had had the meat .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 9]: As it is , go to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 38]: When he stumbled out of the corner to comply , he again put out both his hands , and pleaded : ` Circumstances over which no control -- ' ` Get along with you to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 8]: cried Miss Wren , snapping him up .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 7]: ` Do n't speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 8]: I 'm not going to forgive you .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 7]: Go to bed this moment ! '
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 36]: Seeing another emphatic ` What ' upon its way , he evaded it by complying and was heard to shuffle heavily up stairs , and shut his door , and throw himself on his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 10]: Within a little while afterwards , Lizzie came down .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 11]: ` Shall we have our supper , Jenny dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 24]: bless us and save us , we need have something to keep us going , ' returned Miss Jenny , shrugging her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 45]: Lizzie laid a cloth upon the little bench -LRB- more handy for the person of the house than an ordinary table -RRB- , and put upon it such plain fare as they were accustomed to have , and drew up a stool for herself .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 5]: ` Now for supper !
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 11]: What are you thinking of , Jenny darling ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 32]: I was thinking , ' she returned , coming out of a deep study , ` what I would do to Him , if he should turn out a drunkard . '
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 12]: ` Oh , but he wo n't , ' said Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 12]: ` You 'll take care of that , beforehand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 16]: I shall try to take care of it beforehand , but he might deceive me .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 18]: Oh , my dear , all those fellows with their tricks and their manners do deceive ! '
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 8]: With the little fist in full action .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 15]: ` And if so , I tell you what I think I 'd do .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 73]: When he was asleep , I 'd make a spoon red hot , and I 'd have some boiling liquor bubbling in a saucepan , and I 'd take it out hissing , and I 'd open his mouth with the other hand -- or perhaps he 'd sleep with his mouth ready open -- and I 'd pour it down his throat , and blister it and choke him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 15]: I am sure you would do no such horrible thing , ' said Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 5]: ` Should n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 7]: Well ; perhaps I should n't .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 8]: But I should like to ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 9]: I am equally sure you would not . '
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 6]: ` Not even like to ?
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 7]: Well , you generally know best .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 27]: Only you have n't always lived among it as I have lived -- and your back is n't bad and your legs are not queer . '
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 21]: As they went on with their supper , Lizzie tried to bring her round to that prettier and better state .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 7]: But , the charm was broken .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 38]: The person of the house was the person of a house full of sordid shames and cares , with an upper room in which that abased figure was infecting even innocent sleep with sensual brutality and degradation .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 23]: The doll 's dressmaker had become a little quaint shrew ; of the world , worldly ; of the earth , earthy .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 5]: Poor doll 's dressmaker !
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 31]: How often so dragged down by hands that should have raised her up ; how often so misdirected when losing her way on the eternal road , and asking guidance !
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 8]: Poor , poor little doll 's dressmaker !
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 41]: Chapter 3 A PIECE OF WORK Britannia , sitting meditating one fine day -LRB- perhaps in the attitude in which she is presented on the copper coinage -RRB- , discovers all of a sudden that she wants Veneering in Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 34]: It occurs to her that Veneering is ' a representative man ' -- which can not in these times be doubted -- and that Her Majesty 's faithful Commons are incomplete without him .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 47]: So , Britannia mentions to a legal gentleman of her acquaintance that if Veneering will ` put down ' five thousand pounds , he may write a couple of initial letters after his name at the extremely cheap rate of two thousand five hundred per letter .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 35]: It is clearly understood between Britannia and the legal gentleman that nobody is to take up the five thousand pounds , but that being put down they will disappear by magical conjuration and enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 40]: The legal gentleman in Britannia 's confidence going straight from that lady to Veneering , thus commissioned , Veneering declares himself highly flattered , but requires breathing time to ascertain ` whether his friends will rally round him . '
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 31]: Above all things , he says , it behoves him to be clear , at a crisis of this importance , ` whether his friends will rally round him . '
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 45]: The legal gentleman , in the interests of his client can not allow much time for this purpose , as the lady rather thinks she knows somebody prepared to put down six thousand pounds ; but he says he will give Veneering four hours .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 21]: Veneering then says to Mrs Veneering , ` We must work , ' and throws himself into a Hansom cab .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 59]: Mrs Veneering in the same moment relinquishes baby to Nurse ; presses her aquiline hands upon her brow , to arrange the throbbing intellect within ; orders out the carriage ; and repeats in a distracted and devoted manner , compounded of Ophelia and any self-immolating female of antiquity you may prefer , ` We must work . '
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 31]: Veneering having instructed his driver to charge at the Public in the streets , like the Life-Guards at Waterloo , is driven furiously to Duke Street , Saint James 's .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 30]: There , he finds Twemlow in his lodgings , fresh from the hands of a secret artist who has been doing something to his hair with yolks of eggs .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 66]: The process requiring that Twemlow shall , for two hours after the application , allow his hair to stick upright and dry gradually , he is in an appropriate state for the receipt of startling intelligence ; looking equally like the Monument on Fish Street Hill , and King Priam on a certain incendiary occasion not wholly unknown as a neat point from the classics .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 50]: ` My dear Twemlow , ' says Veneering , grasping both his bands , as the dearest and oldest of my friends -- ' -LRB- ` Then there can be no more doubt about it in future , ' thinks Twemlow , ` and I AM ! ' -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 23]: -- Are you of opinion that your cousin , Lord Snigsworth , would give his name as a Member of my Committee ?
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 20]: I do n't go so far as to ask for his lordship ; I only ask for his name .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 11]: Do you think he would give me his name ? '
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 17]: In sudden low spirits , Twemlow replies , ' I do n't think he would . '
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 46]: ` My political opinions , ' says Veneering , not previously aware of having any , ` are identical with those of Lord Snigsworth , and perhaps as a matter of public feeling and public principle , Lord Snigswotth would give me his name . '
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 39]: ` It might be so , ' says Twemlow ; ` but -- ' And perplexedly scratching his head , forgetful of the yolks of eggs , is the more discomfited by being reminded how stickey he is .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 25]: ` Between such old and intimate friends as ourselves , ' pursues Veneering , ` there should in such a case be no reserve .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 36]: Promise me that if I ask you to do anything for me which you do n't like to do , or feel the slightest difficulty in doing , you will freely tell me so . '
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 22]: This , Twemlow is so kind as to promise , with every appearance of most heartily intending to keep his word .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 21]: ` Would you have any objection to write down to Snigsworthy Park , and ask this favour of Lord Snigsworth ?
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 34]: Of course if it were granted I should know that I owed it solely to you ; while at the same time you would put it to Lord Snigsworth entirely upon public grounds .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 7]: Would you have any objection ? '
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 21]: Says Twemlow , with his hand to his forehead , ` You have exacted a promise from me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 8]: I have , my dear Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 12]: ` And you expect me to keep it honourably . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 8]: I do , my dear Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 60]: ` ON the whole , then ; -- observe me , ' urges Twemlow with great nicety , as if ; in the case of its having been off the whole , he would have done it directly -- ` ON the whole , I must beg you to excuse me from addressing any communication to Lord Snigsworth . '
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 8]: ` Bless you , bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 20]: says Veneering ; horribly disappointed , but grasping him by both hands again , in a particularly fervent manner .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 140]: It is not to be wondered at that poor Twemlow should decline to inflict a letter on his noble cousin -LRB- who has gout in the temper -RRB- , inasmuch as his noble cousin , who allows him a small annuity on which he lives , takes it out of him , as the phrase goes , in extreme severity ; putting him , when he visits at Snigsworthy Park , under a kind of martial law ; ordaining that he shall hang his hat on a particular peg , sit on a particular chair , talk on particular subjects to particular people , and perform particular exercises : such as sounding the praises of the Family Varnish -LRB- not to say Pictures -RRB- , and abstaining from the choicest of the Family Wines unless expressly invited to partake .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 26]: ` One thing , however , I CAN do for you , ' says Twemlow ; ` and that is , work for you . '
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 5]: Veneering blesses him again .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 33]: ` I 'll go , ' says Twemlow , in a rising hurry of spirits , ` to the club ; -- let us see now ; what o'clock is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 7]: ` Twenty minutes to eleven . '
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 29]: ` I 'll be , ' says Twemlow , ` at the club by ten minutes to twelve , and I 'll never leave it all day . '
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 20]: Veneering feels that his friends are rallying round him , and says , ` Thank you , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 8]: I knew I could rely upon you .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 46]: I said to Anastatia before leaving home just now to come to you -- of course the first friend I have seen on a subject so momentous to me , my dear Twemlow -- I said to Anastatia , `` We must work . '' '
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 13]: ` You were right , you were right , ' replies Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 4]: ` Tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 5]: Is SHE working ? '
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 8]: ` She is , ' says Veneering .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 11]: cries Twemlow , polite little gentleman that he is . '
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 7]: A woman 's tact is invaluable .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 16]: To have the dear sex with us , is to have everything with us . '
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 27]: ` But you have not imparted to me , ' remarks Veneering , ` what you think of my entering the House of Commons ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 20]: I think , ' rejoins Twemlow , feelingly , ` that it is the best club in London . '
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 34]: Veneering again blesses him , plunges down stairs , rushes into his Hansom , and directs the driver to be up and at the British Public , and to charge into the City .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 59]: Meanwhile Twemlow , in an increasing hurry of spirits , gets his hair down as well as he can -- which is not very well ; for , after these glutinous applications it is restive , and has a surface on it somewhat in the nature of pastry -- and gets to the club by the appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 32]: At the club he promptly secures a large window , writing materials , and all the newspapers , and establishes himself ; immoveable , to be respectfully contemplated by Pall Mall .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 21]: Sometimes , when a man enters who nods to him , Twemlow says , ` Do you know Veneering ? '
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 12]: Man says , ` No ; member of the club ? '
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 6]: Twemlow says , ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 6]: Coming in for Pocket-Breaches . '
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 6]: Man says , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 10]: Hope he may find it worth the money ! '
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 6]: yawns , and saunters out .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 38]: Towards six o'clock of the afternoon , Twemlow begins to persuade himself that he is positively jaded with work , and thinks it much to be regretted that he was not brought up as a Parliamentary agent .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 13]: From Twemlow 's , Veneering dashes at Podsnap 's place of business .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 27]: Finds Podsnap reading the paper , standing , and inclined to be oratorical over the astonishing discovery he has made , that Italy is not England .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 24]: Respectfully entreats Podsnap 's pardon for stopping the flow of his words of wisdom , and informs him what is in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 9]: Tells Podsnap that their political opinions are identical .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 23]: Gives Podsnap to understand that he , Veneering , formed his political opinions while sitting at the feet of him , Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 13]: Seeks earnestly to know whether Podsnap ` will rally round him ? '
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 22]: Says Podsnap , something sternly , ` Now , first of all , Veneering , do you ask my advice ? '
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 63]: Veneering falters that as so old and so dear a friend -- ` Yes , yes , that 's all very well , ' says Podsnap ; ` but have you made up your mind to take this borough of Pocket-Breaches on its own terms , or do you ask my opinion whether you shall take it or leave it alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 21]: Veneering repeats that his heart 's desire and his soul 's thirst are , that Podsnap shall rally round him .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 20]: ` Now , I 'll be plain with you , Veneering , ' says Podsnap , knitting his brows .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 22]: ` You will infer that I do n't care about Parliament , from the fact of my not being there ? '
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 8]: Why , of course Veneering knows that !
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 35]: Of course Veneering knows that if Podsnap chose to go there , he would be there , in a space of time that might be stated by the light and thoughtless as a jiffy .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 28]: ` It is not worth my while , ' pursues Podsnap , becoming handsomely mollified , ` and it is the reverse of important to my position .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 19]: But it is not my wish to set myself up as law for another man , differently situated .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 15]: You think it IS worth YOUR while , and IS important to YOUR position .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 5]: Is that so ? '
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 17]: Always with the proviso that Podsnap will rally round him , Veneering thinks it is so .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 13]: ` Then you do n't ask my advice , ' says Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 3]: ` Good .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 8]: Then I wo n't give it you .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 7]: But you do ask my help .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 2]: Good .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 8]: Then I 'll work for you . '
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 14]: Veneering instantly blesses him , and apprises him that Twemlow is already working .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 41]: Podsnap does not quite approve that anybody should be already working -- regarding it rather in the light of a liberty -- but tolerates Twemlow , and says he is a well-connected old female who will do no harm . '
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 23]: I have nothing very particular to do to-day , ' adds Podsnap , ` and I 'll mix with some influential people .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 28]: I had engaged myself to dinner , but I 'll send Mrs Podsnap and get off going myself ; and I 'll dine with you at eight .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 11]: It 's important we should report progress and compare notes .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 6]: Now , let me see .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 20]: You ought to have a couple of active energetic fellows , of gentlemanly manners , to go about . '
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 11]: Veneering , after cogitation , thinks of Boots and Brewer .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 13]: ` Whom I have met at your house , ' says Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 6]: They 'll do very well .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 12]: Let them each have a cab , and go about . '
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 47]: Veneering immediately mentions what a blessing he feels it , to possess a friend capable of such grand administrative suggestions , and really is elated at this going about of Boots and Brewer , as an idea wearing an electioneering aspect and looking desperately like business .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 31]: Leaving Podsnap , at a hand-gallop , he descends upon Boots and Brewer , who enthusiastically rally round him by at once bolting off in cabs , taking opposite directions .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 85]: Then Veneering repairs to the legal gentleman in Britannia 's confidence , and with him transacts some delicate affairs of business , and issues an address to the independent electors of Pocket-Breaches , announcing that he is coming among them for their suffrages , as the mariner returns to the home of his early childhood : a phrase which is none the worse for his never having been near the place in his life , and not even now distinctly knowing where it is .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 13]: Mrs Veneering , during the same eventful hours , is not idle .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 31]: No sooner does the carriage turn out , all complete , than she turns into it , all complete , and gives the word ` To Lady Tippins 's . '
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 47]: That charmer dwells over a staymaker 's in the Belgravian Borders , with a life-size model in the window on the ground floor of a distinguished beauty in a blue petticoat , stay-lace in hand , looking over her shoulder at the town in innocent surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 13]: As well she may , to find herself dressing under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 5]: Lady Tippins at home ?
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 35]: Lady Tippins at home , with the room darkened , and her back -LRB- like the lady 's at the ground-floor window , though for a different reason -RRB- cunningly turned towards the light .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 41]: Lady Tippins is so surprised by seeing her dear Mrs Veneering so early -- in the middle of the night , the pretty creature calls it -- that her eyelids almost go up , under the influence of that emotion .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 114]: To whom Mrs Veneering incoherently communicates , how that Veneering has been offered Pocket-Breaches ; how that it is the time for rallying round ; how that Veneering has said ` We must work ' ; how that she is here , as a wife and mother , to entreat Lady Tippins to work ; how that the carriage is at Lady Tippins 's disposal for purposes of work ; how that she , proprietress of said bran new elegant equipage , will return home on foot -- on bleeding feet if need be -- to work -LRB- not specifying how -RRB- , until she drops by the side of baby 's crib .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 20]: ` My love , ' says Lady Tippins , ` compose yourself ; we 'll bring him in . '
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 54]: And Lady Tippins really does work , and work the Veneering horses too ; for she clatters about town all day , calling upon everybody she knows , and showing her entertaining powers and green fan to immense advantage , by rattling on with , My dear soul , what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 8]: What do you suppose me to be ?
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 5]: You 'll never guess .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 9]: I 'm pretending to be an electioneering agent .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 8]: And for what place of all places ?
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 2]: Pocket-Breaches .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 13]: Because the dearest friend I have in the world has bought it .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 12]: And who is the dearest friend I have in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 8]: A man of the name of Veneering .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 31]: Not omitting his wife , who is the other dearest friend I have in the world ; and I positively declare I forgot their baby , who is the other .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 19]: And we are carrying on this little farce to keep up appearances , and is n't it refreshing !
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 48]: Then , my precious child , the fun of it is that nobody knows who these Veneerings are , and that they know nobody , and that they have a house out of the Tales of the Genii , and give dinners out of the Arabian Nights .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 8]: Curious to see 'em , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 6]: Say you 'll know 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 6]: Come and dine with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 6]: They sha n't bore you .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 6]: Say who shall meet you .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 26]: We 'll make up a party of our own , and I 'll engage that they shall not interfere with you for one single moment .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 11]: You really ought to see their gold and silver camels .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 8]: I call their dinner-table , the Caravan .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 25]: Do come and dine with my Veneerings , my own Veneerings , my exclusive property , the dearest friends I have in the world !
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 55]: And above all , my dear , be sure you promise me your vote and interest and all sorts of plumpers for Pocket-Breaches ; for we could n't think of spending sixpence on it , my love , and can only consent to be brought in by the spontaneous thingummies of the incorruptible whatdoyoucallums .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 37]: Now , the point of view seized by the bewitching Tippins , that this same working and rallying round is to keep up appearances , may have something in it , but not all the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 32]: More is done , or considered to be done -- which does as well -- by taking cabs , and ` going about , ' than the fair Tippins knew of .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 16]: Many vast vague reputations have been made , solely by taking cabs and going about .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 8]: This particularly obtains in all Parliamentary affairs .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 63]: Whether the business in hand be to get a man in , or get a man out , or get a man over , or promote a railway , or jockey a railway , or what else , nothing is understood to be so effectual as scouring nowhere in a violent hurry -- in short , as taking cabs and going about .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 41]: Probably because this reason is in the air , Twemlow , far from being singular in his persuasion that he works like a Trojan , is capped by Podsnap , who in his turn is capped by Boots and Brewer .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 69]: At eight o'clock when all these hard workers assemble to dine at Veneering 's , it is understood that the cabs of Boots and Brewer must n't leave the door , but that pails of water must be brought from the nearest baiting-place , and cast over the horses ' legs on the very spot , lest Boots and Brewer should have instant occasion to mount and away .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 52]: Those fleet messengers require the Analytical to see that their hats are deposited where they can be laid hold of at an instant 's notice ; and they dine -LRB- remarkably well though -RRB- with the air of firemen in charge of an engine , expecting intelligence of some tremendous conflagration .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 20]: Mrs Veneering faintly remarks , as dinner opens , that many such days would be too much for her .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 26]: ` Many such days would be too much for all of us , ' says Podsnap ; ` but we 'll bring him in ! '
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 18]: ` We 'll bring him in , ' says Lady Tippins , sportively waving her green fan .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 6]: ` Veneering for ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 8]: ` We 'll bring him in ! '
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 3]: says Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 8]: ` We 'll bring him in ! '
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 5]: say Boots and Brewer .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 31]: Strictly speaking , it would be hard to show cause why they should not bring him in , Pocket-Breaches having closed its little bargain , and there being no opposition .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 28]: However , it is agreed that they must ` work ' to the last , and that if they did not work , something indefinite would happen .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 38]: It is likewise agreed that they are all so exhausted with the work behind them , and need to be so fortified for the work before them , as to require peculiar strengthening from Veneering 's cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 85]: Therefore , the Analytical has orders to produce the cream of the cream of his binns , and therefore it falls out that rallying becomes rather a trying word for the occasion ; Lady Tippins being observed gamely to inculcate the necessity of rearing round their dear Veneering ; Podsnap advocating roaring round him ; Boots and Brewer declaring their intention of reeling round him ; and Veneering thanking his devoted friends one and all , with great emotion , for rarullarulling round him .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 19]: In these inspiring moments , Brewer strikes out an idea which is the great hit of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 29]: He consults his watch , and says -LRB- like Guy Fawkes -RRB- , he 'll now go down to the House of Commons and see how things look .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 48]: ` I 'll keep about the lobby for an hour or so , ' says Brewer , with a deeply mysterious countenance , ` and if things look well , I wo n't come back , but will order my cab for nine in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 11]: ` You could n't do better , ' says Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 11]: Veneering expresses his inability ever to acknowledge this last service .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 9]: Tears stand in Mrs Veneering 's affectionate eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 16]: Boots shows envy , loses ground , and is regarded as possessing a secondrate mind .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 12]: They all crowd to the door , to see Brewer off .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 16]: Brewer says to his driver , ` Now , is your horse pretty fresh ? '
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 7]: eyeing the animal with critical scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 9]: Driver says he 's as fresh as butter .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 16]: ` Put him along then , ' says Brewer ; ` House of Commons . '
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 27]: Driver darts up , Brewer leaps in , they cheer him as he departs , and Mr Podsnap says , ` Mark my words , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 19]: That 's a man of resource ; that 's a man to make his way in life . '
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 32]: When the time comes for Veneering to deliver a neat and appropriate stammer to the men of Pocket-Breaches , only Podsnap and Twemlow accompany him by railway to that sequestered spot .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 87]: The legal gentleman is at the Pocket-Breaches Branch Station , with an open carriage with a printed bill ` Veneering for ever ' stuck upon it , as if it were a wall ; and they gloriously proceed , amidst the grins of the populace , to a feeble little town hall on crutches , with some onions and bootlaces under it , which the legal gentleman says are a Market ; and from the front window of that edifice Veneering speaks to the listening earth .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 33]: In the moment of his taking his hat off , Podsnap , as per agreement made with Mrs Veneering , telegraphs to that wife and mother , ` He 's up . '
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 20]: Veneering loses his way in the usual No Thoroughfares of speech , and Podsnap and Twemlow say Hear hear !
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 25]: and sometimes , when he ca n't by any means back himself out of some very unlucky No Thoroughfare , ` He-a-a-r He-a-a-r ! '
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 22]: with an air of facetious conviction , as if the ingenuity of the thing gave them a sensation of exquisite pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 37]: But Veneering makes two remarkably good points ; so good , that they are supposed to have been suggested to him by the legal gentleman in Britannia 's confidence , while briefly conferring on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 6]: Point the first is this .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 33]: Veneering institutes an original comparison between the country , and a ship ; pointedly calling the ship , the Vessel of the State , and the Minister the Man at the Helm .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 23]: Veneering 's object is to let Pocket-Breaches know that his friend on his right -LRB- Podsnap -RRB- is a man of wealth .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 49]: Consequently says he , ` And , gentlemen , when the timbers of the Vessel of the State are unsound and the Man at the Helm is unskilful , would those great Marine Insurers , who rank among our world-famed merchantprinces -- would they insure her , gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 5]: Would they underwrite her ?
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 8]: Would they incur a risk in her ?
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 7]: Would they have confidence in her ?
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 36]: Why , gentlemen , if I appealed to my honourable friend upon my right , himself among the greatest and most respected of that great and much respected class , he would answer No ! '
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 6]: Point the second is this .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 16]: The telling fact that Twemlow is related to Lord Snigsworth , must be let off .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 41]: Veneering supposes a state of public affairs that probably never could by any possibility exist -LRB- though this is not quite certain , in consequence of his picture being unintelligible to himself and everybody else -RRB- , and thus proceeds .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 38]: ` Why , gentlemen , if I were to indicate such a programme to any class of society , I say it would be received with derision , would be pointed at by the finger of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 34]: If I indicated such a programme to any worthy and intelligent tradesman of your town -- nay , I will here be personal , and say Our town -- what would he reply ?
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 10]: He would reply , `` Away with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 9]: That 's what HE would reply , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 14]: In his honest indignation he would reply , `` Away with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 10]: But suppose I mounted higher in the social scale .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 83]: Suppose I drew my arm through the arm of my respected friend upon my left , and , walking with him through the ancestral woods of his family , and under the spreading beeches of Snigsworthy Park , approached the noble hall , crossed the courtyard , entered by the door , went up the staircase , and , passing from room to room , found myself at last in the august presence of my friend 's near kinsman , Lord Snigsworth .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 46]: And suppose I said to that venerable earl , `` My Lord , I am here before your lordship , presented by your lordship 's near kinsman , my friend upon my left , to indicate that programme ; '' what would his lordship answer ?
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 12]: Why , he would answer , `` Away with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 9]: That 's what he would answer , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 6]: `` Away with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 45]: Unconsciously using , in his exalted sphere , the exact language of the worthy and intelligent tradesman of our town , the near and dear kinsman of my friend upon my left would answer in his wrath , `` Away with it ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 21]: Veneering finishes with this last success , and Mr Podsnap telegraphs to Mrs Veneering , ` He 's down . '
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 26]: Then , dinner is had at the Hotel with the legal gentleman , and then there are in due succession , nomination , and declaration .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 16]: Finally Mr Podsnap telegraphs to Mrs Veneering , ` We have brought him in . '
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 26]: Another gorgeous dinner awaits them on their return to the Veneering halls , and Lady Tippins awaits them , and Boots and Brewer await them .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 56]: There is a modest assertion on everybody 's part that everybody single-handed ` brought him in ' ; but in the main it is conceded by all , that that stroke of business on Brewer 's part , in going down to the house that night to see how things looked , was the master-stroke .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 17]: A touching little incident is related by Mrs Veneering , in the course of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 21]: Mrs Veneering is habitually disposed to be tearful , and has an extra disposition that way after her late excitement .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 40]: Previous to withdrawing from the dinner-table with Lady Tippins , she says , in a pathetic and physically weak manner : ` You will all think it foolish of me , I know , but I must mention it .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 24]: As I sat by Baby 's crib , on the night before the election , Baby was very uneasy in her sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 28]: The Analytical chemist , who is gloomily looking on , has diabolical impulses to suggest ` Wind ' and throw up his situation ; but represses them .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 19]: ` After an interval almost convulsive , Baby curled her little hands in one another and smiled . '
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 21]: Mrs Veneering stopping here , Mr Podsnap deems it incumbent on him to say : ' I wonder why ! '
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 39]: ` Could it be , I asked myself , ' says Mrs Veneering , looking about her for her pocket-handkerchief , ` that the Fairies were telling Baby that her papa would shortly be an M. P. ? '
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 58]: So overcome by the sentiment is Mrs Veneering , that they all get up to make a clear stage for Veneering , who goes round the table to the rescue , and bears her out backward , with her feet impressively scraping the carpet : after remarking that her work has been too much for her strength .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 23]: Whether the fairies made any mention of the five thousand pounds , and it disagreed with Baby , is not speculated upon .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 11]: Poor little Twemlow , quite done up , is touched .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 21]: and still continues touched after he is safely housed over the livery-stable yard in Duke Street , Saint James 's .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 25]: But there , upon his sofa , a tremendous consideration breaks in upon the mild gentleman , putting all softer considerations to the rout .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 4]: ` Gracious heavens !
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 28]: Now I have time to think of it , he never saw one of his constituents in all his days , until we saw them together ! '
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 41]: After having paced the room in distress of mind , with his hand to his forehead , the innocent Twemlow returns to his sofa and moans : ' I shall either go distracted , or die , of this man .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 9]: He comes upon me too late in life .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 10]: I am not strong enough to bear him ! '
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 24]: Chapter 4 CUPID PROMPTED To use the cold language of the world , Mrs Alfred Lammle rapidly improved the acquaintance of Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 30]: To use the warm language of Mrs Lammle , she and her sweet Georgiana soon became one : in heart , in mind , in sentiment , in soul .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 63]: Whenever Georgiana could escape from the thraldom of Podsnappery ; could throw off the bedclothes of the custardcoloured phaeton , and get up ; could shrink out of the range of her mother 's rocking , and -LRB- so to speak -RRB- rescue her poor little frosty toes from being rocked over ; she repaired to her friend , Mrs Alfred Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 7]: Mrs Podsnap by no means objected .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 32]: As a consciously ` splendid woman , ' accustomed to overhear herself so denominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner society , Mrs Podsnap could dispense with her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 21]: Mr Podsnap , for his part , on being informed where Georgiana was , swelled with patronage of the Lammles .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 62]: That they , when unable to lay hold of him , should respectfully grasp at the hem of his mantle ; that they , when they could not bask in the glory of him the sun , should take up with the pale reflected light of the watery young moon his daughter ; appeared quite natural , becoming , and proper .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 29]: It gave him a better opinion of the discretion of the Lammles than he had heretofore held , as showing that they appreciated the value of the connexion .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 75]: So , Georgiana repairing to her friend , Mr Podsnap went out to dinner , and to dinner , and yet to dinner , arm in arm with Mrs Podsnap : settling his obstinate head in his cravat and shirt-collar , much as if he were performing on the Pandean pipes , in his own honour , the triumphal march , See the conquering Podsnap comes , Sound the trumpets , beat the drums !
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 48]: It was a trait in Mr Podsnap 's character -LRB- and in one form or other it will be generally seen to pervade the depths and shallows of Podsnappery -RRB- , that he could not endure a hint of disparagement of any friend or acquaintance of his .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 6]: ` How dare you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 11]: he would seem to say , in such a case .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 6]: ` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 6]: I have licensed this person .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 8]: This person has taken out MY certificate .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 12]: Through this person you strike at me , Podsnap the Great .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 26]: And it is not that I particularly care for the person 's dignity , but that I do most particularly care for Podsnap 's . '
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 25]: Hence , if any one in his presence had presumed to doubt the responsibility of the Lammles , he would have been mightily huffed .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 26]: Not that any one did , for Veneering , M.P. , was always the authority for their being very rich , and perhaps believed it .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 17]: As indeed he might , if he chose , for anything he knew of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 18]: Mr and Mrs Lammle 's house in Sackville Street , Piccadilly , was but a temporary residence .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 25]: It has done well enough , they informed their friends , for Mr Lammle when a bachelor , but it would not do now .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 30]: So , they were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations , and always very nearly taking or buying one , but never quite concluding the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 11]: Hereby they made for themselves a shining little reputation apart .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 19]: People said , on seeing a vacant palatial residence , ` The very thing for the Lammles ! '
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 25]: and wrote to the Lammles about it , and the Lammles always went to look at it , but unfortunately it never exactly answered .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 24]: In short , they suffered so many disappointments , that they began to think it would he necessary to build a palatial residence .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 30]: And hereby they made another shining reputation ; many persons of their acquaintance becoming by anticipation dissatisfied with their own houses , and envious of the non-existent Lammle structure .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 42]: The handsome fittings and furnishings of the house in Sackville Street were piled thick and high over the skeleton up-stairs , and if it ever whispered from under its load of upholstery , ` Here I am in the closet ! '
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 15]: it was to very few ears , and certainly never to Miss Podsnap 's .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 26]: What Miss Podsnap was particularly charmed with , next to the graces of her friend , was the happiness of her friend 's married life .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 9]: This was frequently their theme of conversation . '
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 17]: I am sure , ' said Miss Podsnap , ` Mr Lammle is like a lover .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 11]: At least I -- I should think he was . '
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 6]: ` Georgiana , darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 14]: said Mrs Lammle , holding up a forefinger , ` Take care ! '
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 7]: ` Oh my goodness me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 6]: exclaimed Miss Podsnap , reddening .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 8]: ` What have I said now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 16]: ` Alfred , you know , ' hinted Mrs Lammle , playfully shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 14]: ` You were never to say Mr Lammle any more , Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 4]: Alfred , then .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 8]: I am glad it 's no worse .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 9]: I was afraid I had said something shocking .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 10]: I am always saying something wrong to ma . '
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 8]: ` To me , Georgiana dearest ? '
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 12]: ` No , not to you ; you are not ma .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 6]: I wish you were . '
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 21]: Mrs Lammle bestowed a sweet and loving smile upon her friend , which Miss Podsnap returned as she best could .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 11]: They sat at lunch in Mrs Lammle 's own boudoir .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 18]: ` And so , dearest Georgiana , Alfred is like your notion of a lover ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 19]: I do n't say that , Sophronia , ' Georgiana replied , beginning to conceal her elbows . '
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 9]: I have n't any notion of a lover .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 17]: The dreadful wretches that ma brings up at places to torment me , are not lovers .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 14]: I only mean that Mr -- ' ` Again , dearest Georgiana ? '
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 14]: ` That Alfred -- ' ` Sounds much better , darling . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 5]: -- Loves you so .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 11]: He always treats you with such delicate gallantry and attention .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 7]: Now , do n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 21]: ` Truly , my dear , ' said Mrs Lammle , with a rather singular expression crossing her face . '
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 16]: I believe that he loves me , fully as much as I love him . '
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 7]: ` Oh , what happiness ! '
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 31]: ` But do you know , my Georgiana , ' Mrs Lammle resumed presently , ` that there is something suspicious in your enthusiastic sympathy with Alfred 's tenderness ? '
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 10]: ` Good gracious no , I hope not ! '
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 29]: ` Does n't it rather suggest , ' said Mrs Lammle archly , ` that my Georgiana 's little heart is -- ' ` Oh do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 6]: Miss Podsnap blushingly besought her .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 5]: ` Please do n't !
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 24]: I assure you , Sophronia , that I only praise Alfred , because he is your husband and so fond of you . '
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 15]: Sophronia 's glance was as if a rather new light broke in upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 40]: It shaded off into a cool smile , as she said , with her eyes upon her lunch , and her eyebrows raised : ` You are quite wrong , my love , in your guess at my meaning .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 19]: What I insinuated was , that my Georgiana 's little heart was growing conscious of a vacancy . '
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 12]: ` No , no , no , ' said Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 23]: I would n't have anybody say anything to me in that way for I do n't know how many thousand pounds . '
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 9]: ` In what way , my Georgiana ? '
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 19]: inquired Mrs Lammle , still smiling coolly with her eyes upon her lunch , and her eyebrows raised .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 12]: ` YOU know , ' returned poor little Miss Podsnap . '
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 23]: I think I should go out of my mind , Sophronia , with vexation and shyness and detestation , if anybody did .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 15]: It 's enough for me to see how loving you and your husband are .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 6]: That 's a different thing .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 15]: I could n't bear to have anything of that sort going on with myself .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 18]: I should beg and pray to -- to have the person taken away and trampled upon . '
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 4]: here was Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 45]: Having stolen in unobserved , he playfully leaned on the back of Sophronia 's chair , and , as Miss Podsnap saw him , put one of Sophronia 's wandering locks to his lips , and waved a kiss from it towards Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 10]: ` What is this about husbands and detestations ? '
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 5]: inquired the captivating Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 36]: ` Why , they say , ' returned his wife , ` that listeners never hear any good of themselves ; though you -- but pray how long have you been here , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 9]: ` This instant arrived , my own . '
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 31]: ` Then I may go on -- though if you had been here but a moment or two sooner , you would have heard your praises sounded by Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 38]: ` Only , if they were to be called praises at all which I really do n't think they were , ' explained Miss Podsnap in a flutter , ` for being so devoted to Sophronia . '
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 4]: ` Sophronia ! '
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 3]: murmured Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 5]: ` My life ! '
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 5]: and kissed her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 9]: In return for which she kissed his watch-chain .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 20]: ` But it was not I who was to be taken away and trampled upon , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 9]: said Alfred , drawing a seat between them .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 12]: ` Ask Georgiana , my soul , ' replied his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 6]: Alfred touchingly appealed to Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 12]: ` Oh , it was nobody , ' replied Miss Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 6]: ` It was nonsense . '
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 43]: ` But if you are determined to know , Mr Inquisitive Pet , as I suppose you are , ' said the happy and fond Sophronia , smiling , ` it was any one who should venture to aspire to Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 21]: ` Sophronia , my love , ' remonstrated Mr Lammle , becoming graver , ` you are not serious ? '
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 24]: ` Alfred , my love , ' returned his wife , ' I dare say Georgiana was not , but I am . '
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 20]: ` Now this , ' said Mr Lammle , ` shows the accidental combinations that there are in things !
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 26]: Could you believe , my Ownest , that I came in here with the name of an aspirant to our Georgiana on my lips ? '
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 22]: ` Of course I could believe , Alfred , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` anything that YOU told me . '
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 5]: ` You dear one !
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 9]: And I anything that YOU told me . '
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 11]: How delightful those interchanges , and the looks accompanying them !
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 29]: Now , if the skeleton up-stairs had taken that opportunity , for instance , of calling out ` Here I am , suffocating in the closet ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 25]: I give you my honour , my dear Sophronia -- ' ` And I know what that is , love , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 21]: ` You do , my darling -- that I came into the room all but uttering young Fledgeby 's name .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 10]: Tell Georgiana , dearest , about young Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 7]: ` Oh no , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 5]: Please do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 11]: cried Miss Podsnap , putting her fingers in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 7]: ` I 'd rather not . '
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 65]: Mrs Lammle laughed in her gayest manner , and , removing her Georgiana 's unresisting hands , and playfully holding them in her own at arms ' length , sometimes near together and sometimes wide apart , went on : ` You must know , you dearly beloved little goose , that once upon a time there was a certain person called young Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 35]: And this young Fledgeby , who was of an excellent family and rich , was known to two other certain persons , dearly attached to one another and called Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 37]: So this young Fledgeby , being one night at the play , there sees with Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle , a certain heroine called -- ' ` No , do n't say Georgiana Podsnap ! '
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 8]: pleaded that young lady almost in tears .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 5]: ` Please do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 8]: Oh do do do say somebody else !
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 4]: Not Georgiana Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 11]: Oh do n't , do n't , do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 37]: ` No other , ' said Mrs Lammle , laughing airily , and , full of affectionate blandishments , opening and closing Georgiana 's arms like a pair of compasses , than my little Georgiana Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 20]: So this young Fledgeby goes to that Alfred Lammle and says -- ' ` Oh ple-e-e-ease do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 17]: Georgiana , as if the supplication were being squeezed out of her by powerful compression . '
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 9]: I so hate him for saying it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 9]: ` For saying what , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 4]: laughed Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 29]: ` Oh , I do n't know what he said , ' cried Georgiana wildly , ` but I hate him all the same for saying it . '
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 34]: ` My dear , ' said Mrs Lammle , always laughing in her most captivating way , ` the poor young fellow only says that he is stricken all of a heap . '
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 10]: ` Oh , what shall I ever do ! '
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 3]: interposed Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 13]: ` Oh my goodness what a Fool he must be ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 20]: -- And implores to be asked to dinner , and to make a fourth at the play another time .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 13]: And so he dines to-morrow and goes to the Opera with us .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 4]: That 's all .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 14]: Except , my dear Georgiana -- and what will you think of this !
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 28]: -- that he is infinitely shyer than you , and far more afraid of you than you ever were of any one in all your days ! '
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 32]: In perturbation of mind Miss Podsnap still fumed and plucked at her hands a little , but could not help laughing at the notion of anybody 's being afraid of her .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 51]: With that advantage , Sophronia flattered her and rallied her more successfully , and then the insinuating Alfred flattered her and rallied her , and promised that at any moment when she might require that service at his hands , he would take young Fledgeby out and trample on him .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 82]: Thus it remained amicably understood that young Fledgeby was to come to admire , and that Georgiana was to come to be admired ; and Georgiana with the entirely new sensation in her breast of having that prospect before her , and with many kisses from her dear Sophronia in present possession , preceded six feet one of discontented footman -LRB- an amount of the article that always came for her when she walked home -RRB- to her father 's dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 33]: The happy pair being left together , Mrs Lammle said to her husband : ` If I understand this girl , sir , your dangerous fascinations have produced some effect upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 23]: I mention the conquest in good time because I apprehend your scheme to be more important to you than your vanity . '
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 20]: There was a mirror on the wall before them , and her eyes just caught him smirking in it .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 21]: She gave the reflected image a look of the deepest disdain , and the image received it in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 24]: Next moment they quietly eyed each other , as if they , the principals , had had no part in that expressive transaction .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 31]: It may have been that Mrs Lammle tried in some manner to excuse her conduct to herself by depreciating the poor little victim of whom she spoke with acrimonious contempt .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 31]: It may have been too that in this she did not quite succeed , for it is very difficult to resist confidence , and she knew she had Georgiana 's .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 9]: Nothing more was said between the happy pair .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 23]: Perhaps conspirators who have once established an understanding , may not be over-fond of repeating the terms and objects of their conspiracy .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 11]: Next day came ; came Georgiana ; and came Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 16]: Georgiana had by this time seen a good deal of the house and its frequenters .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 77]: As there was a certain handsome room with a billiard table in it -- on the ground floor , eating out a backyard -- which might have been Mr Lammle 's office , or library , but was called by neither name , but simply Mr Lammle 's room , so it would have been hard for stronger female heads than Georgiana 's to determine whether its frequenters were men of pleasure or men of business .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 14]: Between the room and the men there were strong points of general resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 40]: Both were too gaudy , too slangey , too odorous of cigars , and too much given to horseflesh ; the latter characteristic being exemplified in the room by its decorations , and in the men by their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 38]: High-stepping horses seemed necessary to all Mr Lammle 's friends -- as necessary as their transaction of business together in a gipsy way at untimely hours of the morning and evening , and in rushes and snatches .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 42]: There were friends who seemed to be always coming and going across the Channel , on errands about the Bourse , and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 46]: There were other friends who seemed to be always lolling and lounging in and out of the City , on questions of the Bourse , and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 29]: They were all feverish , boastful , and indefinably loose ; and they all ate and drank a great deal ; and made bets in eating and drinking .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 46]: They all spoke of sums of money , and only mentioned the sums and left the money to be understood ; as ` five and forty thousand Tom , ' or ` Two hundred and twenty-two on every individual share in the lot Joe . '
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 27]: They seemed to divide the world into two classes of people ; people who were making enormous fortunes , and people who were being enormously ruined .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 63]: They were always in a hurry , and yet seemed to have nothing tangible to do ; except a few of them -LRB- these , mostly asthmatic and thick-lipped -RRB- who were for ever demonstrating to the rest , with gold pencil-cases which they could hardly hold because of the big rings on their forefingers , how money was to be made .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 44]: Lastly , they all swore at their grooms , and the grooms were not quite as respectful or complete as other men 's grooms ; seeming somehow to fall short of the groom point as their masters fell short of the gentleman point .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 7]: Young Fledgeby was none of these .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 58]: Young Fledgeby had a peachy cheek , or a cheek compounded of the peach and the red red red wall on which it grows , and was an awkward , sandyhaired , small-eyed youth , exceeding slim -LRB- his enemies would have said lanky -RRB- , and prone to self-examination in the articles of whisker and moustache .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 27]: While feeling for the whisker that he anxiously expected , Fledgeby underwent remarkable fluctuations of spirits , ranging along the whole scale from confidence to despair .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 19]: There were times when he started , as exclaiming ` By Jupiter here it is at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 24]: There were other times when , being equally depressed , he would be seen to shake his head , and give up hope .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 47]: To see him at those periods leaning on a chimneypiece , like as on an urn containing the ashes of his ambition , with the cheek that would not sprout , upon the hand on which that cheek had forced conviction , was a distressing sight .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 9]: Not so was Fledgeby seen on this occasion .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 33]: Arrayed in superb raiment , with his opera hat under his arm , he concluded his selfexamination hopefully , awaited the arrival of Miss Podsnap , and talked small-talk with Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 39]: In facetious homage to the smallness of his talk , and the jerky nature of his manners , Fledgeby 's familiars had agreed to confer upon him -LRB- behind his back -RRB- the honorary title of Fascination Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 12]: ` Warm weather , Mrs Lammle , ' said Fascination Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 13]: Mrs Lammle thought it scarcely as warm as it had been yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 27]: ` Perhaps not , ' said Fascination Fledgeby , with great quickness of repartee ; ` but I expect it will be devilish warm to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 7]: He threw off another little scintillation .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 9]: ` Been out to-day , Mrs Lammle ? '
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 9]: Mrs Lammle answered , for a short drive .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 36]: ` Some people , ' said Fascination Fledgeby , ` are accustomed to take long drives ; but it generally appears to me that if they make 'em too long , they overdo it . '
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 22]: Being in such feather , he might have surpassed himself in his next sally , had not Miss Podsnap been announced .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 22]: Mrs Lammle flew to embrace her darling little Georgy , and when the first transports were over , presented Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 59]: Mr Lammle came on the scene last , for he was always late , and so were the frequenters always late ; all hands being bound to be made late , by private information about the Bourse , and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 40]: A handsome little dinner was served immediately , and Mr Lammle sat sparkling at his end of the table , with his servant behind his chair , and HIS ever-lingering doubts upon the subject of his wages behind himself .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 101]: Mr Lammle 's utmost powers of sparkling were in requisition to-day , for Fascination Fledgeby and Georgiana not only struck each other speechless , but struck each other into astonishing attitudes ; Georgiana , as she sat facing Fledgeby , making such efforts to conceal her elbows as were totally incompatible with the use of a knife and fork ; and Fledgeby , as he sat facing Georgiana , avoiding her countenance by every possible device , and betraying the discomposure of his mind in feeling for his whiskers with his spoon , his wine glass , and his bread .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 18]: So , Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle had to prompt , and this is how they prompted .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 30]: ` Georgiana , ' said Mr Lammle , low and smiling , and sparkling all over , like a harlequin ; ` you are not in your usual spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 12]: Why are you not in your usual spirits , Georgiana ? '
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 22]: Georgiana faltered that she was much the same as she was in general ; she was not aware of being different .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 8]: ` Not aware of being different ! '
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 5]: retorted Mr Alfred Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 7]: ` You , my dear Georgiana !
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 10]: Who are always so natural and unconstrained with us !
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 13]: Who are such a relief from the crowd that are all alike !
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 13]: Who are the embodiment of gentleness , simplicity , and reality ! '
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 22]: Miss Podsnap looked at the door , as if she entertained confused thoughts of taking refuge from these compliments in flight .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 26]: ` Now , I will be judged , ' said Mr Lammle , raising his voice a little , ` by my friend Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 6]: ` Oh DO N'T ! '
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 13]: Miss Podsnap faintly ejaculated : when Mrs Lammle took the prompt-book . '
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 29]: I beg your pardon , Alfred , my dear , but I can not part with Mr Fledgeby quite yet ; you must wait for him a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 12]: Mr Fledgeby and I are engaged in a personal discussion . '
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 24]: Fledgeby must have conducted it on his side with immense art , for no appearance of uttering one syllable had escaped him . '
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 9]: A personal discussion , Sophronia , my love ?
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 3]: What discussion ?
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 6]: Fledgeby , I am jealous .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 6]: What discussion , Fledgeby ? '
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 10]: ` Shall I tell him , Mr Fledgeby ? '
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 4]: asked Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 21]: Trying to look as if he knew anything about it , Fascination replied , ` Yes , tell him . '
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 31]: ` We were discussing then , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` if you MUST know , Alfred , whether Mr Fledgeby was in his usual flow of spirits . '
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 21]: ` Why , that is the very point , Sophronia , that Georgiana and I were discussing as to herself !
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 6]: What did Fledgeby say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 23]: ` Oh , a likely thing , sir , that I am going to tell you everything , and be told nothing !
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 6]: What did Georgiana say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 21]: ` Georgiana said she was doing her usual justice to herself to-day , and I said she was not . '
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 17]: ` Precisely , ' exclaimed Mrs Lammle , ` what I said to Mr Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 7]: Still , it would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 8]: They would not look at one another .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 21]: No , not even when the sparkling host proposed that the quartette should take an appropriately sparkling glass of wine .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 32]: Georgiana looked from her wine glass at Mr Lammle and at Mrs Lammle ; but might n't , could n't , should n't , would n't , look at Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 31]: Fascination looked from his wine glass at Mrs Lammle and at Mr Lammle ; but might n't , could n't , should n't , would n't , look at Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 5]: More prompting was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 9]: Cupid must be brought up to the mark .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 19]: The manager had put him down in the bill for the part , and he must play it .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 24]: ` Sophronia , my dear , ' said Mr Lammle , ' I do n't like the colour of your dress . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 14]: I appeal , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` to Mr Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 14]: ` And I , ' said Mr Lammle , ` to Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 29]: ` Georgy , my love , ' remarked Mrs Lammle aside to her dear girl , ' I rely upon you not to go over to the opposition .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 6]: Now , Mr Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 12]: Fascination wished to know if the colour were not called rosecolour ?
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 16]: Yes , said Mr Lammle ; actually he knew everything ; it was really rose-colour .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 10]: Fascination took rose-colour to mean the colour of roses .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 15]: -LRB- In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and Mrs Lammle . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 13]: Fascination had heard the term Queen of Flowers applied to the Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 15]: Similarly , it might be said that the dress was the Queen of Dresses .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 8]: -LRB- ` Very happy , Fledgeby ! '
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 5]: from Mr Lammle . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 40]: Notwithstanding , Fascination 's opinion was that we all had our eyes -- or at least a large majority of us -- and that -- and -- and his farther opinion was several ands , with nothing beyond them .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 19]: ` Oh , Mr Fledgeby , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` to desert me in that way !
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 18]: Oh , Mr Fledgeby , to abandon my poor dear injured rose and declare for blue ! '
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 6]: ` Victory , victory ! '
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 14]: cried Mr Lammle ; ` your dress is condemned , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 26]: ` But what , ' said Mrs Lammle , stealing her affectionate hand towards her dear girl 's , ` what does Georgy say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 54]: ` She says , ' replied Mr Lammle , interpreting for her , ` that in her eyes you look well in any colour , Sophronia , and that if she had expected to be embarrassed by so pretty a compliment as she has received , she would have worn another colour herself .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 29]: Though I tell her , in reply , that it would not have saved her , for whatever colour she had worn would have been Fledgeby 's colour .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 7]: But what does Fledgeby say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 54]: ` He says , ' replied Mrs Lammle , interpreting for him , and patting the back of her dear girl 's hand , as if it were Fledgeby who was patting it , ` that it was no compliment , but a little natural act of homage that he could n't resist .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 28]: And , ' expressing more feeling as if it were more feeling on the part of Fledgeby , ` he is right , he is right ! '
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 14]: Still , no not even now , would they look at one another .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 44]: Seeming to gnash his sparkling teeth , studs , eyes , and buttons , all at once , Mr Lammle secretly bent a dark frown on the two , expressive of an intense desire to bring them together by knocking their heads together .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 12]: ` Have you heard this opera of to-night , Fledgeby ? '
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 19]: he asked , stopping very short , to prevent himself from running on into ` confound you . '
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 11]: ` Why no , not exactly , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 13]: ` In fact I do n't know a note of it . '
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 10]: ` Neither do you know it , Georgy ? '
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 4]: said Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 14]: ` N-no , ' replied Georgiana , faintly , under the sympathetic coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 28]: ` Why , then , ' said Mrs Lammle , charmed by the discovery which flowed from the premises , ` you neither of you know it !
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 4]: How charming ! '
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 18]: Even the craven Fledgeby felt that the time was now come when he must strike a blow .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 57]: He struck it by saying , partly to Mrs Lammle and partly to the circumambient air , ' I consider myself very fortunate in being reserved by -- ' As he stopped dead , Mr Lammle , making that gingerous bush of his whiskers to look out of , offered him the word ` Destiny . '
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 16]: ` No , I was n't going to say that , ' said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 7]: I was going to say Fate .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 45]: I consider it very fortunate that Fate has written in the book of -- in the book which is its own property -- that I should go to that opera for the first time under the memorable circumstances of going with Miss Podsnap . '
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 43]: To which Georgiana replied , hooking her two little fingers in one another , and addressing the tablecloth , ` Thank you , but I generally go with no one but you , Sophronia , and I like that very much . '
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 33]: Content perforce with this success for the time , Mr Lammle let Miss Podsnap out of the room , as if he were opening her cage door , and Mrs Lammle followed .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 45]: Coffee being presently served up stairs , he kept a watch on Fledgeby until Miss Podsnap 's cup was empty , and then directed him with his finger -LRB- as if that young gentleman were a slow Retriever -RRB- to go and fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 30]: This feat he performed , not only without failure , but even with the original embellishment of informing Miss Podsnap that green tea was considered bad for the nerves .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 18]: Though there Miss Podsnap unintentionally threw him out by faltering , ` Oh , is it indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 6]: How does it act ? '
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 8]: Which he was not prepared to elucidate .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 31]: The carriage announced , Mrs Lammle said ; ` Do n't mind me , Mr Fledgeby , my skirts and cloak occupy both my hands , take Miss Podsnap . '
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 27]: And he took her , and Mrs Lammle went next , and Mr Lammle went last , savagely following his little flock , like a drover .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 36]: But he was all sparkle and glitter in the box at the Opera , and there he and his dear wife made a conversation between Fledgeby and Georgiana in the following ingenious and skilful manner .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 17]: They sat in this order : Mrs Lammle , Fascination Fledgeby , Georgiana , Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 13]: Mrs Lammle made leading remarks to Fledgeby , only requiring monosyllabic replies .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 8]: Mr Lammle did the like with Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 15]: At times Mrs Lammle would lean forward to address Mr Lammle to this purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 34]: ` Alfred , my dear , Mr Fledgeby very justly says , apropos of the last scene , that true constancy would not require any such stimulant as the stage deems necessary . '
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 40]: To which Mr Lammle would reply , ` Ay , Sophronia , my love , but as Georgiana has observed to me , the lady had no sufficient reason to know the state of the gentleman 's affections . '
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 22]: To which Mrs Lammle would rejoin , ` Very true , Alfred ; but Mr Fledgeby points out , ' this .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 19]: To which Alfred would demur : ` Undoubtedly , Sophronia , but Georgiana acutely remarks , ' that .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 43]: Through this device the two young people conversed at great length and committed themselves to a variety of delicate sentiments , without having once opened their lips , save to say yes or no , and even that not to one another .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 53]: Fledgeby took his leave of Miss Podsnap at the carriage door , and the Lammles dropped her at her own home , and on the way Mrs Lammle archly rallied her , in her fond and protecting manner , by saying at intervals , ` Oh little Georgiana , little Georgiana ! '
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 18]: Which was not much ; but the tone added , ` You have enslaved your Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 53]: And thus the Lammles got home at last , and the lady sat down moody and weary , looking at her dark lord engaged in a deed of violence with a bottle of soda-water as though he were wringing the neck of some unlucky creature and pouring its blood down his throat .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 31]: As he wiped his dripping whiskers in an ogreish way , he met her eyes , and pausing , said , with no very gentle voice : ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 13]: ` Was such an absolute Booby necessary to the purpose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 7]: I know what I am doing .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 11]: He is no such dolt as you suppose . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 6]: A genius , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 16]: ` You sneer , perhaps ; and you take a lofty air upon yourself perhaps !
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 24]: But I tell you this : -- when that young fellow 's interest is concerned , he holds as tight as a horse-leech .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 19]: When money is in question with that young fellow , he is a match for the Devil . '
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 9]: ` Is he a match for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 4]: ` He is .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 12]: Almost as good a one as you thought me for you .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 17]: He has no quality of youth in him , but such as you have seen to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 12]: Touch him upon money , and you touch no booby then .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 23]: He really is a dolt , I suppose , in other things ; but it answers his one purpose very well . '
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 13]: ` Has she money in her own right in any case ? '
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 3]: ` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 11]: she has money in her own right in any case .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 25]: You have done so well to-day , Sophronia , that I answer the question , though you know I object to any such questions .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 15]: You have done so well today , Sophronia , that you must be tired .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 5]: Get to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 12]: Chapter 5 MERCURY PROMPTING Fledgeby deserved Mr Alfred Lammle 's eulogium .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 14]: He was the meanest cur existing , with a single pair of legs .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 35]: And instinct -LRB- a word we all clearly understand -RRB- going largely on four legs , and reason always on two , meanness on four legs never attains the perfection of meanness on two .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 45]: The father of this young gentleman had been a money-lender , who had transacted professional business with the mother of this young gentleman , when he , the latter , was waiting in the vast dark antechambers of the present world to be born .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 39]: The lady , a widow , being unable to pay the money-lender , married him ; and in due course , Fledgeby was summoned out of the vast dark antechambers to come and be presented to the Registrar-General .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 16]: Rather a curious speculation how Fledgehy would otherwise have disposed of his leisure until Doomsday .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 12]: Fledgeby 's mother offended her family by marrying Fledgeby 's father .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 23]: It is one of the easiest achievements in life to offend your family when your family want to get rid of you .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 25]: Fledgeby 's mother 's family had been very much offended with her for being poor , and broke with her for becoming comparatively rich .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 10]: Fledgeby 's mother 's family was the Snigsworth family .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 47]: She had even the high honour to be cousin to Lord Snigsworth -- so many times removed that the noble Earl would have had no compunction in removing her one time more and dropping her clean outside the cousinly pale ; but cousin for all that .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 27]: Among her pre-matrimonial transactions with Fledgeby 's father , Fledgeby 's mother had raised money of him at a great disadvantage on a certain reversionary interest .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 25]: The reversion falling in soon after they were married , Fledgeby 's father laid hold of the cash for his separate use and benefit .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 63]: This led to subjective differences of opinion , not to say objective interchanges of bootjacks , backgammon boards , and other such domestic missiles , between Fledgeby 's father and Fledgeby 's mother , and those led to Fledgeby 's mother spending as much money as she could , and to Fledgeby 's father doing all he could n't to restrain her .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 31]: Fledgeby 's childhood had been , in consequence , a stormy one ; but the winds and the waves had gone down in the grave , and Fledgeby flourished alone .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 17]: He lived in chambers in the Albany , did Fledgeby , and maintained a spruce appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 47]: But his youthful fire was all composed of sparks from the grindstone ; and as the sparks flew off , went out , and never warmed anything , be sure that Fledgeby had his tools at the grindstone , and turned it with a wary eye .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 13]: Mr Alfred Lammle came round to the Albany to breakfast with Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 42]: Present on the table , one scanty pot of tea , one scanty loaf , two scanty pats of butter , two scanty rashers of bacon , two pitiful eggs , and an abundance of handsome china bought a secondhand bargain .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 9]: ` What did you think of Georgiana ? '
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 4]: asked Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 15]: ` Why , I 'll tell you , ' said Fledgeby , very deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 7]: ` Do , my boy . '
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 10]: ` You misunderstand me , ' said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 10]: I do n't mean I 'll tell you that .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 10]: I mean I 'll tell you something else . '
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 9]: ` Tell me anything , old fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 15]: ` Ah , but there you misunderstand me again , ' said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 9]: I mean I 'll tell you nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 12]: Mr Lammle sparkled at him , but frowned at him too .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 8]: ` Look here , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 9]: ` You 're deep and you 're ready .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 10]: Whether I am deep or not , never mind .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 5]: I am not ready .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 15]: But I can do one thing , Lammle , I can hold my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 8]: And I intend always doing it . '
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 10]: ` You are a long-headed fellow , Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 9]: ` May be , or may not be .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 15]: If I am a short-tongued fellow , it may amount to the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 13]: Now , Lammle , I am never going to answer questions . '
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 15]: ` My dear fellow , it was the simplest question in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 4]: ` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 13]: It seemed so , but things are not always what they seem .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 12]: I saw a man examined as a witness in Westminster Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 27]: Questions put to him seemed the simplest in the world , but turned out to be anything rather than that , after he had answered 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 8]: Then he should have held his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 19]: If he had held his tongue he would have kept out of scrapes that he got into . '
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 25]: ` If I had held my tongue , you would never have seen the subject of my question , ' remarked Lammle , darkening .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 22]: ` Now , Lammle , ' said Fascination Fledgeby , calmly feeling for his whisker , ` it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 10]: I wo n't be led on into a discussion .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 7]: I ca n't manage a discussion .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 10]: But I can manage to hold my tongue . '
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 4]: ` Can ? '
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 8]: Mr Lammie fell back upon propitiation . '
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 6]: I should think you could !
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 27]: Why , when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with them , the more talkative they get , the more silent you get .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 14]: The more they let out , the more you keep in . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 28]: I do n't object , Lammle , ' returned Fledgeby , with an internal chuckle , ` to being understood , though I object to being questioned .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 10]: That certainly IS the way I do it . '
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 27]: ` And when all the rest of us are discussing our ventures , none of us ever know what a single venture of yours is ! '
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 32]: ` And none of you ever will from me , Lammle , ' replied Fledgeby , with another internal chuckle ; ` that certainly IS the way I do it . '
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 11]: ` Why of course it is , I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 30]: rejoined Lammle , with a flourish of frankness , and a laugh , and stretching out his hands as if to show the universe a remarkable man in Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 26]: ` If I had n't known it of my Fledgeby , should I have proposed our little compact of advantage , to my Fledgeby ? '
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 8]: remarked Fascination , shaking his head slyly .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 13]: ` But I am not to be got at in that way .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 5]: I am not vain .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 10]: That sort of vanity do n't pay , Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 6]: No , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 11]: Compliments only make me hold my tongue the more . '
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 41]: Alfred Lammle pushed his plate away -LRB- no great sacrifice under the circumstances of there being so little in it -RRB- , thrust his hands in his pockets , leaned back in his chair , and contemplated Fledgeby in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 25]: Then he slowly released his left hand from its pocket , and made that bush of his whiskers , still contemplating him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 24]: Then he slowly broke silence , and slowly said : ` What -- the -- Dev-il is this fellow about this morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 79]: ` Now , look here , Lammle , ' said Fascination Fledgeby , with the meanest of twinkles in his meanest of eyes : which were too near together , by the way : ` look here , Lammle ; I am very well aware that I did n't show to advantage last night , and that you and your wife -- who , I consider , is a very clever woman and an agreeable woman -- did .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 14]: I am not calculated to show to advantage under that sort of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 15]: I know very well you two did show to advantage , and managed capitally .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 25]: But do n't you on that account come talking to me as if I was your doll and puppet , because I am not .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 47]: ` And all this , ' cried Alfred , after studying with a look the meanness that was fain to have the meanest help , and yet was so mean as to turn upon it : ` all this because of one simple natural question ! '
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 17]: ` You should have waited till I thought proper to say something about it of myself .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 23]: I do n't like your coming over me with your Georgianas , as if you was her proprietor and mine too . '
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 28]: ` Well , when you are in the gracious mind to say anything about it of yourself , ' retorted Lammle , ` pray do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 5]: I have done it .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 7]: I have said you managed capitally .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 6]: You and your wife both .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 16]: If you 'll go on managing capitally , I 'll go on doing my part .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 7]: Only do n't crow . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 4]: I crow ! '
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 7]: exclaimed Lammle , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 47]: ` Or , ' pursued the other -- ` or take it in your head that people are your puppets because they do n't come out to advantage at the particular moments when you do , with the assistance of a very clever and agreeable wife .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 15]: All the rest keep on doing , and let Mrs Lammle keep on doing .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 29]: Now , I have held my tongue when I thought proper , and I have spoken when I thought proper , and there 's an end of that .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 23]: And now the question is , ' proceeded Fledgeby , with the greatest reluctance , ` will you have another egg ? '
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 13]: ` No , I wo n't , ' said Lammle , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 22]: ` Perhaps you 're right and will find yourself better without it , ' replied Fascination , in greatly improved spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 24]: ` To ask you if you 'll have another rasher would be unmeaning flattery , for it would make you thirsty all day .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 10]: Will you have some more bread and butter ? '
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 11]: ` No , I wo n't , ' repeated Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 9]: ` Then I will , ' said Fascination .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 76]: And it was not a mere retort for the sound 's sake , but was a cheerful cogent consequence of the refusal ; for if Lammle had applied himself again to the loaf , it would have been so heavily visited , in Fledgeby 's opinion , as to demand abstinence from bread , on his part , for the remainder of that meal at least , if not for the whole of the next .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 46]: Whether this young gentleman -LRB- for he was but three-and-twenty -RRB- combined with the miserly vice of an old man , any of the openhanded vices of a young one , was a moot point ; so very honourably did he keep his own counsel .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 62]: He was sensible of the value of appearances as an investment , and liked to dress well ; but he drove a bargain for every moveable about him , from the coat on his back to the china on his breakfast-table ; and every bargain by representing somebody 's ruin or somebody 's loss , acquired a peculiar charm for him .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 40]: It was a part of his avarice to take , within narrow bounds , long odds at races ; if he won , he drove harder bargains ; if he lost , he half starved himself until next time .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 79]: Why money should be so precious to an Ass too dull and mean to exchange it for any other satisfaction , is strange ; but there is no animal so sure to get laden with it , as the Ass who sees nothing written on the face of the earth and sky but the three letters L. S. D. -- not Luxury , Sensuality , Dissoluteness , which they often stand for , but the three dry letters .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 13]: Your concentrated Fox is seldom comparable to your concentrated Ass in money-breeding .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 40]: Fascination Fledgeby feigned to be a young gentleman living on his means , but was known secretly to be a kind of outlaw in the bill-broking line , and to put money out at high interest in various ways .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 44]: His circle of familiar acquaintance , from Mr Lammle round , all had a touch of the outlaw , as to their rovings in the merry greenwood of Jobbery Forest , lying on the outskirts of the Share-Market and the Stock Exchange . '
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 26]: I suppose you , Lammle , ' said Fledgeby , eating his bread and butter , ` always did go in for female society ? '
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 14]: ` Always , ' replied Lammle , glooming considerably under his late treatment .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 9]: ` Came natural to you , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 32]: ` The sex were pleased to like me , sir , ' said Lammle sulkily , but with the air of a man who had not been able to help himself .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 14]: ` Made a pretty good thing of marrying , did n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 3]: asked Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 17]: The other smiled -LRB- an ugly smile -RRB- , and tapped one tap upon his nose .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 14]: ` My late governor made a mess of it , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 13]: ` But Geor -- is the right name Georgina or Georgiana ? '
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 5]: ` Georgiana . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 15]: I was thinking yesterday , I did n't know there was such a name .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 8]: I thought it must end in ina .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 24]: ` Why , you play -- if you can -- the Concertina , you know , ' replied Fledgeby , meditating very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 13]: ` And you have -- when you catch it -- the Scarlatina .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 18]: And you can come down from a balloon in a parach -- no you ca n't though .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 10]: Well , say Georgeute -- I mean Georgiana . '
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 11]: ` You were going to remark of Georgiana -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 10]: Lammle moodily hinted , after waiting in vain . '
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 37]: I was going to remark of Georgiana , sir , ' said Fledgeby , not at all pleased to be reminded of his having forgotten it , ` that she do n't seem to be violent .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 11]: Do n't seem to be of the pitching-in order . '
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 13]: ` She has the gentleness of the dove , Mr Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 23]: ` Of course you 'll say so , ' replied Fledgeby , sharpening , the moment his interest was touched by another .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 21]: ` But you know , the real lookout is this : -- what I say , not what you say .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 27]: I say having my late governor and my late mother in my eye -- that Georgiana do n't seem to be of the pitching-in order . '
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 15]: The respected Mr Lammle was a bully , by nature and by usual practice .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 37]: Perceiving , as Fledgeby 's affronts cumulated , that conciliation by no means answered the purpose here , he now directed a scowling look into Fledgeby 's small eyes for the effect of the opposite treatment .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 28]: Satisfied by what he saw there , he burst into a violent passion and struck his hand upon the table , making the china ring and dance .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 17]: ` You are a very offensive fellow , sir , ' cried Mr Lammle , rising .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 8]: ` You are a highly offensive scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 10]: What do you mean by this behaviour ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 4]: I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 3]: remonstrated Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 7]: ` Do n't break out . '
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 14]: ` You are a very offensive fellow sir , ' repeated Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 10]: ` You are a highly offensive scoundrel ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 7]: I SAY , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 5]: urged Fledgeby , quailing .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 10]: ` Why , you coarse and vulgar vagabond ! '
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 43]: said Mr Lammle , looking fiercely about him , ` if your servant was here to give me sixpence of your money to get my boots cleaned afterwards -- for you are not worth the expenditure -- I 'd kick you . '
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 11]: ` No you would n't , ' pleaded Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 12]: I am sure you 'd think better of it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 15]: I tell you what , Mr Fledgeby , ' said Lammle advancing on him .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 15]: ` Since you presume to contradict me , I 'll assert myself a little .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 6]: Give me your nose ! '
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 21]: Fledgeby covered it with his hand instead , and said , retreating , ' I beg you wo n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 12]: ` Give me your nose , sir , ' repeated Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 33]: Still covering that feature and backing , Mr Fledgeby reiterated -LRB- apparently with a severe cold in his head -RRB- , ' I beg , I beg , you wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 41]: ` And this fellow , ' exclaimed Lammle , stopping and making the most of his chest -- ` This fellow presumes on my having selected him out of all the young fellows I know , for an advantageous opportunity !
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 45]: This fellow presumes on my having in my desk round the corner , his dirty note of hand for a wretched sum payable on the occurrence of a certain event , which event can only be of my and my wife 's bringing about !
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 14]: This fellow , Fledgeby , presumes to be impertinent to me , Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 7]: Give me your nose sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 2]: Stop !
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 12]: I beg your pardon , ' said Fledgeby , with humility .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 9]: ` What do you say , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 11]: demanded Mr Lammle , seeming too furious to understand . '
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 9]: I beg your pardon , ' repeated Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 8]: ` Repeat your words louder , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 15]: The just indignation of a gentleman has sent the blood boiling to my head .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 8]: I do n't hear you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 19]: I say , ' repeated Fledgeby , with laborious explanatory politeness , ' I beg your pardon . '
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 4]: Mr Lammle paused .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 23]: ` As a man of honour , ' said he , throwing himself into a chair , ' I am disarmed . '
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 22]: Mr Fledgeby also took a chair , though less demonstratively , and by slow approaches removed his hand from his nose .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 46]: Some natural diffidence assailed him as to blowing it , so shortly after its having assumed a personal and delicate , not to say public , character ; but he overcame his scruples by degrees , and modestly took that liberty under an implied protest .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 22]: ` Lammle , ' he said sneakingly , when that was done , ' I hope we are friends again ? '
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 15]: ` Mr Fledgeby , ' returned Lammle , ` say no more . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 23]: I must have gone too far in making myself disagreeable , ' said Fledgeby , ` but I never intended it . '
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 10]: ` Say no more , say no more ! '
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 8]: Mr Lammle repeated in a magnificent tone .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 13]: ` Give me your ' -- Fledgeby started -- ` hand . '
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 19]: They shook hands , and on Mr Lammle 's part , in particular , there ensued great geniality .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 50]: For , he was quite as much of a dastard as the other , and had been in equal danger of falling into the second place for good , when he took heart just in time , to act upon the information conveyed to him by Fledgeby 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 8]: The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 61]: Incessant machinations were to be kept at work by Mr and Mrs Lammle ; love was to be made for Fledgeby , and conquest was to be insured to him ; he on his part very humbly admitting his defects as to the softer social arts , and entreating to be backed to the utmost by his two able coadjutors .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 14]: Little recked Mr Podsnap of the traps and toils besetting his Young Person .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 37]: He regarded her as safe within the Temple of Podsnappery , hiding the fulness of time when she , Georgiana , should take him , Fitz-Podsnap , who with all his worldly goods should her endow .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 38]: It would call a blush into the cheek of his standard Young Person to have anything to do with such matters save to take as directed , and with worldly goods as per settlement to be endowed .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 11]: Who giveth this woman to be married to this man ?
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 4]: I , Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 12]: Perish the daring thought that any smaller creation should come between !
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 23]: It was a public holiday , and Fledgeby did not recover his spirits or his usual temperature of nose until the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 43]: Walking into the City in the holiday afternoon , he walked against a living stream setting out of it ; and thus , when he turned into the precincts of St Mary Axe , he found a prevalent repose and quiet there .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 13]: A yellow overhanging plaster-fronted house at which be stopped was quiet too .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 29]: The blinds were all drawn down , and the inscription Pubsey and Co. seemed to doze in the counting-house window on the ground-floor giving on the sleepy street .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 16]: Fledgeby knocked and rang , and Fledgeby rang and knocked , but no one came .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 19]: Fledgeby crossed the narrow street and looked up at the house-windows , but nobody looked down at Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 36]: He got out of temper , crossed the narrow street again , and pulled the housebell as if it were the house 's nose , and he were taking a hint from his late experience .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 20]: His ear at the keyhole seemed then , at last , to give him assurance that something stirred within .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 40]: His eye at the keyhole seemed to confirm his ear , for he angrily pulled the house 's nose again , and pulled and pulled and continued to pull , until a human nose appeared in the dark doorway .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 6]: ` Now you sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 3]: cried Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 7]: ` These are nice games ! '
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 20]: He addressed an old Jewish man in an ancient coat , long of skirt , and wide of pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 30]: A venerable man , bald and shining at the top of his head , and with long grey hair flowing down at its sides and mingling with his beard .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 34]: A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage bent his head , and stretched out his hands with the palms downward , as if to deprecate the wrath of a superior .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 9]: ` What have you been up to ? '
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 7]: said Fledgeby , storming at him .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 23]: ` Generous Christian master , ' urged the Jewish man , ` it being holiday , I looked for no one . '
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 6]: ` Holiday he blowed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 5]: said Fledgeby , entering .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 10]: ` What have YOU got to do with holidays ?
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 5]: Shut the door . '
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 9]: With his former action the old man obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 35]: In the entry hung his rusty large-brimmed low-crowned hat , as long out of date as his coat ; in the corner near it stood his staff -- no walking-stick but a veritable staff .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 18]: Fledgeby turned into the counting-house , perched himself on a business stool , and cocked his hat .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 18]: There were light boxes on shelves in the counting-house , and strings of mock beads hanging up .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 15]: There were samples of cheap clocks , and samples of cheap vases of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 5]: Foreign toys , all .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 57]: Perched on the stool with his hat cocked on his head and one of his legs dangling , the youth of Fledgeby hardly contrasted to advantage with the age of the Jewish man as he stood with his bare head bowed , and his eyes -LRB- which he only raised in speaking -RRB- on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 27]: His clothing was worn down to the rusty hue of the hat in the entry , but though he looked shabby he did not look mean .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 12]: Now , Fledgeby , though not shabby , did look mean .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 29]: ` You have not told me what you were up to , you sir , ' said Fledgeby , scratching his head with the brim of his hat .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 10]: ` Sir , I was breathing the air . '
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 12]: ` In the cellar , that you did n't hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 6]: ` On the house-top . '
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 5]: ` Upon my soul !
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 9]: That 's a way of doing business . '
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 36]: ` Sir , ' the old man represented with a grave and patient air , ` there must be two parties to the transaction of business , and the holiday has left me alone . '
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 8]: Ca n't be buyer and seller too .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 12]: That 's what the Jews say ; ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 21]: ` At least we say truly , if we say so , ' answered the old man with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 19]: ` Your people need speak the truth sometimes , for they lie enough , ' remarked Fascination Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 26]: ` Sir , there is , ' returned the old man with quiet emphasis , ` too much untruth among all denominations of men . '
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 22]: Rather dashed , Fascination Fledgeby took another scratch at his intellectual head with his hat , to gain time for rallying .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 32]: ` For instance , ' he resumed , as though it were he who had spoken last , ` who but you and I ever heard of a poor Jew ? '
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 21]: ` The Jews , ' said the old man , raising his eyes from the ground with his former smile .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 16]: ` They hear of poor Jews often , and are very good to them . '
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 5]: ` Bother that ! '
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 3]: returned Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 7]: ` You know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 15]: You 'd persuade me if you could , that you are a poor Jew .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 17]: I wish you 'd confess how much you really did make out of my late governor .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 10]: I should have a better opinion of you . '
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 16]: The old man only bent his head , and stretched out his hands as before .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 36]: ` Do n't go on posturing like a Deaf and Dumb School , ' said the ingenious Fledgeby , ` but express yourself like a Christian -- or as nearly as you can . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 30]: I had had sickness and misfortunes , and was so poor , ' said the old man , ` as hopelessly to owe the father , principal and interest .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 19]: The son inheriting , was so merciful as to forgive me both , and place me here . '
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 23]: He made a little gesture as though he kissed the hem of an imaginary garment worn by the noble youth before him .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 16]: It was humbly done , but picturesquely , and was not abasing to the doer .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 47]: ` You wo n't say more , I see , ' said Fledgeby , looking at him as if he would like to try the effect of extracting a double-tooth or two , ` and so it 's of no use my putting it to you .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 15]: But confess this , Riah ; who believes you to be poor now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 10]: ` No one , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 10]: ` There you 're right , ' assented Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 18]: ` No one , ' repeated the old man with a grave slow wave of his head .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 8]: ` All scout it as a fable .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 76]: Were I to say `` This little fancy business is not mine '' ; ' with a lithe sweep of his easily-turning hand around him , to comprehend the various objects on the shelves ; ' `` it is the little business of a Christian young gentleman who places me , his servant , in trust and charge here , and to whom I am accountable for every single bead , '' they would laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 21]: When , in the larger money-business , I tell the borrowers -- ' ' I say , old chap ! '
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 15]: interposed Fledgeby , ' I hope you mind what you DO tell 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 15]: ` Sir , I tell them no more than I am about to repeat .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 65]: When I tell them , `` I can not promise this , I can not answer for the other , I must see my principal , I have not the money , I am a poor man and it does not rest with me , '' they are so unbelieving and so impatient , that they sometimes curse me in Jehovah 's name . '
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 10]: ` That 's deuced good , that is ! '
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 4]: said Fascination Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 21]: ` And at other times they say , `` Can it never be done without these tricks , Mr Riah ?
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 19]: Come , come , Mr Riah , we know the arts of your people '' -- my people !
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 31]: -- `` If the money is to be lent , fetch it , fetch it ; if it is not to be lent , keep it and say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 6]: They never believe me . '
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 11]: ` THAT 'S all right , ' said Fascination Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 14]: ` They say , `` We know , Mr Riah , we know .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 14]: We have but to look at you , and we know . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 32]: ` Oh , a good ` un are you for the post , ' thought Fledgeby , ` and a good ` un was I to mark you out for it !
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 12]: I may be slow , but I am precious sure . '
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 29]: Not a syllable of this reflection shaped itself in any scrap of Mr Fledgeby 's breath , lest it should tend to put his servant 's price up .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 64]: But looking at the old man as he stood quiet with his bead bowed and his eyes cast down , he felt that to relinquish an inch of his baldness , an inch of his grey hair , an inch of his coat-skirt , an inch of his hat-brim , an inch of his walking-staff , would be to relinquish hundreds of pounds .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 17]: ` Look here , Riah , ' said Fledgeby , mollified by these self-approving considerations . '
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 12]: I want to go a little more into buying-up queer bills .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 7]: Look out in that direction . '
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 9]: ` Sir , it shall be done . '
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 26]: ` Casting my eye over the accounts , I find that branch of business pays pretty fairly , and I am game for extending it .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 9]: I like to know people 's affairs likewise .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 5]: So look out . '
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 9]: ` Sir , I will , promptly . '
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 43]: ` Put it about in the right quarters , that you 'll buy queer bills by the lump -- by the pound weight if that 's all -- supposing you see your way to a fair chance on looking over the parcel .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 7]: And there 's one thing more .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 19]: Come to me with the books for periodical inspection as usual , at eight on Monday morning . '
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 13]: Riah drew some folding tablets from his breast and noted it down .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 57]: ` That 's all I wanted to say at the present time , ' continued Fledgeby in a grudging vein , as he got off the stool , ` except that I wish you 'd take the air where you can hear the bell , or the knocker , either one of the two or both .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 14]: By-the-by how DO you take the air at the top of the house ?
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 11]: Do you stick your head out of a chimney-pot ? '
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 18]: ` Sir , there are leads there , and I have made a little garden there . '
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 13]: ` To bury your money in , you old dodger ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 19]: A thumbnail 's space of garden would hold the treasure I bury , master , ' said Riah .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 21]: ` Twelve shillings a week , even when they are an old man 's wages , bury themselves . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 31]: I should like to know what you really are worth , ' returned Fledgeby , with whom his growing rich on that stipend and gratitude was a very convenient fiction .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 4]: ` But come !
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 17]: Let 's have a look at your garden on the tiles , before I go ! '
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 11]: The old man took a step back , and hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 11]: ` Truly , sir , I have company there . '
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 8]: ` Have you , by George ! '
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 16]: said Fledgeby ; ' I suppose you happen to know whose premises these are ? '
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 16]: ` Sir , they are yours , and I am your servant in them . '
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 37]: I thought you might have overlooked that , ' retorted Fledgeby , with his eyes on Riah 's beard as he felt for his own ; ` having company on my premises , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 10]: ` Come up and see the guests , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 13]: I hope for your admission that they can do no harm . '
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 36]: Passing him with a courteous reverence , specially unlike any action that Mr Fledgeby could for his life have imparted to his own head and hands , the old man began to ascend the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 46]: As he toiled on before , with his palm upon the stair-rail , and his long black skirt , a very gaberdine , overhanging each successive step , he might have been the leader in some pilgrimage of devotional ascent to a prophet 's tomb .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 39]: Not troubled by any such weak imagining , Fascination Fledgeby merely speculated on the time of life at which his beard had begun , and thought once more what a good ` un he was for the part .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 18]: Some final wooden steps conducted them , stooping under a low penthouse roof , to the house-top .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 16]: Riah stood still , and , turning to his master , pointed out his guests .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 6]: Lizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 20]: For whom , perhaps with some old instinct of his race , the gentle Jew had spread a carpet .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 45]: Seated on it , against no more romantic object than a blackened chimneystack over which some bumble creeper had been trained , they both pored over one book ; both with attentive faces ; Jenny with the sharper ; Lizzie with the more perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 29]: Another little book or two were lying near , and a common basket of common fruit , and another basket full of strings of beads and tinsel scraps .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 49]: A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens completed the garden ; and the encompassing wilderness of dowager old chimneys twirled their cowls and fluttered their smoke , rather as if they were bridling , and fanning themselves , and looking on in a state of airy surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 25]: Taking her eyes off the book , to test her memory of something in it , Lizzie was the first to see herself observed .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 45]: As she rose , Miss Wren likewise became conscious , and said , irreverently addressing the great chief of the premises : ` Whoever you are , I ca n't get up , because my back 's bad and my legs are queer . '
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 13]: ` This is my master , ' said Riah , stepping forward .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 27]: -LRB- ` Do n't look like anybody 's master , ' observed Miss Wren to herself , with a hitch of her chin and eyes . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 20]: ` This , sir , ' pursued the old man , ` is a little dressmaker for little people .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 8]: Explain to the master , Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 13]: ` Dolls ; that 's all , ' said Jenny , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 14]: ` Very difficult to fit too , because their figures are so uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 10]: You never know where to expect their waists . '
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 21]: ` Her friend , ' resumed the old man , motioning towards Lizzie ; ` and as industrious as virtuous .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 6]: But that they both are .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 28]: They are busy early and late , sir , early and late ; and in bye-times , as on this holiday , they go to book-learning . '
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 15]: ` Not much good to be got out of that , ' remarked Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 7]: ` Depends upon the person ! '
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 9]: quoth Miss Wren , snapping him up . '
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 42]: I made acquaintance with my guests , sir , ' pursued the Jew , with an evident purpose of drawing out the dressmaker , ` through their coming here to buy of our damage and waste for Miss Jenny 's millinery .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 17]: Our waste goes into the best of company , sir , on her rosy-cheeked little customers .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 28]: They wear it in their hair , and on their ball-dresses , and even -LRB- so she tells me -RRB- are presented at Court with it . '
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 27]: said Fledgeby , on whose intelligence this doll-fancy made rather strong demands ; ` she 's been buying that basketful to-day , I suppose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 21]: I suppose she has , ' Miss Jenny interposed ; ` and paying for it too , most likely ! '
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 15]: ` Let 's have a look at it , ' said the suspicious chief .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 6]: Riah handed it to him .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 8]: ` How much for this now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 11]: ` Two precious silver shillings , ' said Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 13]: Riah confirmed her with two nods , as Fledgeby looked to him .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 6]: A nod for each shilling .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 26]: ` Well , ' said Fledgeby , poking into the contents of the basket with his forefinger , ` the price is not so bad .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 10]: You have got good measure , Miss What-is-it . '
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 13]: ` Try Jenny , ' suggested that young lady with great calmness .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 18]: ` You have got good measure , Miss Jenny ; but the price is not so bad .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 24]: -- And you , ' said Fledgeby , turning to the other visitor , ` do you buy anything here , miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 9]: ` Nor sell anything neither , miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 32]: Looking askew at the questioner , Jenny stole her hand up to her friend 's , and drew her friend down , so that she bent beside her on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 16]: ` We are thankful to come here for rest , sir , ' said Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 23]: ` You see , you do n't know what the rest of this place is to us ; does he , Lizzie ?
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 10]: It 's the quiet , and the air . '
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 5]: ` The quiet ! '
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 16]: repeated Fledgeby , with a contemptuous turn of his head towards the City 's roar .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 6]: ` And the air ! '
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 6]: with a ` Poof ! '
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 4]: at the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 3]: said Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 7]: ` But it 's so high .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 45]: And you see the clouds rushing on above the narrow streets , not minding them , and you see the golden arrows pointing at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes , and you feel as if you were dead . '
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 14]: The little creature looked above her , holding up her slight transparent hand .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 11]: ` How do you feel when you are dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 6]: asked Fledgeby , much perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 7]: ` Oh , so tranquil ! '
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 7]: cried the little creature , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 9]: ` Oh , so peaceful and so thankful !
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 34]: And you hear the people who are alive , crying , and working , and calling to one another down in the close dark streets , and you seem to pity them so !
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 21]: And such a chain has fallen from you , and such a strange good sorrowful happiness comes upon you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 19]: Her eyes fell on the old man , who , with his hands folded , quietly looked on .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 31]: ` Why it was only just now , ' said the little creature , pointing at him , ` that I fancied I saw him come out of his grave !
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 48]: He toiled out at that low door so bent and worn , and then he took his breath and stood upright , and looked all round him at the sky , and the wind blew upon him , and his life down in the dark was over !
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 24]: -- Till he was called back to life , ' she added , looking round at Fledgeby with that lower look of sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 9]: ` Why did you call him back ? '
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 13]: ` He was long enough coming , anyhow , ' grumbled Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 15]: ` But you are not dead , you know , ' said Jenny Wren .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 7]: ` Get down to life ! '
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 18]: Mr Fledgeby seemed to think it rather a good suggestion , and with a nod turned round .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 30]: As Riah followed to attend him down the stairs , the little creature called out to the Jew in a silvery tone , ` Do n't be long gone .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 8]: Come back , and be dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 38]: And still as they went down they heard the little sweet voice , more and more faintly , half calling and half singing , ` Come back and be dead , Come back and be dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 46]: When they got down into the entry , Fledgeby , pausing under the shadow of the broad old hat , and mechanically poising the staff , said to the old man : ` That 's a handsome girl , that one in her senses . '
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 11]: ` And as good as handsome , ' answered Riah .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 38]: ` At all events , ' observed Fledgeby , with a dry whistle , ' I hope she ai n't bad enough to put any chap up to the fastenings , and get the premises broken open .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 4]: You look out .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 16]: Keep your weather eye awake and do n't make any more acquaintances , however handsome .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 11]: Of course you always keep my name to yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 8]: ` Sir , assuredly I do . '
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 31]: ` If they ask it , say it 's Pubsey , or say it 's Co , or say it 's anything you like , but what it is . '
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 45]: His grateful servant -- in whose race gratitude is deep , strong , and enduring -- bowed his head , and actually did now put the hem of his coat to his lips : though so lightly that the wearer knew nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 35]: Thus , Fascination Fledgeby went his way , exulting in the artful cleverness with which he had turned his thumb down on a Jew , and the old man went his different way up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 59]: As he mounted , the call or song began to sound in his ears again , and , looking above , he saw the face of the little creature looking down out of a Glory of her long bright radiant hair , and musically repeating to him , like a vision : ` Come up and be dead !
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 7]: Come up and be dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 21]: Chapter 6 A RIDDLE WITHOUT AN ANSWER Again Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr Eugene Wrayburn sat together in the Temple .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 57]: This evening , however , they were not together in the place of business of the eminent solicitor , but in another dismal set of chambers facing it on the same second-floor ; on whose dungeon-like black outer-door appeared the legend : PRIVATE MR EUGENE WRAYBURN MR MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD -LRB- Mr Lightwood 's Offices opposite . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 11]: Appearances indicated that this establishment was a very recent institution .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 62]: The white letters of the inscription were extremely white and extremely strong to the sense of smell , the complexion of the tables and chairs was -LRB- like Lady Tippins 's -RRB- a little too blooming to be believed in , and the carpets and floorcloth seemed to rush at the beholder 's face in the unusual prominency of their patterns .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 33]: But the Temple , accustomed to tone down both the still life and the human life that has much to do with it , would soon get the better of all that .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 16]: said Eugene , on one side of the fire , ' I feel tolerably comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 10]: I hope the upholsterer may do the same . '
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 7]: ` Why should n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 11]: asked Lightwood , from the other side of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 36]: ` To be sure , ' pursued Eugene , reflecting , ` he is not in the secret of our pecuniary affairs , so perhaps he may be in an easy frame of mind . '
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 10]: ` We shall pay him , ' said Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 7]: ` Shall we , really ? '
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 6]: returned Eugene , indolently surprised .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 9]: ` You do n't say so ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 22]: I mean to pay him , Eugene , for my part , ' said Mortimer , in a slightly injured tone .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 11]: I mean to pay him too , ' retorted Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 17]: ` But then I mean so much that I -- that I do n't mean . '
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 6]: ` Do n't mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 20]: ` So much that I only mean and shall always only mean and nothing more , my dear Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 7]: It 's the same thing . '
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 62]: His friend , lying back in his easy chair , watched him lying back in his easy chair , as he stretched out his legs on the hearth-rug , and said , with the amused look that Eugene Wrayburn could always awaken in him without seeming to try or care : ` Anyhow , your vagaries have increased the bill . '
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 8]: ` Calls the domestic virtues vagaries ! '
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 10]: exclaimed Eugene , raising his eyes to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 65]: ` This very complete little kitchen of ours , ' said Mortimer , ` in which nothing will ever be cooked -- ' ` My dear , dear Mortimer , ' returned his friend , lazily lifting his head a little to look at him , ` how often have I pointed out to you that its moral influence is the important thing ? '
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 9]: ` Its moral influence on this fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 5]: exclaimed Lightwood , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 35]: ` Do me the favour , ' said Eugene , getting out of his chair with much gravity , ` to come and inspect that feature of our establishment which you rashly disparage . '
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 38]: With that , taking up a candle , he conducted his chum into the fourth room of the set of chambers -- a little narrow room -- which was very completely and neatly fitted as a kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 4]: ` See ! '
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 42]: said Eugene , ` miniature flour-barrel , rollingpin , spice-box , shelf of brown jars , chopping-board , coffee-mill , dresser elegantly furnished with crockery , saucepans and pans , roasting jack , a charming kettle , an armoury of dish-covers .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 36]: The moral influence of these objects , in forming the domestic virtues , may have an immense influence upon me ; not upon you , for you are a hopeless case , but upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 16]: In fact , I have an idea that I feel the domestic virtues already forming .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 10]: Do me the favour to step into my bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 21]: Secretaire , you see , and abstruse set of solid mahogany pigeon-holes , one for every letter of the alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 8]: To what use do I devote them ?
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 9]: I receive a bill -- say from Jones .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 33]: I docket it neatly at the secretaire , JONES , and I put it into pigeonhole J. It 's the next thing to a receipt and is quite as satisfactory to ME .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 64]: And I very much wish , Mortimer , ' sitting on his bed , with the air of a philosopher lecturing a disciple , ` that my example might induce YOU to cultivate habits of punctuality and method ; and , by means of the moral influences with which I have surrounded you , to encourage the formation of the domestic virtues . '
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 20]: Mortimer laughed again , with his usual commentaries of ` How CAN you be so ridiculous , Eugene ! '
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 10]: and ` What an absurd fellow you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 20]: but when his laugh was out , there was something serious , if not anxious , in his face .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 24]: Despite that pernicious assumption of lassitude and indifference , which had become his second nature , he was strongly attached to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 39]: He had founded himself upon Eugene when they were yet boys at school ; and at this hour imitated him no less , admired him no less , loved him no less , than in those departed days .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 31]: ` Eugene , ' said he , ` if I could find you in earnest for a minute , I would try to say an earnest word to you . '
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 6]: ` An earnest word ? '
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 3]: repeated Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 9]: ` The moral influences are beginning to work .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 4]: Say on . '
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 20]: ` Well , I will , ' returned the other , ` though you are not earnest yet . '
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 35]: ` In this desire for earnestness , ' murmured Eugene , with the air of one who was meditating deeply , ' I trace the happy influences of the little flour-barrel and the coffee-mill .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 3]: Gratifying . '
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 43]: ` Eugene , ' resumed Mortimer , disregarding the light interruption , and laying a hand upon Eugene 's shoulder , as he , Mortimer , stood before him seated on his bed , ` you are withholding something from me . '
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 9]: Eugene looked at him , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 14]: ` All this past summer , you have been withholding something from me .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 27]: Before we entered on our boating vacation , you were as bent upon it as I have seen you upon anything since we first rowed together .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 27]: But you cared very little for it when it came , often found it a tie and a drag upon you , and were constantly away .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 62]: Now it was well enough half-a-dozen times , a dozen times , twenty times , to say to me in your own odd manner , which I know so well and like so much , that your disappearances were precautions against our boring one another ; but of course after a short while I began to know that they covered something .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 21]: I do n't ask what it is , as you have not told me ; but the fact is so .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 8]: Say , is it not ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 31]: I give you my word of honour , Mortimer , ' returned Eugene , after a serious pause of a few moments , ` that I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 8]: ` Do n't know , Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 9]: ` Upon my soul , do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 20]: I know less about myself than about most people in the world , and I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 10]: ` You have some design in your mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 4]: ` Have I ?
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 8]: I do n't think I have . '
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 21]: ` At any rate , you have some subject of interest there which used not to be there ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 21]: I really ca n't say , ' replied Eugene , shaking his head blankly , after pausing again to reconsider .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 16]: ` At times I have thought yes ; at other times I have thought no .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 29]: Now , I have been inclined to pursue such a subject ; now I have felt that it was absurd , and that it tired and embarrassed me .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 7]: Absolutely , I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 11]: Frankly and faithfully , I would if I could . '
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 41]: So replying , he clapped a hand , in his turn , on his friend 's shoulder , as he rose from his seat upon the bed , and said : ` You must take your friend as he is .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 10]: You know what I am , my dear Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 10]: You know how dreadfully susceptible I am to boredom .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 33]: You know that when I became enough of a man to find myself an embodied conundrum , I bored myself to the last degree by trying to find out what I meant .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 17]: You know that at length I gave it up , and declined to guess any more .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 15]: Then how can I possibly give you the answer that I have not discovered ?
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 23]: The old nursery form runs , `` Riddle-me-riddle-me-ree , p ` raps you ca n't tell me what this may be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 7]: My reply runs , `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 10]: Upon my life , I ca n't . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 33]: So much of what was fantastically true to his own knowledge of this utterly careless Eugene , mingled with the answer , that Mortimer could not receive it as a mere evasion .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 28]: Besides , it was given with an engaging air of openness , and of special exemption of the one friend he valued , from his reckless indifference .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 7]: ` Come , dear boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 3]: said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 9]: ` Let us try the effect of smoking .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 16]: If it enlightens me at all on this question , I will impart unreservedly . '
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 20]: They returned to the room they had come from , and , finding it heated , opened a window .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 29]: Having lighted their cigars , they leaned out of this window , smoking , and looking down at the moonlight , as it shone into the court below .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 15]: ` No enlightenment , ' resumed Eugene , after certain minutes of silence . '
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 14]: I feel sincerely apologetic , my dear Mortimer , but nothing comes . '
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 16]: ` If nothing comes , ' returned Mortimer , ` nothing can come from it .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 20]: So I shall hope that this may hold good throughout , and that there may be nothing on foot .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 63]: Nothing injurious to you , Eugene , or -- ' Eugene stayed him for a moment with his hand on his arm , while he took a piece of earth from an old flowerpot on the window-sill and dexterously shot it at a little point of light opposite ; having done which to his satisfaction , he said , ` Or ? '
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 9]: ` Or injurious to any one else . '
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 35]: ` How , ' said Eugene , taking another little piece of earth , and shooting it with great precision at the former mark , ` how injurious to any one else ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 25]: ` And , ' said Eugene , taking , as he said the word , another shot , ` to whom else ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 22]: Checking himself with another piece of earth in his hand , Eugene looked at his friend inquiringly and a little suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 11]: There was no concealed or half-expressed meaning in his face .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 35]: ` Two belated wanderers in the mazes of the law , ' said Eugene , attracted by the sound of footsteps , and glancing down as he spoke , ` stray into the court .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 14]: They examine the door-posts of number one , seeking the name they want .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 13]: Not finding it at number one , they come to number two .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 17]: On the hat of wanderer number two , the shorter one , I drop this pellet .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 20]: Hitting him on the hat , I smoke serenely , and become absorbed in contemplation of the sky . '
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 26]: Both the wanderers looked up towards the window ; but , after interchanging a mutter or two , soon applied themselves to the door-posts below .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 20]: There they seemed to discover what they wanted , for they disappeared from view by entering at the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 29]: ` When they emerge , ' said Eugene , ` you shall see me bring them both down ' ; and so prepared two pellets for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 14]: He had not reckoned on their seeking his name , or Lightwood 's .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 25]: But either the one or the other would seem to be in question , for now there came a knock at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 20]: I am on duty to-night , ' said Mortimer , ` stay you where you are , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 35]: Requiring no persuasion , he stayed there , smoking quietly , and not at all curious to know who knocked , until Mortimer spoke to him from within the room , and touched him .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 32]: Then , drawing in his head , he found the visitors to be young Charley Hexam and the schoolmaster ; both standing facing him , and both recognized at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 10]: ` You recollect this young fellow , Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 3]: said Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 13]: ` Let me look at him , ' returned Wrayburn , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 7]: ` Oh , yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 5]: I recollect him ! '
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 37]: He had not been about to repeat that former action of taking him by the chin , but the boy had suspected him of it , and had thrown up his arm with an angry start .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 14]: Laughingly , Wrayburn looked to Lightwood for an explanation of this odd visit .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 10]: ` He says he has something to say . '
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 11]: ` Surely it must be to you , Mortimer . '
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 10]: ` So I thought , but he says no .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 8]: He says it is to you . '
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 13]: ` Yes , I do say so , ' interposed the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 19]: ` And I mean to say what I want to say , too , Mr Eugene Wrayburn ! '
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 21]: Passing him with his eyes as if there were nothing where he stood , Eugene looked on to Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 22]: With consummate indolence , he turned to Mortimer , inquiring : ` And who may this other person be ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 20]: I am Charles Hexam 's friend , ' said Bradley ; ' I am Charles Hexam 's schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 17]: ` My good sir , you should teach your pupils better manners , ' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 24]: Composedly smoking , he leaned an elbow on the chimneypiece , at the side of the fire , and looked at the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 20]: It was a cruel look , in its cold disdain of him , as a creature of no worth .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 34]: The schoolmaster looked at him , and that , too , was a cruel look , though of the different kind , that it had a raging jealousy and fiery wrath in it .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 16]: Very remarkably , neither Eugene Wrayburn nor Bradley Headstone looked at all at the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 23]: Through the ensuing dialogue , those two , no matter who spoke , or whom was addressed , looked at each other .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 20]: There was some secret , sure perception between them , which set them against one another in all ways .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 36]: ` In some high respects , Mr Eugene Wrayburn , ' said Bradley , answering him with pale and quivering lips , ` the natural feelings of my pupils are stronger than my teaching . '
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 28]: ` In most respects , I dare say , ' replied Eugene , enjoying his cigar , ` though whether high or low is of no importance .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 7]: You have my name very correctly .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 6]: Pray what is yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 41]: ` It can not concern you much to know , but -- ' ` True , ' interposed Eugene , striking sharply and cutting him short at his mistake , ` it does not concern me at all to know .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 12]: I can say Schoolmaster , which is a most respectable title .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 7]: You are right , Schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 29]: It was not the dullest part of this goad in its galling of Bradley Headstone , that he had made it himself in a moment of incautious anger .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 18]: He tried to set his lips so as to prevent their quivering , but they quivered fast .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 18]: ` Mr Eugene Wrayburn , ' said the boy , ' I want a word with you .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 36]: I have wanted it so much , that we have looked out your address in the book , and we have been to your office , and we have come from your office here . '
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 23]: ` You have given yourself much trouble , Schoolmaster , ' observed Eugene , blowing the feathery ash from his cigar . '
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 8]: I hope it may prove remunerative . '
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 34]: ` And I am glad to speak , ' pursued the boy , ` in presence of Mr Lightwood , because it was through Mr Lightwood that you ever saw my sister . '
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 55]: For a mere moment , Wrayburn turned his eyes aside from the schoolmaster to note the effect of the last word on Mortimer , who , standing on the opposite side of the fire , as soon as the word was spoken , turned his face towards the fire and looked down into it .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 41]: ` Similarly , it was through Mr Lightwood that you ever saw her again , for you were with him on the night when my father was found , and so I found you with her on the next day .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 10]: Since then , you have seen my sister often .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 9]: You have seen my sister oftener and oftener .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 8]: And I want to know why ? '
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 9]: ` Was this worth while , Schoolmaster ? '
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 11]: murmured Eugene , with the air of a disinterested adviser .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 7]: ` So much trouble for nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 12]: You should know best , but I think not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 29]: I do n't know , Mr Wrayburn , ' answered Bradley , with his passion rising , ` why you address me -- ' ` Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 3]: said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 7]: ` Then I wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 35]: He said it so tauntingly in his perfect placidity , that the respectable right-hand clutching the respectable hair-guard of the respectable watch could have wound it round his throat and strangled him with it .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 42]: Not another word did Eugene deem it worth while to utter , but stood leaning his head upon his hand , smoking , and looking imperturbably at the chafing Bradley Headstone with his clutching right-hand , until Bradley was wellnigh mad .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 27]: ` Mr Wrayburn , ' proceeded the boy , ` we not only know this that I have charged upon you , but we know more .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 21]: It has not yet come to my sister 's knowledge that we have found it out , but we have .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 55]: We had a plan , Mr Headstone and I , for my sister 's education , and for its being advised and overlooked by Mr Headstone , who is a much more competent authority , whatever you may pretend to think , as you smoke , than you could produce , if you tried .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 7]: Then , what do we find ?
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 8]: What do we find , Mr Lightwood ?
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 17]: Why , we find that my sister is already being taught , without our knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 55]: We find that while my sister gives an unwilling and cold ear to our schemes for her advantage -- I , her brother , and Mr Headstone , the most competent authority , as his certificates would easily prove , that could be produced -- she is wilfully and willingly profiting by other schemes .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 16]: Ay , and taking pains , too , for I know what such pains are .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 6]: And so does Mr Headstone !
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 17]: Somebody pays for this , is a thought that naturally occurs to us ; who pays ?
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 26]: We apply ourselves to find out , Mr Lightwood , and we find that your friend , this Mr Eugene Wrayburn , here , pays .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 79]: Then I ask him what right has he to do it , and what does he mean by it , and how comes he to be taking such a liberty without my consent , when I am raising myself in the scale of society by my own exertions and Mr Headstone 's aid , and have no right to have any darkness cast upon my prospects , or any imputation upon my respectability , through my sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 20]: The boyish weakness of this speech , combined with its great selfishness , made it a poor one indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 31]: And yet Bradley Headstone , used to the little audience of a school , and unused to the larger ways of men , showed a kind of exultation in it .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 56]: ` Now I tell Mr Eugene Wrayburn , ' pursued the boy , forced into the use of the third person by the hopelessness of addressing him in the first , ` that I object to his having any acquaintance at all with my sister , and that I request him to drop it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 42]: He is not to take it into his head that I am afraid of my sister 's caring for HIM -- ' -LRB- As the boy sneered , the Master sneered , and Eugene blew off the feathery ash again . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 13]: -- ` But I object to it , and that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 12]: I am more important to to my sister than he thinks .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 26]: As I raise myself , I intend to raise her ; she knows that , and she has to look to me for her prospects .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 14]: Now I understand all this very well , and so does Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 38]: My sister is an excellent girl , but she has some romantic notions ; not about such things as your Mr Eugene Wrayburns , but about the death of my father and other matters of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 30]: Mr Wrayburn encourages those notions to make himself of importance , and so she thinks she ought to be grateful to him , and perhaps even likes to be .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 25]: Now I do n't choose her to be grateful to him , or to be grateful to anybody but me , except Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 24]: And I tell Mr Wrayburn that if he do n't take heed of what I say , it will be worse for her .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 15]: Let him turn that over in his memory , and make sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 5]: Worse for her ! '
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 12]: A pause ensued , in which the schoolmaster looked very awkward .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 34]: ` May I suggest , Schoolmaster , ' said Eugene , removing his fastwaning cigar from his lips to glance at it , ` that you can now take your pupil away . '
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 65]: ` And Mr Lightwood , ' added the boy , with a burning face , under the flaming aggravation of getting no sort of answer or attention , ' I hope you 'll take notice of what I have said to your friend , and of what your friend has heard me say , word by word , whatever he pretends to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 42]: You are bound to take notice of it , Mr Lightwood , for , as I have already mentioned , you first brought your friend into my sister 's company , and but for you we never should have seen him .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 20]: Lord knows none of us ever wanted him , any more than any of us will ever miss him .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 51]: Now Mr Headstone , as Mr Eugene Wrayburn has been obliged to hear what I had to say , and could n't help himself , and as I have said it out to the last word , we have done all we wanted to do , and may go . '
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 16]: ` Go down-stairs , and leave me a moment , Hexam , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 36]: The boy complying with an indignant look and as much noise as he could make , swung out of the room ; and Lightwood went to the window , and leaned there , looking out .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 40]: ` You think me of no more value than the dirt under your feet , ' said Bradley to Eugene , speaking in a carefully weighed and measured tone , or he could not have spoken at all . '
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 19]: I assure you , Schoolmaster , ' replied Eugene , ' I do n't think about you . '
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 17]: ` That 's not true , ' returned the other ; ` you know better . '
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 18]: ` That 's coarse , ' Eugene retorted ; ` but you DO N'T know better . '
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 27]: ` Mr Wrayburn , at least I know very well that it would be idle to set myself against you in insolent words or overbearing manners .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 34]: That lad who has just gone out could put you to shame in half - adozen branches of knowledge in half an hour , but you can throw him aside like an inferior .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 16]: You can do as much by me , I have no doubt , beforehand . '
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 7]: ` Possibly , ' remarked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 28]: ` But I am more than a lad , ' said Bradley , with his clutching hand , ` and I WILL be heard , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 16]: ` As a schoolmaster , ' said Eugene , ` you are always being heard .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 7]: That ought to content you . '
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 17]: ` But it does not content me , ' replied the other , white with passion .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 37]: ` Do you suppose that a man , in forming himself for the duties I discharge , and in watching and repressing himself daily to discharge them well , dismisses a man 's nature ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 31]: I suppose you , ' said Eugene , ` judging from what I see as I look at you , to be rather too passionate for a good schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 13]: As he spoke , he tossed away the end of his cigar .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 12]: ` Passionate with you , sir , I admit I am .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 12]: Passionate with you , sir , I respect myself for being .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 10]: But I have not Devils for my pupils . '
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 14]: ` For your Teachers , I should rather say , ' replied Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 5]: ` Mr Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 4]: ` Schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 10]: ` Sir , my name is Bradley Headstone . '
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 17]: ` As you justly said , my good sir , your name can not concern me .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 6]: Now , what more ? '
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 4]: ` This more .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 71]: Oh , what a misfortune is mine , ' cried Bradley , breaking off to wipe the starting perspiration from his face as he shook from head to foot , ` that I can not so control myself as to appear a stronger creature than this , when a man who has not felt in all his life what I have felt in a day can so command himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 27]: He said it in a very agony , and even followed it with an errant motion of his hands as if he could have torn himself .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 20]: Eugene Wrayburn looked on at him , as if he found him beginning to be rather an entertaining study .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 17]: ` Mr Wrayburn , I desire to say something to you on my own part . '
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 33]: ` Come , come , Schoolmaster , ' returned Eugene , with a languid approach to impatience as the other again struggled with himself ; ` say what you have to say .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 24]: And let me remind you that the door is standing open , and your young friend waiting for you on the stairs . '
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 51]: ` When I accompanied that youth here , sir , I did so with the purpose of adding , as a man whom you should not be permitted to put aside , in case you put him aside as a boy , that his instinct is correct and right . '
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 10]: Thus Bradley Headstone , with great effort and difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 3]: asked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 15]: ` No , sir , ' said the other , flushed and fierce . '
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 38]: I strongly support him in his disapproval of your visits to his sister , and in his objection to your officiousness -- and worse -- in what you have taken upon yourself to do for her . '
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 6]: ` Is THAT all ? '
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 3]: asked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 24]: I determined to tell you that you are not justified in these proceedings , and that they are injurious to his sister . '
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 12]: ` Are you her schoolmaster as well as her brother 's ?
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 10]: -- Or perhaps you would like to be ? '
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 3]: said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 30]: It was a stab that the blood followed , in its rush to Bradley Headstone 's face , as swiftly as if it had been dealt with a dagger .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 9]: ` What do you mean by that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 9]: was as much as he could utter . '
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 11]: A natural ambition enough , ' said Eugene , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 9]: Far be it from me to say otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 47]: The sister who is something too much upon your lips , perhaps -- is so very different from all the associations to which she had been used , and from all the low obscure people about her , that it is a very natural ambition . '
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 14]: ` Do you throw my obscurity in my teeth , Mr Wrayburn ? '
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 22]: ` That can hardly be , for I know nothing concerning it , Schoolmaster , and seek to know nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 21]: ` You reproach me with my origin , ' said Bradley Headstone ; ` you cast insinuations at my bringing-up .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 44]: But I tell you , sir , I have worked my way onward , out of both and in spite of both , and have a right to be considered a better man than you , with better reasons for being proud . '
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 43]: ` How I can reproach you with what is not within my knowledge , or how I can cast stones that were never in my hand , is a problem for the ingenuity of a schoolmaster to prove , ' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 6]: ` Is THAT all ? '
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 22]: If you suppose that boy -- ' ` Who really will be tired of waiting , ' said Eugene , politely .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 17]: ` If you suppose that boy to be friendless , Mr Wrayburn , you deceive yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 13]: I am his friend , and you shall find me so . '
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 14]: ` And you will find HIM on the stairs , ' remarked Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 35]: ` You may have promised yourself , sir , that you could do what you chose here , because you had to deal with a mere boy , inexperienced , friendless , and unassisted .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 12]: But I give you warning that this mean calculation is wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 9]: You have to do with a man also .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 7]: You have to do with me .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 16]: I will support him , and , if need be , require reparation for him .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 16]: My hand and heart are in this cause , and are open to him . '
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 17]: ` And -- quite a coincidence -- the door is open , ' remarked Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 16]: I scorn your shifty evasions , and I scorn you , ' said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 17]: ` In the meanness of your nature you revile me with the meanness of my birth .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 8]: I hold you in contempt for it .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 42]: But if you do n't profit by this visit , and act accordingly , you will find me as bitterly in earnest against you as I could be if I deemed you worth a second thought on my own account . '
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 43]: With a consciously bad grace and stiff manner , as Wrayburn looked so easily and calmly on , he went out with these words , and the heavy door closed like a furnace-door upon his red and white heats of rage . '
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 8]: A curious monomaniac , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 15]: ` The man seems to believe that everybody was acquainted with his mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 30]: Mortimer Lightwood being still at the window , to which he had in delicacy withdrawn , Eugene called to him , and he fell to slowly pacing the room .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 25]: ` My dear fellow , ' said Eugene , as he lighted another cigar , ' I fear my unexpected visitors have been troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 32]: If as a set-off -LRB- excuse the legal phrase from a barrister-at-law -RRB- you would like to ask Tippins to tea , I pledge myself to make love to her . '
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 23]: ` Eugene , Eugene , Eugene , ' replied Mortimer , still pacing the room , ' I am sorry for this .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 11]: And to think that I have been so blind ! '
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 8]: ` How blind , dear boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 5]: inquired his unmoved friend .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 13]: ` What were your words that night at the river-side public-house ? '
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 5]: said Lightwood , stopping .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 9]: ` What was it that you asked me ?
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 20]: Did I feel like a dark combination of traitor and pickpocket when I thought of that girl ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 11]: I seem to remember the expression , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 14]: ` How do YOU feel when you think of her just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 25]: His friend made no direct reply , but observed , after a few whiffs of his cigar , ` Do n't mistake the situation .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 13]: There is no better girl in all this London than Lizzie Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 17]: There is no better among my people at home ; no better among your people . '
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 3]: ` Granted .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 4]: What follows ? '
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 39]: ` There , ' said Eugene , looking after him dubiously as he paced away to the other end of the room , ` you put me again upon guessing the riddle that I have given up . '
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 14]: ` Eugene , do you design to capture and desert this girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 8]: ` My dear fellow , no . '
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 9]: ` Do you design to marry her ? '
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 8]: ` My dear fellow , no . '
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 9]: ` Do you design to pursue her ? '
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 11]: ` My dear fellow , I do n't design anything .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 6]: I have no design whatever .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 6]: I am incapable of designs .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 18]: If I conceived a design , I should speedily abandon it , exhausted by the operation . '
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 7]: ` Oh Eugene , Eugene ! '
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 15]: ` My dear Mortimer , not that tone of melancholy reproach , I entreat .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 23]: What can I do more than tell you all I know , and acknowledge my ignorance of all I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 29]: How does that little old song go , which , under pretence of being cheerful , is by far the most lugubrious I ever heard in my life ?
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 23]: `` Away with melancholy , Nor doleful changes ring On life and human folly , But merrily merrily sing Fal la ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 32]: Do n't let us sing Fal la , my dear Mortimer -LRB- which is comparatively unmeaning -RRB- , but let us sing that we give up guessing the riddle altogether . '
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 21]: ` Are you in communication with this girl , Eugene , and is what these people say true ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 12]: I concede both admissions to my honourable and learned friend . '
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 9]: ` Then what is to come of it ?
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 5]: What are you doing ?
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 6]: Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 18]: ` My dear Mortimer , one would think the schoolmaster had left behind him a catechizing infection .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 10]: You are ruffled by the want of another cigar .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 8]: Take one of these , I entreat .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 11]: Light it at mine , which is in perfect order .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 2]: So !
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 54]: Now do me the justice to observe that I am doing all I can towards self-improvement , and that you have a light thrown on those household implements which , when you only saw them as in a glass darkly , you were hastily -- I must say hastily -- inclined to depreciate .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 23]: Sensible of my deficiencies , I have surrounded myself with moral influences expressly meant to promote the formation of the domestic virtues .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 23]: To those influences , and to the improving society of my friend from boyhood , commend me with your best wishes . '
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 6]: ` Ah , Eugene ! '
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 32]: said Lightwood , affectionately , now standing near him , so that they both stood in one little cloud of smoke ; ' I would that you answered my three questions !
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 7]: What is to come of it ?
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 5]: What are you doing ?
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 6]: Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 43]: ` And my dear Mortimer , ' returned Eugene , lightly fanning away the smoke with his hand for the better exposition of his frankness of face and manner , ` believe me , I would answer them instantly if I could .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 20]: But to enable me to do so , I must first have found out the troublesome conundrum long abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 4]: Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 4]: Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 6]: Tapping his forehead and breast .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 16]: ` Riddle-me , riddleme-ree , perhaps you ca n't tell me what this may be ?
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 10]: -- No , upon my life I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 6]: I give it up ! '
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 70]: Chapter 7 IN WHICH A FRIENDLY MOVE IS ORIGINATED The arrangement between Mr Boffin and his literary man , Mr Silas Wegg , so far altered with the altered habits of Mr Boffin 's life , as that the Roman Empire usually declined in the morning and in the eminently aristocratic family mansion , rather than in the evening , as of yore , and in Boffin 's Bower .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 70]: There were occasions , however , when Mr Boffin , seeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion , would present himself at the Bower after dark , to anticipate the next sallying forth of Wegg , and would there , on the old settle , pursue the downward fortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were by this time on their last legs .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 41]: If Wegg had been worse paid for his office , or better qualified to discharge it , he would have considered these visits complimentary and agreeable ; but , holding the position of a handsomely-remunerated humbug , he resented them .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 22]: This was quite according to rule , for the incompetent servant , by whomsoever employed , is always against his employer .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 43]: Even those born governors , noble and right honourable creatures , who have been the most imbecile in high places , have uniformly shown themselves the most opposed -LRB- sometimes in belying distrust , sometimes in vapid insolence -RRB- to THEIR employer .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 27]: What is in such wise true of the public master and servant , is equally true of the private master and servant all the world over .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 112]: When Mr Silas Wegg did at last obtain free access to ` Our House ' , as he had been wont to call the mansion outside which he had sat shelterless so long , and when he did at last find it in all particulars as different from his mental plans of it as according to the nature of things it well could be , that far-seeing and far-reaching character , by way of asserting himself and making out a case for compensation , affected to fall into a melancholy strain of musing over the mournful past ; as if the house and he had had a fall in life together .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 27]: ` And this , sir , ' Silas would say to his patron , sadly nodding his head and musing , ` was once Our House !
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 46]: This , sir , is the building from which I have so often seen those great creatures , Miss Elizabeth , Master George , Aunt Jane , and Uncle Parker ' -- whose very names were of his own inventing -- ` pass and repass !
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 9]: And has it come to this , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 8]: Ah dear me , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 34]: So tender were his lamentations , that the kindly Mr Boffin was quite sorry for him , and almost felt mistrustful that in buying the house he had done him an irreparable injury .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 46]: Two or three diplomatic interviews , the result of great subtlety on Mr Wegg 's part , but assuming the mask of careless yielding to a fortuitous combination of circumstances impelling him towards Clerkenwell , had enabled him to complete his bargain with Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 47]: ` Bring me round to the Bower , ' said Silas , when the bargain was closed , ` next Saturday evening , and if a sociable glass of old Jamaikey warm should meet your views , I am not the man to begrudge it . '
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 24]: ` You are aware of my being poor company , sir , ' replied Mr Venus , ` but be it so . '
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 23]: It being so , here is Saturday evening come , and here is Mr Venus come , and ringing at the Bower-gate .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 30]: Mr Wegg opens the gate , descries a sort of brown paper truncheon under Mr Venus 's arm , and remarks , in a dry tone : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 12]: I thought perhaps you might have come in a cab . '
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 11]: ` No , Mr Wegg , ' replies Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 8]: I am not above a parcel . '
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 5]: ` Above a parcel !
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 7]: says Wegg , with some dissatisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 18]: But does not openly growl , ' a certain sort of parcel might be above you . '
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 36]: ` Here is your purchase , Mr Wegg , ' says Venus , politely handing it over , ` and I am glad to restore it to the source from whence it -- flowed . '
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 7]: ` Thankee , ' says Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 40]: ` Now this affair is concluded , I may mention to you in a friendly way that I 've my doubts whether , if I had consulted a lawyer , you could have kept this article back from me .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 11]: I only throw it out as a legal point . '
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 9]: ` Do you think so , Mr Wegg ?
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 8]: I bought you in open contract . '
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 30]: ` You ca n't buy human flesh and blood in this country , sir ; not alive , you ca n't , ' says Wegg , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 7]: ` Then query , bone ? '
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 7]: ` As a legal point ? '
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 3]: asks Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 8]: ` As a legal point . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 59]: I am not competent to speak upon that , Mr Wegg , ' says Venus , reddening and growing something louder ; ` but upon a point of fact I think myself competent to speak ; and as a point of fact I would have seen you -- will you allow me to say , further ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 20]: I would n't say more than further , if I was you , ' Mr Wegg suggests , pacifically .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 20]: -- ` Before I 'd have given that packet into your hand without being paid my price for it .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 26]: I do n't pretend to know how the point of law may stand , but I 'm thoroughly confident upon the point of fact . '
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 58]: As Mr Venus is irritable -LRB- no doubt owing to his disappointment in love -RRB- , and as it is not the cue of Mr Wegg to have him out of temper , the latter gentleman soothingly remarks , ' I only put it as a little case ; I only put it ha ` porthetically . '
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 41]: ` Then I 'd rather , Mr Wegg , you put it another time , penn ' orthetically , ' is Mr Venus 's retort , ` for I tell you candidly I do n't like your little cases . '
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 53]: Arrived by this time in Mr Wegg 's sitting-room , made bright on the chilly evening by gaslight and fire , Mr Venus softens and compliments him on his abode ; profiting by the occasion to remind Wegg that he -LRB- Venus -RRB- told him he had got into a good thing .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 7]: ` Tolerable , ' Wegg rejoins .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 18]: ` But bear in mind , Mr Venus , that there 's no gold without its alloy .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 11]: Mix for yourself and take a seat in the chimbley-corner .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 11]: Will you perform upon a pipe , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 29]: I am but an indifferent performer , sir , ' returns the other ; ` but I 'll accompany you with a whiff or two at intervals . '
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 23]: So , Mr Venus mixes , and Wegg mixes ; and Mr Venus lights and puffs , and Wegg lights and puffs .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 20]: ` And there 's alloy even in this metal of yours , Mr Wegg , you was remarking ? '
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 8]: ` Mystery , ' returns Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 9]: I do n't like it , Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 30]: I do n't like to have the life knocked out of former inhabitants of this house , in the gloomy dark , and not know who did it . '
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 11]: ` Might you have any suspicions , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 9]: ` No , ' returns that gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 7]: I know who profits by it .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 7]: But I 've no suspicions . '
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 50]: Having said which , Mr Wegg smokes and looks at the fire with a most determined expression of Charity ; as if he had caught that cardinal virtue by the skirts as she felt it her painful duty to depart from him , and held her by main force .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 30]: ` Similarly , ' resumes Wegg , ' I have observations as I can offer upon certain points and parties ; but I make no objections , Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 17]: Here is an immense fortune drops from the clouds upon a person that shall be nameless .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 20]: Here is a weekly allowance , with a certain weight of coals , drops from the clouds upon me .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 8]: Which of us is the better man ?
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 8]: Not the person that shall be nameless .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 16]: That 's an observation of mine , but I do n't make it an objection .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 11]: I take my allowance and my certain weight of coals .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 5]: He takes his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 8]: That 's the way it works . '
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 26]: ` It would be a good thing for me , if I could see things in the calm light you do , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 49]: ` Again look here , ' pursues Silas , with an oratorical flourish of his pipe and his wooden leg : the latter having an undignified tendency to tilt him back in his chair ; ` here 's another observation , Mr Venus , unaccompanied with an objection .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 12]: Him that shall be nameless is liable to be talked over .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 5]: He gets talked over .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 44]: Him that shall be nameless , having me at his right hand , naturally looking to be promoted higher , and you may perhaps say meriting to be promoted higher -- ' -LRB- Mr Venus murmurs that he does say so . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 23]: -- Him that shall be nameless , under such circumstances passes me by , and puts a talking-over stranger above my head .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 9]: Which of us two is the better man ?
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 9]: Which of us two can repeat most poetry ?
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 45]: Which of us two has , in the service of him that shall be nameless , tackled the Romans , both civil and military , till he has got as husky as if he 'd been weaned and ever since brought up on sawdust ?
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 5]: Not the talking-over stranger .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 35]: Yet the house is as free to him as if it was his , and he has his room , and is put upon a footing , and draws about a thousand a year .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 20]: I am banished to the Bower , to be found in it like a piece of furniture whenever wanted .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 8]: Merit , therefore , do n't win .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 7]: That 's the way it works .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 28]: I observe it , because I ca n't help observing it , being accustomed to take a powerful sight of notice ; but I do n't object .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 8]: Ever here before , Mr Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 10]: ` Not inside the gate , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 15]: ` You 've been as far as the gate then , Mr Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 13]: ` Yes , Mr Wegg , and peeped in from curiosity . '
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 7]: ` Did you see anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 7]: ` Nothing but the dust-yard . '
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 42]: Mr Wegg rolls his eyes all round the room , in that ever unsatisfied quest of his , and then rolls his eyes all round Mr Venus ; as if suspicious of his having something about him to be found out .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 38]: ` And yet , sir , ' he pursues , ` being acquainted with old Mr Harmon , one would have thought it might have been polite in you , too , to give him a call .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 13]: And you 're naturally of a polite disposition , you are . '
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 11]: This last clause as a softening compliment to Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 40]: ` It is true , sir , ' replies Venus , winking his weak eyes , and running his fingers through his dusty shock of hair , ` that I was so , before a certain observation soured me .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 10]: You understand to what I allude , Mr Wegg ?
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 16]: To a certain written statement respecting not wishing to be regarded in a certain light .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 11]: Since that , all is fled , save gall . '
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 16]: ` Not all , ' says Mr Wegg , in a tone of sentimental condolence .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 12]: ` Yes , sir , ' returns Venus , ` all !
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 21]: The world may deem it harsh , but I 'd quite as soon pitch into my best friend as not .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 7]: Indeed , I 'd sooner ! '
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 54]: Involuntarily making a pass with his wooden leg to guard himself as Mr Venus springs up in the emphasis of this unsociable declaration , Mr Wegg tilts over on his back , chair and all , and is rescued by that harmless misanthrope , in a disjointed state and ruefully rubbing his head .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 20]: ` Why , you lost your balance , Mr Wegg , ' says Venus , handing him his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 34]: ` And about time to do it , ' grumbles Silas , ` when a man 's visitors , without a word of notice , conduct themselves with the sudden wiciousness of Jacks-in-boxes !
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 16]: Do n't come flying out of your chair like that , Mr Venus ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 8]: I ask your pardon , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 6]: I am so soured . '
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 21]: ` Yes , but hang it , ' says Wegg argumentatively , ' a well-governed mind can be soured sitting !
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 17]: And as to being regarded in lights , there 's bumpey lights as well as bony .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 17]: IN which , ' again rubbing his head , ' I object to regard myself . '
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 11]: ` I 'll bear it in memory , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 9]: ` If you 'll be so good . '
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 17]: Mr Wegg slowly subdues his ironical tone and his lingering irritation , and resumes his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 15]: ` We were talking of old Mr Harmon being a friend of yours . '
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 8]: ` Not a friend , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 17]: Only known to speak to , and to have a little deal with now and then .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 16]: A very inquisitive character , Mr Wegg , regarding what was found in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 6]: As inquisitive as secret . '
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 6]: You found him secret ? '
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 8]: returns Wegg , with a greedy relish .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 16]: ` He had always the look of it , and the manner of it . '
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 7]: with another roll of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 11]: ` As to what was found in the dust now .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 15]: Did you ever hear him mention how he found it , my dear friend ?
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 12]: Living on the mysterious premises , one would like to know .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 8]: For instance , where he found things ?
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 11]: Or , for instance , how he set about it ?
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 18]: Whether he began at the top ot the mounds , or whether he began at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 21]: Whether he prodded ' ; Mr Wegg 's pantomime is skilful and expressive here ; ` or whether he scooped ?
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 22]: Should you say scooped , my dear Mr Venus ; or should you as a man -- say prodded ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 9]: I should say neither , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 15]: ` As a fellow-man , Mr Venus -- mix again -- why neither ? '
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 20]: ` Because I suppose , sir , that what was found , was found in the sorting and sifting .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 9]: All the mounds are sorted and sifted ? '
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 10]: ` You shall see 'em and pass your opinion .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 4]: Mix again . '
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 52]: On each occasion of his saying ` mix again ' , Mr Wegg , with a hop on his wooden leg , hitches his chair a little nearer ; more as if he were proposing that himself and Mr Venus should mix again , than that they should replenish their glasses .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 32]: ` Living -LRB- as I said before -RRB- on the mysterious premises , ' says Wegg when the other has acted on his hospitable entreaty , ` one likes to know .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 28]: Would you be inclined to say now -- as a brother -- that he ever hid things in the dust , as well as found 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 14]: ` Mr Wegg , on the whole I should say he might . '
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 17]: Mr Wegg claps on his spectacles , and admiringly surveys Mr Venus from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 110]: ` As a mortal equally with myself , whose hand I take in mine for the first time this day , having unaccountably overlooked that act so full of boundless confidence binding a fellow-creetur TO a fellow creetur , ' says Wegg , holding Mr Venus 's palm out , flat and ready for smiting , and now smiting it ; ` as such -- and no other -- for I scorn all lowlier ties betwixt myself and the man walking with his face erect that alone I call my Twin -- regarded and regarding in this trustful bond -- what do you think he might have hid ? '
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 11]: ` It is but a supposition , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 52]: ` As a Being with his hand upon his heart , ' cries Wegg ; and the apostrophe is not the less impressive for the Being 's hand being actually upon his rum and water ; ` put your supposition into language , and bring it out , Mr Venus ! '
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 47]: ` He was the species of old gentleman , sir , ' slowly returns that practical anatomist , after drinking , ` that I should judge likely to take such opportunities as this place offered , of stowing away money , valuables , maybe papers . '
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 113]: ` As one that was ever an ornament to human life , ' says Mr Wegg , again holding out Mr Venus 's palm as if he were going to tell his fortune by chiromancy , and holding his own up ready for smiting it when the time should come ; ` as one that the poet might have had his eye on , in writing the national naval words : Helm a-weather , now lay her close , Yard arm and yard arm she lies ; Again , cried I , Mr Venus , give her t ` other dose , Man shrouds and grapple , sir , or she flies !
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 31]: -- that is to say , regarded in the light of true British Oak , for such you are explain , Mr Venus , the expression `` papers '' ! '
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 39]: ` Seeing that the old gentleman was generally cutting off some near relation , or blocking out some natural affection , ' Mr Venus rejoins , ` he most likely made a good many wills and codicils . '
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 29]: The palm of Silas Wegg descends with a sounding smack upon the palm of Venus , and Wegg lavishly exclaims , ` Twin in opinion equally with feeling !
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 6]: Mix a little more ! '
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 67]: Having now hitched his wooden leg and his chair close in front of Mr Venus , Mr Wegg rapidly mixes for both , gives his visitor his glass , touches its rim with the rim of his own , puts his own to his lips , puts it down , and spreading his hands on his visitor 's knees thus addresses him : ` Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 26]: It ai n't that I object to being passed over for a stranger , though I regard the stranger as a more than doubtful customer .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 16]: It ai n't for the sake of making money , though money is ever welcome .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 22]: It ai n't for myself , though I am not so haughty as to be above doing myself a good turn .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 10]: It 's for the cause of the right . '
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 22]: Mr Venus , passively winking his weak eyes both at once , demands : ` What is , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 12]: ` The friendly move , sir , that I now propose .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 8]: You see the move , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 21]: 'Till you have pointed it out , Mr Wegg , I ca n't say whether I do or not . '
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 18]: ` If there IS anything to be found on these premises , let us find it together .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 14]: Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to look for it together .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 18]: Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to share the profits of it equally betwixt us .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 8]: In the cause of the right . '
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 7]: Thus Silas assuming a noble air .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 57]: ` Then , ' says Mr Venus , looking up , after meditating with his hair held in his hands , as if he could only fix his attention by fixing his head ; ` if anything was to be unburied from under the dust , it would be kept a secret by you and me ?
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 9]: Would that be it , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 12]: ` That would depend upon what it was , Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 23]: Say it was money , or plate , or jewellery , it would be as much ours as anybody else 's . '
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 8]: Mr Venus rubs an eyebrow , interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 10]: ` In the cause of the right it would .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 28]: Because it would be unknowingly sold with the mounds else , and the buyer would get what he was never meant to have , and never bought .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 17]: And what would that be , Mr Venus , but the cause of the wrong ? '
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 11]: ` Say it was papers , ' Mr Venus propounds .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 25]: ` According to what they contained we should offer to dispose of 'em to the parties most interested , ' replies Wegg , promptly .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 12]: ` In the cause of the right , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 7]: ` Always so , Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 21]: If the parties should use them in the cause of the wrong , that would be their act and deed .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 3]: Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 19]: I have an opinion of you , sir , to which it is not easy to give mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 36]: Since I called upon you that evening when you were , as I may say , floating your powerful mind in tea , I have felt that you required to be roused with an object .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 18]: In this friendly move , sir , you will have a glorious object to rouse you . '
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 29]: Mr Wegg then goes on to enlarge upon what throughout has been uppermost in his crafty mind : -- the qualifications of Mr Venus for such a search .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 46]: He expatiates on Mr Venus 's patient habits and delicate manipulation ; on his skill in piecing little things together ; on his knowledge of various tissues and textures ; on the likelihood of small indications leading him on to the discovery of great concealments .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 18]: ` While as to myself , ' says Wegg , ' I am not good at it .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 38]: Whether I gave myself up to prodding , or whether I gave myself up to scooping , I could n't do it with that delicate touch so as not to show that I was disturbing the mounds .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 32]: Quite different with YOU , going to work -LRB- as YOU would -RRB- in the light of a fellowman , holily pledged in a friendly move to his brother man . '
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 65]: Mr Wegg next modestly remarks on the want of adaptation in a wooden leg to ladders and such like airy perches , and also hints at an inherent tendency in that timber fiction , when called into action for the purposes of a promenade on an ashey slope , to stick itself into the yielding foothold , and peg its owner to one spot .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 63]: Then , leaving this part of the subject , he remarks on the special phenomenon that before his installation in the Bower , it was from Mr Venus that he first heard of the legend of hidden wealth in the Mounds : ` which ' , he observes with a vaguely pious air , ` was surely never meant for nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 56]: Lastly , he returns to the cause of the right , gloomily foreshadowing the possibility of something being unearthed to criminate Mr Boffin -LRB- of whom he once more candidly admits it can not be denied that he profits by a murder -RRB- , and anticipating his denunciation by the friendly movers to avenging justice .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 32]: And this , Mr Wegg expressly points out , not at all for the sake of the reward -- though it would be a want of principle not to take it .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 26]: To all this , Mr Venus , with his shock of dusty hair cocked after the manner of a terrier 's ears , attends profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 47]: When Mr Wegg , having finished , opens his arms wide , as if to show Mr Venus how bare his breast is , and then folds them pending a reply , Mr Venus winks at him with both eyes some little time before speaking . '
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 20]: I see you have tried it by yourself , Mr Wegg , ' he says when he does speak .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 11]: ` You have found out the difficulties by experience . '
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 26]: ` No , it can hardly be said that I have tried it , ' replies Wegg , a little dashed by the hint . '
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 6]: I have just skimmed it .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 4]: Skimmed it . '
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 9]: ` And found nothing besides the difficulties ? '
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 6]: Wegg shakes his head . '
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 22]: I scarcely know what to say to this , Mr Wegg , ' observes Venus , after ruminating for a while .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 9]: ` Say yes , ' Wegg naturally urges .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 13]: ` If I was n't soured , my answer would be no .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 22]: But being soured , Mr Wegg , and driven to reckless madness and desperation , I suppose it 's Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 45]: Wegg joyfully reproduces the two glasses , repeats the ceremony of clinking their rims , and inwardly drinks with great heartiness to the health and success in life of the young lady who has reduced Mr Venus to his present convenient state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 14]: The articles of the friendly move are then severally recited and agreed upon .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 10]: They are but secrecy , fidelity , and perseverance .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 29]: The Bower to be always free of access to Mr Venus for his researches , and every precaution to be taken against their attracting observation in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 7]: ` There 's a footstep ! '
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 3]: exclaims Venus .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 5]: cries Wegg , starting .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 3]: ` Outside .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 3]: St ! '
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 19]: They are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move , by shaking hands upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 20]: They softly break off , light their pipes which have gone out , and lean back in their chairs .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 6]: No doubt , a footstep .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 13]: It approaches the window , and a hand taps at the glass .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 10]: calls Wegg ; meaning come round by the door .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 23]: But the heavy old-fashioned sash is slowly raised , and a head slowly looks in out of the dark background of night .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 8]: ` Pray is Mr Silas Wegg here ?
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 5]: I see him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 23]: The friendly movers might not have been quite at their ease , even though the visitor had entered in the usual manner .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 23]: But , leaning on the breast-high window , and staring in out of the darkness , they find the visitor extremely embarrassing .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 34]: Expecially Mr Venus : who removes his pipe , draws back his head , and stares at the starer , as if it were his own Hindoo baby come to fetch him home .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 7]: ` Good evening , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 18]: The yard gate-lock should be looked to , if you please ; it do n't catch . '
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 7]: ` Is it Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 3]: falters Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 6]: ` It is Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 7]: Do n't let me disturb you .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 6]: I am not coming in .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 21]: I have only a message for you , which I undertook to deliver on my way home to my lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 25]: I was in two minds about coming beyond the gate without ringing : not knowing but you might have a dog about . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 20]: I wish I had , ' mutters Wegg , with his back turned as he rose from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 2]: St !
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 8]: The talking-over stranger , Mr Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 9]: ` Is that any one I know ? '
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 5]: inquires the staring Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 6]: ` No , Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 4]: Friend of mine .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 7]: Passing the evening with me . '
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 5]: I beg his pardon .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 26]: Mr Boffin wishes you to know that he does not expect you to stay at home any evening , on the chance of his coming .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 20]: It has occurred to him that he may , without intending it , have been a tie upon you .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 33]: In future , if he should come without notice , he will take his chance of finding you , and it will be all the same to him if he does not .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 9]: I undertook to tell you on my way .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 18]: With that , and ` Good night , ' the Secretary lowers the window , and disappears .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 21]: They listen , and hear his footsteps go back to the gate , and hear the gate close after him .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 26]: ` And for that individual , Mr Venus , ' remarks Wegg , when he is fully gone , ' I have been passed over !
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 11]: Let me ask you what you think of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 40]: Apparently , Mr Venus does not know what to think of him , for he makes sundry efforts to reply , without delivering himself of any other articulate utterance than that he has ' a singular look ' . '
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 19]: A double look , you mean , sir , ' rejoins Wegg , playing bitterly upon the word .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 6]: ` That 's HIS look .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 14]: Any amount of singular look for me , but not a double look !
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 9]: That 's an under-handed mind , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 11]: ` Do you say there 's something against him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 3]: Venus asks .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 6]: ` Something against him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 3]: repeats Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 3]: ` Something ?
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 34]: What would the relief be to my feelings -- as a fellow-man -- if I was n't the slave of truth , and did n't feel myself compelled to answer , Everything ! '
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 13]: See into what wonderful maudlin refuges , featherless ostriches plunge their heads !
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 23]: It is such unspeakable moral compensation to Wegg , to be overcome by the consideration that Mr Rokesmith has an underhanded mind !
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 68]: ` On this starlight night , Mr Venus , ' he remarks , when he is showing that friendly mover out across the yard , and both are something the worse for mixing again and again : ` on this starlight night to think that talking-over strangers , and underhanded minds , can go walking home under the sky , as if they was all square ! '
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 49]: ` The spectacle of those orbs , ' says Mr Venus , gazing upward with his hat tumbling off ; ` brings heavy on me her crushing words that she did not wish to regard herself nor yet to be regarded in that -- ' ' I know !
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 14]: You need n't repeat 'em , ' says Wegg , pressing his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 21]: ` But think how those stars steady me in the cause of the right against some that shall be nameless .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 8]: It is n't that I bear malice .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 9]: But see how they glisten with old remembrances !
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 8]: Old remembrances of what , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 37]: Mr Venus begins drearily replying , ` Of her words , in her own handwriting , that she does not wish to regard herself , nor yet -- ' when Silas cuts him short with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 5]: ` No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 21]: Remembrances of Our House , of Master George , of Aunt Jane , of Uncle Parker , all laid waste !
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 17]: All offered up sacrifices to the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour ! '
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 54]: Chapter 8 IN WHICH AN INNOCENT ELOPEMENT OCCURS The minion of fortune and the worm of the hour , or in less cutting language , Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , the Golden Dustman , had become as much at home in his eminently aristocratic family mansion as he was likely ever to be .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 50]: He could not but feel that , like an eminently aristocratic family cheese , it was much too large for his wants , and bred an infinite amount of parasites ; but he was content to regard this drawback on his property as a sort of perpetual Legacy Duty .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 22]: He felt the more resigned to it , forasmuch as Mrs Boffin enjoyed herself completely , and Miss Bella was delighted .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 14]: That young lady was , no doubt , and acquisition to the Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 26]: She was far too pretty to be unattractive anywhere , and far too quick of perception to be below the tone of her new career .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 40]: Whether it improved her heart might be a matter of taste that was open to question ; but as touching another matter of taste , its improvement of her appearance and manner , there could be no question whatever .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 44]: And thus it soon came about that Miss Bella began to set Mrs Boffin right ; and even further , that Miss Bella began to feel ill at ease , and as it were responsible , when she saw Mrs Boffin going wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 120]: Not that so sweet a disposition and so sound a nature could ever go very wrong even among the great visiting authorities who agreed that the Boffins were ` charmingly vulgar ' -LRB- which for certain was not their own case in saying so -RRB- , but that when she made a slip on the social ice on which all the children of Podsnappery , with genteel souls to be saved , are required to skate in circles , or to slide in long rows , she inevitably tripped Miss Bella up -LRB- so that young lady felt -RRB- , and caused her to experience great confusion under the glances of the more skilful performers engaged in those ice-exercises .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 34]: At Miss Bella 's time of life it was not to be expected that she should examine herself very closely on the congruity or stability of her position in Mr Boffin 's house .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 41]: And as she had never been sparing of complaints of her old home when she had no other to compare it with , so there was no novelty of ingratitude or disdain in her very much preferring her new one .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 19]: ` An invaluable man is Rokesmith , ' said Mr Boffin , after some two or three months .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 11]: ` But I ca n't quite make him out . '
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 12]: Neither could Bella , so she found the subject rather interesting .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 69]: ` He takes more care of my affairs , morning , noon , and night , ' said Mr Boffin , ` than fifty other men put together either could or would ; and yet he has ways of his own that are like tying a scaffolding-pole right across the road , and bringing me up short when I am almost a-walking arm in arm with him . '
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 10]: ` May I ask how so , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 3]: inquired Bella .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 23]: ` Well , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin , ` he wo n't meet any company here , but you .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 30]: When we have visitors , I should wish him to have his regular place at the table like ourselves ; but no , he wo n't take it . '
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 29]: ` If he considers himself above it , ' said Miss Bella , with an airy toss of her head , ' I should leave him alone . '
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 18]: ` It ai n't that , my dear , ' replied Mr Boffin , thinking it over .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 10]: ` He do n't consider himself above it . '
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 12]: ` Perhaps he considers himself beneath it , ' suggested Bella .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 11]: ` If so , he ought to know best . '
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 14]: ` No , my dear ; nor it ai n't that , neither .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 37]: No , ' repeated Mr Boffin , with a shake of his head , after again thinking it over ; ` Rokesmith 's a modest man , but he do n't consider himself beneath it . '
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 10]: ` Then what does he consider , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 3]: asked Bella .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 7]: ` Dashed if I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 17]: ` It seemed that first as if it was only Lightwood that he objected to meet .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 12]: And now it seems to be everybody , except you . '
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 2]: Oho !
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 4]: thought Miss Bella .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 5]: ` In -- deed !
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 8]: That 's it , is it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 27]: For Mr Mortimer Lightwood had dined there two or three times , and she had met him elsewhere , and he had shown her some attention .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 22]: ` Rather cool in a Secretary -- and Pa 's lodger -- to make me the subject of his jealousy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 40]: That Pa 's daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa 's lodger was odd ; but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl : spoilt first by poverty , and then by wealth .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 17]: Be it this history 's part , however , to leave them to unravel themselves . '
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 31]: A little too much , I think , ' Miss Bella reflected scornfully , ` to have Pa 's lodger laying claim to me , and keeping eligible people off !
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 31]: A little too much , indeed , to have the opportunities opened to me by Mr and Mrs Boffin , appropriated by a mere Secretary and Pa 's lodger ! '
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 27]: Yet it was not so very long ago that Bella had been fluttered by the discovery that this same Secretary and lodger seem to like her .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 17]: but the eminently aristocratic mansion and Mrs Boffin 's dressmaker had not come into play then .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 23]: In spite of his seemingly retiring manners a very intrusive person , this Secretary and lodger , in Miss Bella 's opinion .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 27]: Always a light in his office-room when we came home from the play or Opera , and he always at the carriage-door to hand us out .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 35]: Always a provoking radiance too on Mrs Boffin 's face , and an abominably cheerful reception of him , as if it were possible seriously to approve what the man had in his mind !
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 30]: ` You never charge me , Miss Wilfer , ' said the Secretary , encountering her by chance alone in the great drawing-room , ` with commissions for home .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 17]: I shall always be happy to execute any commands you may have in that direction . '
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 11]: ` Pray what may you mean , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 9]: inquired Miss Bella , with languidly drooping eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 4]: ` By home ?
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 10]: I mean your father 's house at Holloway . '
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 47]: She coloured under the retort -- so skilfully thrust , that the words seemed to be merely a plain answer , given in plain good faith -- and said , rather more emphatically and sharply : ` What commissions and commands are you speaking of ? '
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 24]: ` Only little words of remembrance as I assume you sent somehow or other , ' replied the Secretary with his former air .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 18]: ` It would be a pleasure to me if you would make me the bearer of them .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 16]: As you know , I come and go between the two houses every day . '
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 12]: ` You need n't remind me of that , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 30]: She was too quick in this petulant sally against ` Pa 's lodger ' ; and she felt that she had been so when she met his quiet look .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 12]: ` They do n't send many -- what was your expression ?
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 19]: -- words of remembrance to me , ' said Bella , making haste to take refuge in illusage .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 21]: ` They frequently ask me about you , and I give them such slight intelligence as I can . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 12]: I hope it 's truly given , ' exclaimed Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 22]: I hope you can not doubt it , for it would be very much against you , if you could . '
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 9]: ` No , I do not doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 11]: I deserve the reproach , which is very just indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 10]: I beg your pardon , Mr Rokesmith . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 25]: I should beg you not to do so , but that it shows you to such admirable advantage , ' he replied with earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 11]: ` Forgive me ; I could not help saying that .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 30]: To return to what I have digressed from , let me add that perhaps they think I report them to you , deliver little messages , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 15]: But I forbear to trouble you , as you never ask me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 27]: I am going , sir , ' said Bella , looking at him as if he had reproved her , ` to see them tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 20]: ` Is that , ' he asked , hesitating , ` said to me , or to them ? '
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 7]: ` To which you please . '
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 4]: ` To both ?
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 8]: Shall I make it a message ? '
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 10]: ` You can if you like , Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 14]: Message or no message , I am going to see them tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 9]: ` Then I will tell them so . '
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 20]: He lingered a moment , as though to give her the opportunity of prolonging the conversation if she wished .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 9]: As she remained silent , he left her .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 22]: Two incidents of the little interview were felt by Miss Bella herself , when alone again , to be very curious .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 24]: The first was , that he unquestionably left her with a penitent air upon her , and a penitent feeling in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 29]: The second was , that she had not an intention or a thought of going home , until she had announced it to him as a settled design .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 17]: ` What can I mean by it , or what can he mean by it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 33]: was her mental inquiry : ` He has no right to any power over me , and how do I come to mind him when I do n't care for him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 22]: Mrs Boffin , insisting that Bella should make tomorrow 's expedition in the chariot , she went home in great grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 64]: Mrs Wilfer and Miss Lavinia had speculated much on the probabilities and improbabilities of her coming in this gorgeous state , and , on beholding the chariot from the window at which they were secreted to look out for it , agreed that it must be detained at the door as long as possible , for the mortification and confusion of the neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 20]: Then they repaired to the usual family room , to receive Miss Bella with a becoming show of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 26]: The family room looked very small and very mean , and the downward staircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 18]: The little house and all its arrangements were a poor contrast to the eminently aristocratic dwelling . '
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 19]: I can hardly believe , thought Bella , that I ever did endure life in this place ! '
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 24]: Gloomy majesty on the part of Mrs Wilfer , and native pertness on the part of Lavvy , did not mend the matter .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 16]: Bella really stood in natural need of a little help , and she got none .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 35]: ` This , ' said Mrs Wilfer , presenting a cheek to be kissed , as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon , ` is quite an honour !
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 12]: You will probably find your sister Lavvy grown , Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 53]: ` Ma , ' Miss Lavinia interposed , ` there can be no objection to your being aggravating , because Bella richly deserves it ; but I really must request that you will not drag in such ridiculous nonsense as my having grown when I am past the growing age . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 18]: I grew , myself , ' Mrs Wilfer sternly proclaimed , ` after I was married . '
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 24]: ` Very well , Ma , ' returned Lavvy , ` then I think you had much better have left it alone . '
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 57]: The lofty glare with which the majestic woman received this answer , might have embarrassed a less pert opponent , but it had no effect upon Lavinia : who , leaving her parent to the enjoyment of any amount of glaring at she might deem desirable under the circumstances , accosted her sister , undismayed . '
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 19]: I suppose you wo n't consider yourself quite disgraced , Bella , if I give you a kiss ?
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 8]: And how do you do , Bella ?
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 7]: And how are your Boffins ? '
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 4]: ` Peace ! '
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 3]: ` Hold !
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 10]: I will not suffer this tone of levity . '
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 5]: ` My goodness me !
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 8]: How are your Spoffins , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 15]: said Lavvy , ` since Ma so very much objects to your Boffins . '
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 4]: ` Impertinent girl !
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 3]: Minx ! '
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 9]: said Mrs wilfer , with dread severity . '
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 62]: I do n't care whether I am a Minx , or a Sphinx , ' returned Lavinia , coolly , tossing her head ; ` it 's exactly the same thing to me , and I 'd every bit as soon be one as the other ; but I know this -- I 'll not grow after I 'm married ! '
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 5]: ` You will not ?
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 5]: YOU will not ? '
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 6]: repeated Mrs Wilfer , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 9]: ` No , Ma , I will not .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 6]: Nothing shall induce me . '
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 12]: Mrs Wilfer , having waved her gloves , became loftily pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 14]: ` But it was to be expected ; ' thus she spake . '
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 20]: A child of mine deserts me for the proud and prosperous , and another child of mine despises me .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 6]: It is quite fitting . '
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 30]: ` Ma , ' Bella struck in , ` Mr and Mrs Boffin are prosperous , no doubt ; but you have no right to say they are proud .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 11]: You must know very well that they are not . '
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 38]: ` In short , Ma , ' said Lavvy , bouncing over to the enemy without a word of notice , you must know very well -- or if you do n't , more shame for you !
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 12]: -- that Mr and Mrs Boffin are just absolute perfection . '
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 24]: ` Truly , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , courteously receiving the deserter , it would seem that we are required to think so .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 16]: And this , Lavinia , is my reason for objecting to a tone of levity .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 31]: Mrs Boffin -LRB- of whose physiognomy I can never speak with the composure I would desire to preserve -RRB- , and your mother , are not on terms of intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 26]: It is not for a moment to be supposed that she and her husband dare to presume to speak of this family as the Wilfers .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 13]: I can not therefore condescend to speak of them as the Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 30]: No ; for such a tone -- call it familiarity , levity , equality , or what you will -- would imply those social interchanges which do not exist .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 7]: Do I render myself intelligible ? '
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 44]: Without taking the least notice of this inquiry , albeit delivered in an imposing and forensic manner , Lavinia reminded her sister , ` After all , you know , Bella , you have n't told us how your Whatshisnames are . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 25]: I do n't want to speak of them here , ' replied Bella , suppressing indignation , and tapping her foot on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 17]: ` They are much too kind and too good to be drawn into these discussions . '
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 7]: ` Why put it so ? '
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 8]: demanded Mrs Wilfer , with biting sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 9]: ` Why adopt a circuitous form of speech ?
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 13]: It is polite and it is obliging ; but why do it ?
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 16]: Why not openly say that they are much too kind and too good for US ?
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 5]: We understand the allusion .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 6]: Why disguise the phrase ? '
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 30]: ` Ma , ' said Bella , with one beat of her foot , ` you are enough to drive a saint mad , and so is Lavvy . '
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 5]: ` Unfortunate Lavvy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 10]: cried Mrs Wilfer , in a tone of commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 7]: ` She always comes for it .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 5]: My poor child ! '
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 41]: But Lavvy , with the suddenness of her former desertion , now bounced over to the other enemy : very sharply remarking , ` Do n't patronize ME , Ma , because I can take care of myself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 52]: I only wonder , ' resumed Mrs Wilfer , directing her observations to her elder daughter , as safer on the whole than her utterly unmanageable younger , ` that you found time and inclination to tear yourself from Mr and Mrs Boffin , and come to see us at all .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 22]: I only wonder that our claims , contending against the superior claims of Mr and Mrs Boffin , had any weight .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 21]: I feel I ought to be thankful for gaining so much , in competition with Mr and Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 45]: -LRB- The good lady bitterly emphasized the first letter of the word Boffin , as if it represented her chief objection to the owners of that name , and as if she could have born Doffin , Moffin , or Poffin much better . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 42]: ` Ma , ' said Bella , angrily , ` you force me to say that I am truly sorry I did come home , and that I never will come home again , except when poor dear Pa is here .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 57]: For , Pa is too magnanimous to feel envy and spite towards my generous friends , and Pa is delicate enough and gentle enough to remember the sort of little claim they thought I had upon them and the unusually trying position in which , through no act of my own , I had been placed .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 28]: And I always did love poor dear Pa better than all the rest of you put together , and I always do and I always shall ! '
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 20]: Here Bella , deriving no comfort from her charming bonnet and her elegant dress , burst into tears . '
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 49]: I think , R.W. , ' cried Mrs Wilfer , lifting up her eyes and apostrophising the air , ` that if you were present , it would be a trial to your feelings to hear your wife and the mother of your family depreciated in your name .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 21]: But Fate has spared you this , R.W. , whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon her ! '
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 8]: Here Mrs Wilfer burst into tears . '
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 6]: I hate the Boffins ! '
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 4]: protested Miss Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 13]: I do n't care who objects to their being called the Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 7]: I WILL call 'em the Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 9]: The Boffins , the Boffins , the Boffins !
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 59]: And I say they are mischief-making Boffins , and I say the Boffins have set Bella against me , and I tell the Boffins to their faces : ' which was not strictly the fact , but the young lady was excited : ` that they are detestable Boffins , disreputable Boffins , odious Boffins , beastly Boffins .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 3]: There ! '
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 7]: Here Miss Lavinia burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 19]: The front garden-gate clanked , and the Secretary was seen coming at a brisk pace up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 41]: ` Leave Me to open the door to him , ' said Mrs Wilfer , rising with stately resignation as she shook her head and dried her eyes ; ` we have at present no stipendiary girl to do so .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 6]: We have nothing to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 20]: If he sees these traces of emotion on our cheeks , let him construe them as he may . '
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 7]: With those words she stalked out .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 30]: In a few moments she stalked in again , proclaiming in her heraldic manner , ` Mr Rokesmith is the bearer of a packet for Miss Bella Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 16]: Mr Rokesmith followed close upon his name , and of course saw what was amiss .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 13]: But he discreetly affected to see nothing , and addressed Miss Bella .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 16]: ` Mr Boffin intended to have placed this in the carriage for you this morning .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 43]: He wished you to have it , as a little keepsake he had prepared -- it is only a purse , Miss Wilfer -- but as he was disappointed in his fancy , I volunteered to come after you with it . '
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 11]: Bella took it in her hand , and thanked him .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 27]: ` We have been quarrelling here a little , Mr Rokesmith , but not more than we used ; you know our agreeable ways among ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 6]: You find me just going .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 4]: Good-bye , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 5]: Goodbye , Lavvy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 13]: and with a kiss for each Miss Bella turned to the door .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 20]: The Secretary would have attended her , but Mrs Wilfer advancing and saying with dignity , ` Pardon me !
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 29]: Permit me to assert my natural right to escort my child to the equipage which is in waiting for her , ' he begged pardon and gave place .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 33]: It was a very magnificent spectacle indeed , too see Mrs Wilfer throw open the house-door , and loudly demand with extended gloves , ` The male domestic of Mrs Boffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 17]: To whom presenting himself , she delivered the brief but majestic charge , ` Miss Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 4]: Coming out ! '
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 18]: and so delivered her over , like a female Lieutenant of the Tower relinquishing a State Prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 44]: The effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards perfectly paralyzing on the neighbours , and was much enhanced by the worthy lady airing herself for that term in a kind of splendidly serene trance on the top step .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 17]: When Bella was seated in the carriage , she opened the little packet in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 17]: It contained a pretty purse , and the purse contained a bank note for fifty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 28]: ` This shall be a joyful surprise for poor dear Pa , ' said Bella , ` and I 'll take it myself into the City ! '
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 42]: As she was uninformed respecting the exact locality of the place of business of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles , but knew it to be near Mincing Lane , she directed herself to be driven to the corner of that darksome spot .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 49]: Thence she despatched ` the male domestic of Mrs Boffin , ' in search of the counting-house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles , with a message importing that if R. Wilfer could come out , there was a lady waiting who would be glad to speak with him .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 43]: The delivery of these mysterious words from the mouth of a footman caused so great an excitement in the counting-house , that a youthful scout was instantly appointed to follow Rumty , observe the lady , and come in with his report .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 31]: Nor was the agitation by any means diminished , when the scout rushed back with the intelligence that the lady was ' a slap-up gal in a bang-up chariot . '
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 46]: Rumty himself , with his pen behind his ear under his rusty hat , arrived at the carriage-door in a breathless condition , and had been fairly lugged into the vehicle by his cravat and embraced almost unto choking , before he recognized his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 6]: ` My dear child ! '
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 6]: he then panted , incoherently .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 5]: ` Good gracious me !
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 7]: What a lovely woman you are !
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 15]: I thought you had been unkind and forgotten your mother and sister . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 12]: I have just been to see them , Pa dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 11]: and how -- how did you find your mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 6]: asked R. W. , dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 12]: ` Very disagreeable , Pa , and so was Lavvy . '
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 30]: ` They are sometimes a little liable to it , ' observed the patient cherub ; ` but I hope you made allowances , Bella , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 15]: I was disagreeable too , Pa ; we were all of us disagreeable together .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 64]: But I want you to come and dine with me somewhere , Pa. ' ` Why , my dear , I have already partaken of a -- if one might mention such an article in this superb chariot -- of a -- Saveloy , ' replied R. Wilfer , modestly dropping his voice on the word , as he eyed the canary-coloured fittings .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 7]: That 's nothing , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 31]: ` Truly , it ai n't as much as one could sometimes wish it to be , my dear , ' he admitted , drawing his hand across his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 49]: ` Still , when circumstances over which you have no control , interpose obstacles between yourself and Small Germans , you ca n't do better than bring a contented mind to hear on ' -- again dropping his voice in deference to the chariot -- ` Saveloys ! '
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 6]: ` You poor good Pa !
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 27]: Pa , do , I beg and pray , get leave for the rest of the day , and come and pass it with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 16]: ` Well , my dear , I 'll cut back and ask for leave . '
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 71]: ` But before you cut back , ' said Bella , who had already taken him by the chin , pulled his hat off , and begun to stick up his hair in her old way , ` do say that you are sure I am giddy and inconsiderate , but have never really slighted you , Pa. ' ` My dear , I say it with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 49]: And might I likewise observe , ' her father delicately hinted , with a glance out at window , ` that perhaps it might he calculated to attract attention , having one 's hair publicly done by a lovely woman in an elegant turn-out in Fenchurch Street ? '
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 9]: Bella laughed and put on his hat again .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 22]: But when his boyish figure bobbed away , its shabbiness and cheerful patience smote the tears out of her eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 25]: I hate that Secretary for thinking it of me , ' she said to herself , ` and yet it seems half true ! '
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 18]: Back came her father , more like a boy than ever , in his release from school .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 7]: ` All right , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 5]: Leave given at once .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 6]: Really very handsomely done ! '
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 36]: ` Now where can we find some quiet place , Pa , in which I can wait for you while you go on an errand for me , if I send the carriage away ? '
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 4]: It demanded cogitation .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 33]: ` You see , my dear , ' he explained , ` you really have become such a very lovely woman , that it ought to he a very quiet place . '
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 19]: At length he suggested , ` Near the garden up by the Trinity House on Tower Hill . '
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 30]: So , they were driven there , and Bella dismissed the chariot ; sending a pencilled note by it to Mrs Boffin , that she was with her father .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 24]: ` Now , Pa , attend to what I am going to say , and promise and vow to be obedient . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 9]: I promise and vow , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 6]: ` You ask no questions .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 59]: You take this purse ; you go to the nearest place where they keep everything of the very very best , ready made ; you buy and put on , the most beautiful suit of clothes , the most beautiful hat , and the most beautiful pair of bright boots -LRB- patent leather , Pa , mind ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 16]: that are to be got for money ; and you come back to me . '
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 15]: ` But , my dear Bella -- ' ` Take care , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 8]: pointing her forefinger at him , merrily .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 7]: ` You have promised and vowed .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 8]: It 's perjury , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 30]: There was water in the foolish little fellow 's eyes , but she kissed them dry -LRB- though her own were wet -RRB- , and he bobbed away again .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 41]: After half an hour , he came back , so brilliantly transformed , that Bella was obliged to walk round him in ecstatic admiration twenty times , before she could draw her arm through his , and delightedly squeeze it .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 23]: ` Now , Pa , ' said Bella , hugging him close , ` take this lovely woman out to dinner . '
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 10]: ` Where shall we go , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 4]: ` Greenwich ! '
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 5]: said Bella , valiantly .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 16]: ` And be sure you treat this lovely woman with everything of the best . '
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 33]: While they were going along to take boat , ` Do n't you wish , my dear , ' said R. W. , timidly , ` that your mother was here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 20]: ` No , I do n't , Pa , for I like to have you all to myself to-day .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 15]: I was always your little favourite at home , and you were always mine .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 17]: We have run away together often , before now ; have n't we , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 9]: ` Ah , to be sure we have !
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 26]: Many a Sunday when your mother was -- was a little liable to it , ' repeating his former delicate expression after pausing to cough .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 23]: ` Yes , and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have been , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 45]: I made you carry me , over and over again , when you should have made me walk ; and I often drove you in harness , when you would much rather have sat down and read your newspaper : did n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 5]: ` Sometimes , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 9]: But Lor , what a child you were !
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 7]: What a companion you were ! '
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 3]: ` Companion ?
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 22]: That 's just what I want to be to-day , Pa. ' ` You are safe to succeed , my love .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 26]: Your brothers and sisters have all in their turns been companions to me , to a certain extent , but only to a certain extent .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 49]: Your mother has , throughout life , been a companion that any man might -- might look up to -- and -- and commit the sayings of , to memory -- and -- form himself upon -- if he -- ' ` If he liked the model ? '
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 3]: suggested Bella .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 33]: ` We-ell , ye-es , ' he returned , thinking about it , not quite satisfied with the phrase : ` or perhaps I might say , if it was in him .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 23]: Supposing , for instance , that a man wanted to be always marching , he would find your mother an inestimable companion .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 36]: But if he had any taste for walking , or should wish at any time to break into a trot , he might sometimes find it a little difficult to keep step with your mother .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 45]: Or take it this way , Bella , ' he added , after a moment 's reflection ; ` Supposing that a man had to go through life , we wo n't say with a companion , but we 'll say to a tune .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 14]: Supposing that the tune allotted to him was the Dead March in Saul .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 31]: It would be a very suitable tune for particular occasions -- none better -- but it would be difficult to keep time with in the ordinary run of domestic transactions .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 31]: For instance , if he took his supper after a hard day , to the Dead March in Saul , his food might be likely to sit heavy on him .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 51]: Or , if he was at any time inclined to relieve his mind by singing a comic song or dancing a hornpipe , and was obliged to do it to the Dead March in Saul , he might find himself put out in the execution of his lively intentions . '
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 5]: ` Poor Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 10]: thought Bella , as she hung upon his arm .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 34]: ` Now , what I will say for you , my dear , ' the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining , ` is , that you are so adaptable .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 4]: So adaptable . '
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 14]: ` Indeed I am afraid I have shown a wretched temper , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 13]: I am afraid I have been very complaining , and very capricious .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 9]: I seldom or never thought of it before .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 22]: But when I sat in the carriage just now and saw you coming along the pavement , I reproached myself . '
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 8]: ` Not at all , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 9]: Do n't speak of such a thing . '
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 15]: A happy and a chatty man was Pa in his new clothes that day .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 45]: Take it for all in all , it was perhaps the happiest day he had ever known in his life ; not even excepting that on which his heroic partner had approached the nuptial altar to the tune of the Dead March in Saul .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 26]: The little expedition down the river was delightful , and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 4]: Everything was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 22]: The park was delightful , the punch was delightful , the dishes of fish were delightful , the wine was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 74]: Bella was more delightful than any other item in the festival ; drawing Pa out in the gayest manner ; making a point of always mentioning herself as the lovely woman ; stimulating Pa to order things , by declaring that the lovely woman insisted on being treated with them ; and in short causing Pa to be quite enraptured with the consideration that he WAS the Pa of such a charming daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 39]: And then , as they sat looking at the ships and steamboats making their way to the sea with the tide that was running down , the lovely woman imagined all sorts of voyages for herself and Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 79]: Now , Pa , in the character of owner of a lumbering square-sailed collier , was tacking away to Newcastle , to fetch black diamonds to make his fortune with ; now , Pa was going to China in that handsome threemasted ship , to bring home opium , with which he would for ever cut out Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles , and to bring home silks and shawls without end for the decoration of his charming daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 81]: Now , John Harmon 's disastrous fate was all a dream , and he had come home and found the lovely woman just the article for him , and the lovely woman had found him just the article for her , and they were going away on a trip , in their gallant bark , to look after their vines , with streamers flying at all points , a band playing on deck and Pa established in the great cabin .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 104]: Now , John Harmon was consigned to his grave again , and a merchant of immense wealth -LRB- name unknown -RRB- had courted and married the lovely woman , and he was so enormously rich that everything you saw upon the river sailing or steaming belonged to him , and he kept a perfect fleet of yachts for pleasure , and that little impudent yacht which you saw over there , with the great white sail , was called The Bella , in honour of his wife , and she held her state aboard when it pleased her , like a modern Cleopatra .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 67]: Anon , there would embark in that troop-ship when she got to Gravesend , a mighty general , of large property -LRB- name also unknown -RRB- , who would n't hear of going to victory without his wife , and whose wife was the lovely woman , and she was destined to become the idol of all the red coats and blue jackets alow and aloft .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 15]: And then again : you saw that ship being towed out by a steam-tug ?
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 9]: where did you suppose she was going to ?
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 154]: She was going among the coral reefs and cocoa-nuts and all that sort of thing , and she was chartered for a fortunate individual of the name of Pa -LRB- himself on board , and much respected by all hands -RRB- , and she was going , for his sole profit and advantage , to fetch a cargo of sweet-smelling woods , the most beautiful that ever were seen , and the most profitable that ever were heard of ; and her cargo would be a great fortune , as indeed it ought to be : the lovely woman who had purchased her and fitted her expressly for this voyage , being married to an Indian Prince , who was a Something-or-Other , and who wore Cashmere shawls all over himself and diamonds and emeralds blazing in his turban , and was beautifully coffeecoloured and excessively devoted , though a little too jealous .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 45]: Thus Bella ran on merrily , in a manner perfectly enchanting to Pa , who was as willing to put his head into the Sultan 's tub of water as the beggar-boys below the window were to put THEIR heads in the mud . '
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 31]: I suppose , my dear , ' said Pa after dinner , ` we may come to the conclusion at home , that we have lost you for good ? '
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 5]: Bella shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 4]: Did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 4]: Could n't say .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 40]: All she was able to report was , that she was most handsomely supplied with everything she could possibly want , and that whenever she hinted at leaving Mr and Mrs Boffin , they would n't hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 19]: ` And now , Pa , ' pursued Bella , ` I 'll make a confession to you .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 16]: I am the most mercenary little wretch that ever lived in the world . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 29]: I should hardly have thought it of you , my dear , ' returned her father , first glancing at himself ; and then at the dessert . '
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 14]: I understand what you mean , Pa , but it 's not that .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 26]: It 's not that I care for money to keep as money , but I do care so much for what it will buy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 26]: ` Really I think most of us do , ' returned R. W. ` But not to the dreadful extent that I do , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 3]: O-o ! '
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 18]: cried Bella , screwing the exclamation out of herself with a twist of her dimpled chin . '
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 6]: I AM so mercenary ! '
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 33]: With a wistful glance R. W. said , in default of having anything better to say : ` About when did you begin to feel it coming on , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 7]: ` That 's it , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 8]: That 's the terrible part of it .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 25]: When I was at home , and only knew what it was to be poor , I grumbled but did n't so much mind .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 22]: When I was at home expecting to be rich , I thought vaguely of all the great things I would do .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 47]: But when I had been disappointed of my splendid fortune , and came to see it from day to day in other hands , and to have before my eyes what it could really do , then I became the mercenary little wretch I am . '
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 11]: ` It 's your fancy , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 14]: I can assure you it 's nothing of the sort , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 25]: said Bella , nodding at him , with her very pretty eyebrows raised as high as they would go , and looking comically frightened .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 6]: ` It 's a fact .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 7]: I am always avariciously scheming . '
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 3]: ` Lor !
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 4]: But how ? '
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 8]: ` I 'll tell you , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 44]: I do n't mind telling YOU , because we have always been favourites of each other 's , and because you are not like a Pa , but more like a sort of a younger brother with a dear venerable chubbiness on him .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 28]: And besides , ' added Bella , laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face , ` because I have got you in my power .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 6]: This is a secret expedition .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 13]: If ever you tell of me , I 'll tell of you .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 11]: I 'll tell Ma that you dined at Greenwich . '
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 31]: ` Well ; seriously , my dear , ' observed R. W. , with some trepidation of manner , ` it might be as well not to mention it . '
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 4]: laughed Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 10]: I knew you would n't like it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 12]: So you keep my confidence , and I 'll keep yours .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 14]: But betray the lovely woman , and you shall find her a serpent .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 33]: Now , you may give me a kiss , Pa , and I should like to give your hair a turn , because it has been dreadfully neglected in my absence . '
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 53]: R. W. submitted his head to the operator , and the operator went on talking ; at the same time putting separate locks of his hair through a curious process of being smartly rolled over her two revolving forefingers , which were then suddenly pulled out of it in opposite lateral directions .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 12]: On each of these occasions the patient winced and winked . '
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 14]: I have made up my mind that I must have money , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 28]: I feel that I ca n't beg it , borrow it , or steal it ; and so I have resolved that I must marry it . '
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 33]: R. W. cast up his eyes towards her , as well as he could under the operating circumstances , and said in a tone of remonstrance , ` My de-ar Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 18]: ` Have resolved , I say , Pa , that to get money I must marry money .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 16]: In consequence of which , I am always looking out for money to captivate . '
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 6]: ` My de-a-r Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 13]: ` Yes , Pa , that is the state of the case .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 24]: If ever there was a mercenary plotter whose thoughts and designs were always in her mean occupation , I am the amiable creature .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 6]: But I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 19]: I hate and detest being poor , and I wo n't be poor if I can marry money .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 22]: Now you are deliciously fluffy , Pa , and in a state to astonish the waiter and pay the bill . '
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 17]: ` But , my dear Bella , this is quite alarming at your age . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 24]: I told you so , Pa , but you would n't believe it , ' returned Bella , with a pleasant childish gravity .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 7]: ` Is n't it shocking ? '
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 23]: ` It would be quite so , if you fully knew what you said , my dear , or meant it . '
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 16]: ` Well , Pa , I can only tell you that I mean nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 7]: Talk to me of love ! '
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 18]: said Bella , contemptuously : though her face and figure certainly rendered the subject no incongruous one .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 8]: ` Talk to me of fiery dragons !
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 18]: But talk to me of poverty and wealth , and there indeed we touch upon realities . '
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 21]: ` My De-ar , this is becoming Awful -- ' her father was emphatically beginning : when she stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 6]: ` Pa , tell me .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 6]: Did you marry money ? '
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 11]: ` You know I did n't , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 18]: Bella hummed the Dead March in Saul , and said , after all it signified very little !
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 23]: But seeing him look grave and downcast , she took him round the neck and kissed him back to cheerfulness again . '
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 17]: I did n't mean that last touch , Pa ; it was only said in joke .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 3]: Now mind !
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 16]: You are not to tell of me , and I 'll not tell of you .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 42]: And more than that ; I promise to have no secrets from you , Pa , and you may make certain that , whatever mercenary things go on , I shall always tell you all about them in strict confidence . '
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 23]: Fain to be satisfied with this concession from the lovely woman , R. W. rang the bell , and paid the bill .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 84]: ` Now , all the rest of this , Pa , ' said Bella , rolling up the purse when they were alone again , hammering it small with her little fist on the table , and cramming it into one of the pockets of his new waistcoat , ` is for you , to buy presents with for them at home , and to pay bills with , and to divide as you like , and spend exactly as you think proper .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 19]: Last of all take notice , Pa , that it 's not the fruit of any avaricious scheme .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 21]: Perhaps if it was , your little mercenary wretch of a daughter would n't make so free with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 48]: After which , she tugged at his coat with both hands , and pulled him all askew in buttoning that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket , and then tied her dimples into her bonnet-strings in a very knowing way , and took him back to London .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 48]: Arrived at Mr Boffin 's door , she set him with his back against it , tenderly took him by the ears as convenient handles for her purpose , and kissed him until he knocked muffled double knocks at the door with the back of his head .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 17]: That done , she once more reminded him of their compact and gaily parted from him .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 21]: Not so gaily , however , but that tears filled her eyes as he went away down the dark street .
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 18]: Not so gaily , but that she several times said , ` Ah , poor little Pa !
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 10]: Ah , poor dear struggling shabby little Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 10]: before she took heart to knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 30]: Not so gaily , but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 56]: Not so gaily , but that she fell into very low spirits sitting late in her own room , and very heartily wept , as she wished , now that the deceased old John Harmon had never made a will about her , now that the deceased young John Harmon had lived to marry her .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 30]: ` Contradictory things to wish , ' said Bella , ` but my life and fortunes are so contradictory altogether that what can I expect myself to be ! '
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 37]: Chapter 9 IN WHICH THE ORPHAN MAKES HIS WILL The Secretary , working in the Dismal Swamp betimes next morning , was informed that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 59]: The footman who communicated this intelligence made a decent pause before uttering the name , to express that it was forced on his reluctance by the youth in question , and that if the youth had had the good sense and good taste to inherit some other name it would have spared the feelings of him the bearer .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 19]: ` Mrs Boffin will be very well pleased , ' said the Secretary in a perfectly composed way .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 6]: ` Show him in . '
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 28]: Mr Sloppy being introduced , remained close to the door : revealing in various parts of his form many surprising , confounding , and incomprehensible buttons . '
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 20]: I am glad to see you , ' said John Rokesmith , in a cheerful tone of welcome . '
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 7]: I have been expecting you . '
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 37]: Sloppy explained that he had meant to come before , but that the Orphan -LRB- of whom he made mention as Our Johnny -RRB- had been ailing , and he had waited to report him well .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 8]: ` Then he is well now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 4]: said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 10]: ` No he ai n't , ' said Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 28]: Mr Sloppy having shaken his head to a considerable extent , proceeded to remark that he thought Johnny ` must have took 'em from the Minders . '
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 20]: Being asked what he meant , he answered , them that come out upon him and partickler his chest .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 23]: Being requested to explain himself , he stated that there was some of 'em wot you could n't kiver with a sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 23]: Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case , he opined that they wos about as red as ever red could be .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 24]: ` But as long as they strikes out ` ards , sir , ' continued Sloppy , ` they ai n't so much .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 15]: It 's their striking in ` ards that 's to be kep off . '
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 10]: John Rokesmith hoped the child had had medical attendance ?
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 17]: Oh yes , said Sloppy , he had been took to the doctor 's shop once .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 8]: And what did the doctor call it ?
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 4]: Rokesmith asked him .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 23]: After some perplexed reflection , Sloppy answered , brightening , ` He called it something as wos wery long for spots . '
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 4]: Rokesmith suggested measles .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 20]: ` No , ' said Sloppy with confidence , ` ever so much longer than THEM , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 24]: -LRB- Mr Sloppy was elevated by this fact , and seemed to consider that it reflected credit on the poor little patient . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 14]: ` Mrs Boffin will be sorry to hear this , ' said Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 24]: ` Mrs Higden said so , sir , when she kep it from her , hoping as Our Johnny would work round . '
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 8]: ` But I hope he will ? '
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 12]: said Rokesmith , with a quick turn upon the messenger . '
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 8]: I hope so , ' answered Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 12]: ` It all depends on their striking in ` ards . '
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 41]: He then went on to say that whether Johnny had ` took 'em ' from the Minders , or whether the Minders had ` took em from Johnny , the Minders had been sent home and had ` got em .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 45]: Furthermore , that Mrs Higden 's days and nights being devoted to Our Johnny , who was never out of her lap , the whole of the mangling arrangements had devolved upon himself , and he had had ` rayther a tight time ' .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 23]: The ungainly piece of honesty beamed and blushed as he said it , quite enraptured with the remembrance of having been serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 30]: ` Last night , ' said Sloppy , ` when I was a-turning at the wheel pretty late , the mangle seemed to go like Our Johnny 's breathing .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 59]: It begun beautiful , then as it went out it shook a little and got unsteady , then as it took the turn to come home it had a rattle-like and lumbered a bit , then it come smooth , and so it went on till I scarce know 'd which was mangle and which was Our Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 26]: Nor Our Johnny , he scarce know 'd either , for sometimes when the mangle lumbers he says , `` Me choking , Granny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 27]: and Mrs Higden holds him up in her lap and says to me `` Bide a bit , Sloppy , '' and we all stops together .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 21]: And when Our Johnny gets his breathing again , I turns again , and we all goes on together . '
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 15]: Sloppy had gradually expanded with his description into a stare and a vacant grin .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 43]: He now contracted , being silent , into a halfrepressed gush of tears , and , under pretence of being heated , drew the under part of his sleeve across his eyes with a singularly awkward , laborious , and roundabout smear .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 10]: ` This is unfortunate , ' said Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 10]: I must go and break it to Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 7]: Stay you here , Sloppy . '
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 25]: Sloppy stayed there , staring at the pattern of the paper on the wall , until the Secretary and Mrs Boffin came back together .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 33]: And with Mrs Boffin was a young lady -LRB- Miss Bella Wilfer by name -RRB- who was better worth staring at , it occurred to Sloppy , than the best of wall-papering .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 12]: ` Ah , my poor dear pretty little John Harmon ! '
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 10]: ` Yes mum , ' said the sympathetic Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 19]: ` You do n't think he is in a very , very bad way , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 9]: asked the pleasant creature with her wholesome cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 32]: Put upon his good faith , and finding it in collision with his inclinations , Sloppy threw back his head and uttered a mellifluous howl , rounded off with a sniff .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 7]: ` So bad as that ! '
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 4]: cried Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 14]: ` And Betty Higden not to tell me of it sooner ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 16]: I think she might have been mistrustful , mum , ' answered Sloppy , hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 11]: ` Of what , for Heaven 's sake ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 25]: I think she might have been mistrustful , mum , ' returned Sloppy with submission , ` of standing in Our Johnny 's light .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 27]: There 's so much trouble in illness , and so much expense , and she 's seen such a lot of its being objected to . '
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 24]: ` But she never can have thought , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` that I would grudge the dear child anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 34]: ` No mum , but she might have thought -LRB- as a habit-like -RRB- of its standing in Johnny 's light , and might have tried to bring him through it unbeknownst . '
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 6]: Sloppy knew his ground well .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 30]: To conceal herself in sickness , like a lower animal ; to creep out of sight and coil herself away and die ; had become this woman 's instinct .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 57]: To catch up in her arms the sick child who was dear to her , and hide it as if it were a criminal , and keep off all ministration but such as her own ignorant tenderness and patience could supply , had become this woman 's idea of maternal love , fidelity , and duty .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 41]: The shameful accounts we read , every week in the Christian year , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , the infamous records of small official inhumanity , do not pass by the people as they pass by us .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 44]: And hence these irrational , blind , and obstinate prejudices , so astonishing to our magnificence , and having no more reason in them -- God save the Queen and Confound their politics -- no , than smoke has in coming from fire !
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 20]: ` It 's not a right place for the poor child to stay in , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 16]: ` Tell us , dear Mr Rokesmith , what to do for the best . '
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 15]: He had already thought what to do , and the consultation was very short .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 23]: He could pave the way , he said , in half an hour , and then they would go down to Brentford .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 9]: ` Pray take me , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 47]: Therefore a carriage was ordered , of capacity to take them all , and in the meantime Sloppy was regaled , feasting alone in the Secretary 's room , with a complete realization of that fairy vision -- meat , beer , vegetables , and pudding .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 37]: In consequence of which his buttons became more importunate of public notice than before , with the exception of two or three about the region of the waistband , which modestly withdrew into a creasy retirement .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 12]: Punctual to the time , appeared the carriage and the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 13]: He sat on the box , and Mr Sloppy graced the rumble .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 32]: So , to the Three Magpies as before : where Mrs Boffin and Miss Bella were handed out , and whence they all went on foot to Mrs Betty Higden 's .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 86]: But , on the way down , they had stopped at a toy-shop , and had bought that noble charger , a description of whose points and trappings had on the last occasion conciliated the then worldlyminded orphan , and also a Noah 's ark , and also a yellow bird with an artificial voice in him , and also a military doll so well dressed that if he had only been of life-size his brother-officers in the Guards might never have found him out .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 31]: Bearing these gifts , they raised the latch of Betty Higden 's door , and saw her sitting in the dimmest and furthest corner with poor Johnny in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 10]: ` And how 's my boy , Betty ? '
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 9]: asked Mrs Boffin , sitting down beside her .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 5]: ` He 's bad !
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 5]: He 's bad ! '
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 4]: said Betty . '
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 15]: I begin to be afeerd he 'll not be yours any more than mine .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 32]: All others belonging to him have gone to the Power and the Glory , and I have a mind that they 're drawing him to them -- leading him away . '
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 13]: ` No , no , no , ' said Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 25]: I do n't know why else he clenches his little hand as if it had hold of a finger that I ca n't see .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 30]: Look at it , ' said Betty , opening the wrappers in which the flushed child lay , and showing his small right hand lying closed upon his breast .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 6]: ` It 's always so .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 7]: It do n't mind me . '
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 6]: ` Is he asleep ? '
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 7]: ` No , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 9]: You 're not asleep , my Johnny ? '
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 22]: ` No , ' said Johnny , with a quiet air of pity for himself ; and without opening his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 8]: ` Here 's the lady , Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 5]: And the horse . '
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 15]: Johnny could bear the lady , with complete indifference , but not the horse .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 26]: Opening his heavy eyes , he slowly broke into a smile on beholding that splendid phenomenon , and wanted to take it in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 25]: As it was much too big , it was put upon a chair where he could hold it by the mane and contemplate it .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 7]: Which he soon forgot to do .
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 30]: But , Johnny murmuring something with his eyes closed , and Mrs Boffin not knowing what , old Betty bent her ear to listen and took pains to understand .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 55]: Being asked by her to repeat what he had said , he did so two or three times , and then it came out that he must have seen more than they supposed when he looked up to see the horse , for the murmur was , ` Who is the boofer lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 53]: Now , the boofer , or beautiful , lady was Bella ; and whereas this notice from the poor baby would have touched her of itself ; it was rendered more pathetic by the late melting of her heart to her poor little father , and their joke about the lovely woman .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 45]: So , Bella 's behaviour was very tender and very natural when she kneeled on the brick floor to clasp the child , and when the child , with a child 's admiration of what is young and pretty , fondled the boofer lady .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 50]: ` Now , my good dear Betty , ' said Mrs Boffin , hoping that she saw her opportunity , and laying her hand persuasively on her arm ; ` we have come to remove Johnny from this cottage to where he can be taken better care of . '
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 29]: Instantly , and before another word could be spoken , the old woman started up with blazing eyes , and rushed at the door with the sick child .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 11]: ` Stand away from me every one of ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 6]: she cried out wildly . '
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 7]: I see what ye mean now .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 10]: Let me go my way , all of ye .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 12]: I 'd sooner kill the Pretty , and kill myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 6]: ` Stay , stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 6]: said Rokesmith , soothing her .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 8]: ` You do n't understand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 5]: I understand too well .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 9]: I know too much about it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 10]: I 've run from it too many a year .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 21]: Never for me , nor for the child , while there 's water enough in England to cover us ! '
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 38]: The terror , the shame , the passion of horror and repugnance , firing the worn face and perfectly maddening it , would have been a quite terrible sight , if embodied in one old fellow-creature alone .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 27]: Yet it ` crops up ' -- as our slang goes -- my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , in other fellow-creatures , rather frequently !
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 21]: ` It 's been chasing me all my life , but it shall never take me nor mine alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 4]: cried old Betty .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 7]: ` I 've done with ye .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 30]: I 'd have fastened door and window and starved out , afore I 'd ever have let ye in , if I had known what ye came for ! '
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 41]: But , catching sight of Mrs Boffin 's wholesome face , she relented , and crouching down by the door and bending over her burden to hush it , said humbly : ` Maybe my fears has put me wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 15]: If they have so , tell me , and the good Lord forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 25]: I 'm quick to take this fright , I know , and my head is summ ` at light with wearying and watching . '
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 8]: ` There , there , there ! '
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 4]: returned Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 5]: ` Come , come !
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 8]: Say no more of it , Betty .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 8]: It was a mistake , a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 20]: Any one of us might have made it in your place , and felt just as you do . '
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 7]: ` The Lord bless ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 10]: said the old woman , stretching out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 47]: ` Now , see , Betty , ' pursued the sweet compassionate soul , holding the hand kindly , ` what I really did mean , and what I should have begun by saying out , if I had only been a little wiser and handier .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 56]: We want to move Johnny to a place where there are none but children ; a place set up on purpose for sick children ; where the good doctors and nurses pass their lives with children , talk to none but children , touch none but children , comfort and cure none but children . '
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 9]: ` Is there really such a place ? '
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 11]: asked the old woman , with a gaze of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 15]: ` Yes , Betty , on my word , and you shall see it .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 27]: If my home was a better place for the dear boy , I 'd take him to it ; but indeed indeed it 's not . '
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 24]: ` You shall take him , ' returned Betty , fervently kissing the comforting hand , ` where you will , my deary .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 29]: I am not so hard , but that I believe your face and voice , and I will , as long as I can see and hear . '
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 22]: This victory gained , Rokesmith made haste to profit by it , for he saw how woefully time had been lost .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 78]: He despatched Sloppy to bring the carriage to the door ; caused the child to be carefully wrapped up ; bade old Betty get her bonnet on ; collected the toys , enabling the little fellow to comprehend that his treasures were to be transported with him ; and had all things prepared so easily that they were ready for the carriage as soon as it appeared , and in a minute afterwards were on their way .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 15]: Sloppy they left behind , relieving his overcharged breast with a paroxysm of mangling .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 33]: At the Children 's Hospital , the gallant steed , the Noah 's ark , yellow bird , and the officer in the Guards , were made as welcome as their child-owner .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 16]: But the doctor said aside to Rokesmith , ` This should have been days ago .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 4]: Too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 110]: However , they were all carried up into a fresh airy room , and there Johnny came to himself , out of a sleep or a swoon or whatever it was , to find himself lying in a little quiet bed , with a little platform over his breast , on which were already arranged , to give him heart and urge him to cheer up , the Noah 's ark , the noble steed , and the yellow bird ; with the officer in the Guards doing duty over the whole , quite as much to the satisfaction of his country as if he had been upon Parade .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 33]: And at the bed 's head was a coloured picture beautiful to see , representing as it were another Johnny seated on the knee of some Angel surely who loved little children .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 99]: And , marvellous fact , to lie and stare at : Johnny had become one of a little family , all in little quiet beds -LRB- except two playing dominoes in little arm-chairs at a little table on the hearth -RRB- : and on all the little beds were little platforms whereon were to be seen dolls ' houses , woolly dogs with mechanical barks in them not very dissimilar from the artificial voice pervading the bowels of the yellow bird , tin armies , Moorish tumblers , wooden tea things , and the riches of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 23]: As Johnny murmured something in his placid admiration , the ministering women at his bed 's head asked him what he said .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 17]: It seemed that he wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his ?
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 6]: So they told him yes .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 18]: It seemed then , that he wanted to know whether God had brought them all together there ?
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 7]: So they told him yes again .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 19]: They made out then , that he wanted to know whether they would all get out of pain ?
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 19]: So they answered yes to that question likewise , and made him understand that the reply included himself .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 31]: Johnny 's powers of sustaining conversation were as yet so very imperfectly developed , even in a state of health , that in sickness they were little more than monosyllabic .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 65]: But , he had to be washed and tended , and remedies were applied , and though those offices were far , far more skilfully and lightly done than ever anything had been done for him in his little life , so rough and short , they would have hurt and tired him but for an amazing circumstance which laid hold of his attention .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 50]: This was no less than the appearance on his own little platform in pairs , of All Creation , on its way into his own particular ark : the elephant leading , and the fly , with a diffident sense of his size , politely bringing up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 36]: A very little brother lying in the next bed with a broken leg , was so enchanted by this spectacle that his delight exalted its enthralling interest ; and so came rest and sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 20]: I see you are not afraid to leave the dear child here , Betty , ' whispered Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 5]: ` No , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 14]: Most willingly , most thankfully , with all my heart and soul . '
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 45]: So , they kissed him , and left him there , and old Betty was to come back early in the morning , and nobody but Rokesmith knew for certain how that the doctor had said , ` This should have been days ago .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 4]: Too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 65]: But , Rokesmith knowing it , and knowing that his bearing it in mind would be acceptable thereafter to that good woman who had been the only light in the childhood of desolate John Harmon dead and gone , resolved that late at night he would go back to the bedside of John Harmon 's namesake , and see how it fared with him .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 17]: The family whom God had brought together were not all asleep , but were all quiet .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 22]: From bed to bed , a light womanly tread and a pleasant fresh face passed in the silence of the night .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 44]: A little head would lift itself up into the softened light here and there , to be kissed as the face went by -- for these little patients are very loving -- and would then submit itself to be composed to rest again .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 38]: The mite with the broken leg was restless , and moaned ; but after a while turned his face towards Johnny 's bed , to fortify himself with a view of the ark , and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 43]: Over most of the beds , the toys were yet grouped as the children had left them when they last laid themselves down , and , in their innocent grotesqueness and incongruity , they might have stood for the children 's dreams .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 14]: The doctor came in too , to see how it fared with Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 14]: And he and Rokesmith stood together , looking down with compassion on him .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 8]: ` What is it , Johnny ? '
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 19]: Rokesmith was the questioner , and put an arm round the poor baby as he made a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 4]: ` Him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 5]: said the little fellow .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 4]: ` Those ! '
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 50]: The doctor was quick to understand children , and , taking the horse , the ark , the yellow bird , and the man in the Guards , from Johnny 's bed , softly placed them on that of his next neighbour , the mite with the broken leg .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 54]: With a weary and yet a pleased smile , and with an action as if he stretched his little figure out to rest , the child heaved his body on the sustaining arm , and seeking Rokesmith 's face with his lips , said : ' A kiss for the boofer lady . '
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 26]: Having now bequeathed all he had to dispose of , and arranged his affairs in this world , Johnny , thus speaking , left it .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 32]: Chapter 10 A SUCCESSOR Some of the Reverend Frank Milvey 's brethren had found themselves exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds , because they were required to bury the dead too hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 47]: But , the Reverend Frank , inclining to the belief that they were required to do one or two other things -LRB- say out of nine-and-thirty -RRB- calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if they would think as much about them , held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 36]: Indeed , the Reverend Frank Milvey was a forbearing man , who noticed many sad warps and blights in the vineyard wherein he worked , and did not profess that they made him savagely wise .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 28]: He only learned that the more he himself knew , in his little limited human way , the better he could distantly imagine what Omniscience might know .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 48]: Wherefore , if the Reverend Frank had had to read the words that troubled some of his brethren , and profitably touched innumerable hearts , in a worse case than Johnny 's , he would have done so out of the pity and humility of his soul .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 26]: Reading them over Johnny , he thought of his own six children , but not of his poverty , and read them with dimmed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 27]: And very seriously did he and his bright little wife , who had been listening , look down into the small grave and walk home arm-in-arm .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 16]: There was grief in the aristocratic house , and there was joy in the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 24]: Mr Wegg argued , if an orphan were wanted , was he not an orphan himself ; and could a better be desired ?
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 55]: And why go beating about Brentford bushes , seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims upon you and made no sacrifices for you , when here was an orphan ready to your hand who had given up in your cause , Miss Elizabeth , Master George , Aunt Jane , and Uncle Parker ?
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 12]: Mr Wegg chuckled , consequently , when he heard the tidings .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 50]: Nay , it was afterwards affirmed by a witness who shall at present be nameless , that in the seclusion of the Bower he poked out his wooden leg , in the stage-ballet manner , and executed a taunting or triumphant pirouette on the genuine leg remaining to him .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 34]: John Rokesmith 's manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time , was more the manner of a young man towards a mother , than that of a Secretary towards his employer 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 86]: It had always been marked by a subdued affectionate deference that seemed to have sprung up on the very day of his engagement ; whatever was odd in her dress or her ways had seemed to have no oddity for him ; he had sometimes borne a quietly-amused face in her company , but still it had seemed as if the pleasure her genial temper and radiant nature yielded him , could have been quite as naturally expressed in a tear as in a smile .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 55]: The completeness of his sympathy with her fancy for having a little John Harmon to protect and rear , he had shown in every act and word , and now that the kind fancy was disappointed , he treated it with a manly tenderness and respect for which she could hardly thank him enough .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 23]: ` But I do thank you , Mr Rokesmith , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` and I thank you most kindly .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 6]: You love children . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 6]: I hope everybody does . '
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 26]: ` They ought , ' said Mrs Boffin ; ` but we do n't all of us do what we ought , do us ? '
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 15]: John Rokesmith replied , ` Some among us supply the short-comings of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 13]: You have loved children well , Mr Boffin has told me . '
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 22]: Not a bit better than he has , but that 's his way ; he puts all the good upon me .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 9]: You speak rather sadly , Mr Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 5]: ` Do I ? '
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 7]: ` It sounds to me so .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 8]: Were you one of many children ? '
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 6]: ` An only child ? '
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 6]: ` No there was another .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 5]: Dead long ago . '
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 7]: ` Father or mother alive ? '
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 4]: ` Dead . '
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 10]: -- ` And the rest of your relations ? '
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 10]: ` Dead -- if I ever had any living .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 7]: I never heard of any . '
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 14]: At this point of the dialogue Bella came in with a light step .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 24]: She paused at the door a moment , hesitating whether to remain or retire ; perplexed by finding that she was not observed .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 22]: ` Now , do n't mind an old lady 's talk , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` but tell me .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 19]: Are you quite sure , Mr Rokesmith , that you have never had a disappointment in love ? '
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 4]: ` Quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 7]: Why do you ask me ? '
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 7]: ` Why , for this reason .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 18]: Sometimes you have a kind of kept-down manner with you , which is not like your age .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 8]: You ca n't be thirty ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 7]: I am not yet thirty . '
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 35]: Deeming it high time to make her presence known , Bella coughed here to attract attention , begged pardon , and said she would go , fearing that she interrupted some matter of business .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 43]: ` No , do n't go , ' rejoined Mrs Boffin , ` because we are coming to business , instead of having begun it , and you belong to it as much now , my dear Bella , as I do .
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 10]: But I want my Noddy to consult with us .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 13]: Would somebody be so good as find my Noddy for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 17]: Rokesmith departed on that errand , and presently returned accompanied by Mr Boffin at his jog-trot .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 21]: Bella felt a little vague trepidation as to the subject-matter of this same consultation , until Mrs Boffin announced it .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 57]: ` Now , you come and sit by me , my dear , ' said that worthy soul , taking her comfortable place on a large ottoman in the centre of the room , and drawing her arm through Bella 's ; ` and Noddy , you sit here , and Mr Rokesmith you sit there .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 15]: Now , you see , what I want to talk about , is this .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 47]: Mr and Mrs Milvey have sent me the kindest note possible -LRB- which Mr Rokesmith just now read to me out aloud , for I ai n't good at handwritings -RRB- , offering to find me another little child to name and educate and bring up .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 7]: This has set me thinking . '
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 26]: -LRB- ` And she is a steam-ingein at it , ' murmured Mr Boffin , in an admiring parenthesis , ` when she once begins .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 22]: It may n't be so easy to start her ; but once started , she 's a ingein . ' -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 34]: -- This has set me thinking , I say , ' repeated Mrs Boffin , cordially beaming under the influence of her husband 's compliment , ` and I have thought two things .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 16]: First of all , that I have grown timid of reviving John Harmon 's name .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 29]: It 's an unfortunate name , and I fancy I should reproach myself if I gave it to another dear child , and it proved again unlucky . '
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 30]: ` Now , whether , ' said Mr Boffin , gravely propounding a case for his Secretary 's opinion ; ` whether one might call that a superstition ? '
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 17]: ` It is a matter of feeling with Mrs Boffin , ' said Rokesmith , gently .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 8]: ` The name has always been unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 11]: It has now this new unfortunate association connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 6]: The name has died out .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 4]: Why revive it ?
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 10]: Might I ask Miss Wilfer what she thinks ? '
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 43]: ` It has not been a fortunate name for me , ' said Bella , colouring -- ` or at least it was not , until it led to my being here -- but that is not the point in my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 35]: As we had given the name to the poor child , and as the poor child took so lovingly to me , I think I should feel jealous of calling another child by it .
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 26]: I think I should feel as if the name had become endeared to me , and I had no right to use it so . '
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 8]: ` And that 's your opinion ? '
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 16]: remarked Mr Boffin , observant of the Secretary 's face and again addressing him . '
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 17]: I say again , it is a matter of feeling , ' returned the Secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 12]: I think Miss Wilfer 's feeling very womanly and pretty . '
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 15]: ` Now , give us your opinion , Noddy , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 19]: ` My opinion , old lady , ' returned the Golden Dustman , ` is your opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 28]: ` Then , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` we agree not to revive John Harmon 's name , but to let it rest in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 23]: It is , as Mr Rokesmith says , a matter of feeling , but Lor how many matters ARE matters of feeling !
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 15]: Well ; and so I come to the second thing I have thought of .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 70]: You must know , Bella , my dear , and Mr Rokesmith , that when I first named to my husband my thoughts of adopting a little orphan boy in remembrance of John Harmon , I further named to my husband that it was comforting to think that how the poor boy would be benefited by John 's own money , and protected from John 's own forlornness . '
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 6]: ` Hear , hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 4]: cried Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 5]: ` So she did .
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 3]: Ancoar ! '
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 26]: ` No , not Ancoar , Noddy , my dear , ' returned Mrs Boffin , ` because I am going to say something else .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 17]: I meant that , I am sure , as I much as I still mean it .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 24]: But this little death has made me ask myself the question , seriously , whether I was n't too bent upon pleasing myself .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 21]: Else why did I seek out so much for a pretty child , and a child quite to my liking ?
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 23]: Wanting to do good , why not do it for its own sake , and put my tastes and likings by ? '
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 55]: ` Perhaps , ' said Bella ; and perhaps she said it with some little sensitiveness arising out of those old curious relations of hers towards the murdered man ; ` perhaps , in reviving the name , you would not have liked to give it to a less interesting child than the original .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 7]: He interested you very much . '
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 59]: ` Well , my dear , ' returned Mrs Boffin , giving her a squeeze , ` it 's kind of you to find that reason out , and I hope it may have been so , and indeed to a certain extent I believe it was so , but I am afraid not to the whole extent .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 19]: However , that do n't come in question now , because we have done with the name . '
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 14]: ` Laid it up as a remembrance , ' suggested Bella , musingly .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 15]: ` Much better said , my dear ; laid it up as a remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 40]: Well then ; I have been thinking if I take any orphan to provide for , let it not be a pet and a plaything for me , but a creature to be helped for its own sake . '
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 6]: ` Not pretty then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 10]: ` No , ' returned Mrs Boffin , stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 6]: ` Nor prepossessing then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 8]: ` No , ' returned Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 5]: ` Not necessarily so .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 7]: That 's as it may happen .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 37]: A well-disposed boy comes in my way who may be even a little wanting in such advantages for getting on in life , but is honest and industrious and requires a helping hand and deserves it .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 22]: If I am very much in earnest and quite determined to be unselfish , let me take care of HIM . '
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 25]: Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion , appeared , and crossing to Rokesmith apologetically announced the objectionable Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 13]: The four members of Council looked at one another , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 10]: ` Shall he be brought here , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 3]: asked Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 14]: Whereupon the footman disappeared , reappeared presenting Sloppy , and retired much disgusted .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 47]: The consideration of Mrs Boffin had clothed Mr Sloppy in a suit of black , on which the tailor had received personal directions from Rokesmith to expend the utmost cunning of his art , with a view to the concealment of the cohering and sustaining buttons .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 61]: But , so much more powerful were the frailties of Sloppy 's form than the strongest resources of tailoring science , that he now stood before the Council , a perfect Argus in the way of buttons : shining and winking and gleaming and twinkling out of a hundred of those eyes of bright metal , at the dazzled spectators .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 49]: The artistic taste of some unknown hatter had furnished him with a hatband of wholesale capacity which was fluted behind , from the crown of his hat to the brim , and terminated in a black bunch , from which the imagination shrunk discomfited and the reason revolted .
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 48]: Some special powers with which his legs were endowed , had already hitched up his glossy trousers at the ankles , and bagged them at the knees ; while similar gifts in his arms had raised his coatsleeves from his wrists and accumulated them at his elbows .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 29]: Thus set forth , with the additional embellishments of a very little tail to his coat , and a yawning gulf at his waistband , Sloppy stood confessed .
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 11]: ` And how is Betty , my good fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 5]: Mrs Boffin asked him .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 38]: ` Thankee , mum , ' said Sloppy , ` she do pretty nicely , and sending her dooty and many thanks for the tea and all faviours and wishing to know the family 's healths . '
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 9]: ` Have you just come , Sloppy ? '
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 6]: ` Yes , mum . '
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 11]: ` Then you have not had your dinner yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 5]: ` No , mum .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 6]: But I mean to it .
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 62]: For I ai n't forgotten your handsome orders that I was never to go away without having had a good ` un off of meat and beer and pudding -- no : there was four of 'em , for I reckoned 'em up when I had 'em ; meat one , beer two , vegetables three , and which was four ?
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 10]: -- Why , pudding , HE was four ! '
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 16]: Here Sloppy threw his head back , opened his mouth wide , and laughed rapturously .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 10]: ` How are the two poor little Minders ? '
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 4]: asked Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 13]: ` Striking right out , mum , and coming round beautiful . '
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 24]: Mrs Boffin looked on the other three members of Council , and then said , beckoning with her finger : ` Sloppy . '
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 6]: ` Yes , mum . '
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 6]: ` Come forward , Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 10]: Should you like to dine here every day ? '
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 10]: ` Off of all four on 'em , mum ?
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 4]: O mum ! '
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 18]: Sloppy 's feelings obliged him to squeeze his hat , and contract one leg at the knee .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 20]: And should you like to be always taken care of here , if you were industrious and deserving ? '
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 5]: ` Oh , mum !
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 29]: -- But there 's Mrs Higden , ' said Sloppy , checking himself in his raptures , drawing back , and shaking his head with very serious meaning .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 6]: ` There 's Mrs Higden .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 6]: Mrs Higden goes before all .
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 14]: None can ever be better friends to me than Mrs Higden 's been .
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 11]: And she must be turned for , must Mrs Higden .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 13]: Where would Mrs Higden be if she war n't turned for ! '
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 26]: At the mere thought of Mrs Higden in this inconceivable affliction , Mr Sloppy 's countenance became pale , and manifested the most distressful emotions .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 28]: ` You are as right as right can be , Sloppy , ' said Mrs Boffin ` and far be it from me to tell you otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 6]: It shall be seen to .
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 38]: If Betty Higden can be turned for all the same , you shall come here and be taken care of for life , and be made able to keep her in other ways than the turning . '
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 29]: ` Even as to that , mum , ' answered the ecstatic Sloppy , ` the turning might be done in the night , do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 14]: I could be here in the day , and turn in the night .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 11]: I do n't want no sleep , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 31]: Or even if I any ways should want a wink or two , ' added Sloppy , after a moment 's apologetic reflection , ' I could take 'em turning .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 15]: I 've took 'em turning many a time , and enjoyed 'em wonderful ! '
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 50]: On the grateful impulse of the moment , Mr Sloppy kissed Mrs Boffin 's hand , and then detaching himself from that good creature that he might have room enough for his feelings , threw back his head , opened his mouth wide , and uttered a dismal howl .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 58]: It was creditable to his tenderness of heart , but suggested that he might on occasion give some offence to the neighbours : the rather , as the footman looked in , and begged pardon , finding he was not wanted , but excused himself ; on the ground ` that he thought it was Cats . '
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 49]: Chapter 11 SOME AFFAIRS OF THE HEART Little Miss Peecher , from her little official dwelling-house , with its little windows like the eyes in needles , and its little doors like the covers of school-books , was very observant indeed of the object of her quiet affections .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 28]: Love , though said to be afflicted with blindness , is a vigilant watchman , and Miss Peecher kept him on double duty over Mr Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 57]: It was not that she was naturally given to playing the spy -- it was not that she was at all secret , plotting , or mean -- it was simply that she loved the irresponsive Bradley with all the primitive and homely stock of love that had never been examined or certificated out of her .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 50]: If her faithful slate had had the latent qualities of sympathetic paper , and its pencil those of invisible ink , many a little treatise calculated to astonish the pupils would have come bursting through the dry sums in school-time under the warming influence of Miss Peecher 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 100]: For , oftentimes when school was not , and her calm leisure and calm little house were her own , Miss Peecher would commit to the confidential slate an imaginary description of how , upon a balmy evening at dusk , two figures might have been observed in the market-garden ground round the corner , of whom one , being a manly form , bent over the other , being a womanly form of short stature and some compactness , and breathed in a low voice the words , 'Em ma Peecher , wilt thou be my own ? '
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 21]: after which the womanly form 's head reposed upon the manly form 's shoulder , and the nightingales tuned up .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 18]: Though all unseen , and unsuspected by the pupils , Bradley Headstone even pervaded the school exercises .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 5]: Was Geography in question ?
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 37]: He would come triumphantly flying out of Vesuvius and Aetna ahead of the lava , and would boil unharmed in the hot springs of Iceland , and would float majestically down the Ganges and the Nile .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 8]: Did History chronicle a king of men ?
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 13]: Behold him in pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his watch-guard round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 6]: Were copies to be written ?
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 29]: In capital B 's and H 's most of the girls under Miss Peecher 's tuition were half a year ahead of every other letter in the alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 56]: And Mental Arithmetic , administered by Miss Peecher , often devoted itself to providing Bradley Headstone with a wardrobe of fabulous extent : fourscore and four neck-ties at two and ninepence-halfpenny , two gross of silver watches at four pounds fifteen and sixpence , seventy-four black hats at eighteen shillings ; and many similar superfluities .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 59]: The vigilant watchman , using his daily opportunities of turning his eyes in Bradley 's direction , soon apprized Miss Peecher that Bradley was more preoccupied than had been his wont , and more given to strolling about with a downcast and reserved face , turning something difficult in his mind that was not in the scholastic syllabus .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 57]: Putting this and that together -- combining under the head ` this , ' present appearances and the intimacy with Charley Hexam , and ranging under the head ` that ' the visit to his sister , the watchman reported to Miss Peecher his strong suspicions that the sister was at the bottom of it . '
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 30]: I wonder , ' said Miss Peecher , as she sat making up her weekly report on a half-holiday afternoon , ` what they call Hexam 's sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 16]: Mary Anne , at her needlework , attendant and attentive , held her arm up .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 7]: ` Well , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 9]: ` She is named Lizzie , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 25]: ` She can hardly be named Lizzie , I think , Mary Anne , ' returned Miss Peecher , in a tunefully instructive voice .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 11]: ` Is Lizzie a Christian name , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 33]: Mary Anne laid down her work , rose , hooked herself behind , as being under catechization , and replied : ` No , it is a corruption , Miss Peecher . '
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 8]: ` Who gave her that name ? '
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 50]: Miss Peecher was going on , from the mere force of habit , when she checked herself ; on Mary Anne 's evincing theological impatience to strike in with her godfathers and her godmothers , and said : ' I mean of what name is it a corruption ? '
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 10]: ` Elizabeth , or Eliza , Miss Peecher . '
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 6]: ` Right , Mary Anne .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 20]: Whether there were any Lizzies in the early Christian Church must be considered very doubtful , very doubtful . '
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 7]: Miss Peecher was exceedingly sage here .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 24]: ` Speaking correctly , we say , then , that Hexam 's sister is called Lizzie ; not that she is named so .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 8]: Do we not , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 8]: ` We do , Miss Peecher . '
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 50]: ` And where , ' pursued Miss Peecher , complacent in her little transparent fiction of conducting the examination in a semiofficial manner for Mary Anne 's benefit , not her own , ` where does this young woman , who is called but not named Lizzie , live ?
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 8]: Think , now , before answering . '
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 15]: ` In Church Street , Smith Square , by Mill Bank , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 30]: ` In Church Street , Smith Square , by Mill Bank , ' repeated Miss Peecher , as if possessed beforehand of the book in which it was written .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 3]: Exactly so .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 12]: And what occupation does this young woman pursue , Mary Anne ?
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 4]: Take time . '
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 18]: ` She has a place of trust at an outfitter 's in the City , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 26]: said Miss Peecher , pondering on it ; but smoothly added , in a confirmatory tone , ` At an outfitter 's in the City .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 3]: Ye-es ? '
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 16]: ` And Charley -- ' Mary Anne was proceeding , when Miss Peecher stared . '
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 9]: I mean Hexam , Miss Peecher . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 9]: I should think you did , Mary Anne .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 8]: I am glad to hear you do .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 58]: And Hexam -- ' ` Says , ' Mary Anne went on , ` that he is not pleased with his sister , and that his sister wo n't be guided by his advice , and persists in being guided by somebody else 's ; and that -- ' ` Mr Headstone coming across the garden ! '
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 12]: exclaimed Miss Peecher , with a flushed glance at the looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 10]: ` You have answered very well , Mary Anne .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 12]: You are forming an excellent habit of arranging your thoughts clearly .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 5]: That will do . '
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 38]: The discreet Mary Anne resumed her seat and her silence , and stitched , and stitched , and was stitching when the schoolmaster 's shadow came in before him , announcing that he might be instantly expected .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 20]: ` Good evening , Miss Peecher , ' he said , pursuing the shadow , and taking its place .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 7]: ` Good evening , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 7]: Mary Anne , a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 15]: ` Thank you , ' said Bradley , seating himself in his constrained manner .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 8]: ` This is but a flying visit .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 20]: I have looked in , on my way , to ask a kindness of you as a neighbour . '
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 12]: ` Did you say on your way , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 4]: asked Miss Peecher .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 12]: ` On my way to -- where I am going . '
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 21]: ` Church Street , Smith Square , by Mill Bank , ' repeated Miss Peecher , in her own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 22]: ` Charley Hexam has gone to get a book or two he wants , and will probably be back before me .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 21]: As we leave my house empty , I took the liberty of telling him I would leave the key here .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 10]: Would you kindly allow me to do so ? '
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 6]: ` Certainly , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 9]: Going for an evening walk , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 14]: ` Partly for a walk , and partly for -- on business . '
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 20]: ` Business in Church Street , Smith Square , by Mill Bank , ' repeated Miss Peecher to herself .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 23]: ` Having said which , ' pursued Bradley , laying his door-key on the table , ' I must be already going .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 13]: There is nothing I can do for you , Miss Peecher ? '
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 5]: In which direction ? '
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 8]: ` In the direction of Westminster . '
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 15]: ` Mill Bank , ' Miss Peecher repeated in her own thoughts once again .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 16]: ` No , thank you , Mr Headstone ; I 'll not trouble you . '
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 12]: ` You could n't trouble me , ' said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 16]: returned Miss Peecher , though not aloud ; ` but you can trouble ME ! '
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 23]: And for all her quiet manner , and her quiet smile , she was full of trouble as he went his way .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 7]: She was right touching his destination .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 46]: He held as straight a course for the house of the dolls ' dressmaker as the wisdom of his ancestors , exemplified in the construction of the intervening streets , would let him , and walked with a bent head hammering at one fixed idea .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 14]: It had been an immoveable idea since he first set eyes upon her .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 54]: It seemed to him as if all that he could suppress in himself he had suppressed , as if all that he could restrain in himself he had restrained , and the time had come -- in a rush , in a moment -- when the power of self-command had departed from him .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 58]: Love at first sight is a trite expression quite sufficiently discussed ; enough that in certain smouldering natures like this man 's , that passion leaps into a blaze , and makes such head as fire does in a rage of wind , when other passions , but for its mastery , could be held in chains .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 81]: As a multitude of weak , imitative natures are always lying by , ready to go mad upon the next wrong idea that may be broached -- in these times , generally some form of tribute to Somebody for something that never was done , or , if ever done , that was done by Somebody Else -- so these less ordinary natures may lie by for years , ready on the touch of an instant to burst into flame .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 29]: The schoolmaster went his way , brooding and brooding , and a sense of being vanquished in a struggle might have been pieced out of his worried face .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 45]: Truly , in his breast there lingered a resentful shame to find himself defeated by this passion for Charley Hexam 's sister , though in the very self-same moments he was concentrating himself upon the object of bringing the passion to a successful issue .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 14]: He appeared before the dolls ' dressmaker , sitting alone at her work .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 4]: ` Oho ! '
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 14]: thought that sharp young personage , ` it 's you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 12]: I know your tricks and your manners , my friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 18]: ` Hexam 's sister , ' said Bradley Headstone , ` is not come home yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 13]: ` You are quite a conjuror , ' returned Miss Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 17]: I will wait , if you please , for I want to speak to her . '
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 5]: ` Do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 4]: returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 4]: ` Sit down .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 7]: I hope it 's mutual . '
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 42]: Bradley glanced distrustfully at the shrewd face again bending over the work , and said , trying to conquer doubt and hesitation : ' I hope you do n't imply that my visit will be unacceptable to Hexam 's sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 6]: Do n't call her that .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 34]: I ca n't bear you to call her that , ' returned Miss Wren , snapping her fingers in a volley of impatient snaps , ` for I do n't like Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 4]: ` Indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 10]: Miss Wren wrinkled her nose , to express dislike .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 3]: ` Selfish .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 5]: Thinks only of himself .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 8]: The way with all of you . '
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 8]: ` The way with all of us ?
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 8]: Then you do n't like ME ? '
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 15]: ` So-so , ' replied Miss Wren , with a shrug and a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 9]: ` Do n't know much about you . '
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 28]: ` But I was not aware it was the way with all of us , ' said Bradley , returning to the accusation , a little injured .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 11]: ` Wo n't you say , some of us ? '
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 18]: ` Meaning , ' returned the little creature , ` every one of you , but you .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 2]: Hah !
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 8]: Now look this lady in the face .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 5]: This is Mrs Truth .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 3]: The Honourable .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 3]: Full-dressed . '
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 46]: Bradley glanced at the doll she held up for his observation -- which had been lying on its face on her bench , while with a needle and thread she fastened the dress on at the back -- and looked from it to her . '
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 83]: I stand the Honourable Mrs T. on my bench in this corner against the wall , where her blue eyes can shine upon you , ' pursued Miss Wren , doing so , and making two little dabs at him in the air with her needle , as if she pricked him with it in his own eyes ; ` and I defy you to tell me , with Mrs T. for a witness , what you have come here for . '
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 8]: ` To see Hexam 's sister . '
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 8]: ` You do n't say so ! '
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 8]: retorted Miss Wren , hitching her chin .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 7]: ` But on whose account ? '
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 6]: ` Her own . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 5]: O Mrs T. ! '
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 6]: ` You hear him ! '
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 32]: ` To reason with her , ' pursued Bradley , half humouring what was present , and half angry with what was not present ; ` for her own sake . '
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 6]: ` Oh Mrs T. ! '
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 4]: exclaimed the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 27]: ` For her own sake , ' repeated Bradley , warming , ` and for her brother 's , and as a perfectly disinterested person . '
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 31]: ` Really , Mrs T. , ' remarked the dressmaker , ` since it comes to this , we must positively turn you with your face to the wall . '
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 46]: She had hardly done so , when Lizzie Hexam arrived , and showed some surprise on seeing Bradley Headstone there , and Jenny shaking her little fist at him close before her eyes , and the Honourable Mrs T. with her face to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 34]: ` Here 's a perfectly disinterested person , Lizzie dear , ' said the knowing Miss Wren , ` come to talk with you , for your own sake and your brother 's .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 4]: Think of that .
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 43]: I am sure there ought to be no third party present at anything so very kind and so very serious ; and so , if you 'll remove the third party upstairs , my dear , the third party will retire . '
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 37]: Lizzie took the hand which the dolls ' dressmaker held out to her for the purpose of being supported away , but only looked at her with an inquiring smile , and made no other movement .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 49]: ` The third party hobbles awfully , you know , when she 's left to herself ; ' said Miss Wren , ` her back being so bad , and her legs so queer ; so she ca n't retire gracefully unless you help her , Lizzie . '
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 31]: ` She can do no better than stay where she is , ' returned Lizzie , releasing the hand , and laying her own lightly on Miss Jenny 's curls .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 12]: And then to Bradley : ` From Charley , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 29]: In an irresolute way , and stealing a clumsy look at her , Bradley rose to place a chair for her , and then returned to his own .
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 32]: ` Strictly speaking , ' said he , ' I come from Charley , because I left him only a little while ago ; but I am not commissioned by Charley .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 9]: I come of my own spontaneous act . '
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 27]: With her elbows on her bench , and her chin upon her hands , Miss Jenny Wren sat looking at him with a watchful sidelong look .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 13]: Lizzie , in her different way , sat looking at him too .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 70]: ` The fact is , ' began Bradley , with a mouth so dry that he had some difficulty in articulating his words : the consciousness of which rendered his manner still more ungainly and undecided ; ` the truth is , that Charley , having no secrets from me -LRB- to the best of my belief -RRB- , has confided the whole of this matter to me . '
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 18]: He came to a stop , and Lizzie asked : ` what matter , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 56]: I thought , ' returned the schoolmaster , stealing another look at her , and seeming to try in vain to sustain it ; for the look dropped as it lighted on her eyes , ` that it might be so superfluous as to be almost impertinent , to enter upon a definition of it .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 37]: My allusion was to this matter of your having put aside your brother 's plans for you , and given the preference to those of Mr -- I believe the name is Mr Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 25]: He made this point of not being certain of the name , with another uneasy look at her , which dropped like the last .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 20]: Nothing being said on the other side , he had to begin again , and began with new embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 18]: ` Your brother 's plans were communicated to me when he first had them in his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 41]: In point of fact he spoke to me about them when I was last here -- when we were walking back together , and when I -- when the impression was fresh upon me of having seen his sister . '
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 38]: There might have been no meaning in it , but the little dressmaker here removed one of her supporting hands from her chin , and musingly turned the Honourable Mrs T. with her face to the company .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 11]: That done , she fell into her former attitude . '
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 58]: I approved of his idea , ' said Bradley , with his uneasy look wandering to the doll , and unconsciously resting there longer than it had rested on Lizzie , ` both because your brother ought naturally to be the originator of any such scheme , and because I hoped to be able to promote it .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 18]: I should have had inexpressible pleasure , I should have taken inexpressible interest , in promoting it .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 16]: Therefore I must acknowledge that when your brother was disappointed , I too was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 15]: I wish to avoid reservation or concealment , and I fully acknowledge that . '
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 12]: He appeared to have encouraged himself by having got so far .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 62]: At all events he went on with much greater firmness and force of emphasis : though with a curious disposition to set his teeth , and with a curious tight-screwing movement of his right hand in the clenching palm of his left , like the action of one who was being physically hurt , and was unwilling to cry out . '
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 16]: I am a man of strong feelings , and I have strongly felt this disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 6]: I do strongly feel it .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 19]: I do n't show what I feel ; some of us are obliged habitually to keep it down .
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 5]: To keep it down .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 7]: But to return to your brother .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 31]: He has taken the matter so much to heart that he has remonstrated -LRB- in my presence he remonstrated -RRB- with Mr Eugene Wrayburn , if that be the name .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 7]: He did so , quite ineffectually .
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 21]: As any one not blinded to the real character of Mr -- Mr Eugene Wrayburn -- would readily suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 11]: He looked at Lizzie again , and held the look .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 28]: And his face turned from burning red to white , and from white back to burning red , and so for the time to lasting deadly white .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 15]: ` Finally , I resolved to come here alone , and appeal to you .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 50]: I resolved to come here alone , and entreat you to retract the course you have chosen , and instead of confiding in a mere stranger -- a person of most insolent behaviour to your brother and others -- to prefer your brother and your brother 's friend . '
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 30]: Lizzie Hexam had changed colour when those changes came over him , and her face now expressed some anger , more dislike , and even a touch of fear .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 8]: But she answered him very steadily . '
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 15]: I can not doubt , Mr Headstone , that your visit is well meant .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 18]: You have been so good a friend to Charley that I have no right to doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 35]: I have nothing to tell Charley , but that I accepted the help to which he so much objects before he made any plans for me ; or certainly before I knew of any .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 27]: It was considerately and delicately offered , and there were reasons that had weight with me which should be as dear to Charley as to me .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 13]: I have no more to say to Charley on this subject . '
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 25]: His lips trembled and stood apart , as he followed this repudiation of himself ; and limitation of her words to her brother . '
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 47]: I should have told Charley , if he had come to me , ' she resumed , as though it were an after-thought , ` that Jenny and I find our teacher very able and very patient , and that she takes great pains with us .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 26]: So much so , that we have said to her we hope in a very little while to be able to go on by ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 32]: Charley knows about teachers , and I should also have told him , for his satisfaction , that ours comes from an institution where teachers are regularly brought up . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 89]: I should like to ask you , ' said Bradley Headstone , grinding his words slowly out , as though they came from a rusty mill ; ' I should like to ask you , if I may without offence , whether you would have objected -- no ; rather , I should like to say , if I may without offence , that I wish I had had the opportunity of coming here with your brother and devoting my poor abilities and experience to your service . '
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 8]: ` Thank you , Mr Headstone . '
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 62]: ` But I fear , ' he pursued , after a pause , furtively wrenching at the seat of his chair with one hand , as if he would have wrenched the chair to pieces , and gloomily observing her while her eyes were cast down , ` that my humble services would not have found much favour with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 22]: She made no reply , and the poor stricken wretch sat contending with himself in a heat of passion and torment .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 15]: After a while he took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead and hands .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 19]: ` There is only one thing more I had to say , but it is the most important .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 24]: There is a reason against this matter , there is a personal relation concerned in this matter , not yet explained to you .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 19]: It might -- I do n't say it would -- it might -- induce you to think differently .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 12]: To proceed under the present circumstances is out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 18]: Will you please come to the understanding that there shall be another interview on the subject ? '
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 8]: ` With Charley , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 15]: ` With -- well , ' he answered , breaking off , ` yes !
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 5]: Say with him too .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 28]: Will you please come to the understanding that there must be another interview under more favourable circumstances , before the whole case can be submitted ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 21]: I do n't , ' said Lizzie , shaking her head , ` understand your meaning , Mr Headstone . '
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 26]: ` Limit my meaning for the present , ' he interrupted , ` to the whole case being submitted to you in another interview . '
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 7]: ` What case , Mr Headstone ?
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 7]: What is wanting to it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 13]: ` You -- you shall be informed in the other interview . '
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 22]: Then he said , as if in a burst of irrepressible despair , ` I -- I leave it all incomplete !
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 11]: There is a spell upon me , I think ! '
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 16]: And then added , almost as if he asked for pity , ` Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 6]: He held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 39]: As she , with manifest hesitation , not to say reluctance , touched it , a strange tremble passed over him , and his face , so deadly white , was moved as by a stroke of pain .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 5]: Then he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 31]: The dolls ' dressmaker sat with her attitude unchanged , eyeing the door by which he had departed , until Lizzie pushed her bench aside and sat down near her .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 47]: Then , eyeing Lizzie as she had previously eyed Bradley and the door , Miss Wren chopped that very sudden and keen chop in which her jaws sometimes indulged , leaned back in her chair with folded arms , and thus expressed herself : ` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 39]: If he -- I mean , of course , my dear , the party who is coming to court me when the time comes -- should be THAT sort of man , he may spare himself the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 12]: HE would n't do to be trotted about and made useful .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 13]: He 'd take fire and blow up while he was about it .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 17]: ` And so you would be rid of him , ' said Lizzie , humouring her .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 10]: ` Not so easily , ' returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 8]: ` He would n't blow up alone .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 8]: He 'd carry me up with him .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 9]: I know his tricks and his manners . '
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 13]: ` Would he want to hurt you , do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 3]: asked Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 38]: ` Might n't exactly want to do it , my dear , ' returned Miss Wren ; ` but a lot of gunpowder among lighted lucifer-matches in the next room might almost as well be here . '
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 15]: ` He is a very strange man , ' said Lizzie , thoughtfully . '
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 23]: I wish he was so very strange a man as to be a total stranger , ' answered the sharp little thing .
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 66]: It being Lizzie 's regular occupation when they were alone of an evening to brush out and smooth the long fair hair of the dolls ' dressmaker , she unfastened a ribbon that kept it back while the little creature was at her work , and it fell in a beautiful shower over the poor shoulders that were much in need of such adorning rain .
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 23]: ` Not now , Lizzie , dear , ' said Jenny ; ` let us have a talk by the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 31]: With those words , she in her turn loosened her friend 's dark hair , and it dropped of its own weight over her bosom , in two rich masses .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 68]: Pretending to compare the colours and admire the contrast , Jenny so managed a mere touch or two of her nimble hands , as that she herself laying a cheek on one of the dark folds , seemed blinded by her own clustering curls to all but the fire , while the fine handsome face and brow of Lizzie were revealed without obstruction in the sombre light .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 18]: ` Let us have a talk , ' said Jenny , ` about Mr Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 59]: Something sparkled down among the fair hair resting on the dark hair ; and if it were not a star -- which it could n't be -- it was an eye ; and if it were an eye , it was Jenny Wren 's eye , bright and watchful as the bird 's whose name she had taken .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 7]: ` Why about Mr Wrayburn ? '
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 3]: Lizzie asked .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 13]: ` For no better reason than because I 'm in the humour .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 8]: I wonder whether he 's rich ! '
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 7]: ` No , not rich . '
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 5]: ` Poor ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 9]: I think so , for a gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 4]: To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 7]: Yes , he 's a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 9]: Not of our sort ; is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 28]: A shake of the head , a thoughtful shake of the head , and the answer , softly spoken , ` Oh no , oh no ! '
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 13]: The dolls ' dressmaker had an arm round her friend 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 39]: Adjusting the arm , she slyly took the opportunity of blowing at her own hair where it fell over her face ; then the eye down there , under lighter shadows sparkled more brightly and appeared more watchful .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 25]: ` When He turns up , he sha n't be a gentleman ; I 'll very soon send him packing , if he is .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 14]: However , he 's not Mr Wrayburn ; I have n't captivated HIM .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 9]: I wonder whether anybody has , Lizzie ! '
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 7]: ` It is very likely . '
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 6]: ` Is it very likely ?
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 5]: I wonder who ! '
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 24]: ` Is it not very likely that some lady has been taken by him , and that he may love her dearly ? '
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 3]: ` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 17]: What would you think of him , Lizzie , if you were a lady ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 5]: I a lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 5]: she repeated , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 6]: ` Such a fancy ! '
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 14]: But say : just as a fancy , and for instance . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 4]: I a lady !
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 15]: I , a poor girl who used to row poor father on the river .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 23]: I , who had rowed poor father out and home on the very night when I saw him for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 22]: I , who was made so timid by his looking at me , that I got up and went out ! '
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 20]: -LRB- ` He did look at you , even that night , though you were not a lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 6]: thought Miss Wren . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 5]: I a lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 15]: Lizzie went on in a low voice , with her eyes upon the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 26]: ` I , with poor father 's grave not even cleared of undeserved stain and shame , and he trying to clear it for me !
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 5]: I a lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 15]: ` Only as a fancy , and for instance , ' urged Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 11]: ` Too much , Jenny , dear , too much !
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 11]: My fancy is not able to get that far . '
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 17]: As the low fire gleamed upon her , it showed her smiling , mournfully and abstractedly .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 37]: ` But I am in the humour , and I must be humoured , Lizzie , because after all I am a poor little thing , and have had a hard day with my bad child .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 32]: Look in the fire , as I like to hear you tell how you used to do when you lived in that dreary old house that had once been a windmill .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 22]: Look in the -- what was its name when you told fortunes with your brother that I DO N'T like ? '
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 9]: ` The hollow down by the flare ? '
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 5]: That 's the name !
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 11]: You can find a lady there , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 17]: ` More easily than I can make one of such material as myself , Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 15]: The sparkling eye looked steadfastly up , as the musing face looked thoughtfully down .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 14]: said the dolls ' dressmaker , ` We have found our lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 13]: Lizzie nodded , and asked , ` Shall she be rich ? '
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 12]: ` She had better be , as he 's poor . '
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 6]: ` She is very rich .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 6]: Shall she be handsome ? '
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 16]: ` Even you can be that , Lizzie , so she ought to be . '
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 7]: ` She is very handsome . '
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 9]: ` What does she say about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 25]: asked Miss Jenny , in a low voice : watchful , through an intervening silence , of the face looking down at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 18]: ` She is glad , glad , to be rich , that he may have the money .
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 18]: She is glad , glad , to be beautiful , that he may be proud of her .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 8]: Her poor heart -- ' ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 5]: Her poor hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 4]: said Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 15]: ` Her heart -- is given him , with all its love and truth .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 17]: She would joyfully die with him , or , better than that , die for him .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 39]: She knows he has failings , but she thinks they have grown up through his being like one cast away , for the want of something to trust in , and care for , and think well of .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 83]: And she says , that lady rich and beautiful that I can never come near , `` Only put me in that empty place , only try how little I mind myself , only prove what a world of things I will do and bear for you , and I hope that you might even come to be much better than you are , through me who am so much worse , and hardly worth the thinking of beside you . '' '
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 46]: As the face looking at the fire had become exalted and forgetful in the rapture of these words , the little creature , openly clearing away her fair hair with her disengaged hand , had gazed at it with earnest attention and something like alarm .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 29]: Now that the speaker ceased , the little creature laid down her head again , and moaned , ' O me , O me , O me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 8]: ` In pain , dear Jenny ? '
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 7]: asked Lizzie , as if awakened .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 9]: ` Yes , but not the old pain .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 8]: Lay me down , lay me down .
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 9]: Do n't go out of my sight to-night .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 9]: Lock the door and keep close to me .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 22]: Then turning away her face , she said in a whisper to herself , ` My Lizzie , my poor Lizzie !
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 22]: O my blessed children , come back in the long bright slanting rows , and come for her , not me .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 12]: She wants help more than I , my blessed children ! '
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 35]: She had stretched her hands up with that higher and better look , and now she turned again , and folded them round Lizzie 's neck , and rocked herself on Lizzie 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 67]: Chapter 12 MORE BIRDS OF PREY Rogue Riderhood dwelt deep and dark in Limehouse Hole , among the riggers , and the mast , oar and block makers , and the boatbuilders , and the sail-lofts , as in a kind of ship 's hold stored full of waterside characters , some no better than himself , some very much better , and none much worse .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 57]: The Hole , albeit in a general way not over nice in its choice of company , was rather shy in reference to the honour of cultivating the Rogue 's acquaintance ; more frequently giving him the cold shoulder than the warm hand , and seldom or never drinking with him unless at his own expense .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 33]: A part of the Hole , indeed , contained so much public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage could move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 35]: But , there may have been the drawback on this magnanimous morality , that its exponents held a true witness before Justice to be the next unneighbourly and accursed character to a false one .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 35]: Had it not been for the daughter whom he often mentioned , Mr Riderhood might have found the Hole a mere grave as to any means it would yield him of getting a living .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 14]: But Miss Pleasant Riderhood had some little position and connection in Limehouse Hole .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 37]: Upon the smallest of small scales , she was an unlicensed pawnbroker , keeping what was popularly called a Leaving Shop , by lending insignificant sums on insignificant articles of property deposited with her as security .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 20]: In her four-and-twentieth year of life , Pleasant was already in her fifth year of this way of trade .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 67]: Her deceased mother had established the business , and on that parent 's demise she had appropriated a secret capital of fifteen shillings to establishing herself in it ; the existence of such capital in a pillow being the last intelligible confidential communication made to her by the departed , before succumbing to dropsical conditions of snuff and gin , incompatible equally with coherence and existence .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 23]: Why christened Pleasant , the late Mrs Riderhood might possibly have been at some time able to explain , and possibly not .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 9]: Her daughter had no information on that point .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 12]: Pleasant she found herself , and she could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 28]: She had not been consulted on the question , any more than on the question of her coming into these terrestrial parts , to want a name .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 37]: Similarly , she found herself possessed of what is colloquially termed a swivel eye -LRB- derived from her father -RRB- , which she might perhaps have declined if her sentiments on the subject had been taken .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 27]: She was not otherwise positively ill-looking , though anxious , meagre , of a muddy complexion , and looking as old again as she really was .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 56]: As some dogs have it in the blood , or are trained , to worry certain creatures to a certain point , so -- not to make the comparison disrespectfially -- Pleasant Riderhood had it in the blood , or had been trained , to regard seamen , within certain limits , as her prey .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 19]: Show her a man in a blue jacket , and , figuratively speaking , she pinned him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 18]: Yet , all things considered , she was not of an evil mind or an unkindly disposition .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 17]: For , observe how many things were to be considered according to her own unfortunate experience .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 25]: Show Pleasant Riderhood a Wedding in the street , and she only saw two people taking out a regular licence to quarrel and fight .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 68]: Show her a Christening , and she saw a little heathen personage having a quite superfluous name bestowed upon it , inasmuch as it would be commonly addressed by some abusive epithet : which little personage was not in the least wanted by anybody , and would be shoved and banged out of everybody 's way , until it should grow big enough to shove and bang .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 44]: Show her a Funeral , and she saw an unremunerative ceremony in the nature of a black masquerade , conferring a temporary gentility on the performers , at an immense expense , and representing the only formal party ever given by the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 57]: Show her a live father , and she saw but a duplicate of her own father , who from her infancy had been taken with fits and starts of discharging his duty to her , which duty was always incorporated in the form of a fist or a leathern strap , and being discharged hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 16]: All things considered , therefore , Pleasant Riderhood was not so very , very bad .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 104]: There was even a touch of romance in her -- of such romance as could creep into Limehouse Hole -- and maybe sometimes of a summer evening , when she stood with folded arms at her shopdoor , looking from the reeking street to the sky where the sun was setting , she may have had some vaporous visions of far-off islands in the southern seas or elsewhere -LRB- not being geographically particular -RRB- , where it would be good to roam with a congenial partner among groves of bread-fruit , waiting for ships to be wafted from the hollow ports of civilization .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 18]: For , sailors to be got the better of , were essential to Miss Pleasant 's Eden .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 34]: Not on a summer evening did she come to her little shop-door , when a certain man standing over against the house on the opposite side of the street took notice of her .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 12]: That was on a cold shrewd windy evening , after dark .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 44]: Pleasant Riderhood shared with most of the lady inhabitants of the Hole , the peculiarity that her hair was a ragged knot , constantly coming down behind , and that she never could enter upon any undertaking without first twisting it into place .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 31]: At that particular moment , being newly come to the threshold to take a look out of doors , she was winding herself up with both hands after this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 58]: And so prevalent was the fashion , that on the occasion of a fight or other disturbance in the Hole , the ladies would be seen flocking from all quarters universally twisting their back-hair as they came along , and many of them , in the hurry of the moment , carrying their back-combs in their mouths .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 34]: It was a wretched little shop , with a roof that any man standing in it could touch with his hand ; little better than a cellar or cave , down three steps .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 69]: Yet in its ill-lighted window , among a flaring handkerchief or two , an old peacoat or so , a few valueless watches and compasses , a jar of tobacco and two crossed pipes , a bottle of walnut ketchup , and some horrible sweets these creature discomforts serving as a blind to the main business of the Leaving Shop -- was displayed the inscription SEAMAN 'S BOARDING-HOUSE .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 29]: Taking notice of Pleasant Riderhood at the door , the man crossed so quickly that she was still winding herself up , when he stood close before her .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 8]: ` Is your father at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 4]: said he . '
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 18]: I think he is , ' returned Pleasant , dropping her arms ; ` come in . '
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 13]: It was a tentative reply , the man having a seafaring appearance .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 12]: Her father was not at home , and Pleasant knew it .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 31]: ` Take a seat by the fire , ' were her hospitable words when she had got him in ; ` men of your calling are always welcome here . '
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 8]: ` Thankee , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 25]: His manner was the manner of a sailor , and his hands were the hands of a sailor , except that they were smooth .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 92]: Pleasant had an eye for sailors , and she noticed the unused colour and texture of the hands , sunburnt though they were , as sharply as she noticed their unmistakable loosneness and suppleness , as he sat himself down with his left arm carelessly thrown across his left leg a little above the knee , and the right arm as carelessly thrown over the elbow of the wooden chair , with the hand curved , half open and half shut , as if it had just let go a rope .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 10]: ` Might you be looking for a Boarding-House ? '
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 15]: Pleasant inquired , taking her observant stand on one side of the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 14]: I do n't rightly know my plans yet , ' returned the man .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 11]: ` You ai n't looking for a Leaving Shop ? '
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 8]: ` No , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 21]: ` No , ' assented Pleasant , ` you 've got too much of an outfit on you for that .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 12]: But if you should want either , this is both . '
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 6]: ` Ay , ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 10]: said the man , glancing round the place . '
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 3]: I know .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 7]: I 've been here before . '
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 12]: ` Did you Leave anything when you were here before ? '
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 11]: asked Pleasant , with a view to principal and interest .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 7]: The man shook his head . '
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 10]: I am pretty sure you never boarded here ? '
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 7]: The man again shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 13]: ` What DID you do here when you were here before ? '
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 3]: asked Pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 9]: ` For I do n't remember you . '
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 10]: ` It 's not at all likely you should .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 29]: I only stood at the door , one night -- on the lower step there -- while a shipmate of mine looked in to speak to your father .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 7]: I remember the place well . '
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 6]: Looking very curiously round it .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 9]: ` Might that have been long ago ? '
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 8]: ` Ay , a goodish bit ago .
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 9]: When I came off my last voyage . '
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 11]: ` Then you have not been to sea lately ? '
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 14]: Been in the sick bay since then , and been employed ashore . '
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 14]: ` Then , to be sure , that accounts for your hands . '
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 21]: The man with a keen look , a quick smile , and a change of manner , caught her up .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 7]: ` You 're a good observer .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 7]: That accounts for my hands . '
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 13]: Pleasant was somewhat disquieted by his look , and returned it suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 40]: Not only was his change of manner , though very sudden , quite collected , but his former manner , which he resumed , had a certain suppressed confidence and sense of power in it that were half threatening .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 8]: ` Will your father be long ? '
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 4]: he inquired . '
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 6]: I ca n't say . '
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 19]: ` As you supposed he was at home , it would seem that he has just gone out ?
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 6]: How 's that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 11]: I supposed he had come home , ' Pleasant explained .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 7]: You supposed he had come home ?
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 8]: Then he has been some time out ?
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 6]: How 's that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 8]: I do n't want to deceive you .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 10]: Father 's on the river in his boat . '
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 7]: ` At the old work ? '
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 5]: asked the man . '
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 17]: I do n't know what you mean , ' said Pleasant , shrinking a step back .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 9]: ` What on earth d'ye want ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 9]: I do n't want to hurt your father .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 13]: I do n't want to say I might , if I chose .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 7]: I want to speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 8]: Not much in that , is there ?
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 13]: There shall be no secrets from you ; you shall be by .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 21]: And plainly , Miss Riderhood , there 's nothing to be got out of me , or made of me .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 36]: I am not good for the Leaving Shop , I am not good for the Boarding-House , I am not good for anything in your way to the extent of sixpenn ` orth of halfpence .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 13]: Put the idea aside , and we shall get on together . '
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 9]: ` But you 're a seafaring man ? '
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 20]: argued Pleasant , as if that were a sufficient reason for his being good for something in her way .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 5]: ` Yes and no .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 10]: I have been , and I may be again .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 7]: But I am not for you .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 10]: Wo n't you take my word for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 17]: The conversation had arrived at a crisis to justify Miss Pleasant 's hair in tumbling down .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 21]: It tumbled down accordingly , and she twisted it up , looking from under her bent forehead at the man .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 67]: In taking stock of his familiarly worn rough-weather nautical clothes , piece by piece , she took stock of a formidable knife in a sheath at his waist ready to his hand , and of a whistle hanging round his neck , and of a short jagged knotted club with a loaded head that peeped out of a pocket of his loose outer jacket or frock .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 33]: He sat quietly looking at her ; but , with these appendages partially revealing themselves , and with a quantity of bristling oakumcoloured head and whisker , he had a formidable appearance .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 11]: ` Wo n't you take my word for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 4]: he asked again .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 8]: Pleasant answered with a short dumb nod .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 8]: He rejoined with another short dumb nod .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 39]: Then he got up and stood with his arms folded , in front of the fire , looking down into it occasionally , as she stood with her arms folded , leaning against the side of the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 32]: ` To wile away the time till your father comes , ' he said , -- ` pray is there much robbing and murdering of seamen about the water-side now ? '
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 4]: ` Any ? '
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 18]: ` Complaints of that sort are sometimes made , about Ratcliffe and Wapping and up that way .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 9]: But who knows how many are true ? '
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 5]: ` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 8]: And it do n't seem necessary . '
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 11]: ` That 's what I say , ' observed Pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 8]: ` Where 's the reason for it ?
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 21]: Bless the sailors , it ai n't as if they ever could keep what they have , without it . '
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 5]: ` You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 18]: Their money may be soon got out of them , without violence , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 20]: ` Of course it may , ' said Pleasant ; ` and then they ship again and get more .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 23]: And the best thing for 'em , too , to ship again as soon as ever they can be brought to it .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 13]: They 're never so well off as when they 're afloat . '
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 21]: ` I 'll tell you why I ask , ' pursued the visitor , looking up from the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 14]: I was once beset that way myself , and left for dead . '
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 3]: said Pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 7]: ` Where did it happen ? '
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 47]: ` It happened , ' returned the man , with a ruminative air , as he drew his right hand across his chin , and dipped the other in the pocket of his rough outer coat , ` it happened somewhere about here as I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 14]: I do n't think it can have been a mile from here . '
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 6]: ` Were you drunk ? '
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 4]: asked Pleasant . '
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 10]: I was muddled , but not with fair drinking .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 9]: I had not been drinking , you understand .
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 6]: A mouthful did it . '
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 20]: Pleasant with a grave look shook her head ; importing that she understood the process , but decidedly disapproved .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 17]: ` Fair trade is one thing , ' said she , ` but that 's another .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 15]: No one has a right to carry on with Jack in THAT way . '
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 39]: ` The sentiment does you credit , ' returned the man , with a grim smile ; and added , in a mutter , ` the more so , as I believe it 's not your father 's .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 14]: -- Yes , I had a bad time of it , that time .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 19]: I lost everything , and had a sharp struggle for my life , weak as I was . '
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 9]: ` Did you get the parties punished ? '
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 4]: asked Pleasant . '
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 24]: A tremendous punishment followed , ' said the man , more seriously ; ` but it was not of my bringing about . '
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 7]: ` Of whose , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 3]: asked Pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 28]: The man pointed upward with his forefinger , and , slowly recovering that hand , settled his chin in it again as he looked at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 29]: Bringing her inherited eye to bear upon him , Pleasant Riderhood felt more and more uncomfortable , his manner was so mysterious , so stern , so self-possessed .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 20]: ` Anyways , ' said the damsel , ' I am glad punishment followed , and I say so .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 14]: Fair trade with seafaring men gets a bad name through deeds of violence .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 21]: I am as much against deeds of violence being done to seafaring men , as seafaring men can be themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 16]: I am of the same opinion as my mother was , when she was living .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 17]: Fair trade , my mother used to say , but no robbery and no blows . '
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 86]: In the way of trade Miss Pleasant would have taken -- and indeed did take when she could -- as much as thirty shillings a week for board that would be dear at five , and likewise conducted the Leaving business upon correspondingly equitable principles ; yet she had that tenderness of conscience and those feelings of humanity , that the moment her ideas of trade were overstepped , she became the seaman 's champion , even against her father whom she seldom otherwise resisted .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 21]: But , she was here interrupted by her father 's voice exclaiming angrily , ` Now , Poll Parrot ! '
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 17]: and by her father 's hat being heavily flung from his hand and striking her face .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 34]: Accustomed to such occasional manifestations of his sense of parental duty , Pleasant merely wiped her face on her hair -LRB- which of course had tumbled down -RRB- before she twisted it up .
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 23]: This was another common procedure on the part of the ladies of the Hole , when heated by verbal or fistic altercation .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 18]: ` Blest if I believe such a Poll Parrot as you was ever learned to speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 44]: growled Mr Riderhood , stooping to pick up his hat , and making a feint at her with his head and right elbow ; for he took the delicate subject of robbing seamen in extraordinary dudgeon , and was out of humour too .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 9]: ` What are you Poll Parroting at now ?
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 20]: Ai n't you got nothing to do but fold your arms and stand a Poll Parroting all night ? '
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 10]: ` Let her alone , ' urged the man .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 9]: ` She was only speaking to me . '
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 7]: ` Let her alone too ! '
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 9]: retorted Mr Riderhood , eyeing him all over .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 10]: ` Do you know she 's my daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 21]: ` And do n't you know that I wo n't have no Poll Parroting on the part of my daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 16]: No , nor yet that I wo n't take no Poll Parroting from no man ?
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 13]: And who may YOU be , and what may YOU want ? '
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 12]: ` How can I tell you until you are silent ? '
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 5]: returned the other fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 25]: ` Well , ' said Mr Riderhood , quailing a little , ' I am willing to be silent for the purpose of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 8]: But do n't Poll Parrot me . '
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 8]: ` Are you thirsty , you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 16]: the man asked , in the same fierce short way , after returning his look .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 19]: ` Why nat ` rally , ' said Mr Riderhood , ` ai n't I always thirsty ! '
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 10]: -LRB- Indignant at the absurdity of the question . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 7]: ` What will you drink ? '
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 4]: demanded the man .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 24]: ` Sherry wine , ' returned Mr Riderhood , in the same sharp tone , ` if you 're capable of it . '
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 29]: The man put his hand in his pocket , took out half a sovereign , and begged the favour of Miss Pleasant that she would fetch a bottle .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 17]: ` With the cork undrawn , ' he added , emphatically , looking at her father .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 27]: ` I 'll take my Alfred David , ' muttered Mr Riderhood , slowly relaxing into a dark smile , ` that you know a move .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 5]: Do I know YOU ?
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 13]: N -- n -- no , I do n't know you . '
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 14]: The man replied , ` No , you do n't know me . '
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 16]: And so they stood looking at one another surlily enough , until Pleasant came back .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 16]: ` There 's small glasses on the shelf , ' said Riderhood to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 9]: ` Give me the one without a foot .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 20]: I gets my living by the sweat of my brow , and it 's good enough for ME . '
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 55]: This had a modest selfdenying appearance ; but it soon turned out that as , by reason of the impossibility of standing the glass upright while there was anything in it , it required to be emptied as soon as filled , Mr Riderhood managed to drink in the proportion of three to one .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 43]: With his Fortunatus 's goblet ready in his hand , Mr Riderhood sat down on one side of the table before the fire , and the strange man on the other : Pleasant occupying a stool between the latter and the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 89]: The background , composed of handkerchiefs , coats , shirts , hats , and other old articles ` On Leaving , ' had a general dim resemblance to human listeners ; especially where a shiny black sou ` wester suit and hat hung , looking very like a clumsy mariner with his back to the company , who was so curious to overhear , that he paused for the purpose with his coat half pulled on , and his shoulders up to his ears in the uncompleted action .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 22]: The visitor first held the bottle against the light of the candle , and next examined the top of the cork .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 32]: Satisfied that it had not been tampered with , he slowly took from his breastpocket a rusty claspknife , and , with a corkscrew in the handle , opened the wine .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 46]: That done , he looked at the cork , unscrewed it from the corkscrew , laid each separately on the table , and , with the end of the sailor 's knot of his neckerchief , dusted the inside of the neck of the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 6]: All this with great deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 28]: At first Riderhood had sat with his footless glass extended at arm 's length for filling , while the very deliberate stranger seemed absorbed in his preparations .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 27]: But , gradually his arm reverted home to him , and his glass was lowered and lowered until he rested it upside down upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 12]: By the same degrees his attention became concentrated on the knife .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 37]: And now , as the man held out the bottle to fill all round , Riderhood stood up , leaned over the table to look closer at the knife , and stared from it to him .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 4]: asked the man .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 9]: ` Why , I know that knife ! '
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 10]: ` Yes , I dare say you do . '
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 14]: He motioned to him to hold up his glass , and filled it .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 11]: Riderhood emptied it to the last drop and began again .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 17]: ` That there knife -- ' ` Stop , ' said the man , composedly . '
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 9]: I was going to drink to your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 7]: Your health , Miss Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 14]: ` That knife was the knife of a seaman named George Radfoot . '
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 5]: ` It was . '
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 10]: ` That seaman was well beknown to me . '
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 5]: ` He was . '
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 8]: ` What 's come to him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 7]: ` Death has come to him .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 9]: Death came to him in an ugly shape .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 15]: He looked , ' said the man , ` very horrible after it . '
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 5]: ` Arter what ? '
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 8]: said Riderhood , with a frowning stare .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 7]: ` After he was killed . '
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 3]: ` Killed ?
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 5]: Who killed him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 27]: Only answering with a shrug , the man filled the footless glass , and Riderhood emptied it : looking amazedly from his daughter to his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 35]: ` You do n't mean to tell a honest man -- ' he was recommencing with his empty glass in his hand , when his eye became fascinated by the stranger 's outer coat .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 57]: He leaned across the table to see it nearer , touched the sleeve , turned the cuff to look at the sleevelining -LRB- the man , in his perfect composure , offering not the least objection -RRB- , and exclaimed , ` It 's my belief as this here coat was George Radfoot 's too ! '
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 5]: ` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 26]: He wore it the last time you ever saw him , and the last time you ever will see him -- in this world . '
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 18]: ` It 's my belief you mean to tell me to my face you killed him ! '
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 15]: exclaimed Riderhood ; but , nevertheless , allowing his glass to be filled again .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 15]: The man only answered with another shrug , and showed no symptom of confusion .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 18]: ` Wish I may die if I know what to be up to with this chap ! '
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 17]: said Riderhood , after staring at him , and tossing his last glassful down his throat .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 10]: ` Let 's know what to make of you .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 6]: Say something plain . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 22]: I will , ' returned the other , leaning forward across the table , and speaking in a low impressive voice .
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 8]: ` What a liar you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 20]: The honest witness rose , and made as though he would fling his glass in the man 's face .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 35]: The man not wincing , and merely shaking his forefinger half knowingly , half menacingly , the piece of honesty thought better of it and sat down again , putting the glass down too .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 48]: ` And when you went to that lawyer yonder in the Temple with that invented story , ' said the stranger , in an exasperatingly comfortable sort of confidence , ` you might have had your strong suspicions of a friend of your own , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 9]: I think you had , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 5]: ` Me my suspicions ?
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 5]: Of what friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 10]: ` Tell me again whose knife was this ? '
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 4]: demanded the man .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 33]: ` It was possessed by , and was the property of -- him as I have made mention on , ' said Riderhood , stupidly evading the actual mention of the name .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 10]: ` Tell me again whose coat was this ? '
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 33]: ` That there article of clothing likeways belonged to , and was wore by -- him as I have made mention on , ' was again the dull Old Bailey evasion . '
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 21]: I suspect that you gave him the credit of the deed , and of keeping cleverly out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 13]: But there was small cleverness in HIS keeping out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 22]: The cleverness would have been , to have got back for one single instant to the light of the sun . '
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 92]: ` Things is come to a pretty pass , ' growled Mr Riderhood , rising to his feet , goaded to stand at bay , ` when bullyers as is wearing dead men 's clothes , and bullyers as is armed with dead men 's knives , is to come into the houses of honest live men , getting their livings by the sweats of their brows , and is to make these here sort of charges with no rhyme and no reason , neither the one nor yet the other !
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 11]: Why should I have had my suspicions of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 79]: ` Because you knew him , ' replied the man ; ` because you had been one with him , and knew his real character under a fair outside ; because on the night which you had afterwards reason to believe to be the very night of the murder , he came in here , within an hour of his having left his ship in the docks , and asked you in what lodgings he could find room .
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 8]: Was there no stranger with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 20]: ` I 'll take my world-without-end everlasting Alfred David that you war n't with him , ' answered Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 20]: ` You talk big , you do , but things look pretty black against yourself , to my thinking .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 20]: You charge again ' me that George Radfoot got lost sight of , and was no more thought of .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 7]: What 's that for a sailor ?
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 58]: Why there 's fifty such , out of sight and out of mind , ten times as long as him -- through entering in different names , re-shipping when the out ` ard voyage is made , and what not -- a turning up to light every day about here , and no matter made of it .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 4]: Ask my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 27]: You could go on Poll Parroting enough with her , when I war n't come in : Poll Parrot a little with her on this pint .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 10]: You and your suspicions of my suspicions of him !
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 7]: What are my suspicions of you ?
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 8]: You tell me George Radfoot got killed .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 12]: I ask you who done it and how you know it .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 10]: You carry his knife and you wear his coat .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 9]: I ask you how you come by 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 7]: Hand over that there bottle ! '
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 17]: Here Mr Riderhood appeared to labour under a virtuous delusion that it was his own property .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 46]: ` And you , ' he added , turning to his daughter , as he filled the footless glass , ` if it war n't wasting good sherry wine on you , I 'd chuck this at you , for Poll Parroting with this man .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 44]: It 's along of Poll Parroting that such like as him gets their suspicions , whereas I gets mine by argueyment , and being nat ` rally a honest man , and sweating away at the brow as a honest man ought . '
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 68]: Here he filled the footless goblet again , and stood chewing one half of its contents and looking down into the other as he slowly rolled the wine about in the glass ; while Pleasant , whose sympathetic hair had come down on her being apostrophised , rearranged it , much in the style of the tail of a horse when proceeding to market to be sold .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 3]: ` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 5]: Have you finished ? '
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 5]: asked the strange man .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Riderhood , ' I ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 3]: Now then !
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 21]: I want to know how George Radfoot come by his death , and how you come by his kit ? '
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 14]: ` If you ever do know , you wo n't know now . '
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 31]: ` And next I want to know , ' proceeded Riderhood ` whether you mean to charge that what-you-may-call-it-murder -- ' ` Harmon murder , father , ' suggested Pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 6]: ` No Poll Parroting ! '
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 6]: he vociferated , in return .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 6]: ` Keep your mouth shut !
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 20]: -- I want to know , you sir , whether you charge that there crime on George Radfoot ? '
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 14]: ` If you ever do know , you wo n't know now . '
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 8]: ` Perhaps you done it yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 9]: said Riderhood , with a threatening action . '
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 21]: I alone know , ' returned the man , sternly shaking his head , ` the mysteries of that crime .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 13]: I alone know that your trumped-up story can not possibly be true .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 21]: I alone know that it must be altogether false , and that you must know it to be altogether false .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 19]: I come here to-night to tell you so much of what I know , and no more . '
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 33]: Mr Riderhood , with his crooked eye upon his visitor , meditated for some moments , and then refilled his glass , and tipped the contents down his throat in three tips .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 6]: ` Shut the shop-door ! '
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 13]: he then said to his daughter , putting the glass suddenly down .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 10]: ` And turn the key and stand by it !
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 34]: If you know all this , you sir , ' getting , as he spoke , between the visitor and the door , ` why ha n't you gone to Lawyer Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 17]: ` That , also , is alone known to myself , ' was the cool answer .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 31]: ` Do n't you know that , if you did n't do the deed , what you say you could tell is worth from five to ten thousand pound ? '
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 4]: asked Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 18]: I know it very well , and when I claim the money you shall share it . '
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 23]: The honest man paused , and drew a little nearer to the visitor , and a little further from the door . '
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 69]: I know it , ' repeated the man , quietly , ` as well as I know that you and George Radfoot were one together in more than one dark business ; and as well as I know that you , Roger Riderhood , conspired against an innocent man for blood-money ; and as well as I know that I can -- and that I swear I will !
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 25]: -- give you up on both scores , and be the proof against you in my own person , if you defy me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 4]: ` Father ! '
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 7]: cried Pleasant , from the door .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 6]: ` Do n't defy him !
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 5]: Give way to him !
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 10]: Do n't get into more trouble , father ! '
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 14]: ` Will you leave off a Poll Parroting , I ask you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 11]: cried Mr Riderhood , half beside himself between the two .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 10]: Then , propitiatingly and crawlingly : ` You sir !
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 10]: You ha n't said what you want of me .
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 28]: Is it fair , is it worthy of yourself , to talk of my defying you afore ever you say what you want of me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 11]: I do n't want much , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 15]: ` This accusation of yours must not be left half made and half unmade .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 12]: What was done for the blood-money must be thoroughly undone . '
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 19]: ` Well ; but Shipmate -- ' ` Do n't call me Shipmate , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 13]: ` Captain , then , ' urged Mr Riderhood ; ` there !
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 7]: You wo n't object to Captain .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 12]: It 's a honourable title , and you fully look it .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 2]: Captain !
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 6]: Ai n't the man dead ?
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 6]: Now I ask you fair .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 6]: Ai n't Gaffer dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 18]: ` Well , ' returned the other , with impatience , ` yes , he is dead .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 4]: What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 10]: ` Can words hurt a dead man , Captain ?
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 7]: I only ask you fair . '
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 19]: ` They can hurt the memory of a dead man , and they can hurt his living children .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 8]: How many children had this man ? '
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 7]: ` Meaning Gaffer , Captain ? '
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 9]: ` Of whom else are we speaking ? '
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 37]: returned the other , with a movement of his foot , as if Rogue Riderhood were beginning to sneak before him in the body as well as the spirit , and he spurned him off . '
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 11]: I have heard of a daughter , and a son .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 17]: I ask for information ; I ask YOUR daughter ; I prefer to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 7]: What children did Hexam leave ? '
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 30]: Pleasant , looking to her father for permission to reply , that honest man exclaimed with great bitterness : ` Why the devil do n't you answer the Captain ?
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 19]: You can Poll Parrot enough when you ai n't wanted to Poll Parrot , you perwerse jade ! '
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 20]: Thus encouraged , Pleasant explained that there were only Lizzie , the daughter in question , and the youth .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 7]: Both very respectable , she added .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 38]: ` It is dreadful that any stigma should attach to them , ' said the visitor , whom the consideration rendered so uneasy that he rose , and paced to and fro , muttering , ` Dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 2]: Unforeseen ?
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 7]: How could it be foreseen ! '
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 15]: Then he stopped , and asked aloud : ` Where do they live ? '
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 31]: Pleasant further explained that only the daughter had resided with the father at the time of his accidental death , and that she had immediately afterwards quitted the neighbourhood . '
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 28]: I know that , ' said the man , ` for I have been to the place they dwelt in , at the time of the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 13]: Could you quietly find out for me where she lives now ? '
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 9]: Pleasant had no doubt she could do that .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 8]: Within what time , did she think ?
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 4]: Within a day .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 21]: The visitor said that was well , and he would return for the information , relying on its being obtained .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 17]: To this dialogue Riderhood had attended in silence , and he now obsequiously bespake the Captain .
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 3]: ` Captain !
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 36]: Mentioning them unfort ` net words of mine respecting Gaffer , it is contrairily to be bore in mind that Gaffer always were a precious rascal , and that his line were a thieving line .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 79]: Likeways when I went to them two Governors , Lawyer Lightwood and the t ` other Governor , with my information , I may have been a little over-eager for the cause of justice , or -LRB- to put it another way -RRB- a little over-stimilated by them feelings which rouses a man up , when a pot of money is going about , to get his hand into that pot of money for his family 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 33]: Besides which , I think the wine of them two Governors was -- I will not say a hocussed wine , but fur from a wine as was elthy for the mind .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 11]: And there 's another thing to be remembered , Captain .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 42]: Did I stick to them words when Gaffer was no more , and did I say bold to them two Governors , `` Governors both , wot I informed I still inform ; wot was took down I hold to '' ?
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 15]: I says , frank and open -- no shuffling , mind you , Captain !
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 50]: -- `` I may have been mistook , I 've been a thinking of it , it may n't have been took down correct on this and that , and I wo n't swear to thick and thin , I 'd rayther forfeit your good opinions than do it .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 55]: And so far as I know , ' concluded Mr Riderhood , by way of proof and evidence to character , ' I HAVE actiwally forfeited the good opinions of several persons -- even your own , Captain , if I understand your words -- but I 'd sooner do it than be forswore .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 12]: There ; if that 's conspiracy , call me conspirator . '
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 36]: ` You shall sign , ' said the visitor , taking very little heed of this oration , ' a statement that it was all utterly false , and the poor girl shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 16]: I will bring it with me for your signature , when I come again . '
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 10]: ` When might you be expected , Captain ? '
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 11]: inquired Riderhood , again dubiously getting between him and door .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 7]: ` Quite soon enough for you .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 12]: I shall not disappoint you ; do n't be afraid . '
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 13]: ` Might you be inclined to leave any name , Captain ? '
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 7]: ` No , not at all .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 8]: I have no such intention . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 31]: `` Shall '' is summ ` at of a hard word , Captain , ' urged Riderhood , still feebly dodging between him and the door , as he advanced .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 32]: ` When you say a man `` shall '' sign this and that and t ` other , Captain , you order him about in a grand sort of a way .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 9]: Do n't it seem so to yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 13]: The man stood still , and angrily fixed him with his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 6]: ` Father , father ! '
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 21]: entreated Pleasant , from the door , with her disengaged hand nervously trembling at her lips ; ` do n't !
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 9]: Do n't get into trouble any more ! '
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 11]: ` Hear me out , Captain , hear me out !
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 40]: All I was wishing to mention , Captain , afore you took your departer , ' said the sneaking Mr Riderhood , falling out of his path , ` was , your handsome words relating to the reward . '
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 38]: ` When I claim it , ' said the man , in a tone which seemed to leave some such words as ` you dog , ' very distinctly understood , ` you shall share it . '
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 39]: Looking stedfastly at Riderhood , he once more said in a low voice , this time with a grim sort of admiration of him as a perfect piece of evil , ` What a liar you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 18]: and , nodding his head twice or thrice over the compliment , passed out of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 9]: But , to Pleasant he said good-night kindly .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 35]: The honest man who gained his living by the sweat of his brow remained in a state akin to stupefaction , until the footless glass and the unfinished bottle conveyed themselves into his mind .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 22]: From his mind he conveyed them into his hands , and so conveyed the last of the wine into his stomach .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 22]: When that was done , he awoke to a clear perception that Poll Parroting was solely chargeable with what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 42]: Therefore , not to be remiss in his duty as a father , he threw a pair of sea-boots at Pleasant , which she ducked to avoid , and then cried , poor thing , using her hair for a pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 38]: Chapter 13 A SOLO AND A DUETT The wind was blowing so hard when the visitor came out at the shop-door into the darkness and dirt of Limehouse Hole , that it almost blew him in again .
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 34]: Doors were slamming violently , lamps were flickering or blown out , signs were rocking in their frames , the water of the kennels , wind-dispersed , flew about in drops like rain .
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 29]: Indifferent to the weather , and even preferring it to better weather for its clearance of the streets , the man looked about him with a scrutinizing glance .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 11]: ` Thus much I know , ' he murmured . '
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 23]: I have never been here since that night , and never was here before that night , but thus much I recognize .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 15]: I wonder which way did we take when we came out of that shop .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 17]: We turned to the right as I have turned , but I can recall no more .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 7]: Did we go by this alley ?
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 7]: Or down that little lane ? '
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 21]: He tried both , but both confused him equally , and he came straying back to the same spot . '
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 46]: I remember there were poles pushed out of upper windows on which clothes were drying , and I remember a low public-house , and the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to it of the scraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 20]: But here are all these things in the lane , and here are all these things in the alley .
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 26]: And I have nothing else in my mind but a wall , a dark doorway , a flight of stairs , and a room . '
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 27]: He tried a new direction , but made nothing of it ; walls , dark doorways , flights of stairs and rooms , were too abundant .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 28]: And , like most people so puzzled , he again and again described a circle , and found himself at the point from which he had begun .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 56]: ` This is like what I have read in narratives of escape from prison , ' said he , ` where the little track of the fugitives in the night always seems to take the shape of the great round world , on which they wander ; as if it were a secret law . '
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 52]: Here he ceased to be the oakum-headed , oakum-whiskered man on whom Miss Pleasant Riderhood had looked , and , allowing for his being still wrapped in a nautical overcoat , became as like that same lost wanted Mr Julius Handford , as never man was like another in this world .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 37]: In the breast of the coat he stowed the bristling hair and whisker , in a moment , as the favouring wind went with him down a solitary place that it had swept clear of passengers .
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 16]: Yet in that same moment he was the Secretary also , Mr Boffin 's Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 27]: For John Rokesmith , too , was as like that same lost wanted Mr Julius Handford as never man was like another in this world . '
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 15]: I have no clue to the scene of my death , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 7]: ` Not that it matters now .
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 24]: But having risked discovery by venturing here at all , I should have been glad to track some part of the way . '
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 24]: With which singular words he abandoned his search , came up out of Limehouse Hole , and took the way past Limehouse Church .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 14]: At the great iron gate of the churchyard he stopped and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 40]: He looked up at the high tower spectrally resisting the wind , and he looked round at the white tombstones , like enough to the dead in their winding-sheets , and he counted the nine tolls of the clockbell .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 63]: ` It is a sensation not experienced by many mortals , ' said he , ` to be looking into a churchyard on a wild windy night , and to feel that I no more hold a place among the living than these dead do , and even to know that I lie buried somewhere else , as they lie buried here .
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 6]: Nothing uses me to it .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 23]: A spirit that was once a man could hardly feel stranger or lonelier , going unrecognized among mankind , than I feel .
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 11]: ` But this is the fanciful side of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 25]: It has a real side , so difficult that , though I think of it every day , I never thoroughly think it out .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 14]: Now , let me determine to think it out as I walk home .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 24]: I know I evade it , as many men -- perhaps most men -- do evade thinking their way through their greatest perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 9]: I will try to pin myself to mine .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 17]: Do n't evade it , John Harmon ; do n't evade it ; think it out !
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 112]: ` When I came to England , attracted to the country with which I had none but most miserable associations , by the accounts of my fine inheritance that found me abroad , I came back , shrinking from my father 's money , shrinking from my father 's memory , mistrustful of being forced on a mercenary wife , mistrustful of my father 's intention in thrusting that marriage on me , mistrustful that I was already growing avaricious , mistrustful that I was slackening in gratitude to the two dear noble honest friends who had made the only sunlight in my childish life or that of my hearthroken sister .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 33]: I came back , timid , divided in my mind , afraid of myself and everybody here , knowing of nothing but wretchedness that my father 's wealth had ever brought about .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 14]: Now , stop , and so far think it out , John Harmon .
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 4]: Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 5]: That is exactly so .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 11]: ` On board serving as third mate was George Radfoot .
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 6]: I knew nothing of him .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 31]: His name first became known to me about a week before we sailed , through my being accosted by one of the shipagent 's clerks as `` Mr Radfoot . ''
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 56]: It was one day when I had gone aboard to look to my preparations , and the clerk , coming behind me as I stood on deck , tapped me on the shoulder , and said , `` Mr Rad-foot , look here , '' referring to some papers that he had in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 51]: And my name first became known to Radfoot , through another clerk within a day or two , and while the ship was yet in port , coming up behind him , tapping him on the shoulder and beginning , `` I beg your pardon , Mr Harmon -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 35]: I believe we were alike in bulk and stature but not otherwise , and that we were not strikingly alike , even in those respects , when we were together and could be compared .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 96]: ` However , a sociable word or two on these mistakes became an easy introduction between us , and the weather was hot , and he helped me to a cool cabin on deck alongside his own , and his first school had been at Brussels as mine had been , and he had learnt French as I had learnt it , and he had a little history of himself to relate -- God only knows how much of it true , and how much of it false -- that had its likeness to mine .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 7]: I had been a seaman too .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 36]: So we got to be confidential together , and the more easily yet , because he and every one on board had known by general rumour what I was making the voyage to England for .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 61]: By such degrees and means , he came to the knowledge of my uneasiness of mind , and of its setting at that time in the direction of desiring to see and form some judgment of my allotted wife , before she could possibly know me for myself ; also to try Mrs Boffin and give her a glad surprise .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 60]: So the plot was made out of our getting common sailors ' dresses -LRB- as he was able to guide me about London -RRB- , and throwing ourselves in Bella Wilfer 's neighbourhood , and trying to put ourselves in her way , and doing whatever chance might favour on the spot , and seeing what came of it .
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 28]: If nothing came of it , I should be no worse off , and there would merely be a short delay in my presenting myself to Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 7]: I have all these facts right ?
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 6]: They are all accurately right .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 18]: ` His advantage in all this was , that for a time I was to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 32]: It might be for a day or for two days , but I must be lost sight of on landing , or there would be recognition , anticipation , and failure .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 42]: Therefore , I disembarked with my valise in my hand -- as Potterson the steward and Mr Jacob Kibble my fellow-passenger afterwards remembered -- and waited for him in the dark by that very Limehouse Church which is now behind me .
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 26]: ` As I had always shunned the port of London , I only knew the church through his pointing out its spire from on board .
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 62]: Perhaps I might recall , if it were any good to try , the way by which I went to it alone from the river ; but how we two went from it to Riderhood 's shop , I do n't know -- any more than I know what turns we took and doubles we made , after we left it .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 9]: The way was purposely confused , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 19]: ` But let me go on thinking the facts out , and avoid confusing them with my speculations .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 21]: Whether be took me by a straight way or a crooked way , what is that to the purpose now ?
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 5]: Steady , John Harmon .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 41]: ` When we stopped at Riderhood 's , and he asked that scoundrel a question or two , purporting to refer only to the lodging-houses in which there was accommodation for us , had I the least suspicion of him ?
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 2]: None .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 10]: Certainly none until afterwards when I held the clue .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 32]: I think he must have got from Riderhood in a paper , the drug , or whatever it was , that afterwards stupefied me , but I am far from sure .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 18]: All I felt safe in charging on him to-night , was old companionship in villainy between them .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 21]: Their undisguised intimacy , and the character I now know Riderhood to bear , made that not at all adventurous .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 9]: But I am not clear about the drug .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 16]: Thinking out the circumstances on which I found my suspicion , they are only two .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 28]: One : I remember his changing a small folded paper from one pocket to another , after we came out , which he had not touched before .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 32]: Two : I now know Riderhood to have been previously taken up for being concerned in the robbery of an unlucky seaman , to whom some such poison had been given .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 37]: ` It is my conviction that we can not have gone a mile from that shop , before we came to the wall , the dark doorway , the flight of stairs , and the room .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 10]: The night was particularly dark and it rained hard .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 26]: As I think the circumstances back , I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement of the passage , whch was not under cover .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 20]: The room overlooked the river , or a dock , or a creek , and the tide was out .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 70]: Being possessed of the time down to that point , I know by the hour that it must have been about low water ; but while the coffee was getting ready , I drew back the curtain -LRB- a dark-brown curtain -RRB- , and , looking out , knew by the kind of reflection below , of the few neighbouring lights , that they were reflected in tidal mud .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 18]: ` He had carried under his arm a canvas bag , containing a suit of his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 17]: I had no change of outer clothes with me , as I was to buy slops .
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 29]: `` You are very wet , Mr Harmon , '' -- I can hear him saying -- `` and I am quite dry under this good waterproof coat .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 7]: Put on these clothes of mine .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 27]: You may find on trying them that they will answer your purpose to-morrow , as well as the slops you mean to buy , or better .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 12]: While you change , I 'll hurry the hot coffee . ''
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 46]: When he came back , I had his clothes on , and there was a black man with him , wearing a linen jacket , like a steward , who put the smoking coffee on the table in a tray and never looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 8]: I am so far literal and exact ?
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 8]: Literal and exact , I am certain .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 46]: ` Now , I pass to sick and deranged impressions ; they are so strong , that I rely upon them ; but there are spaces between them that I know nothing about , and they are not pervaded by any idea of time . '
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 27]: I had drank some coffee , when to my sense of sight he began to swell immensely , and something urged me to rush at him .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 8]: We had a struggle near the door .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 31]: He got from me , through my not knowing where to strike , in the whirling round of the room , and the flashing of flames of fire between us .
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 4]: I dropped down .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 14]: Lying helpless on the ground , I was turned over by a foot .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 10]: I was dragged by the neck into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 6]: I heard men speak together .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 8]: I was turned over by other feet .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 15]: I saw a figure like myself lying dressed in my clothes on a bed .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 34]: What might have been , for anything I knew , a silence of days , weeks , months , years , was broken by a violent wrestling of men all over the room .
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 15]: The figure like myself was assailed , and my valise was in its hand .
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 8]: I was trodden upon and fallen over .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 18]: I heard a noise of blows , and thought it was a wood-cutter cutting down a tree .
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 54]: I could not have said that my name was John Harmon -- I could not have thought it -- I did n't know it -- but when I heard the blows , I thought of the wood-cutter and his axe , and had some dead idea that I was lying in a forest .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 6]: ` This is still correct ?
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 21]: Still correct , with the exception that I can not possibly express it to myself without using the word I .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 6]: But it was not I .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 12]: There was no such thing as I , within my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 42]: ` It was only after a downward slide through something like a tube , and then a great noise and a sparkling and crackling as of fires , that the consciousness came upon me , `` This is John Harmon drowning !
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 8]: John Harmon , struggle for your life .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 11]: John Harmon , call on Heaven and save yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 35]: I think I cried it out aloud in a great agony , and then a heavy horrid unintelligible something vanished , and it was I who was struggling there alone in the water . '
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 19]: I was very weak and faint , frightfully oppressed with drowsiness , and driving fast with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 37]: Looking over the black water , I saw the lights racing past me on the two banks of the river , as if they were eager to be gone and leave me dying in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 16]: The tide was running down , but I knew nothing of up or down then .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 55]: When , guiding myself safely with Heaven 's assistance before the fierce set of the water , I at last caught at a boat moored , one of a tier of boats at a causeway , I was sucked under her , and came up , only just alive , on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 8]: ` Was I long in the water ?
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 17]: Long enough to be chilled to the heart , but I do n't know how long .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 29]: Yet the cold was merciful , for it was the cold night air and the rain that restored me from a swoon on the stones of the causeway .
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 67]: They naturally supposed me to have toppled in , drunk , when I crept to the public-house it belonged to ; for I had no notion where I was , and could not articulate -- through the poison that had made me insensible having affected my speech -- and I supposed the night to be the previous night , as it was still dark and raining .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 8]: But I had lost twenty-four hours . '
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 22]: I have checked the calculation often , and it must have been two nights that I lay recovering in that public-house .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 47]: I am sure it was while I lay in that bed there , that the thought entered my head of turning the danger I had passed through , to the account of being for some time supposed to have disappeared mysteriously , and of proving Bella .
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 52]: The dread of our being forced on one another , and perpetuating the fate that seemed to have fallen on my father 's riches -- the fate that they should lead to nothing but evil -- was strong upon the moral timidity that dates from my childhood with my poor sister .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 39]: ` As to this hour I can not understand that side of the river where I recovered the shore , being the opposite side to that on which I was ensnared , I shall never understand it now .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 38]: Even at this moment , while I leave the river behind me , going home , I can not conceive that it rolls between me and that spot , or that the sea is where it is .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 19]: But this is not thinking it out ; this is making a leap to the present time . '
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 19]: I could not have done it , but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 19]: Not a great fortune , forty and odd pounds for the inheritor of a hundred and odd thousand !
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 5]: But it was enough .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 8]: Without it I must have disclosed myself .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 21]: Without it , I could never have gone to that Exchequer Coffee House , or taken Mrs Wilfer 's lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 25]: ` Some twelve days I lived at that hotel , before the night when I saw the corpse of Radfoot at the Police Station .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 35]: The inexpressible mental horror that I laboured under , as one of the consequences of the poison , makes the interval seem greatly longer , but I know it can not have been longer .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 58]: That suffering has gradually weakened and weakened since , and has only come upon me by starts , and I hope I am free from it now ; but even now , I have sometimes to think , constrain myself , and stop before speaking , or I could not say the words I want to say .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 13]: ` Again I ramble away from thinking it out to the end .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 17]: It is not so far to the end that I need be tempted to break off .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 6]: Now , on straight ! '
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 17]: I examined the newspapers every day for tidings that I was missing , but saw none .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 29]: Going out that night to walk -LRB- for I kept retired while it was light -RRB- , I found a crowd assembled round a placard posted at Whitehall .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 41]: It described myself , John Harmon , as found dead and mutilated in the river under circumstances of strong suspicion , described my dress , described the papers in my pockets , and stated where I was lying for recognition .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 102]: In a wild incautious way I hurried there , and there -- with the horror of the death I had escaped , before my eyes in its most appalling shape , added to the inconceivable horror tormenting me at that time when the poisonous stuff was strongest on me -- I perceived that Radfoot had been murdered by some unknown hands for the money for which he would have murdered me , and that probably we had both been shot into the river from the same dark place into the same dark tide , when the stream ran deep and strong .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 36]: ` That night I almost gave up my mystery , though I suspected no one , could offer no information , knew absolutely nothing save that the murdered man was not I , but Radfoot .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 27]: Next day while I hesitated , and next day while I hesitated , it seemed as if the whole country were determined to have me dead .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 39]: The Inquest declared me dead , the Government proclaimed me dead ; I could not listen at my fireside for five minutes to the outer noises , but it was borne into my ears that I was dead .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 17]: ` So John Harmon died , and Julius Handford disappeared , and John Rokesmith was born .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 42]: John Rokesmith 's intent to-night has been to repair a wrong that he could never have imagined possible , coming to his ears through the Lightwood talk related to him , and which he is bound by every consideration to remedy .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 13]: In that intent John Rokesmith will persevere , as his duty is .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 9]: ` Now , is it all thought out ?
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 5]: All to this time ?
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 3]: Nothing omitted ?
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 4]: No , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 5]: But beyond this time ?
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 25]: To think it out through the future , is a harder though a much shorter task than to think it out through the past .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 5]: John Harmon is dead .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 7]: Should John Harmon come to life ?
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 6]: ` If yes , why ?
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 6]: If no , why ? '
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 6]: ` Take yes , first .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 19]: To enlighten human Justice concerning the offence of one far beyond it who may have a living mother .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 25]: To enlighten it with the lights of a stone passage , a flight of stairs , a brown window-curtain , and a black man .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 65]: To come into possession of my father 's money , and with it sordidly to buy a beautiful creature whom I love -- I can not help it ; reason has nothing to do with it ; I love her against reason -- but who would as soon love me for my own sake , as she would love the beggar at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 15]: What a use for the money , and how worthy of its old misuses !
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 6]: ` Now , take no .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 11]: The reasons why John Harmon should not come to life .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 18]: Because he has passively allowed these dear old faithful friends to pass into possession of the property .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 25]: Because he sees them happy with it , making a good use of it , effacing the old rust and tarnish on the money .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 13]: Because they have virtually adopted Bella , and will provide for her .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 27]: Because there is affection enough in her nature , and warmth enough in her heart , to develop into something enduringly good , under favourable conditions .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 22]: Because her faults have been intensified by her place in my father 's will , and she is already growing better .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 57]: Because her marriage with John Harmon , after what I have heard from her own lips , would be a shocking mockery , of which both she and I must always be conscious , and which would degrade her in her mind , and me in mine , and each of us in the other 's .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 25]: Because if John Harmon comes to life and does not marry her , the property falls into the very hands that hold it now .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 6]: ` What would I have ?
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 39]: Dead , I have found the true friends of my lifetime still as true as tender and as faithful as when I was alive , and making my memory an incentive to good actions done in my name .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 48]: Dead , I have found them when they might have slighted my name , and passed greedily over my grave to ease and wealth , lingering by the way , like single-hearted children , to recall their love for me when I was a poor frightened child .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 41]: Dead , I have heard from the woman who would have been my wife if I had lived , the revolting truth that I should have purchased her , caring nothing for me , as a Sultan buys a slave .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 6]: ` What would I have ?
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 33]: If the dead could know , or do know , how the living use them , who among the hosts of dead has found a more disinterested fidelity on earth than I ?
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 7]: Is not that enough for me ?
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 26]: If I had come back , these noble creatures would have welcomed me , wept over me , given up everything to me with joy .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 15]: I did not come back , and they have passed unspoiled into my place .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 13]: Let them rest in it , and let Bella rest in hers .
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 7]: ` What course for me then ?
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 2]: This .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 42]: To live the same quiet Secretary life , carefully avoiding chances of recognition , until they shall have become more accustomed to their altered state , and until the great swarm of swindlers under many names shall have found newer prey .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 51]: By that time , the method I am establishing through all the affairs , and with which I will every day take new pains to make them both familiar , will be , I may hope , a machine in such working order as that they can keep it going .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 13]: I know I need but ask of their generosity , to have .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 34]: When the right time comes , I will ask no more than will replace me in my former path of life , and John Rokesmith shall tread it as contentedly as he may .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 9]: But John Harmon shall come back no more .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 57]: ` That I may never , in the days to come afar off , have any weak misgiving that Bella might , in any contingency , have taken me for my own sake if I had plainly asked her , I WILL plainly ask her : proving beyond all question what I already know too well .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 22]: And now it is all thought out , from the beginning to the end , and my mind is easier . '
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 39]: So deeply engaged had the living-dead man been , in thus communing with himself , that he had regarded neither the wind nor the way , and had resisted the former instinctively as he had pursued the latter .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 34]: But being now come into the City , where there was a coach-stand , he stood irresolute whether to go to his lodgings , or to go first to Mr Boffin 's house .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 57]: He decided to go round by the house , arguing , as he carried his overcoat upon his arm , that it was less likely to attract notice if left there , than if taken to Holloway : both Mrs Wilfer and Miss Lavinia being ravenously curious touching every article of which the lodger stood possessed .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 24]: Arriving at the house , he found that Mr and Mrs Boffin were out , but that Miss Wilfer was in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 29]: Miss Wilfer had remained at home , in consequence of not feeling very well , and had inquired in the evening if Mr Rokesmith were in his room .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 16]: ` Make my compliments to Miss Wilfer , and say I am here now . '
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 33]: Miss Wilfer 's compliments came down in return , and , if it were not too much trouble , would Mr Rokesmith be so kind as to come up before he went ?
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 13]: It was not too much trouble , and Mr Rokesmith came up .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 13]: Oh she looked very pretty , she looked very , very pretty !
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 45]: If the father of the late John Harmon had but left his money unconditionally to his son , and if his son had but lighted on this loveable girl for himself , and had the happiness to make her loving as well as loveable !
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 9]: Are you not well , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 6]: ` Yes , quite well .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 18]: I was sorry to hear , when I came in , that YOU were not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 4]: A mere nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 24]: I had a headache -- gone now -- and was not quite fit for a hot theatre , so I stayed at home .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 16]: I asked you if you were not well , because you look so white . '
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 4]: ` Do I ?
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 8]: I have had a busy evening . '
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 29]: She was on a low ottoman before the fire , with a little shining jewel of a table , and her book and her work , beside her .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 47]: what a different life the late John Harmon 's , if it had been his happy privilege to take his place upon that ottoman , and draw his arm about that waist , and say , ' I hope the time has been long without me ?
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 11]: What a Home Goddess you look , my darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 21]: But , the present John Rokesmith , far removed from the late John Harmon , remained standing at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 17]: A little distance in respect of space , but a great distance in respect of separation .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 49]: ` Mr Rokesmith , ' said Bella , taking up her work , and inspecting it all round the corners , ' I wanted to say something to you when I could have the opportunity , as an explanation why I was rude to you the other day .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 13]: You have no right to think ill of me , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 33]: The sharp little way in which she darted a look at him , half sensitively injured , and half pettishly , would have been very much admired by the late John Harmon .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 16]: ` You do n't know how well I think of you , Miss Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 31]: ` Truly , you must have a very high opinion of me , Mr Rokesmith , when you believe that in prosperity I neglect and forget my old home . '
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 7]: ` Do I believe so ? '
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 15]: ` You DID , sir , at any rate , ' returned Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 22]: I took the liberty of reminding you of a little omission into which you had fallen -- insensibly and naturally fallen .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 8]: It was no more than that . '
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 23]: ` And I beg leave to ask you , Mr Rokesmith , ' said Bella , ` why you took that liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 19]: -- I hope there is no offence in the phrase ; it is your own , remember . '
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 16]: ` Because I am truly , deeply , profoundly interested in you , Miss Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 11]: Because I wish to see you always at your best .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 9]: Because I -- shall I go on ? '
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 22]: ` No , sir , ' returned Bella , with a burning face , ` you have said more than enough .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 9]: I beg that you will NOT go on .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 16]: If you have any generosity , any honour , you will say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 41]: The late John Harmon , looking at the proud face with the downcast eyes , and at the quick breathing as it stirred the fall of bright brown hair over the beautiful neck , would probably have remained silent . '
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 28]: I wish to speak to you , sir , ' said Bella , ` once for all , and I do n't know how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 27]: I have sat here all this evening , wishing to speak to you , and determining to speak to you , and feeling that I must .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 9]: I beg for a moment 's time . '
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 25]: He remained silent , and she remained with her face averted , sometimes making a slight movement as if she would turn and speak .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 6]: At length she did so .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 21]: ` You know how I am situated here , sir , and you know how I am situated at home .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 23]: I must speak to you for myself , since there is no one about me whom I could ask to do so .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 24]: It is not generous in you , it is not honourable in you , to conduct yourself towards me as you do . '
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 17]: ` Is it ungenerous or dishonourable to be devoted to you ; fascinated by you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 4]: ` Preposterous ! '
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 18]: The late John Harmon might have thought it rather a contemptuous and lofty word of repudiation . '
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 23]: I now feel obliged to go on , ' pursued the Secretary , ` though it were only in self-explanation and self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 29]: I hope , Miss Wilfer , that it is not unpardonable -- even in me -- to make an honest declaration of an honest devotion to you . '
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 6]: ` An honest declaration ! '
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 6]: repeated Bella , with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 7]: ` Is it otherwise ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 27]: I must request , sir , ' said Bella , taking refuge in a touch of timely resentment , ` that I may not be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 12]: You must excuse me if I decline to be cross-examined . '
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 11]: ` Oh , Miss Wilfer , this is hardly charitable .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 11]: I ask you nothing but what your own emphasis suggests .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 8]: However , I waive even that question .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 12]: But what I have declared , I take my stand by .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 24]: I can not recall the avowal of my earnest and deep attachment to you , and I do not recall it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 11]: I reject it , sir , ' said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 15]: I should be blind and deaf if I were not prepared for the reply .
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 13]: Forgive my offence , for it carries its punishment with it . '
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 5]: ` What punishment ? '
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 3]: asked Bella .
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 7]: ` Is my present endurance none ?
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 14]: But excuse me ; I did not mean to cross-examine you again . '
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 33]: ` You take advantage of a hasty word of mine , ' said Bella with a little sting of self-reproach , ` to make me seem -- I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 9]: I spoke without consideration when I used it .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 28]: If that was bad , I am sorry ; but you repeat it after consideration , and that seems to me to be at least no better .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 30]: For the rest , I beg it may be understood , Mr Rokesmith , that there is an end of this between us , now and for ever . '
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 10]: ` Now and for ever , ' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 20]: I appeal to you , sir , ' proceeded Bella with increasing spirit , ` not to pursue me .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 24]: I appeal to you not to take advantage of your position in this house to make my position in it distressing and disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 23]: I appeal to you to discontinue your habit of making your misplaced attentions as plain to Mrs Boffin as to me . '
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 8]: ` Have I done so ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 10]: I should think you have , ' replied Bella .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 19]: ` In any case it is not your fault if you have not , Mr Rokesmith . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 9]: I hope you are wrong in that impression .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 10]: I should be very sorry to have justified it .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 6]: I think I have not .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 8]: For the future there is no apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 7]: It is all over . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 13]: I am much relieved to hear it , ' said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 17]: I have far other views in life , and why should you waste your own ? '
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 4]: ` Mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 4]: said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 5]: ` My life ! '
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 17]: His curious tone caused Bella to glance at the curious smile with which he said it .
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 8]: It was gone as he glanced back .
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 44]: ` Pardon me , Miss Wilfer , ' he proceeded , when their eyes met ; ` you have used some hard words , for which I do not doubt you have a justification in your mind , that I do not understand .
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 4]: Ungenerous and dishonourable .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 5]: In what ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 16]: I would rather not be asked , ' said Bella , haughtily looking down . '
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 14]: I would rather not ask , but the question is imposed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 11]: Kindly explain ; or if not kindly , justly . '
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 6]: ` Oh , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 48]: said Bella , raising her eyes to his , after a little struggle to forbear , ` is it generous and honourable to use the power here which your favour with Mr and Mrs Boffin and your ability in your place give you , against me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 5]: ` Against you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 42]: ` Is it generous and honourable to form a plan for gradually bringing their influence to bear upon a suit which I have shown you that I do not like , and which I tell you that I utterly reject ? '
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 27]: The late John Harmon could have borne a good deal , but he would have been cut to the heart by such a suspicion as this .
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 56]: ` Would it be generous and honourable to step into your place -- if you did so , for I do n't know that you did , and I hope you did not -- anticipating , or knowing beforehand , that I should come here , and designing to take me at this disadvantage ? '
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 12]: ` This mean and cruel disadvantage , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' assented Bella .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 25]: The Secretary kept silence for a little while ; then merely said , ` You are wholly mistaken , Miss Wilfer ; wonderfully mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 13]: I can not say , however , that it is your fault .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 15]: If I deserve better things of you , you do not know it . '
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 28]: ` At least , sir , ' retorted Bella , with her old indignation rising , ` you know the history of my being here at all .
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 28]: I have heard Mr Boffin say that you are master of every line and word of that will , as you are master of all his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 60]: And was it not enough that I should have been willed away , like a horse , or a dog , or a bird ; but must you too begin to dispose of me in your mind , and speculate in me , as soon as I had ceased to be the talk and the laugh of the town ?
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 13]: Am I for ever to be made the property of strangers ? '
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 17]: ` Believe me , ' returned the Secretary , ` you are wonderfully mistaken . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 13]: I should be glad to know it , ' answered Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 7]: I doubt if you ever will .
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 2]: Good-night .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 26]: Of course I shall be careful to conceal any traces of this interview from Mr and Mrs Boffin , as long as I remain here .
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 17]: Trust me , what you have complained of is at an end for ever . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 12]: I am glad I have spoken , then , Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 12]: It has been painful and difficult , but it is done .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 13]: If I have hurt you , I hope you will forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 35]: I am inexperienced and impetuous , and I have been a little spoilt ; but I really am not so bad as I dare say I appear , or as you think me . '
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 17]: He quitted the room when Bella had said this , relenting in her wilful inconsistent way .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 28]: Left alone , she threw herself back on her ottoman , and said , ' I did n't know the lovely woman was such a Dragon ! '
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 31]: Then , she got up and looked in the glass , and said to her image , ` You have been positively swelling your features , you little fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 58]: Then , she took an impatient walk to the other end of the room and back , and said , ' I wish Pa was here to have a talk about an avaricious marriage ; but he is better away , poor dear , for I know I should pull his hair if he WAS here . '
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 35]: And then she threw her work away , and threw her book after it , and sat down and hummed a tune , and hummed it out of tune , and quarrelled with it .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 8]: And John Rokesmith , what did he ?
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 16]: He went down to his room , and buried John Harmon many additional fathoms deep .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 38]: He took his hat , and walked out , and , as he went to Holloway or anywhere else -- not at all minding where -- heaped mounds upon mounds of earth over John Harmon 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 13]: His walking did not bring him home until the dawn of day .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 66]: And so busy had he been all night , piling and piling weights upon weights of earth above John Harmon 's grave , that by that time John Harmon lay buried under a whole Alpine range ; and still the Sexton Rokesmith accumulated mountains over him , lightening his labour with the dirge , ` Cover him , crush him , keep him down ! '
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 39]: Chapter 14 STRONG OF PURPOSE The sexton-task of piling earth above John Harmon all night long , was not conducive to sound sleep ; but Rokesmith had some broken morning rest , and rose strengthened in his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 6]: It was all over now .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 54]: No ghost should trouble Mr and Mrs Boffin 's peace ; invisible and voiceless , the ghost should look on for a little while longer at the state of existence out of which it had departed , and then should for ever cease to haunt the scenes in which it had no place .
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 7]: He went over it all again .
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 32]: He had lapsed into the condition in which he found himself , as many a man lapses into many a condition , without perceiving the accumulative power of its separate circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 97]: When in the distrust engendered by his wretched childhood and the action for evil -- never yet for good within his knowledge then -- of his father and his father 's wealth on all within their influence , he conceived the idea of his first deception , it was meant to be harmless , it was to last but a few hours or days , it was to involve in it only the girl so capriciously forced upon him and upon whom he was so capriciously forced , and it was honestly meant well towards her .
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 49]: For , if he had found her unhappy in the prospect of that marriage -LRB- through her heart inclining to another man or for any other cause -RRB- , be would seriously have said : ` This is another of the old perverted uses of the misery-making money .
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 17]: I will let it go to my and my sister 's only protectors and friends . '
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 57]: When the snare into which he fell so outstripped his first intention as that he found himself placarded by the police authorities upon the London walls for dead , he confusedly accepted the aid that fell upon him , without considering how firmly it must seem to fix the Boffins in their accession to the fortune .
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 42]: When he saw them , and knew them , and even from his vantage-ground of inspection could find no flaw in them , he asked himself , ` And shall I come to life to dispossess such people as these ? '
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 16]: There was no good to set against the putting of them to that hard proof .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 36]: He had heard from Bella 's own lips when he stood tapping at the door on that night of his taking the lodgings , that the marriage would have been on her part thoroughly mercenary .
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 26]: He had since tried her , in his own unknown person and supposed station , and she not only rejected his advances but resented them .
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 19]: Was it for him to have the shame of buying her , or the meanness of punishing her ?
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 35]: Yet , by coming to life and accepting the condition of the inheritance , he must do the former ; and by coming to life and rejecting it , he must do the latter .
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 20]: Another consequence that he had never foreshadowed , was the implication of an innocent man in his supposed murder .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 32]: He would obtain complete retraction from the accuser , and set the wrong right ; but clearly the wrong could never have been done if he had never planned a deception .
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 29]: Then , whatever inconvenience or distress of mind the deception cost him , it was manful repentantly to accept as among its consequences , and make no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 25]: Thus John Rokesmith in the morning , and it buried John Harmon still many fathoms deeper than he had been buried in the night .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 18]: Going out earlier than he was accustomed to do , he encountered the cherub at the door .
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 17]: The cherub 's way was for a certain space his way , and they walked together .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 14]: It was impossible not to notice the change in the cherub 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 24]: The cherub felt very conscious of it , and modestly remarked : ' A present from my daughter Bella , Mr Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 24]: The words gave the Secretary a stroke of pleasure , for he remembered the fifty pounds , and he still loved the girl .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 24]: No doubt it was very weak -- it always IS very weak , some authorities hold -- but he loved the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 20]: I do n't know whether you happen to have read many books of African Travel , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 10]: said R. W. ' I have read several . '
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 50]: ` Well , you know , there 's usually a King George , or a King Boy , or a King Sambo , or a King Bill , or Bull , or Rum , or Junk , or whatever name the sailors may have happened to give him . '
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 3]: asked Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 3]: ` Anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 7]: Anywhere in Africa , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 33]: Pretty well everywhere , I may say ; for black kings are cheap -- and I think ' -- said R. W. , with an apologetic air , ` nasty ' . '
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 10]: I am much of your opinion , Mr Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 9]: You were going to say -- ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 46]: I was going to say , the king is generally dressed in a London hat only , or a Manchester pair of braces , or one epaulette , or an uniform coat with his legs in the sleeves , or something of that kind . '
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 9]: ` Just so , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 43]: ` In confidence , I assure you , Mr Rokesmith , ' observed the cheerful cherub , ` that when more of my family were at home and to be provided for , I used to remind myself immensely of that king .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 29]: You have no idea , as a single man , of the difficulty I have had in wearing more than one good article at a time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 11]: I can easily believe it , Mr Wilfer . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 34]: I only mention it , ' said R. W. in the warmth of his heart , ` as a proof of the amiable , delicate , and considerate affection of my daughter Bella .
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 23]: If she had been a little spoilt , I could n't have thought so very much of it , under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 7]: But no , not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 7]: And she is so very pretty !
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 16]: I hope you agree with me in finding her very pretty , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 5]: ` Certainly I do .
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 6]: Every one must . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 9]: I hope so , ' said the cherub .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 10]: ` Indeed , I have no doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 13]: This is a great advancement for her in life , Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 8]: A great opening of her prospects ? '
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 15]: ` Miss Wilfer could have no better friends than Mr and Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 4]: ` Impossible ! '
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 5]: said the gratified cherub .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 14]: ` Really I begin to think things are very well as they are .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 19]: If Mr John Harmon had lived -- ' ` He is better dead , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 62]: ` No , I wo n't go so far as to say that , ' urged the cherub , a little remonstrant against the very decisive and unpitying tone ; ` but he might n't have suited Bella , or Bella might n't have suited him , or fifty things , whereas now I hope she can choose for herself . '
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 31]: ` Has she -- as you place the confidence in me of speaking on the subject , you will excuse my asking -- has she -- perhaps -- chosen ? '
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 4]: faltered the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 6]: ` Oh dear no ! '
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 23]: returned R. W. ` Young ladies sometimes , ' Rokesmith hinted , ` choose without mentioning their choice to their fathers . '
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 9]: ` Not in this case , Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 16]: Between my daughter Bella and me there is a regular league and covenant of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 8]: It was ratified only the other day .
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 29]: The ratification dates from -- these , ' said the cherub , giving a little pull at the lappels of his coat and the pockets of his trousers .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 9]: ` Oh no , she has not chosen .
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 27]: To be sure , young George Sampson , in the days when Mr John Harmon -- ' ` Who I wish had never been born ! '
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 9]: said the Secretary , with a gloomy brow .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 52]: R. W. looked at him with surprise , as thinking he had contracted an unaccountable spite against the poor deceased , and continued : ` In the days when Mr John Harmon was being sought out , young George Sampson certainly was hovering about Bella , and Bella let him hover .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 21]: But it never was seriously thought of , and it 's still less than ever to be thought of now .
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 18]: For Bella is ambitious , Mr Rokesmith , and I think I may predict will marry fortune .
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 31]: This time , you see , she will have the person and the property before her together , and will be able to make her choice with her eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 5]: This is my road .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 10]: I am very sorry to part company so soon .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 6]: Good morning , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 32]: The Secretary pursued his way , not very much elevated in spirits by this conversation , and , arriving at the Boffin mansion , found Betty Higden waiting for him . '
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 30]: I should thank you kindly , sir , ' said Betty , ` if I might make so bold as have a word or two wi ' you . '
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 28]: She should have as many words as she liked , he told her ; and took her into his room , and made her sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 10]: Tis concerning Sloppy , sir , ' said Betty .
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 11]: ` And that 's how I come here by myself .
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 26]: Not wishing him to know what I 'm a-going to say to you , I got the start of him early and walked up . '
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 10]: ` You have wonderful energy , ' returned Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 10]: ` You are as young as I am . '
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 8]: Betty Higden gravely shook her head . '
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 20]: I am strong for my time of life , sir , but not young , thank the Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 10]: ` Are you thankful for not being young ? '
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 30]: If I was young , it would all have to be gone through again , and the end would be a weary way off , do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 11]: But never mind me ; 't is concerning Sloppy . '
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 10]: ` And what about him , Betty ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 6]: Tis just this , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 37]: It ca n't be reasoned out of his head by any powers of mine but what that he can do right by your kind lady and gentleman and do his work for me , both together .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 5]: Now he ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 25]: To give himself up to being put in the way of arning a good living and getting on , he must give me up .
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 8]: Well ; he wo n't . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 10]: I respect him for it , ' said Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 6]: ` DO ye , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 10]: I do n't know but what I do myself .
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 14]: Still that do n't make it right to let him have his way .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 18]: So as he wo n't give me up , I 'm a-going to give him up . '
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 6]: ` How , Betty ? '
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 11]: ` I 'm a-going to run away from him . '
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 25]: With an astonished look at the indomitable old face and the bright eyes , the Secretary repeated , ` Run away from him ? '
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 13]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Betty , with one nod .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 24]: And in the nod and in the firm set of her mouth , there was a vigour of purpose not to be doubted .
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 6]: ` Come , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 4]: said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 7]: ` We must talk about this .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 28]: Let us take our time over it , and try to get at the true sense of the case and the true course , by degrees . '
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 40]: ` Now , lookee here , by dear , ' returned old Betty -- ` asking your excuse for being so familiar , but being of a time of life a ` most to be your grandmother twice over .
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 6]: Now , lookee , here .
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 42]: 'T is a poor living and a hard as is to be got out of this work that I 'm a doing now , and but for Sloppy I do n't know as I should have held to it this long .
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 12]: But it did just keep us on , the two together .
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 35]: Now that I 'm alone -- with even Johnny gone -- I 'd far sooner be upon my feet and tiring of myself out , than a sitting folding and folding by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 7]: And I 'll tell you why .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 22]: There 's a deadness steals over me at times , that the kind of life favours and I do n't like .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 110]: Now , I seem to have Johnny in my arms -- now , his mother -- now , his mother 's mother -- now , I seem to be a child myself , a lying once again in the arms of my own mother -- then I get numbed , thought and sense , till I start out of my seat , afeerd that I 'm a growing like the poor old people that they brick up in the Unions , as you may sometimes see when they let 'em out of the four walls to have a warm in the sun , crawling quite scared about the streets .
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 29]: I was a nimble girl , and have always been a active body , as I told your lady , first time ever I see her good face .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 13]: I can still walk twenty mile if I am put to it .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 14]: I 'd far better be a walking than a getting numbed and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 16]: I 'm a good fair knitter , and can make many little things to sell .
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 24]: The loan from your lady and gentleman of twenty shillings to fit out a basket with , would be a fortune for me .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 27]: Trudging round the country and tiring of myself out , I shall keep the deadness off , and get my own bread by my own labour .
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 8]: And what more can I want ? '
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 18]: ` And this is your plan , ' said the Secretary , ` for running away ? '
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 6]: ` Show me a better !
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 8]: My deary , show me a better !
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 55]: Why , I know very well , ' said old Betty Higden , ` and you know very well , that your lady and gentleman would set me up like a queen for the rest of my life , if so be that we could make it right among us to have it so .
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 14]: But we ca n't make it right among us to have it so .
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 16]: I 've never took charity yet , nor yet has any one belonging to me .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 37]: And it would be forsaking of myself indeed , and forsaking of my children dead and gone , and forsaking of their children dead and gone , to set up a contradiction now at last . '
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 27]: ` It might come to be justifiable and unavoidable at last , ' the Secretary gently hinted , with a slight stress on the word . '
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 6]: I hope it never will !
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 44]: It ai n't that I mean to give offence by being anyways proud , ' said the old creature simply , ` but that I want to be of a piece like , and helpful of myself right through to my death . '
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 39]: ` And to be sure , ' added the Secretary , as a comfort for her , ` Sloppy will be eagerly looking forward to his opportunity of being to you what you have been to him . '
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 9]: ` Trust him for that , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 5]: said Betty , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 23]: ` Though he had need to be something quick about it , for I 'm a getting to be an old one .
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 17]: But I 'm a strong one too , and travel and weather never hurt me yet !
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 37]: Now , be so kind as speak for me to your lady and gentleman , and tell 'em what I ask of their good friendliness to let me do , and why I ask it . '
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 42]: The Secretary felt that there was no gainsaying what was urged by this brave old heroine , and he presently repaired to Mrs Boffin and recommended her to let Betty Higden have her way , at all events for the time .
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 38]: ` It would be far more satisfactory to your kind heart , I know , ' he said , ` to provide for her , but it may be a duty to respect this independent spirit . '
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 12]: Mrs Boffin was not proof against the consideration set before her .
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 21]: She and her husband had worked too , and had brought their simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps .
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 18]: If they owed a duty to Betty Higden , of a surety that duty must be done .
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 47]: ` But , Betty , ' said Mrs Boffin , when she accompanied John Rokesmith back to his room , and shone upon her with the light of her radiant face , ` granted all else , I think I would n't run away ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 16]: Twould come easier to Sloppy , ' said Mrs Higden , shaking her head . ''
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 7]: Twould come easier to me too .
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 8]: But 't is as you please . '
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 7]: ` When would you go ? '
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 11]: ` Now , ' was the bright and ready answer .
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 8]: ` To-day , my deary , tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 9]: Bless ye , I am used to it .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 9]: I know many parts of the country well .
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 26]: When nothing else was to be done , I have worked in many a market-garden afore now , and in many a hop-garden too . '
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 31]: ` If I give my consent to your going , Betty -- which Mr Rokesmith thinks I ought to do -- ' Betty thanked him with a grateful curtsey . '
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 9]: -- We must not lose sight of you .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 11]: We must not let you pass out of our knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 8]: We must know all about you . '
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 34]: ` Yes , my deary , but not through letter-writing , because letterwriting -- indeed , writing of most sorts had n't much come up for such as me when I was young .
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 8]: But I shall be to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 17]: No fear of my missing a chance of giving myself a sight of your reviving face .
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 38]: Besides , ' said Betty , with logical good faith , ' I shall have a debt to pay off , by littles , and naturally that would bring me back , if nothing else would . '
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 7]: ` MUST it be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 12]: asked Mrs Boffin , still reluctant , of the Secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 6]: I think it must . '
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 33]: After more discussion it was agreed that it should be done , and Mrs Boffin summoned Bella to note down the little purchases that were necessary to set Betty up in trade .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 61]: ` Do n't ye be timorous for me , my dear , ' said the stanch old heart , observant of Bella 's face : when I take my seat with my work , clean and busy and fresh , in a country market-place , I shall turn a sixpence as sure as ever a farmer 's wife there . '
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 17]: The Secretary took that opportunity of touching on the practical question of Mr Sloppy 's capabilities .
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 26]: He would have made a wonderful cabinet-maker , said Mrs Higden , ` if there had been the money to put him to it . '
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 30]: She had seen him handle tools that he had borrowed to mend the mangle , or to knock a broken piece of furniture together , in a surprising manner .
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 18]: As to constructing toys for the Minders , out of nothing , he had done that daily .
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 33]: And once as many as a dozen people had got together in the lane to see the neatness with which he fitted the broken pieces of a foreign monkey 's musical instrument .
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 10]: ` That 's well , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 14]: ` It will not be hard to find a trade for him . '
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 26]: John Harmon being buried under mountains now , the Secretary that very same day set himself to finish his affairs and have done with him .
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 45]: He drew up an ample declaration , to be signed by Rogue Riderhood -LRB- knowing he could get his signature to it , by making him another and much shorter evening call -RRB- , and then considered to whom should he give the document ?
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 8]: To Hexam 's son , or daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 7]: Resolved speedily , to the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 54]: But it would be safer to avoid seeing the daughter , because the son had seen Julius Handford , and -- he could not be too careful -- there might possibly be some comparison of notes between the son and daughter , which would awaken slumbering suspicion , and lead to consequences . '
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 21]: I might even , ' he reflected , ` be apprehended as having been concerned in my own murder ! '
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 15]: Therefore , best to send it to the daughter under cover by the post .
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 28]: Pleasant Riderhood had undertaken to find out where she lived , and it was not necessary that it should be attended by a single word of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 5]: So far , straight .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 48]: But , all that he knew of the daughter he derived from Mrs Boffin 's accounts of what she heard from Mr Lightwood , who seemed to have a reputation for his manner of relating a story , and to have made this story quite his own .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 71]: It interested him , and he would like to have the means of knowing more -- as , for instance , that she received the exonerating paper , and that it satisfied her -- by opening some channel altogether independent of Lightwood : who likewise had seen Julius Handford , who had publicly advertised for Julius Handford , and whom of all men he , the Secretary , most avoided .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 32]: ` But with whom the common course of things might bring me in a moment face to face , any day in the week or any hour in the day . '
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 15]: Now , to cast about for some likely means of opening such a channel .
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 13]: The boy , Hexam , was training for and with a schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 29]: The Secretary knew it , because his sister 's share in that disposal of him seemed to be the best part of Lightwood 's account of the family .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 13]: This young fellow , Sloppy , stood in need of some instruction .
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 21]: If he , the Secretary , engaged that schoolmaster to impart it to him , the channel might be opened .
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 14]: The next point was , did Mrs Boffin know the schoolmaster 's name ?
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 10]: No , but she knew where the school was .
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 3]: Quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 21]: Promptly the Secretary wrote to the master of that school , and that very evening Bradley Headstone answered in person .
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 40]: The Secretary stated to the schoolmaster how the object was , to send to him for certain occasional evening instruction , a youth whom Mr and Mrs Boffin wished to help to an industrious and useful place in life .
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 13]: The schoolmaster was willing to undertake the charge of such a pupil .
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 7]: The Secretary inquired on what terms ?
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 7]: The schoolmaster stated on what terms .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 5]: Agreed and disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 25]: ` May I ask , sir , ' said Bradley Headstone , ` to whose good opinion I owe a recommendation to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 12]: ` You should know that I am not the principal here .
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 7]: I am Mr Boffin 's Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 24]: Mr Boffin is a gentleman who inherited a property of which you may have heard some public mention ; the Harmon property . '
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 42]: ` Mr Harmon , ' said Bradley : who would have been a great deal more at a loss than he was , if he had known to whom he spoke : ` was murdered and found in the river . '
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 10]: ` Was murdered and found in the river . '
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 25]: ` It was not -- ' ` No , ' interposed the Secretary , smiling , ` it was not he who recommended you .
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 11]: Mr Boffin heard of you through a certain Mr Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 14]: I think you know Mr Lightwood , or know of him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 14]: I know as much of him as I wish to know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 13]: I have no acquaintance with Mr Lightwood , and I desire none .
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 33]: I have no objection to Mr Lightwood , but I have a particular objection to some of Mr Lightwood 's friends -- in short , to one of Mr Lightwood 's friends .
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 5]: His great friend . '
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 44]: He could hardly get the words out , even then and there , so fierce did he grow -LRB- though keeping himself down with infinite pains of repression -RRB- , when the careless and contemptuous bearing of Eugene Wrayburn rose before his mind .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 37]: The Secretary saw there was a strong feeling here on some sore point , and he would have made a diversion from it , but for Bradley 's holding to it in his cumbersome way . '
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 17]: I have no objection to mention the friend by name , ' he said , doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 13]: ` The person I object to , is Mr Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 5]: The Secretary remembered him .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 63]: In his disturbed recollection of that night when he was striving against the drugged drink , there was but a dim image of Eugene 's person ; but he remembered his name , and his manner of speaking , and how he had gone with them to view the body , and where he had stood , and what he had said .
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 30]: ` Pray , Mr Headstone , what is the name , ' he asked , again trying to make a diversion , ` of young Hexam 's sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 20]: ` Her name is Lizzie , ' said the schoolmaster , with a strong contraction of his whole face .
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 16]: ` She is a young woman of a remarkable character ; is she not ? '
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 53]: ` She is sufficiently remarkable to be very superior to Mr Eugene Wrayburn -- though an ordinary person might be that , ' said the schoolmaster ; ` and I hope you will not think it impertinent in me , sir , to ask why you put the two names together ? '
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 10]: ` By mere accident , ' returned the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 30]: ` Observing that Mr Wrayburn was a disagreeable subject with you , I tried to get away from it : though not very successfully , it would appear . '
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 10]: ` Do you know Mr Wrayburn , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 20]: ` Then perhaps the names can not be put together on the authority of any representation of his ? '
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 6]: ` Certainly not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 37]: I took the liberty to ask , ' said Bradley , after casting his eyes on the ground , ` because he is capable of making any representation , in the swaggering levity of his insolence .
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 12]: I -- I hope you will not misunderstand me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 22]: I -- I am much interested in this brother and sister , and the subject awakens very strong feelings within me .
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 8]: Very , very , strong feelings . '
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 15]: With a shaking hand , Bradley took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 40]: The Secretary thought , as he glanced at the schoolmaster 's face , that he had opened a channel here indeed , and that it was an unexpectedly dark and deep and stormy one , and difficult to sound .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 21]: All at once , in the midst of his turbulent emotions , Bradley stopped and seemed to challenge his look .
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 17]: Much as though he suddenly asked him , ` What do you see in me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 44]: ` The brother , young Hexam , was your real recommendation here , ' said the Secretary , quietly going back to the point ; ` Mr and Mrs Boffin happening to know , through Mr Lightwood , that he was your pupil .
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 42]: Anything that I ask respecting the brother and sister , or either of them , I ask for myself out of my own interest in the subject , and not in my official character , or on Mr Boffin 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 12]: How I come to be interested , I need not explain .
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 16]: You know the father 's connection with the discovery of Mr Harmon 's body . '
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 22]: ` Sir , ' replied Bradley , very restlessly indeed , ' I know all the circumstances of that case . '
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 13]: ` Pray tell me , Mr Headstone , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 33]: ` Does the sister suffer under any stigma because of the impossible accusation -- groundless would be a better word -- that was made against the father , and substantially withdrawn ? '
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 16]: ` No , sir , ' returned Bradley , with a kind of anger . '
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 9]: I am very glad to hear it . '
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 58]: ` The sister , ' said Bradley , separating his words over-carefully , and speaking as if he were repeating them from a book , ` suffers under no reproach that repels a man of unimpeachable character who had made for himself every step of his way in life , from placing her in his own station .
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 20]: I will not say , raising her to his own station ; I say , placing her in it .
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 16]: The sister labours under no reproach , unless she should unfortunately make it for herself .
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 41]: When such a man is not deterred from regarding her as his equal , and when he has convinced himself that there is no blemish on her , I think the fact must be taken to be pretty expressive . '
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 9]: ` And there is such a man ? '
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 4]: said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 45]: Bradley Headstone knotted his brows , and squared his large lower jaw , and fixed his eyes on the ground with an air of determination that seemed unnecessary to the occasion , as he replied : ` And there is such a man . '
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 17]: The Secretary had no reason or excuse for prolonging the conversation , and it ended here .
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 38]: Within three hours the oakumheaded apparition once more dived into the Leaving Shop , and that night Rogue Riderhood 's recantation lay in the post office , addressed under cover to Lizzie Hexam at her right address .
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 23]: All these proceedings occupied John Rokesmith so much , that it was not until the following day that he saw Bella again .
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 38]: It seemed then to be tacitly understood between them that they were to be as distantly easy as they could , without attracting the attention of Mr and Mrs Boffin to any marked change in their manner .
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 27]: The fitting out of old Betty Higden was favourable to this , as keeping Bella engaged and interested , and as occupying the general attention . '
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 99]: I think , ' said Rokesmith , when they all stood about her , while she packed her tidy basket -- except Bella , who was busily helping on her knees at the chair on which it stood ; ` that at least you might keep a letter in your pocket , Mrs Higden , which I would write for you and date from here , merely stating , in the names of Mr and Mrs Boffin , that they are your friends ; -- I wo n't say patrons , because they would n't like it . '
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 16]: ` No , no , no , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` no patronizing !
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 13]: Let 's keep out of THAT , whatever we come to . '
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 20]: ` There 's more than enough of that about , without us ; ai n't there , Noddy ? '
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 5]: said Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 8]: I believe you , old lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 5]: returned the Golden Dustman .
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 5]: ` Overmuch indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 16]: ` But people sometimes like to be patronized ; do n't they , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 7]: asked Bella , looking up . '
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 19]: And if THEY do , my dear , they ought to learn better , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 51]: ` Patrons and Patronesses , and Vice-Patrons and Vice-Patronesses , and Deceased Patrons and Deceased Patronesses , and Ex-Vice-Patrons and Ex-Vice-Patronesses , what does it all mean in the books of the Charities that come pouring in on Rokesmith as he sits among 'em pretty well up to his neck !
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 29]: If Mr Tom Noakes gives his five shillings ai n't he a Patron , and if Mrs Jack Styles gives her five shillings ai n't she a Patroness ?
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 8]: What the deuce is it all about ?
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 15]: If it ai n't stark staring impudence , what do you call it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 13]: ` Do n't be warm , Noddy , ' Mrs Boffin urged .
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 4]: ` Warm ! '
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 4]: cried Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 11]: ` It 's enough to make a man smoking hot .
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 9]: I ca n't go anywhere without being Patronized .
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 8]: I do n't want to be Patronized .
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 45]: If I buy a ticket for a Flower Show , or a Music Show , or any sort of Show , and pay pretty heavy for it , why am I to be Patroned and Patronessed as if the Patrons and Patronesses treated me ?
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 20]: If there 's a good thing to be done , ca n't it be done on its own merits ?
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 19]: If there 's a bad thing to be done , can it ever be Patroned and Patronessed right ?
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 41]: Yet when a new Institution 's going to be built , it seems to me that the bricks and mortar ai n't made of half so much consequence as the Patrons and Patronesses ; no , nor yet the objects .
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 20]: I wish somebody would tell me whether other countries get Patronized to anything like the extent of this one !
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 18]: And as to the Patrons and Patronesses themselves , I wonder they 're not ashamed of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 21]: They ai n't Pills , or Hair-Washes , or Invigorating Nervous Essences , to be puffed in that way ! '
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 31]: Having delivered himself of these remarks , Mr Boffin took a trot , according to his usual custom , and trotted back to the spot from which he had started .
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 22]: ` As to the letter , Rokesmith , ' said Mr Boffin , ` you 're as right as a trivet .
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 19]: Give her the letter , make her take the letter , put it in her pocket by violence .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 5]: She might fall sick .
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 12]: You know you might fall sick , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 19]: ` Do n't deny it , Mrs Higden , in your obstinacy ; you know you might . '
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 16]: Old Betty laughed , and said that she would take the letter and be thankful .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 6]: ` That 's right ! '
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 4]: That 's sensible .
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 22]: And do n't be thankful to us -LRB- for we never thought of it -RRB- , but to Mr Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 15]: The letter was written , and read to her , and given to her .
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 9]: ` Now , how do you feel ? '
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 7]: ` Do you like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 7]: ` The letter , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 3]: said Betty .
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 10]: ` Ay , it 's a beautiful letter ! '
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 20]: ` No , no , no ; not the letter , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` the idea .
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 15]: Are you sure you 're strong enough to carry out the idea ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 26]: I shall be stronger , and keep the deadness off better , this way , than any way left open to me , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 26]: ` Do n't say than any way left open , you know , ' urged Mr Boffin ; ` because there are ways without end .
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 14]: A housekeeper would be acceptable over yonder at the Bower , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 30]: Would n't you like to see the Bower , and know a retired literary man of the name of Wegg that lives there -- WITH a wooden leg ? '
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 20]: Old Betty was proof even against this temptation , and fell to adjusting her black bonnet and shawl . '
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 54]: I would n't let you go , now it comes to this , after all , ' said Mr Boffin , ` if I did n't hope that it may make a man and a workman of Sloppy , in as short a time as ever a man and workman was made yet .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 10]: Why , what have you got there , Betty ?
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 5]: Not a doll ? '
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 17]: It was the man in the Guards who had been on duty over Johnny 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 18]: The solitary old woman showed what it was , and put it up quietly in her dress .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 51]: Then , she gratefully took leave of Mrs Boffin , and of Mr Boffin , and of Rokesmith , and then put her old withered arms round Bella 's young and blooming neck , and said , repeating Johnny 's words : ' A kiss for the boofer lady . '
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 48]: The Secretary looked on from a doorway at the boofer lady thus encircled , and still looked on at the boofer lady standing alone there , when the determined old figure with its steady bright eyes was trudging through the streets , away from paralysis and pauperism .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 23]: Chapter 15 THE WHOLE CASE SO FAR Bradley Headstone held fast by that other interview he was to have with Lizzie Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 24]: In stipulating for it , he had been impelled by a feeling little short of desperation , and the feeling abided by him .
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 35]: It was very soon after his interview with the Secretary , that he and Charley Hexam set out one leaden evening , not unnoticed by Miss Peecher , to have this desperate interview accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 24]: ` That dolls ' dressmaker , ' said Bradley , ` is favourable neither to me nor to you , Hexam . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 9]: A pert crooked little chit , Mr Headstone !
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 25]: I knew she would put herself in the way , if she could , and would be sure to strike in with something impertinent .
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 20]: It was on that account that I proposed our going to the City to-night and meeting my sister . '
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 20]: ` So I supposed , ' said Bradley , getting his gloves on his nervous hands as he walked .
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 6]: ` So I supposed . '
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 20]: ` Nobody but my sister , ' pursued Charley , ` would have found out such an extraordinary companion .
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 15]: She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another .
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 13]: She told me so , that night when we went there . '
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 12]: ` Why should she give herself up to the dressmaker ? '
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 3]: asked Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 6]: said the boy , colouring .
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 7]: ` One of her romantic ideas !
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 13]: I tried to convince her so , but I did n't succeed .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 26]: However , what we have got to do , is , to succeed to-night , Mr Headstone , and then all the rest follows . '
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 9]: ` You are still sanguine , Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 7]: ` Certainly I am , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 10]: Why , we have everything on our side . '
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 11]: ` Except your sister , perhaps , ' thought Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 11]: But he only gloomily thought it , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 14]: ` Everything on our side , ' repeated the boy with boyish confidence .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 15]: ` Respectability , an excellent connexion for me , common sense , everything ! '
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 31]: ` To be sure , your sister has always shown herself a devoted sister , ' said Bradley , willing to sustain himself on even that low ground of hope .
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 16]: ` Naturally , Mr Headstone , I have a good deal of influence with her .
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 28]: And now that you have honoured me with your confidence and spoken to me first , I say again , we have everything on our side . '
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 13]: And Bradley thought again , ` Except your sister , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 14]: A grey dusty withered evening in London city has not a hopeful aspect .
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 25]: The closed warehouses and offices have an air of death about them , and the national dread of colour has an air of mourning .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 99]: The towers and steeples of the many houseencompassed churches , dark and dingy as the sky that seems descending on them , are no relief to the general gloom ; a sun-dial on a church-wall has the look , in its useless black shade , of having failed in its business enterprise and stopped payment for ever ; melancholy waifs and strays of housekeepers and porter sweep melancholy waifs and strays of papers and pins into the kennels , and other more melancholy waifs and strays explore them , searching and stooping and poking for anything to sell .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 37]: The set of humanity outward from the City is as a set of prisoners departing from gaol , and dismal Newgate seems quite as fit a stronghold for the mighty Lord Mayor as his own state-dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 55]: On such an evening , when the city grit gets into the hair and eyes and skin , and when the fallen leaves of the few unhappy city trees grind down in corners under wheels of wind , the schoolmaster and the pupil emerged upon the Leadenhall Street region , spying eastward for Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 20]: Being something too soon in their arrival , they lurked at a corner , waiting for her to appear .
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 26]: The bestlooking among us will not look very well , lurking at a corner , and Bradley came out of that disadvantage very poorly indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 8]: ` Here she comes , Mr Headstone !
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 9]: Let us go forward and meet her . '
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 14]: As they advanced , she saw them coming , and seemed rather troubled .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 18]: But she greeted her brother with the usual warmth , and touched the extended hand of Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 13]: ` Why , where are you going , Charley , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 5]: she asked him then .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 3]: ` Nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 9]: We came on purpose to meet you . '
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 8]: ` To meet me , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 8]: We are going to walk with you .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 23]: But do n't let us take the great leading streets where every one walks , and we ca n't hear ourselves speak .
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 8]: Let us go by the quiet backways .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 15]: Here 's a large paved court by this church , and quiet , too .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 7]: Let us go up here . '
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 12]: ` But it 's not in the way , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 12]: ` Yes it is , ' said the boy , petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 14]: ` It 's in my way , and my way is yours . '
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 22]: She had not released his hand , and , still holding it , looked at him with a kind of appeal .
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 18]: He avoided her eyes , under pretence of saying , ` Come along , Mr Headstone . '
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 20]: Bradley walked at his side -- not at hers -- and the brother and sister walked hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 32]: The court brought them to a churchyard ; a paved square court , with a raised bank of earth about breast high , in the middle , enclosed by iron rails .
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 42]: Here , conveniently and heathfully elevated above the level of the living , were the dead , and the tombstones ; some of the latter droopingly inclined from the perpendicular , as if they were ashamed of the lies they told .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 35]: They paced the whole of this place once , in a constrained and uncomfortable manner , when the boy stopped and said : ` Lizzie , Mr Headstone has something to say to you .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 29]: I do n't wish to be an interruption either to him or to you , and so I 'll go and take a little stroll and come back .
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 35]: I know in a general way what Mr Headstone intends to say , and I very highly approve of it , as I hope -- and indeed I do not doubt -- you will .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 34]: I need n't tell you , Lizzie , that I am under great obligations to Mr Headstone , and that I am very anxious for Mr Headstone to succeed in all he undertakes .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 19]: As I hope -- and as , indeed , I do n't doubt -- you must be . '
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 24]: ` Charley , ' returned his sister , detaining his hand as he withdrew it , ' I think you had better stay .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 15]: I think Mr Headstone had better not say what he thinks of saying . '
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 12]: ` Why , how do you know what it is ? '
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 4]: returned the boy .
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 15]: ` Perhaps I do n't , but -- ' ` Perhaps you do n't ?
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 9]: No , Liz , I should think not .
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 16]: If you knew what it was , you would give me a very different answer .
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 8]: There ; let go ; be sensible .
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 14]: I wonder you do n't remember that Mr Headstone is looking on . '
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 32]: She allowed him to separate himself from her , and he , after saying , ` Now Liz , be a rational girl and a good sister , ' walked away .
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 23]: She remained standing alone with Bradley Headstone , and it was not until she raised her eyes , that he spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 26]: I said , ' he began , ` when I saw you last , that there was something unexplained , which might perhaps influence you .
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 9]: I have come this evening to explain it .
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 18]: I hope you will not judge of me by my hesitating manner when I speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 8]: You see me at my greatest disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 29]: It is most unfortunate for me that I wish you to see me at my best , and that I know you see me at my worst . '
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 16]: She moved slowly on when he paused , and he moved slowly on beside her .
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 48]: ` It seems egotistical to begin by saying so much about myself , ' he resumed , ` but whatever I say to you seems , even in my own ears , below what I want to say , and different from what I want to say .
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 6]: I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 4]: So it is .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 8]: You are the ruin of me . '
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 26]: She started at the passionate sound of the last words , and at the passionate action of his hands , with which they were accompanied .
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 14]: you are the ruin -- the ruin -- the ruin -- of me .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 30]: I have no resources in myself , I have no confidence in myself , I have no government of myself when you are near me or in my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 9]: And you are always in my thoughts now .
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 13]: I have never been quit of you since I first saw you .
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 10]: Oh , that was a wretched day for me !
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 9]: That was a wretched , miserable day ! '
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 39]: A touch of pity for him mingled with her dislike of him , and she said : ` Mr Headstone , I am grieved to have done you any harm , but I have never meant it . '
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 5]: he cried , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 22]: ` Now , I seem to have reproached you , instead of revealing to you the state of my own mind !
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 4]: Bear with me .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 10]: I am always wrong when you are in question .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 6]: It is my doom . '
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 47]: Struggling with himself , and by times looking up at the deserted windows of the houses as if there could be anything written in their grimy panes that would help him , he paced the whole pavement at her side , before he spoke again . '
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 20]: I must try to give expression to what is in my mind ; it shall and must be spoken .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 56]: Though you see me so confounded -- though you strike me so helpless -- I ask you to believe that there are many people who think well of me ; that there are some people who highly esteem me ; that I have in my way won a Station which is considered worth winning . '
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 11]: ` Surely , Mr Headstone , I do believe it .
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 11]: Surely I have always known it from Charley . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 63]: I ask you to believe that if I were to offer my home such as it is , my station such as it is , my affections such as they are , to any one of the best considered , and best qualified , and most distinguished , among the young women engaged in my calling , they would probably be accepted .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 6]: Even readily accepted . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 18]: I do not doubt it , ' said Lizzie , with her eyes upon the ground . '
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 49]: I have sometimes had it in my thoughts to make that offer and to settle down as many men of my class do : I on the one side of a school , my wife on the other , both of us interested in the same work . '
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 9]: ` Why have you not done so ? '
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 4]: asked Lizzie Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 9]: ` Why do you not do so ? '
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 8]: ` Far better that I never did !
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 72]: The only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks , ' he said , always speaking passionately , and , when most emphatic , repeating that former action of his hands , which was like flinging his heart 's blood down before her in drops upon the pavement-stones ; ` the only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks is , that I never did .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 35]: For if I had , and if the same spell had come upon me for my ruin , I know I should have broken that tie asunder as if it had been thread . '
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 15]: She glanced at him with a glance of fear , and a shrinking gesture .
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 9]: He answered , as if she had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 23]: It would not have been voluntary on my part , any more than it is voluntary in me to be here now .
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 6]: You draw me to you .
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 16]: If I were shut up in a strong prison , you would draw me out .
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 11]: I should break through the wall to come to you .
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 25]: If I were lying on a sick bed , you would draw me up -- to stagger to your feet and fall there . '
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 16]: The wild energy of the man , now quite let loose , was absolutely terrible .
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 26]: He stopped and laid his hand upon a piece of the coping of the burial-ground enclosure , as if he would have dislodged the stone .
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 15]: ` No man knows till the time comes , what depths are within him .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 14]: To some men it never comes ; let them rest and be thankful !
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 38]: To me , you brought it ; on me , you forced it ; and the bottom of this raging sea , ' striking himself upon the breast , ` has been heaved up ever since . '
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 9]: ` Mr Headstone , I have heard enough .
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 6]: Let me stop you here .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 11]: It will be better for you and better for me .
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 7]: Let us find my brother . '
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 4]: ` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 7]: It shall and must be spoken .
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 14]: I have been in torments ever since I stopped short of it before .
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 4]: You are alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 34]: It is another of my miseries that I can not speak to you or speak of you without stumbling at every syllable , unless I let the check go altogether and run mad .
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 8]: Here is a man lighting the lamps .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 6]: He will be gone directly .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 12]: I entreat of you let us walk round this place again .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 18]: You have no reason to look alarmed ; I can restrain myself , and I will . '
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 12]: She yielded to the entreaty -- how could she do otherwise !
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 9]: -- and they paced the stones in silence .
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 22]: One by one the lights leaped up making the cold grey church tower more remote , and they were alone again .
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 29]: He said no more until they had regained the spot where he had broken off ; there , he again stood still , and again grasped the stone .
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 22]: In saying what he said then , he never looked at her ; but looked at it and wrenched at it .
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 10]: ` You know what I am going to say .
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 4]: I love you .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 43]: What other men may mean when they use that expression , I can not tell ; what I mean is , that I am under the influence of some tremendous attraction which I have resisted in vain , and which overmasters me .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 51]: You could draw me to fire , you could draw me to water , you could draw me to the gallows , you could draw me to any death , you could draw me to anything I have most avoided , you could draw me to any exposure and disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 28]: This and the confusion of my thoughts , so that I am fit for nothing , is what I mean by your being the ruin of me .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 31]: But if you would return a favourable answer to my offer of myself in marringe , you could draw me to any good -- every good -- with equal force .
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 13]: My circumstances are quite easy , and you would want for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 14]: My reputation stands quite high , and would be a shield for yours .
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 40]: If you saw me at my work , able to do it well and respected in it , you might even come to take a sort of pride in me ; -- I would try hard that you should .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 24]: Whatever considerations I may have thought of against this offer , I have conquered , and I make it with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 35]: Your brother favours me to the utmost , and it is likely that we might live and work together ; anyhow , it is certain that he would have my best influence and support .
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 13]: I do n't know what I could say more if I tried .
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 13]: I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is .
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 26]: I only add that if it is any claim on you to be in earnest , I am in thorough earnest , dreadful earnest . '
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 21]: The powdered mortar from under the stone at which he wrenched , rattled on the pavement to confirm his words .
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 8]: ` Mr Headstone -- ' ` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 17]: I implore you , before you answer me , to walk round this place once more .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 24]: It will give you a minute 's time to think , and me a minute 's time to get some fortitude together . '
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 25]: Again she yielded to the entreaty , and again they came back to the same place , and again he worked at the stone .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 23]: ` Is it , ' he said , with his attention apparently engrossed by it , ` yes , or no ? '
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 29]: ` Mr Headstone , I thank you sincerely , I thank you gratefully , and hope you may find a worthy wife before long and be very happy .
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 6]: But it is no . '
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 15]: ` Is no short time necessary for reflection ; no weeks or days ? '
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 9]: he asked , in the same half-suffocated way .
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 5]: ` None whatever . '
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 20]: ` Are you quite decided , and is there no chance of any change in my favour ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 22]: I am quite decided , Mr Headstone , and I am bound to answer I am certain there is none . '
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 48]: ` Then , ' said he , suddenly changing his tone and turning to her , and bringing his clenched hand down upon the stone with a force that laid the knuckles raw and bleeding ; ` then I hope that I may never kill him ! '
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 54]: The dark look of hatred and revenge with which the words broke from his livid lips , and with which he stood holding out his smeared hand as if it held some weapon and had just struck a mortal blow , made her so afraid of him that she turned to run away .
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 8]: But he caught her by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 8]: ` Mr Headstone , let me go .
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 10]: Mr Headstone , I must call for help ! '
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 27]: ` It is I who should call for help , ' he said ; ` you do n't know yet how much I need it . '
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 53]: The working of his face as she shrank from it , glancing round for her brother and uncertain what to do , might have extorted a cry from her in another instant ; but all at once he sternly stopped it and fixed it , as if Death itself had done so .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 7]: You see I have recovered myself .
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 5]: Hear me out . '
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 40]: With much of the dignity of courage , as she recalled her selfreliant life and her right to be free from accountability to this man , she released her arm from his grasp and stood looking full at him .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 11]: She had never been so handsome , in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 25]: A shade came over them while he looked back at her , as if she drew the very light out of them to herself .
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 53]: ` This time , at least , I will leave nothing unsaid , ' he went on , folding his hands before him , clearly to prevent his being betrayed into any impetuous gesture ; ` this last time at least I will not be tortured with after-thoughts of a lost opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 5]: Mr Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 15]: ` Was it of him you spoke in your ungovernable rage and violence ? '
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 6]: Lizzie Hexam demanded with spirit .
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 16]: He bit his lip , and looked at her , and said never a word .
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 10]: ` Was it Mr Wrayburn that you threatened ? '
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 17]: He bit his lip again , and looked at her , and said never a word .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 15]: ` You asked me to hear you out , and you will not speak .
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 7]: Let me find my brother . '
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 3]: ` Stay !
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 6]: I threatened no one . '
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 11]: Her look dropped for an instant to his bleeding hand .
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 21]: He lifted it to his mouth , wiped it on his sleeve , and again folded it over the other .
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 9]: ` Mr Eugene Wrayburn , ' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 15]: ` Why do you mention that name again and again , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 15]: ` Because it is the text of the little I have left to say .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 2]: Observe !
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 7]: There are no threats in it .
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 15]: If I utter a threat , stop me , and fasten it upon me .
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 5]: Mr Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 20]: A worse threat than was conveyed in his manner of uttering the name , could hardly have escaped him .
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 5]: ` He haunts you .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 6]: You accept favours from him .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 9]: You are willing enough to listen to HIM .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 11]: I know it , as well as he does . '
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 35]: ` Mr Wrayburn has been considerate and good to me , sir , ' said Lizzie , proudly , ` in connexion with the death and with the memory of my poor father . '
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 4]: ` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 18]: He is of course a very considerate and a very good man , Mr Eugene Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 22]: ` He is nothing to you , I think , ' said Lizzie , with an indignation she could not repress .
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 7]: ` Oh yes , he is .
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 4]: There you mistake .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 7]: He is much to me . '
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 9]: ` What can he be to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 16]: ` He can be a rival to me among other things , ' said Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 27]: ` Mr Headstone , ' returned Lizzie , with a burning face , ` it is cowardly in you to speak to me in this way .
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 48]: But it makes me able to tell you that I do not like you , and that I never have liked you from the first , and that no other living creature has anything to do with the effect you have produced upon me for yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 25]: His head bent for a moment , as if under a weight , and he then looked up again , moistening his lips . '
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 13]: I was going on with the little I had left to say .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 19]: I knew all this about Mr Eugene Wrayhurn , all the while you were drawing me to you .
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 11]: I strove against the knowledge , but quite in vain .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 7]: It made no difference in me .
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 12]: With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind , I went on .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 15]: With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind , I spoke to you just now .
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 21]: With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind , I have been set aside and I have been cast out . '
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 26]: ` If you give those names to my thanking you for your proposal and declining it , is it my fault , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 25]: said Lizzie , compassionating the bitter struggle he could not conceal , almost as much as she was repelled and alarmed by it . '
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 17]: I am not complaining , ' he returned , ' I am only stating the case .
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 21]: I had to wrestle with my self-respect when I submitted to be drawn to you in spite of Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 11]: You may imagine how low my self-respect lies now . '
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 24]: She was hurt and angry ; but repressed herself in consideration of his suffering , and of his being her brother 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 33]: ` And it lies under his feet , ' said Bradley , unfolding his hands in spite of himself , and fiercely motioning with them both towards the stones of the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 4]: ` Remember that !
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 19]: It lies under that fellow 's feet , and he treads upon it and exults above it . '
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 6]: ` He does not ! '
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 3]: said Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 5]: ` He does ! '
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 4]: said Bradley . '
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 26]: I have stood before him face to face , and he crushed me down in the dirt of his contempt , and walked over me .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 14]: Because he knew with triumph what was in store for me to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 12]: ` O , Mr Headstone , you talk quite wildly . '
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 4]: ` Quite collectedly .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 8]: I know what I say too well .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 6]: Now I have said all .
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 31]: I have used no threat , remember ; I have done no more than show you how the case stands ; -- how the case stands , so far . '
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 11]: At this moment her brother sauntered into view close by .
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 12]: She darted to him , and caught him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 15]: Bradley followed , and laid his heavy hand on the boy 's opposite shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 9]: ` Charley Hexam , I am going home .
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 20]: I must walk home by myself to-night , and get shut up in my room without being spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 24]: Give me half an hour 's start , and let me be , till you find me at my work in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 14]: I shall be at my work in the morning just as usual . '
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 17]: Clasping his hands , he uttered a short unearthly broken cry , and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 43]: The brother and sister were left looking at one another near a lamp in the solitary churchyard , and the boy 's face clouded and darkened , as he said in a rough tone : ` What is the meaning of this ?
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 9]: What have you done to my best friend ?
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 6]: Out with the truth ! '
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 4]: ` Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 4]: said his sister .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 9]: ` Speak a little more considerately ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 21]: I am not in the humour for consideration , or for nonsense of any sort , ' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 7]: ` What have you been doing ?
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 12]: Why has Mr Headstone gone from us in that way ? '
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 19]: ` He asked me -- you know he asked me -- to be his wife , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 6]: said the boy , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 17]: ` And I was obliged to tell him that I could not be his wife . '
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 24]: ` You were obliged to tell him , ' repeated the boy angrily , between his teeth , and rudely pushing her away .
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 8]: ` You were obliged to tell him !
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 12]: Do you know that he is worth fifty of you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 17]: ` It may easily be so , Charley , but I can not marry him . '
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 25]: ` You mean that you are conscious that you ca n't appreciate him , and do n't deserve him , I suppose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 20]: I mean that I do not like him , Charley , and that I will never marry him . '
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 20]: ` Upon my soul , ' exclaimed the boy , ` you are a nice picture of a sister !
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 12]: Upon my soul , you are a pretty piece of disinterestedness !
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 39]: And so all my endeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world , and to raise you with me , are to be beaten down by YOUR low whims ; are they ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 9]: I will not reproach you , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 5]: ` Hear her ! '
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 10]: exclaimed the boy , looking round at the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 7]: ` She wo n't reproach me !
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 19]: She does her best to destroy my fortunes and her own , and she wo n't reproach me !
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 43]: Why , you 'll tell me , next , that you wo n't reproach Mr Headstone for coming out of the sphere to which he is an ornament , and putting himself at YOUR feet , to be rejected by YOU ! '
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 47]: ` No , Charley ; I will only tell you , as I told himself , that I thank him for doing so , that I am sorry he did so , and that I hope he will do much better , and be happy . '
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 44]: Some touch of compunction smote the boy 's hardening heart as he looked upon her , his patient little nurse in infancy , his patient friend , adviser , and reclaimer in boyhood , the self-forgetting sister who had done everything for him .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 12]: His tone relented , and he drew her arm through his .
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 26]: ` Now , come , Liz ; do n't let us quarrel : let us be reasonable and talk this over like brother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 7]: Will you listen to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 6]: ` Oh , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 22]: she replied through her starting tears ; ` do I not listen to you , and hear many hard things ! '
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 6]: ` Then I am sorry .
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 4]: There , Liz !
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 5]: I am unfeignedly sorry .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 8]: Only you do put me out so .
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 3]: Now see .
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 8]: Mr Headstone is perfectly devoted to you .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 29]: He has told me in the strongest manner that he has never been his old self for one single minute since I first brought him to see you .
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 39]: Miss Peecher , our schoolmistress -- pretty and young , and all that -- is known to be very much attached to him , and he wo n't so much as look at her or hear of her .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 16]: Now , his devotion to you must be a disinterested one ; must n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 24]: If he married Miss Peecher , he would be a great deal better off in all worldly respects , than in marrying you .
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 15]: Well then ; he has nothing to get by it , has he ? '
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 7]: ` Nothing , Heaven knows ! '
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 23]: ` Very well then , ' said the boy ; ` that 's something in his favour , and a great thing .
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 5]: Then I come in .
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 41]: Mr Headstone has always got me on , and he has a good deal in his power , and of course if he was my brother-in-law he would n't get me on less , but would get me on more .
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 38]: Mr Headstone comes and confides in me , in a very delicate way , and says , `` I hope my marrying your sister would be agreeable to you , Hexam , and useful to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 23]: I say , `` There 's nothing in the world , Mr Headstone , that I could he better pleased with . ''
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 26]: Mr Headstone says , `` Then I may rely upon your intimate knowledge of me for your good word with your sister , Hexam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 23]: And I say , `` Certainly , Mr Headstone , and naturally I have a good deal of influence with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 11]: So I have ; have n't I , Liz ? '
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 6]: ` Yes , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 4]: ` Well said !
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 27]: Now , you see , we begin to get on , the moment we begin to be really talking it over , like brother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 5]: Then YOU come in .
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 70]: As Mr Headstone 's wife you would be occupying a most respectable station , and you would be holding a far better place in society than you hold now , and you would at length get quit of the river-side and the old disagreeables belonging to it , and you would be rid for good of dolls ' dressmakers and their drunken fathers , and the like of that .
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 35]: Not that I want to disparage Miss Jenny Wren : I dare say she is all very well in her way ; but her way is not your way as Mr Headstone 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 32]: Now , you see , Liz , on all three accounts -- on Mr Headstone 's , on mine , on yours -- nothing could be better or more desirable . '
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 23]: They were walking slowly as the boy spoke , and here he stood still , to see what effect he had made .
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 28]: His sister 's eyes were fixed upon him ; but as they showed no yielding , and as she remained silent , he walked her on again .
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 18]: There was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed , though he tried to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 40]: ` Having so much influence with you , Liz , as I have , perhaps I should have done better to have had a little chat with you in the first instance , before Mr Headstone spoke for himself .
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 35]: But really all this in his favour seemed so plain and undeniable , and I knew you to have always been so reasonable and sensible , that I did n't consider it worth while .
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 9]: Very likely that was a mistake of mine .
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 8]: However , it 's soon set right .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 46]: All that need be done to set it right , is for you to tell me at once that I may go home and tell Mr Headstone that what has taken place is not final , and that it will all come round by-and-by . '
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 4]: He stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 16]: The pale face looked anxiously and lovingly at him , but she shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 7]: ` Ca n't you speak ? '
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 6]: said the boy sharply . '
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 9]: I am very unwilling to speak , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 7]: If I must , I must .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 28]: I can not authorize you to say any such thing to Mr Headstone : I can not allow you to say any such thing to Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 23]: Nothing remains to be said to him from me , after what I have said for good and all , to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 23]: ` And this girl , ' cried the boy , contemptuously throwing her off again , ` calls herself a sister ! '
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 17]: ` Charley , dear , that is the second time that you have almost struck me .
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 8]: Do n't be hurt by my words .
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 8]: I do n't mean -- Heaven forbid !
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 22]: -- that you intended it ; but you hardly know with what a sudden swing you removed yourself from me . '
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 4]: ` However ! '
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 33]: said the boy , taking no heed of the remonstrance , and pursuing his own mortified disappointment , ' I know what this means , and you shall not disgrace me . '
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 16]: ` It means what I have told you , Charley , and nothing more . '
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 23]: ` That 's not true , ' said the boy in a violent tone , ` and you know it 's not .
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 14]: It means your precious Mr Wrayburn ; that 's what it means . '
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 13]: If you remember any old days of ours together , forbear ! '
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 15]: ` But you shall not disgrace me , ' doggedly pursued the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 21]: I am determined that after I have climbed up out of the mire , you shall not pull me down .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 28]: You ca n't disgrace me if I have nothing to do with you , and I will have nothing to do with you for the future . '
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 29]: On many a night like this , and many a worse night , I have sat on the stones of the street , hushing you in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 28]: Unsay those words without even saying you are sorry for them , and my arms are open to you still , and so is my heart . '
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 7]: ` I 'll not unsay them .
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 6]: I 'll say them again .
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 19]: You are an inveterately bad girl , and a false sister , and I have done with you .
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 10]: For ever , I have done with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 28]: He threw up his ungrateful and ungracious hand as if it set up a barrier between them , and flung himself upon his heel and left her .
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 27]: She remained impassive on the same spot , silent and motionless , until the striking of the church clock roused her , and she turned away .
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 28]: But then , with the breaking up of her immobility came the breaking up of the waters that the cold heart of the selfish boy had frozen .
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 13]: And ' O that I were lying here with the dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 21]: and ' O Charley , Charley , that this should be the end of our pictures in the fire ! '
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 20]: were all the words she said , as she laid her face in her hands on the stone coping .
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 17]: A figure passed by , and passed on , but stopped and looked round at her .
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 25]: It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head , wearing a large brimmed low-crowned hat , and a long-skirted coat .
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 44]: After hesitating a little , the figure turned back , and , advancing with an air of gentleness and compassion , said : ` Pardon me , young woman , for speaking to you , but you are under some distress of mind .
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 23]: I can not pass upon my way and leave you weeping here alone , as if there was nothing in the place .
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 5]: Can I help you ?
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 10]: Can I do anything to give you comfort ? '
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 27]: She raised her head at the sound of these kind words , and answered gladly , ` O , Mr Riah , is it you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 15]: ` My daughter , ' said the old man , ' I stand amazed !
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 7]: I spoke as to a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 8]: Take my arm , take my arm .
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 4]: What grieves you ?
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 5]: Who has done this ?
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 7]: Poor girl , poor girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 18]: ` My brother has quarrelled with me , ' sobbed Lizzie , ` and renounced me . '
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 14]: ` He is a thankless dog , ' said the Jew , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 6]: ` Let him go . '
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 11]: Shake the dust from thy feet and let him go .
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 4]: Come , daughter !
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 39]: Come home with me -- it is but across the road -- and take a little time to recover your peace and to make your eyes seemly , and then I will bear you company through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 31]: For it is past your usual time , and will soon be late , and the way is long , and there is much company out of doors to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 17]: She accepted the support he offered her , and they slowly passed out of the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 39]: They were in the act of emerging into the main thoroughfare , when another figure loitering discontentedly by , and looking up the street and down it , and all about , started and exclaimed , ` Lizzie !
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 7]: why , where have you been ?
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 8]: Why , what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 19]: As Eugene Wrayburn thus addressed her , she drew closer to the Jew , and bent her head .
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 25]: The Jew having taken in the whole of Eugene at one sharp glance , cast his eyes upon the ground , and stood mute .
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 9]: ` Lizzie , what is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 11]: ` Mr Wrayburn , I can not tell you now .
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 14]: I can not tell you to-night , if I ever can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 5]: Pray leave me . '
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 12]: ` But , Lizzie , I came expressly to join you .
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 21]: I came to walk home with you , having dined at a coffee-house in this neighbourhood and knowing your hour .
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 31]: And I have been lingering about , ' added Eugene , ` like a bailiff ; or , ' with a look at Riah , ` an old clothesman . '
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 18]: The Jew lifted up his eyes , and took in Eugene once more , at another glance .
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 14]: ` Mr Wrayburn , pray , pray , leave me with this protector .
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 5]: And one thing more .
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 9]: Pray , pray be careful of yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 6]: ` Mysteries of Udolpho ! '
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 9]: said Eugene , with a look of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 23]: ` May I be excused for asking , in the elderly gentleman 's presence , who is this kind protector ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 9]: A trustworthy friend , ' said Lizzie . '
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 12]: I will relieve him of his trust , ' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 15]: ` But you must tell me , Lizzie , what is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 19]: ` Her brother is the matter , ' said the old man , lifting up his eyes again .
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 7]: ` Our brother the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 7]: returned Eugene , with airy contempt .
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 14]: ` Our brother is not worth a thought , far less a tear .
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 7]: What has our brother done ? '
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 29]: The old man lifted up his eyes again , with one grave look at Wrayburn , and one grave glance at Lizzie , as she stood looking down .
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 25]: Both were so full of meaning that even Eugene was checked in his light career , and subsided into a thoughtful ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 51]: With an air of perfect patience the old man , remaining mute and keeping his eyes cast down , stood , retaining Lizzie 's arm , as though in his habit of passive endurance , it would be all one to him if he had stood there motionless all night .
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 42]: ` If Mr Aaron , ' said Eugene , who soon found this fatiguing , ` will be good enough to relinquish his charge to me , he will be quite free for any engagement he may have at the Synagogue .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 10]: Mr Aaron , will you have the kindness ? '
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 8]: But the old man stood stock still .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 21]: ` Good evening , Mr Aaron , ' said Eugene , politely ; ` we need not detain you . '
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 16]: Then turning to Lizzie , ` Is our friend Mr Aaron a little deaf ? '
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 43]: ` My hearing is very good , Christian gentleman , ' replied the old man , calmly ; ` but I will hear only one voice to-night , desiring me to leave this damsel before I have conveyed her to her home .
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 10]: If she requests it , I will do it .
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 10]: I will do it for no one else . '
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 11]: ` May I ask why so , Mr Aaron ? '
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 9]: said Eugene , quite undisturbed in his ease .
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 4]: ` Excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 17]: If she asks me , I will tell her , ' replied the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 9]: I will tell no one else . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 20]: I do not ask you , ' said Lizzie , ` and I beg you to take me home .
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 27]: Mr Wrayburn , I have had a bitter trial to-night , and I hope you will not think me ungrateful , or mysterious , or changeable .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 8]: I am neither ; I am wretched .
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 8]: Pray remember what I said to you .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 8]: Pray , pray , take care . '
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 26]: ` My dear Lizzie , ' he returned , in a low voice , bending over her on the other side ; ` of what ?
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 4]: Of whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 13]: ` Of any one you have lately seen and made angry . '
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 7]: He snapped his fingers and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 29]: ` Come , ' said he , ` since no better may be , Mr Aaron and I will divide this trust , and see you home together .
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 10]: Mr Aaron on that side ; I on this .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 14]: If perfectly agreeable to Mr Aaron , the escort will now proceed . '
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 7]: He knew his power over her .
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 12]: He knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her .
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 23]: He knew that , her fears for him being aroused , she would be uneasy if he were out of her sight .
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 22]: For all his seeming levity and carelessness , he knew whatever he chose to know of the thoughts of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 73]: And going on at her side , so gaily , regardless of all that had been urged against him ; so superior in his sallies and self-possession to the gloomy constraint of her suitor and the selfish petulance of her brother ; so faithful to her , as it seemed , when her own stock was faithless ; what an immense advantage , what an overpowering influence , were his that night !
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 110]: Add to the rest , poor girl , that she had heard him vilified for her sake , and that she had suffered for his , and where the wonder that his occasional tones of serious interest -LRB- setting off his carelessness , as if it were assumed to calm her -RRB- , that his lightest touch , his lightest look , his very presence beside her in the dark common street , were like glimpses of an enchanted world , which it was natural for jealousy and malice and all meanness to be unable to bear the brightness of , and to gird at as bad spirits might .
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 18]: Nothing more being said of repairing to Riah 's , they went direct to Lizzie 's lodging .
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 16]: A little short of the house-door she parted from them , and went in alone .
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 35]: ` Mr Aaron , ' said Eugene , when they were left together in the street , ` with many thanks for your company , it remains for me unwillingly to say Farewell . '
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 26]: ` Sir , ' returned the other , ' I give you good night , and I wish that you were not so thoughtless . '
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 34]: ` Mr Aaron , ' returned Eugene , ' I give you good night , and I wish -LRB- for you are a little dull -RRB- that you were not so thoughtful . '
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 33]: But now , that his part was played out for the evening , and when in turning his back upon the Jew he came off the stage , he was thoughtful himself .
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 9]: ` How did Lightwood 's catechism run ? '
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 11]: he murmured , as he stopped to light his cigar .
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 8]: ` What is to come of it ?
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 5]: What are you doing ?
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 5]: Where are you going ?
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 6]: We shall soon know now .
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 3]: Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 5]: with a heavy sigh .
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 58]: The heavy sigh was repeated as if by an echo , an hour afterwards , when Riah , who had been sitting on some dark steps in a corner over against the house , arose and went his patient way ; stealing through the streets in his ancient dress , like the ghost of a departed Time .
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 52]: Chapter 16 AN ANNIVERSARY OCCASION The estimable Twemlow , dressing himself in his lodgings over the stable-yard in Duke Street , Saint James 's , and hearing the horses at their toilette below , finds himself on the whole in a disadvantageous position as compared with the noble animals at livery .
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 103]: For whereas , on the one hand , he has no attendant to slap him soundingly and require him in gruff accents to come up and come over , still , on the other hand , he has no attendant at all ; and the mild gentleman 's finger-joints and other joints working rustily in the morning , he could deem it agreeable even to be tied up by the countenance at his chamber-door , so he were there skilfully rubbed down and slushed and sluiced and polished and clothed , while himself taking merely a passive part in these trying transactions .
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 105]: How the fascinating Tippins gets on when arraying herself for the bewilderment of the senses of men , is known only to the Graces and her maid ; but perhaps even that engaging creature , though not reduced to the self-dependence of Twemlow could dispense with a good deal of the trouble attendant on the daily restoration of her charms , seeing that as to her face and neck this adorable divinity is , as it were , a diurnal species of lobster -- throwing off a shell every forenoon , and needing to keep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens .
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 24]: Howbeit , Twemlow doth at length invest himself with collar and cravat and wristbands to his knuckles , and goeth forth to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 32]: And to breakfast with whom but his near neighbours , the Lammles of Sackville Street , who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman , Mr Fledgely .
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 39]: The awful Snigsworth might taboo and prohibit Fledgely , but the peaceable Twemlow reasons , If he IS my kinsman I did n't make him so , and to meet a man is not to know him . '
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 54]: It is the first anniversary of the happy marriage of Mr and Mrs Lammle , and the celebration is a breakfast , because a dinner on the desired scale of sumptuosity can not be achieved within less limits than those of the non-existent palatial residence of which so many people are madly envious .
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 33]: So , Twemlow trips with not a little stiffness across Piccadilly , sensible of having once been more upright in figure and less in danger of being knocked down by swift vehicles .
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 63]: To be sure that was in the days when he hoped for leave from the dread Snigsworth to do something , or be something , in life , and before that magnificent Tartar issued the ukase , ` As he will never distinguish himself , he must be a poor gentleman-pensioner of mine , and let him hereby consider himself pensioned . '
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 3]: my Twemlow !
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 96]: Say , little feeble grey personage , what thoughts are in thy breast to-day , of the Fancy -- so still to call her who bruised thy heart when it was green and thy head brown -- and whether it be better or worse , more painful or less , to believe in the Fancy to this hour , than to know her for a greedy armourplated crocodile , with no more capacity of imagining the delicate and sensitive and tender spot behind thy waistcoat , than of going straight at it with a knitting-needle .
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 54]: Say likewise , my Twemlow , whether it be the happier lot to be a poor relation of the great , or to stand in the wintry slush giving the hack horses to drink out of the shallow tub at the coach-stand , into which thou has so nearly set thy uncertain foot .
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 8]: Twemlow says nothing , and goes on .
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 20]: As he approaches the Lammles ' door , drives up a little one-horse carriage , containing Tippins the divine .
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 24]: Tippins , letting down the window , playfully extols the vigilance of her cavalier in being in waiting there to hand her out .
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 21]: Twemlow hands her out with as much polite gravity as if she were anything real , and they proceed upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 23]: Tippins all abroad about the legs , and seeking to express that those unsteady articles are only skipping in their native buoyancy .
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 40]: And dear Mrs Lammle and dear Mr Lammle , how do you do , and when are you going down to what 's - its-name place -- Guy , Earl of Warwick , you know -- what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 11]: -- Dun Cow -- to claim the flitch of bacon ?
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 34]: And Mortimer , whose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers , by reason first of fickleness and then of base desertion , how do YOU do , wretch ?
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 7]: And Mr Wrayburn , YOU here !
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 21]: What can YOU come for , because we are all very sure before-hand that you are not going to talk !
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 27]: And Veneering , M.P. , how are things going on down at the house , and when will you turn out those terrible people for us ?
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 30]: And Mrs Veneering , my dear , can it positively be true that you go down to that stifling place night after night , to hear those men prose ?
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 37]: Talking of which , Veneering , why do n't you prose , for you have n't opened your lips there yet , and we are dying to hear what you have got to say to us !
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 8]: Miss Podsnap , charmed to see you .
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 4]: Pa , here ?
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 4]: Ma , neither ?
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 3]: Mr Boots !
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 2]: Delighted .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 3]: Mr Brewer !
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 8]: This IS a gathering of the clans .
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 31]: Thus Tippins , and surveys Fledgeby and outsiders through golden glass , murmuring as she turns about and about , in her innocent giddy way , Anybody else I know ?
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 6]: No , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 3]: Nobody there .
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 3]: Nobody THERE .
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 3]: Nobody anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 22]: Mr Lammle , all a-glitter , produces his friend Fledgeby , as dying for the honour of presentation to Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 72]: Fledgeby presented , has the air of going to say something , has the air of going to say nothing , has an air successively of meditation , of resignation , and of desolation , backs on Brewer , makes the tour of Boots , and fades into the extreme background , feeling for his whisker , as if it might have turned up since he was there five minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 20]: But Lammle has him out again before he has so much as completely ascertained the bareness of the land .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 20]: He would seem to be in a bad way , Fledgeby ; for Lammle represents him as dying again .
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 12]: He is dying now , of want of presentation to Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 5]: Twemlow offers his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 5]: Glad to see him .
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 14]: ` Your mother , sir , was a connexion of mine . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 19]: I believe so , ' says Fledgeby , ` but my mother and her family were two . '
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 8]: ` Are you staying in town ? '
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 4]: asks Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 8]: I always am , ' says Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 9]: ` You like town , ' says Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 23]: But is felled flat by Fledgeby 's taking it quite ill , and replying , No , he do n't like town .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 20]: Lammle tries to break the force of the fall , by remarking that some people do not like town .
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 20]: Fledgeby retorting that he never heard of any such case but his own , Twemlow goes down again heavily .
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 12]: ` There is nothing new this morning , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 11]: says Twemlow , returning to the mark with great spirit .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 7]: Fledgeby has not heard of anything .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 15]: ` No , there 's not a word of news , ' says Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 9]: ` Not a particle , ' adds Boots .
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 10]: ` Not an atom , ' chimes in Brewer .
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 29]: Somehow the execution of this little concerted piece appears to raise the general spirits as with a sense of duty done , and sets the company a going .
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 19]: Everybody seems more equal than before , to the calamity of being in the society of everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 31]: Even Eugene standing in a window , moodily swinging the tassel of a blind , gives it a smarter jerk now , as if he found himself in better case .
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 3]: Breakfast announced .
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 35]: Everything on table showy and gaudy , but with a self-assertingly temporary and nomadic air on the decorations , as boasting that they will be much more showy and gaudy in the palatial residence .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 42]: Mr Lammle 's own particular servant behind his chair ; the Analytical behind Veneering 's chair ; instances in point that such servants fall into two classes : one mistrusting the master 's acquaintances , and the other mistrusting the master .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 10]: Mr Lammle 's servant , of the second class .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 30]: Appearing to be lost in wonder and low spirits because the police are so long in coming to take his master up on some charge of the first magnitude .
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 39]: Veneering , M.P. , on the right of Mrs Lammle ; Twemlow on her left ; Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. -LRB- wife of Member of Parliament -RRB- , and Lady Tippins on Mr Lammle 's right and left .
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 19]: But be sure that well within the fascination of Mr Lammle 's eye and smile sits little Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 21]: And be sure that close to little Georgiana , also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman , sits Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 35]: Oftener than twice or thrice while breakfast is in progress , Mr Twemlow gives a little sudden turn towards Mrs Lammle , and then says to her , ' I beg your pardon ! '
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 15]: This not being Twemlow 's usual way , why is it his way to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 41]: Why , the truth is , Twemlow repeatedly labours under the impression that Mrs Lammle is going to speak to him , and turning finds that it is not so , and mostly that she has her eyes upon Veneering .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 17]: Strange that this impression so abides by Twemlow after being corrected , yet so it is .
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 30]: Lady Tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth -LRB- including grape-juice in the category -RRB- becomes livelier , and applies herself to elicit sparks from Mortimer Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 32]: It is always understood among the initiated , that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to Lady Tippins , who will then strike conversational fire out of him .
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 58]: In a pause of mastication and deglutition , Lady Tippins , contemplating Mortimer , recalls that it was at our dear Veneerings , and in the presence of a party who are surely all here , that he told them his story of the man from somewhere , which afterwards became so horribly interesting and vulgarly popular .
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 23]: ` Yes , Lady Tippins , ' assents Mortimer ; ` as they say on the stage , `` Even so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 24]: ` Then we expect you , ' retorts the charmer , ` to sustain your reputation , and tell us something else . '
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 25]: ` Lady Tippins , I exhausted myself for life that day , and there is nothing more to be got out of me . '
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 52]: Mortimer parries thus , with a sense upon him that elsewhere it is Eugene and not he who is the jester , and that in these circles where Eugene persists in being speechless , he , Mortimer , is but the double of the friend on whom he has founded himself .
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 21]: ` But , ' quoth the fascinating Tippins , ' I am resolved on getting something more out of you .
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 2]: Traitor !
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 10]: what is this I hear about another disappearance ? '
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 22]: ` As it is you who have heard it , ' returns Lightwood , ` perhaps you 'll tell us . '
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 6]: ` Monster , away ! '
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 4]: retorts Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 11]: ` Your own Golden Dustman referred me to you . '
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 23]: Mr Lammle , striking in here , proclaims aloud that there is a sequel to the story of the man from somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 7]: Silence ensues upon the proclamation . '
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 21]: I assure you , ' says Lightwood , glancing round the table , ' I have nothing to tell . '
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 18]: But Eugene adding in a low voice , ` There , tell it , tell it ! '
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 13]: he corrects himself with the addition , ` Nothing worth mentioning . '
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 17]: Boots and Brewer immediately perceive that it is immensely worth mentioning , and become politely clamorous .
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 12]: Veneering is also visited by a perception to the same effect .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 28]: But it is understood that his attention is now rather used up , and difficult to hold , that being the tone of the House of Commons .
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 34]: ` Pray do n't be at the trouble of composing yourselves to listen , ' says Mortimer Lightwood , ` because I shall have finished long before you have fallen into comfortable attitudes .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 59]: It 's like -- ' ` It 's like , ' impatiently interrupts Eugene , ` the children 's narrative : `` I 'll tell you a story Of Jack a Manory , And now my story 's begun ; I 'll tell you another Of Jack and his brother , And now my story is done . ''
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 10]: -- Get on , and get it over ! '
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 50]: Eugene says this with a sound of vexation in his voice , leaning back in his chair and looking balefully at Lady Tippins , who nods to him as her dear Bear , and playfully insinuates that she -LRB- a selfevident proposition -RRB- is Beauty , and he Beast .
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 29]: ` The reference , ' proceeds Mortimer , ` which I suppose to be made by my honourable and fair enslaver opposite , is to the following circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 65]: Very lately , the young woman , Lizzie Hexam , daughter of the late Jesse Hexam , otherwise Gaffer , who will be remembered to have found the body of the man from somewhere , mysteriously received , she knew not from whom , an explicit retraction of the charges made against her father , by another water-side character of the name of Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 61]: Nobody believed them , because little Rogue Riderhood -- I am tempted into the paraphrase by remembering the charming wolf who would have rendered society a great service if he had devoured Mr Riderhood 's father and mother in their infancy -- had previously played fast and loose with the said charges , and , in fact , abandoned them .
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 57]: However , the retraction I have mentioned found its way into Lizzie Hexam 's hands , with a general flavour on it of having been favoured by some anonymous messenger in a dark cloak and slouched hat , and was by her forwarded , in her father 's vindication , to Mr Boffin , my client .
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 39]: You will excuse the phraseology of the shop , but as I never had another client , and in all likelihood never shall have , I am rather proud of him as a natural curiosity probably unique . '
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 20]: Although as easy as usual on the surface , Lightwood is not quite as easy as usual below it .
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 25]: With an air of not minding Eugene at all , he feels that the subject is not altogether a safe one in that connexion .
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 64]: ` The natural curiosity which forms the sole ornament of my professional museum , ' he resumes , ` hereupon desires his Secretary -- an individual of the hermit-crab or oyster species , and whose name , I think , is Chokesmith -- but it does n't in the least matter -- say Artichoke -- to put himself in communication with Lizzie Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 17]: Artichoke professes his readiness so to do , endeavours to do so , but fails . '
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 5]: ` Why fails ? '
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 3]: asks Boots .
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 5]: ` How fails ? '
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 3]: asks Brewer .
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 25]: ` Pardon me , ' returns Lightwood , ' I must postpone the reply for one moment , or we shall have an anti-climax .
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 26]: Artichoke failing signally , my client refers the task to me : his purpose being to advance the interests of the object of his search .
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 46]: I proceed to put myself in communication with her ; I even happen to possess some special means , ' with a glance at Eugene , ` of putting myself in communication with her ; but I fail too , because she has vanished . '
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 4]: ` Vanished ! '
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 5]: is the general echo .
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 7]: ` Disappeared , ' says Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 13]: ` Nobody knows how , nobody knows when , nobody knows where .
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 16]: And so ends the story to which my honourable and fair enslaver opposite referred . '
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 22]: Tippins , with a bewitching little scream , opines that we shall every one of us be murdered in our beds .
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 14]: Eugene eyes her as if some of us would be enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 17]: Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. , remarks that these social mysteries make one afraid of leaving Baby .
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 51]: Veneering , M.P. , wishes to be informed -LRB- with something of a second-hand air of seeing the Right Honourable Gentleman at the head of the Home Department in his place -RRB- whether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been spirited away or otherwise harmed ?
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 39]: Instead of Lightwood 's answering , Eugene answers , and answers hastily and vexedly : ` No , no , no ; he does n't mean that ; he means voluntarily vanished -- but utterly -- completely . '
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 61]: However , the great subject of the happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle must not be allowed to vanish with the other vanishments -- with the vanishing of the murderer , the vanishing of Julius Handford , the vanishing of Lizzie Hexam , -- and therefore Veneering must recall the present sheep to the pen from which they have strayed .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 65]: Who so fit to discourse of the happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle , they being the dearest and oldest friends he has in the world ; or what audience so fit for him to take into his confidence as that audience , a noun of multitude or signifying many , who are all the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 104]: So Veneering , without the formality of rising , launches into a familiar oration , gradually toning into the Parliamentary sing-song , in which he sees at that board his dear friend Twemlow who on that day twelvemonth bestowed on his dear friend Lammle the fair hand of his dear friend Sophronia , and in which he also sees at that board his dear friends Boots and Brewer whose rallying round him at a period when his dear friend Lady Tippins likewise rallied round him -- ay , and in the foremost rank -- he can never forget while memory holds her seat .
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 30]: But he is free to confess that he misses from that board his dear old friend Podsnap , though he is well represented by his dear young friend Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 40]: And he further sees at that board -LRB- this he announces with pomp , as if exulting in the powers of an extraordinary telescope -RRB- his friend Mr Fledgeby , if he will permit him to call him so .
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 107]: For all of these reasons , and many more which he right well knows will have occurred to persons of your exceptional acuteness , he is here to submit to you that the time has arrived when , with our hearts in our glasses , with tears in our eyes , with blessings on our lips , and in a general way with a profusion of gammon and spinach in our emotional larders , we should one and all drink to our dear friends the Lammles , wishing them many years as happy as the last , and many many friends as congenially united as themselves .
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 56]: And this he will add ; that Anastatia Veneering -LRB- who is instantly heard to weep -RRB- is formed on the same model as her old and chosen friend Sophronia Lammle , in respect that she is devoted to the man who wooed and won her , and nobly discharges the duties of a wife .
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 37]: Seeing no better way out of it , Veneering here pulls up his oratorical Pegasus extremely short , and plumps down , clean over his head , with : ` Lammle , God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 3]: Then Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 55]: Too much of him every way ; pervadingly too much nose of a coarse wrong shape , and his nose in his mind and his manners ; too much smile to be real ; too much frown to be false ; too many large teeth to be visible at once without suggesting a bite .
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 43]: He thanks you , dear friends , for your kindly greeting , and hopes to receive you -- it may be on the next of these delightfiil occasions -- in a residence better suited to your claims on the rites of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 13]: He will never forget that at Veneering 's he first saw Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 13]: Sophronia will never forget that at Veneering 's she first saw him .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 20]: ` They spoke of it soon after they were married , and agreed that they would never forget it .
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 10]: In fact , to Veneering they owe their union .
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 38]: They hope to show their sense of this some day -LRB- ` No , no , from Veneering -RRB- -- oh yes , yes , and let him rely upon it , they will if they can !
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 42]: His marriage with Sophronia was not a marriage of interest on either side : she had her little fortune , he had his little fortune : they joined their little fortunes : it was a marriage of pure inclination and suitability .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 3]: Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 48]: Sophronia and he are fond of the society of young people ; but he is not sure that their house would be a good house for young people proposing to remain single , since the contemplation of its domestic bliss might induce them to change their minds .
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 18]: He will not apply this to any one present ; certainly not to their darling little Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 4]: Again thank you !
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 13]: Neither , by-the-by , will he apply it to his friend Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 27]: He thanks Veneering for the feeling manner in which he referred to their common friend Fledgeby , for he holds that gentleman in the highest estimation .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 27]: In fact -LRB- returning unexpectedly to Fledgeby -RRB- , the better you know him , the more you find in him that you desire to know .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 4]: Again thank you !
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 14]: In his dear Sophronia 's name and in his own , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 16]: Mrs Lammle has sat quite still , with her eyes cast down upon the table-cloth .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 32]: As Mr Lammle 's address ends , Twemlow once more turns to her involuntarily , not cured yet of that often recurring impression that she is going to speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 11]: This time she really is going to speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 17]: Veneering is talking with his other next neighbour , and she speaks in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 5]: ` Mr Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 9]: He answers , ' I beg your pardon ?
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 3]: Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 13]: Still a little doubtful , because of her not looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 17]: ` You have the soul of a gentleman , and I know I may trust you .
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 20]: Will you give me the opportunity of saying a few words to you when you come up stairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 3]: ` Assuredly .
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 6]: I shall be honoured . '
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 29]: ` Do n't seem to do so , if you please , and do n't think it inconsistent if my manner should be more careless than my words .
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 6]: I may be watched . '
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 19]: Intensely astonished , Twemlow puts his hand to his forehead , and sinks back in his chair meditating .
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 4]: Mrs Lammle rises .
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 3]: All rise .
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 6]: The ladies go up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 7]: The gentlemen soon saunter after them .
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 53]: Fledgeby has devoted the interval to taking an observation of Boots 's whiskers , Brewer 's whiskers , and Lammle 's whiskers , and considering which pattern of whisker he would prefer to produce out of himself by friction , if the Genie of the cheek would only answer to his rubbing .
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 9]: In the drawing-room , groups form as usual .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 32]: Lightwood , Boots , and Brewer , flutter like moths around that yellow wax candle -- guttering down , and with some hint of a winding-sheet in it -- Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 28]: Outsiders cultivate Veneering , M P. , and Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. Lammle stands with folded arms , Mephistophelean in a corner , with Georgiana and Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 24]: Mrs Lammle , on a sofa by a table , invites Mr Twemlow 's attention to a book of portraits in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 19]: Mr Twemlow takes his station on a settee before her , and Mrs Lammle shows him a portrait .
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 24]: ` You have reason to be surprised , ' she says softly , ` but I wish you would n't look so . '
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 17]: Disturbed Twemlow , making an effort not to look so , looks much more so . '
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 18]: I think , Mr Twemlow , you never saw that distant connexion of yours before to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 6]: ` No , never . '
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 14]: ` Now that you do see him , you see what he is .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 8]: You are not proud of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 12]: ` To say the truth , Mrs Lammle , no . '
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 17]: ` If you knew more of him , you would be less inclined to acknowledge him .
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 5]: Here is another portrait .
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 8]: What do you think of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 15]: Twemlow has just presence of mind enough to say aloud : ` Very like !
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 4]: Uncommonly like ! '
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 14]: ` You have noticed , perhaps , whom he favours with his attentions ?
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 12]: You notice where he is now , and how engaged ? '
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 23]: But Mr Lammle -- ' She darts a look at him which he can not comprehend , and shows him another portrait .
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 9]: ` Very good ; is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 4]: ` Charming ! '
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 3]: says Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 10]: ` So like as to be almost a caricature ?
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 33]: -- Mr Twemlow , it is impossible to tell you what the struggle in my mind has been , before I could bring myself to speak to you as I do now .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 21]: It is only in the conviction that I may trust you never to betray me , that I can proceed .
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 41]: Sincerely promise me that you never will betray my confidence -- that you will respect it , even though you may no longer respect me , -- and I shall be as satisfied as if you had sworn it . '
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 16]: ` Madam , on the honour of a poor gentleman -- ' ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 6]: I can desire no more .
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 12]: Mr Twemlow , I implore you to save that child ! '
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 5]: ` That child ? '
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 3]: ` Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 5]: She will be sacrificed .
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 12]: She will be inveigled and married to that connexion of yours .
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 9]: It is a partnership affair , a money-speculation .
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 26]: She has no strength of will or character to help herself and she is on the brink of being sold into wretchedness for life . '
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 3]: ` Amazing !
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 10]: But what can I do to prevent it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 11]: demands Twemlow , shocked and bewildered to the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 6]: ` Here is another portrait .
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 8]: And not good , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 34]: Aghast at the light manner of her throwing her head back to look at it critically , Twemlow still dimly perceives the expediency of throwing his own head back , and does so .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 14]: Though he no more sees the portrait than if it were in China .
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 10]: ` Decidedly not good , ' says Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 6]: ` Stiff and exaggerated ! '
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 29]: ` And ex -- ' But Twemlow , in his demolished state , can not command the word , and trails off into ' -- actly so . '
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 16]: ` Mr Twemlow , your word will have weight with her pompous , self-blinded father .
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 10]: You know how much he makes of your family .
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 4]: Lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 4]: Warn him . '
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 8]: ` But warn him against whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 5]: ` Against me . '
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 13]: By great good fortune Twemlow receives a stimulant at this critical instant .
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 7]: The stimulant is Lammle 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 14]: ` Sophronia , my dear , what portraits are you showing Twemlow ? '
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 7]: ` Public characters , Alfred . '
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 9]: ` Show him the last of me . '
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 6]: ` Yes , Alfred . '
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 22]: She puts the book down , takes another book up , turns the leaves , and presents the portrait to Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 9]: ` That is the last of Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 6]: Do you think it good ?
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 7]: -- Warn her father against me .
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 15]: I deserve it , for I have been in the scheme from the first .
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 14]: It is my husband 's scheme , your connexion 's , and mine .
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 24]: I tell you this , only to show you the necessity of the poor little foolish affectionate creature 's being befriended and rescued .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 9]: You will not repeat this to her father .
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 12]: You will spare me so far , and spare my husband .
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 22]: For , though this celebration of to-day is all a mockery , he is my husband , and we must live .
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 8]: -- Do you think it like ? '
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 26]: Twemlow , in a stunned condition , feigns to compare the portrait in his hand with the original looking towards him from his Mephistophelean corner .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 6]: ` Very well indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 15]: are at length the words which Twemlow with great difficulty extracts from himself . '
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 7]: I am glad you think so .
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 11]: On the whole , I myself consider it the best .
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 6]: The others are so dark .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 44]: Now here , for instance , is another of Mr Lammle -- ' ` But I do n't understand ; I do n't see my way , ' Twemlow stammers , as he falters over the book with his glass at his eye .
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 11]: ` How warn her father , and not tell him ?
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 5]: Tell him how much ?
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 5]: Tell him how little ?
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 9]: I -- I -- am getting lost . '
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 35]: ` Tell him I am a match-maker ; tell him I am an artful and designing woman ; tell him you are sure his daughter is best out of my house and my company .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 14]: Tell him any such things of me ; they will all be true .
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 22]: You know what a puffed-up man he is , and how easily you can cause his vanity to take the alarm .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 23]: Tell him as much as will give him the alarm and make him careful of her , and spare me the rest .
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 44]: Mr Twemlow , I feel my sudden degradation in your eyes ; familiar as I am with my degradation in my own eyes , I keenly feel the change that must have come upon me in yours , in these last few moments .
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 16]: But I trust to your good faith with me as implicitly as when I began .
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 20]: If you knew how often I have tried to speak to you to-day , you would almost pity me .
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 32]: I want no new promise from you on my own account , for I am satisfied , and I always shall be satisfied , with the promise you have given me .
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 16]: I can venture to say no more , for I see that I am watched .
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 50]: If you would set my mind at rest with the assurance that you will interpose with the father and save this harmless girl , close that book before you return it to me , and I shall know what you mean , and deeply thank you in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 21]: -- Alfred , Mr Twemlow thinks the last one the best , and quite agrees with you and me . '
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 3]: Alfred advances .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 5]: The groups break up .
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 13]: Lady Tippins rises to go , and Mrs Veneering follows her leader .
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 26]: For the moment , Mrs Lammle does not turn to them , but remains looking at Twemlow looking at Alfred 's portrait through his eyeglass .
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 36]: The moment past , Twemlow drops his eyeglass at its ribbon 's length , rises , and closes the book with an emphasis which makes that fragile nursling of the fairies , Tippins , start .
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 79]: Then good-bye and good-bye , and charming occasion worthy of the Golden Age , and more about the flitch of bacon , and the like of that ; and Twemlow goes staggering across Piccadilly with his hand to his forehead , and is nearly run down by a flushed lettercart , and at last drops safe in his easy-chair , innocent good gentleman , with his hand to his forehead still , and his head in a whirl .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 28]: BOOK THE THIRD A LONG LANE Chapter 1 LODGERS IN QUEER STREET It was a foggy day in London , and the fog was heavy and dark .
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 40]: Animate London , with smarting eyes and irritated lungs , was blinking , wheezing , and choking ; inanimate London was a sooty spectre , divided in purpose between being visible and invisible , and so being wholly neither .
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 60]: Gaslights flared in the shops with a haggard and unblest air , as knowing themselves to be nightcreatures that had no business abroad under the sun ; while the sun itself when it was for a few moments dimly indicated through circling eddies of fog , showed as if it had gone out and were collapsing flat and cold .
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 66]: Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day , but there the fog was grey , whereas in London it was , at about the boundary line , dark yellow , and a little within it brown , and then browner , and then browner , until at the heart of the City -- which call Saint Mary Axe -- it was rusty-black .
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 82]: From any point of the high ridge of land northward , it might have been discerned that the loftiest buildings made an occasional struggle to get their heads above the foggy sea , and especially that the great dome of Saint Paul 's seemed to die hard ; but this was not perceivable in the streets at their feet , where the whole metropolis was a heap of vapour charged with muffled sound of wheels , and enfolding a gigantic catarrh .
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 63]: At nine o'clock on such a morning , the place of business of Pubsey and Co. was not the liveliest object even in Saint Mary Axe -- which is not a very lively spot -- with a sobbing gaslight in the countinghouse window , and a burglarious stream of fog creeping in to strangle it through the keyhole of the main door .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 23]: But the light went out , and the main door opened , and Riah came forth with a bag under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 28]: Almost in the act of coming out at the door , Riah went into the fog , and was lost to the eyes of Saint Mary Axe .
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 29]: But the eyes of this history can follow him westward , by Cornhill , Cheapside , Fleet Street , and the Strand , to Piccadilly and the Albany .
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 60]: Thither he went at his grave and measured pace , staff in hand , skirt at heel ; and more than one head , turning to look back at his venerable figure already lost in the mist , supposed it to be some ordinary figure indistinctly seen , which fancy and the fog had worked into that passing likeness .
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 30]: Arrived at the house in which his master 's chambers were on the second floor , Riah proceeded up the stairs , and paused at Fascination Fledgeby 's door .
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 31]: Making free with neither bell nor knocker , he struck upon the door with the top of his staff , and , having listened , sat down on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 39]: It was characteristic of his habitual submission , that he sat down on the raw dark staircase , as many of his ancestors had probably sat down in dungeons , taking what befell him as it might befall .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 40]: After a time , when he had grown so cold as to be fain to blow upon his fingers , he arose and knocked with his staff again , and listened again , and again sat down to wait .
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 27]: Thrice he repeated these actions before his listening ears were greeted by the voice of Fledgeby , calling from his bed , ` Hold your row !
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 11]: -- I 'll come and open the door directly ! '
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 37]: But , in lieu of coming directly , he fell into a sweet sleep for some quarter of an hour more , during which added interval Riah sat upon the stairs and waited with perfect patience .
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 18]: At length the door stood open , and Mr Fledgeby 's retreating drapery plunged into bed again .
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 26]: Following it at a respectful distance , Riah passed into the bed-chamber , where a fire had been sometime lighted , and was burning briskly .
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 15]: ` Why , what time of night do you mean to call it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 25]: inquired Fledgeby , turning away beneath the clothes , and presenting a comfortable rampart of shoulder to the chilled figure of the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 13]: ` Sir , it is full half-past ten in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 6]: ` The deuce it is !
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 8]: Then it must be precious foggy ? '
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 7]: ` Very foggy , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 7]: ` And raw , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 43]: ` Chill and bitter , ' said Riah , drawing out a handkerchief , and wiping the moisture from his beard and long grey hair as he stood on the verge of the rug , with his eyes on the acceptable fire .
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 11]: With a plunge of enjoyment , Fledgeby settled himself afresh .
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 17]: ` Any snow , or sleet , or slush , or anything of that sort ? '
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 7]: ` No , sir , no .
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 7]: Not quite so bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 7]: The streets are pretty clean . '
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 27]: ` You need n't brag about it , ' returned Fledgeby , disappointed in his desire to heighten the contrast between his bed and the streets .
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 9]: ` But you 're always bragging about something .
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 6]: Got the books there ? '
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 8]: ` They are here , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 4]: ` All right .
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 34]: I 'll turn the general subject over in my mind for a minute or two , and while I 'm about it you can empty your bag and get ready for me . '
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 11]: With another comfortable plunge , Mr Fledgeby fell asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 38]: The old man , having obeyed his directions , sat down on the edge of a chair , and , folding his hands before him , gradually yielded to the influence of the warmth , and dozed .
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 47]: He was roused by Mr Fledgeby 's appearing erect at the foot of the bed , in Turkish slippers , rose-coloured Turkish trousers -LRB- got cheap from somebody who had cheated some other somebody out of them -RRB- , and a gown and cap to correspond .
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 33]: In that costume he would have left nothing to be desired , if he had been further fitted out with a bottomless chair , a lantern , and a bunch of matches .
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 8]: ` Now , old ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 24]: cried Fascination , in his light raillery , ` what dodgery are you up to next , sitting there with your eyes shut ?
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 5]: You ai n't asleep .
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 12]: Catch a weasel at it , and catch a Jew ! '
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 16]: ` Truly , sir , I fear I nodded , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 5]: ` Not you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 9]: returned Fledgeby , with a cunning look . '
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 22]: A telling move with a good many , I dare say , but it wo n't put ME off my guard .
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 17]: Not a bad notion though , if you want to look indifferent in driving a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 8]: Oh , you are a dodger ! '
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 50]: The old man shook his head , gently repudiating the imputation , and suppresed a sigh , and moved to the table at which Mr Fledgeby was now pouring out for himself a cup of steaming and fragrant coffee from a pot that had stood ready on the hob .
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 32]: It was an edifying spectacle , the young man in his easy chair taking his coffee , and the old man with his grey head bent , standing awaiting his pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 4]: ` Now ! '
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 23]: ` Fork out your balance in hand , and prove by figures how you make it out that it ai n't more .
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 9]: First of all , light that candle . '
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 34]: Riah obeyed , and then taking a bag from his breast , and referring to the sum in the accounts for which they made him responsible , told it out upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 14]: Fledgeby told it again with great care , and rang every sovereign . '
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 38]: I suppose , ' he said , taking one up to eye it closely , ` you have n't been lightening any of these ; but it 's a trade of your people 's , you know .
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 13]: YOU understand what sweating a pound means , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 40]: ` Much as you do , sir , ' returned the old man , with his hands under opposite cuffs of his loose sleeves , as he stood at the table , deferentially observant of the master 's face .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 11]: ` May I take the liberty to say something ? '
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 9]: ` You may , ' Fledgeby graciously conceded .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 44]: ` Do you not , sir -- without intending it -- of a surety without intending it -- sometimes mingle the character I fairly earn in your employment , with the character which it is your policy that I should bear ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 25]: I do n't find it worth my while to cut things so fine as to go into the inquiry , ' Fascination coolly answered .
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 6]: ` Not in justice ? '
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 5]: ` Bother justice ! '
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 6]: ` Not in generosity ? '
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 6]: ` Jews and generosity ! '
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 7]: ` That 's a good connexion !
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 13]: Bring out your vouchers , and do n't talk Jerusalem palaver . '
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 19]: The vouchers were produced , and for the next half-hour Mr Fledgeby concentrated his sublime attention on them .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 22]: They and the accounts were all found correct , and the books and the papers resumed their places in the bag .
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 22]: ` Next , ' said Fledgeby , ` concerning that bill-broking branch of the business ; the branch I like best .
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 13]: What queer bills are to be bought , and at what prices ?
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 13]: You have got your list of what 's in the market ? '
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 40]: ` Sir , a long list , ' replied Riah , taking out a pocket-book , and selecting from its contents a folded paper , which , being unfolded , became a sheet of foolscap covered with close writing .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 4]: ` Whew ! '
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 11]: whistled Fledgeby , as he took it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 11]: ` Queer Street is full of lodgers just at present !
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 13]: These are to be disposed of in parcels ; are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 26]: ` In parcels as set forth , ' returned the old man , looking over his master 's shoulder ; ` or the lump . '
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 16]: ` Half the lump will be waste-paper , one knows beforehand , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 9]: ` Can you get it at waste-paper price ?
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 6]: That 's the question . '
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 15]: Riah shook his head , and Fledgeby cast his small eyes down the list .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 36]: They presently began to twinkle , and he no sooner became conscious of their twinkling , than he looked up over his shoulder at the grave face above him , and moved to the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 44]: Making a desk of it , he stood there with his back to the old man , warming his knees , perusing the list at his leisure , and often returning to some lines of it , as though they were particularly interesting .
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 19]: At those times he glanced in the chimney-glass to see what note the old man took of him .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 25]: He took none that could be detected , but , aware of his employer 's suspicions , stood with his eyes on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 25]: Mr Fledgeby was thus amiably engaged when a step was heard at the outer door , and the door was heard to open hastily .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 3]: ` Hark !
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 23]: That 's your doing , you Pump of Israel , ' said Fledgeby ; ` you ca n't have shut it . '
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 26]: Then the step was heard within , and the voice of Mr Alfred Lammle called aloud , ` Are you anywhere here , Fledgeby ? '
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 30]: To which Fledgeby , after cautioning Riah in a low voice to take his cue as it should be given him , replied , ` Here I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 6]: and opened his bedroom door .
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 33]: ` This gentleman is only Pubsey and Co. of Saint Mary Axe , that I am trying to make terms for an unfortunate friend with in a matter of some dishonoured bills .
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 27]: But really Pubsey and Co. are so strict with their debtors , and so hard to move , that I seem to be wasting my time .
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 19]: Ca n't I make ANY terms with you on my friend 's part , Mr Riah ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 20]: I am but the representative of another , sir , ' returned the Jew in a low voice . '
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 10]: I do as I am bidden by my principal .
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 12]: It is not my capital that is invested in the business .
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 10]: It is not my profit that arises therefrom . '
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 3]: laughed Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 4]: ` Lammle ? '
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 3]: laughed Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 4]: We know . '
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 11]: ` Devilish good , ai n't it , Lammle ? '
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 10]: said Fledgeby , unspeakably amused by his hidden joke .
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 10]: ` Always the same , always the same ! '
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 3]: said Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 11]: ` Mr -- ' ` Riah , Pubsey and Co. .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 31]: Saint Mary Axe , ' Fledgeby put in , as he wiped away the tears that trickled from his eyes , so rare was his enjoyment of his secret joke .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 21]: ` Mr Riah is bound to observe the invaRiahle forms for such cases made and provided , ' said Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 10]: ` He is only the representative of another ! '
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 3]: cried Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 10]: ` Does as he is told by his principal !
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 10]: Not his capital that 's invested in the business .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 6]: Oh , that 's good !
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 6]: Ha ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 28]: Mr Lammle joined in the laugh and looked knowing ; and the more he did both , the more exquisite the secret joke became for Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 41]: ` However , ' said that fascinating gentleman , wiping his eyes again , ` if we go on in this way , we shall seem to be almost making game of Mr Riah , or of Pubsey and Co. .
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 15]: Saint Mary Axe , or of somebody : which is far from our intention .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 44]: Mr Riah , if you would have the kindness to step into the next room for a few moments while I speak with Mr Lammle here , I should like to try to make terms with you once again before you go . '
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 34]: The old man , who had never raised his eyes during the whole transaction of Mr Fledgeby 's joke , silently bowed and passed out by the door which Fledgeby opened for him .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 35]: Having closed it on him , Fledgeby returned to Lammle , standing with his back to the bedroom fire , with one hand under his coat-skirts , and all his whiskers in the other .
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 7]: ` There 's something wrong ! '
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 8]: ` How do you know it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 3]: demanded Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 13]: ` Because you show it , ' replied Fledgeby in unintentional rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 25]: ` Well then ; there is , ' said Lammle ; ` there IS something wrong ; the whole thing 's wrong . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 4]: I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 28]: remonstrated Fascination very slowly , and sitting down with his hands on his knees to stare at his glowering friend with his back to the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 25]: I tell you , Fledgeby , ' repeated Lammle , with a sweep of his right arm , ` the whole thing 's wrong .
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 6]: The game 's up . '
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 7]: ` What game 's up ? '
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 12]: demanded Fledgeby , as slowly as before , and more sternly .
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 4]: ` THE game .
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 3]: OUR game .
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 4]: Read that . '
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 13]: Fledgeby took a note from his extended hand and read it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 6]: ` Alfred Lammle , Esquire .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 28]: Sir : Allow Mrs Podsnap and myself to express our united sense of the polite attentions of Mrs Alfred Lammle and yourself towards our daughter , Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 27]: Allow us also , wholly to reject them for the future , and to communicate our final desire that the two families may become entire strangers .
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 21]: I have the honour to be , Sir , your most obedient and very humble servant , JOHN PODSNAP . '
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 40]: Fledgeby looked at the three blank sides of this note , quite as long and earnestly as at the first expressive side , and then looked at Lammle , who responded with another extensive sweep of his right arm .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 7]: ` Whose doing is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 9]: ` Impossible to imagine , ' said Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 26]: ` Perhaps , ' suggested Fledgeby , after reflecting with a very discontented brow , ` somebody has been giving you a bad character . '
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 13]: ` Or you , ' said Lammle , with a deeper frown .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 22]: Mr Fledgeby appeared to be on the verge of some mutinous expressions , when his hand happened to touch his nose .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 34]: A certain remembrance connected with that feature operating as a timely warning , he took it thoughtfully between his thumb and forefinger , and pondered ; Lammle meanwhile eyeing him with furtive eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 9]: ` This wo n't improve with talking about .
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 15]: If we ever find out who did it , we 'll mark that person .
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 21]: There 's nothing more to be said , except that you undertook to do what circumstances prevent your doing . '
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 30]: ` And that you undertook to do what you might have done by this time , if you had made a prompter use of circumstances , ' snarled Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 3]: ` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 21]: That , ' remarked Fledgeby , with his hands in the Turkish trousers , ` is matter of opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 38]: ` Mr Fledgeby , ' said Lammle , in a bullying tone , ` am I to understand that you in any way reflect upon me , or hint dissatisfaction with me , in this affair ? '
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 26]: ` No , ' said Fledgeby ; ` provided you have brought my promissory note in your pocket , and now hand it over . '
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 8]: Lammle produced it , not without reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 19]: Fledgeby looked at it , identified it , twisted it up , and threw it into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 21]: They both looked at it as it blazed , went out , and flew in feathery ash up the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 38]: ` NOW , Mr Fledgeby , ' said Lammle , as before ; ` am I to understand that you in any way reflect upon me , or hint dissatisfaction with me , in this affair ? '
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 7]: ` Finally and unreservedly no ? '
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 7]: ` Fledgeby , my hand . '
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 24]: Mr Fledgeby took it , saying , ` And if we ever find out who did this , we 'll mark that person .
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 14]: And in the most friendly manner , let me mention one thing more .
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 15]: I do n't know what your circumstances are , and I do n't ask .
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 7]: You have sustained a loss here .
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 21]: Many men are liable to be involved at times , and you may be , or you may not be .
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 40]: But whatever you do , Lammle , do n't -- do n't -- do n't , I beg of you -- ever fall into the hands of Pubsey and Co. in the next room , for they are grinders .
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 50]: Regular flayers and grinders , my dear Lammle , ' repeated Fledgeby with a peculiar relish , ` and they 'll skin you by the inch , from the nape of your neck to the sole of your foot , and grind every inch of your skin to tooth-powder .
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 8]: You have seen what Mr Riah is .
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 17]: Never fall into his hands , Lammle , I beg of you as a friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 30]: Mr Lammle , disclosing some alarm at the solemnity of this affectionate adjuration , demanded why the devil he ever should fall into the hands of Pubsey and Co. ?
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 36]: ` To confess the fact , I was made a little uneasy , ' said the candid Fledgeby , ` by the manner in which that Jew looked at you when he heard your name .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 7]: I did n't like his eye .
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 12]: But it may have been the heated fancy of a friend .
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 39]: Of course if you are sure that you have no personal security out , which you may not be quite equal to meeting , and which can have got into his hands , it must have been fancy .
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 10]: Still , I did n't like his eye . '
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 26]: The brooding Lammle , with certain white dints coming and going in his palpitating nose , looked as if some tormenting imp were pinching it .
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 28]: Fledgeby , watching him with a twitch in his mean face which did duty there for a smile , looked very like the tormentor who was pinching .
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 26]: ` But I must n't keep him waiting too long , ' said Fledgeby , ` or he 'll revenge it on my unfortunate friend .
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 9]: How 's your very clever and agreeable wife ?
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 9]: She knows we have broken down ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 7]: I showed her the letter . '
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 6]: ` Very much surprised ? '
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 4]: asked Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 24]: I think she would have been more so , ' answered Lammle , ` if there had been more go in YOU ? '
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 10]: -- She lays it upon me , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 13]: ` Mr Fledgeby , I will not have my words misconstrued . '
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 24]: ` Do n't break out , Lammle , ' urged Fledgeby , in a submissive tone , ` because there 's no occasion .
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 6]: I only asked a question .
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 9]: Then she do n't lay it upon me ?
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 6]: To ask another question . '
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 14]: ` Very good , ' said Fledgeby , plainly seeing that she did .
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 6]: ` My compliments to her .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 10]: They shook hands , and Lammle strode out pondering .
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 47]: Fledgeby saw him into the fog , and , returning to the fire and musing with his face to it , stretched the legs of the rose-coloured Turkish trousers wide apart , and meditatively bent his knees , as if he were going down upon them .
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 65]: ` You have a pair of whiskers , Lammle , which I never liked , ' murmured Fledgeby , ` and which money ca n't produce ; you are boastful of your manners and your conversation ; you wanted to pull my nose , and you have let me in for a failure , and your wife says I am the cause of it .
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 6]: I 'll bowl you down .
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 30]: I will , though I have no whiskers , ' here he rubbed the places where they were due , ` and no manners , and no conversation ! '
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 39]: Having thus relieved his noble mind , he collected the legs of the Turkish trousers , straightened himself on his knees , and called out to Riah in the next room , ` Halloa , you sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 37]: At sight of the old man re-entering with a gentleness monstrously in contrast with the character he had given him , Mr Fledgeby was so tickled again , that he exclaimed , laughing , ` Good !
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 2]: Good !
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 9]: Upon my soul it is uncommon good ! '
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 67]: ` Now , old ` un , ' proceeded Fledgeby , when he had had his laugh out , ` you 'll buy up these lots that I mark with my pencil -- there 's a tick there , and a tick there , and a tick there -- and I wager two-pence you 'll afterwards go on squeezing those Christians like the Jew you are .
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 57]: Now , next you 'll want a cheque -- or you 'll say you want it , though you 've capital enough somewhere , if one only knew where , but you 'd be peppered and salted and grilled on a gridiron before you 'd own to it -- and that cheque I 'll write . '
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 89]: When he had unlocked a drawer and taken a key from it to open another drawer , in which was another key that opened another drawer , in which was another key that opened another drawer , in which was the cheque book ; and when he had written the cheque ; and when , reversing the key and drawer process , he had placed his cheque book in safety again ; he beckoned the old man , with the folded cheque , to come and take it .
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 40]: ` Old ` un , ' said Fledgeby , when the Jew had put it in his pocketbook , and was putting that in the breast of his outer garment ; ` so much at present for my affairs .
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 11]: Now a word about affairs that are not exactly mine .
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 5]: Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 18]: With his hand not yet withdrawn from the breast of his garment , Riah started and paused .
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 4]: ` Oho ! '
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 6]: ` Did n't expect it !
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 7]: Where have you hidden her ? '
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 26]: Showing that he was taken by surprise , the old man looked at his master with some passing confusion , which the master highly enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 18]: ` Is she in the house I pay rent and taxes for in Saint Mary Axe ? '
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 3]: demanded Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 25]: ` Is she in your garden up atop of that house -- gone up to be dead , or whatever the game is ? '
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 3]: asked Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 7]: ` Where is she then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 38]: Riah bent his eyes upon the ground , as if considering whether he could answer the question without breach of faith , and then silently raised them to Fledgeby 's face , as if he could not .
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 4]: said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 8]: I wo n't press that just now .
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 16]: But I want to know this , and I will know this , mind you .
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 7]: What are you up to ? '
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 31]: The old man , with an apologetic action of his head and hands , as not comprehending the master 's meaning , addressed to him a look of mute inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 13]: ` You ca n't be a gallivanting dodger , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 36]: ` For you 're a `` regular pity the sorrows '' , you know -- if you DO know any Christian rhyme -- `` whose trembling limbs have borne him to '' -- et cetrer .
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 26]: You 're one of the Patriarchs ; you 're a shaky old card ; and you ca n't be in love with this Lizzie ? '
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 6]: ` O , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 3]: expostulated Riah .
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 10]: ` O , sir , sir , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 35]: ` Then why , ' retorted Fledgeby , with some slight tinge of a blush , ` do n't you out with your reason for having your spoon in the soup at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 10]: ` Sir , I will tell you the truth .
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 21]: But -LRB- your pardon for the stipulation -RRB- it is in sacred confidence ; it is strictly upon honour . '
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 5]: ` Honour too ! '
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 8]: cried Fledgeby , with a mocking lip .
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 5]: ` Honour among Jews .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 4]: Cut away . '
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 9]: ` It is upon honour , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 9]: the other still stipulated , with respectful firmness .
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 5]: ` Oh , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 7]: Honour bright , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 27]: The old man , never bidden to sit down , stood with an earnest hand laid on the back of the young man 's easy chair .
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 25]: The young man sat looking at the fire with a face of listening curiosity , ready to check him off and catch him tripping .
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 8]: ` Cut away , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 7]: ` Start with your motive . '
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 14]: ` Sir , I have no motive but to help the helpless . '
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 25]: Mr Fledgeby could only express the feelings to which this incredible statement gave rise in his breast , by a prodigiously long derisive sniff .
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 37]: ` How I came to know , and much to esteem and to respect , this damsel , I mentioned when you saw her in my poor garden on the house-top , ' said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 5]: ` Did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 5]: said Fledgeby , distrustfully .
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 3]: ` Well .
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 7]: Perhaps you did , though . '
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 16]: ` The better I knew her , the more interest I felt in her fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 6]: They gathered to a crisis .
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 37]: I found her beset by a selfish and ungrateful brother , beset by an unacceptable wooer , beset by the snares of a more powerful lover , beset by the wiles of her own heart . '
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 11]: ` She took to one of the chaps then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 22]: ` Sir , it was only natural that she should incline towards him , for he had many and great advantages .
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 18]: But he was not of her station , and to marry her was not in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 48]: Perils were closing round her , and the circle was fast darkening , when I -- being as you have said , sir , too old and broken to be suspected of any feeling for her but a father 's -- stepped in , and counselled flight .
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 33]: I said , `` My daughter , there are times of moral danger when the hardest virtuous resolution to form is flight , and when the most heroic bravery is flight . ''
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 29]: She answered , she had had this in her thoughts ; but whither to fly without help she knew not , and there were none to help her .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 20]: I showed her there was one to help her , and it was I. And she is gone . '
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 9]: ` What did you do with her ? '
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 8]: asked Fledgeby , feeling his cheek . '
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 68]: I placed her , ' said the old man , ` at a distance ; ' with a grave smooth outward sweep from one another of his two open hands at arm 's length ; ` at a distance -- among certain of our people , where her industry would serve her , and where she could hope to exercise it , unassailed from any quarter . '
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 24]: Fledgeby 's eyes had come from the fire to notice the action of his hands when he said ` at a distance . '
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 30]: Fledgeby now tried -LRB- very unsuccessfully -RRB- to imitate that action , as he shook his head and said , ` Placed her in that direction , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 7]: Oh you circular old dodger ! '
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 25]: With one hand across his breast and the other on the easy chair , Riah , without justifying himself , waited for further questioning .
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 29]: But , that it was hopeless to question him on that one reserved point , Fledgeby , with his small eyes too near together , saw full well .
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 18]: ` Lizzie , ' said Fledgeby , looking at the fire again , and then looking up .
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 5]: ` Humph , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 16]: You did n't tell me the other name in your garden atop of the house .
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 8]: I 'll be more communicative with you .
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 7]: The other name 's Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 7]: Riah bent his head in assent .
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 12]: ` Look here , you sir , ' said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 16]: I have a notion I know something of the inveigling chap , the powerful one .
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 10]: Has he anything to do with the law ? '
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 11]: ` Nominally , I believe it his calling . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 4]: I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 6]: Name anything like Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 9]: ` Sir , not at all like . '
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 24]: ` Come , old ` un , ' said Fledgeby , meeting his eyes with a wink , ` say the name . '
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 4]: ` Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 5]: ` By Jupiter ! '
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 3]: cried Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 7]: ` That one , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 16]: I thought it might be the other , but I never dreamt of that one !
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 35]: I should n't object to your baulking either of the pair , dodger , for they are both conceited enough ; but that one is as cool a customer as ever I met with .
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 10]: Got a beard besides , and presumes upon it .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 7]: Well done , old ` un !
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 6]: Go on and prosper ! '
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 15]: Brightened by this unexpected commendation , Riah asked were there more instructions for him ?
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 26]: ` No , ' said Fledgeby , ` you may toddle now , Judah , and grope about on the orders you have got . '
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 46]: Dismissed with those pleasing words , the old man took his broad hat and staff , and left the great presence : more as if he were some superior creature benignantly blessing Mr Fledgeby , than the poor dependent on whom he set his foot .
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 17]: Left alone , Mr Fledgeby locked his outer door , and came back to his fire .
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 6]: ` Well done you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 5]: said Fascination to himself .
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 13]: ` Slow , you may be ; sure , you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 26]: This he twice or thrice repeated with much complacency , as he again dispersed the legs of the Turkish trousers and bent the knees . '
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 14]: A tidy shot that , I flatter myself , ' he then soliloquised .
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 9]: ` And a Jew brought down with it !
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 21]: Now , when I heard the story told at Lammle 's , I did n't make a jump at Riah .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 14]: Not a hit of it ; I got at him by degrees . '
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 36]: Herein he was quite accurate ; it being his habit , not to jump , or leap , or make an upward spring , at anything in life , but to crawl at everything . '
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 18]: I got at him , ' pursued Fledgeby , feeling for his whisker , ` by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 32]: If your Lammles or your Lightwoods had got at him anyhow , they would have asked him the question whether he had n't something to do with that gal 's disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 10]: I knew a better way of going to work .
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 25]: Having got behind the hedge , and put him in the light , I took a shot at him and brought him down plump .
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 18]: It do n't count for much , being a Jew , in a match against ME ! '
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 15]: Another dry twist in place of a smile , made his face crooked here .
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 23]: ` As to Christians , ' proceeded Fledgeby , ` look out , fellowChristians , particularly you that lodge in Queer Street !
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 18]: I have got the run of Queer Street now , and you shall see some games there .
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 29]: To work a lot of power over you and you not know it , knowing as you think yourselves , would be almost worth laying out money upon .
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 21]: But when it comes to squeezing a profit out of you into the bargain , it 's something like ! '
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 22]: With this apostrophe Mr Fledgeby appropriately proceeded to divest himself of his Turkish garments , and invest himself with Christian attire .
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 59]: Pending which operation , and his morning ablutions , and his anointing of himself with the last infallible preparation for the production of luxuriant and glossy hair upon the human countenance -LRB- quacks being the only sages he believed in besides usurers -RRB- , the murky fog closed about him and shut him up in its sooty embrace .
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 31]: If it had never let him out any more , the world would have had no irreparable loss , but could have easily replaced him from its stock on hand .
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 46]: Chapter 2 A RESPECTED FRIEND IN A NEW ASPECT In the evening of this same foggy day when the yellow windowblind of Pubsey and Co. was drawn down upon the day 's work , Riah the Jew once more came forth into Saint Mary Axe .
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 18]: But this time he carried no bag , and was not bound on his master 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 36]: He passed over London Bridge , and returned to the Middlesex shore by that of Westminster , and so , ever wading through the fog , waded to the doorstep of the dolls ' dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 5]: Miss Wren expected him .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 44]: He could see her through the window by the light of her low fire -- carefully banked up with damp cinders that it might last the longer and waste the less when she was out -- sitting waiting for him in her bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 34]: His tap at the glass roused her from the musing solitude in which she sat , and she came to the door to open it ; aiding her steps with a little crutch-stick .
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 7]: ` Good evening , godmother ! '
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 5]: said Miss Jenny Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 14]: The old man laughed , and gave her his arm to lean on .
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 13]: ` Wo n't you come in and warm yourself , godmother ? '
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 5]: asked Miss Jenny Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 13]: ` Not if you are ready , Cinderella , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 6]: exclaimed Miss Wren , delighted .
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 9]: ` Now you ARE a clever old boy !
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 31]: If we gave prizes at this establishment -LRB- but we only keep blanks -RRB- , you should have the first silver medal , for taking me up so quick . '
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 41]: As she spake thus , Miss Wren removed the key of the house-door from the keyhole and put it in her pocket , and then bustlingly closed the door , and tried it as they both stood on the step .
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 27]: Satisfied that her dwelling was safe , she drew one hand through the old man 's arm and prepared to ply her crutch-stick with the other .
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 21]: But the key was an instrument of such gigantic proportions , that before they started Riah proposed to carry it .
Parsing [sent. 10565 len. 7]: ` No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 10566 len. 11]: I 'll carry it myself , ' returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10567 len. 21]: ` I 'm awfully lopsided , you know , and stowed down in my pocket it 'll trim the ship .
Parsing [sent. 10568 len. 23]: To let you into a secret , godmother , I wear my pocket on my high side , o ' purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 10569 len. 10]: With that they began their plodding through the fog .
Parsing [sent. 10570 len. 25]: ` Yes , it was truly sharp of you , godmother , ' resumed Miss Wren with great approbation , ` to understand me .
Parsing [sent. 10571 len. 18]: But , you see , you ARE so like the fairy godmother in the bright little books !
Parsing [sent. 10572 len. 31]: You look so unlike the rest of people , and so much as if you had changed yourself into that shape , just this moment , with some benevolent object .
Parsing [sent. 10573 len. 3]: Boh ! '
Parsing [sent. 10574 len. 15]: cried Miss Jenny , putting her face close to the old man 's . '
Parsing [sent. 10575 len. 13]: I can see your features , godmother , behind the beard . '
Parsing [sent. 10576 len. 15]: ` Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too , Jenny ? '
Parsing [sent. 10577 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10578 len. 4]: That it does !
Parsing [sent. 10579 len. 31]: If you 'd only borrow my stick and tap this piece of pavement -- this dirty stone that my foot taps -- it would start up a coach and six .
Parsing [sent. 10580 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 10581 len. 6]: Let 's believe so ! '
Parsing [sent. 10582 len. 13]: ` With all my heart , ' replied the good old man .
Parsing [sent. 10583 len. 16]: ` And I 'll tell you what I must ask you to do , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 10584 len. 20]: I must ask you to be so kind as give my child a tap , and change him altogether .
Parsing [sent. 10585 len. 14]: O my child has been such a bad , bad child of late !
Parsing [sent. 10586 len. 9]: It worries me nearly out of my wits .
Parsing [sent. 10587 len. 10]: Not done a stroke of work these ten days .
Parsing [sent. 10588 len. 25]: Has had the horrors , too , and fancied that four coppercoloured men in red wanted to throw him into a fiery furnace . '
Parsing [sent. 10589 len. 9]: ` But that 's dangerous , Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 10590 len. 5]: ` Dangerous , godmother ?
Parsing [sent. 10591 len. 10]: My child is always dangerous , more or less .
Parsing [sent. 10592 len. 29]: He might ' -- here the little creature glanced back over her shoulder at the sky -- ` be setting the house on fire at this present moment .
Parsing [sent. 10593 len. 14]: I do n't know who would have a child , for my part !
Parsing [sent. 10594 len. 7]: It 's no use shaking him .
Parsing [sent. 10595 len. 11]: I have shaken him till I have made myself giddy .
Parsing [sent. 10596 len. 19]: `` Why do n't you mind your Commandments and honour your parent , you naughty old boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10597 len. 8]: I said to him all the time .
Parsing [sent. 10598 len. 10]: But he only whimpered and stared at me . '
Parsing [sent. 10599 len. 10]: ` What shall be changed , after him ? '
Parsing [sent. 10600 len. 8]: asked Riah in a compassionately playful voice .
Parsing [sent. 10601 len. 30]: ` Upon my word , godmother , I am afraid I must be selfish next , and get you to set me right in the back and the legs .
Parsing [sent. 10602 len. 26]: It 's a little thing to you with your power , godmother , but it 's a great deal to poor weak aching me . '
Parsing [sent. 10603 len. 19]: There was no querulous complaining in the words , but they were not the less touching for that .
Parsing [sent. 10604 len. 5]: ` And then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10605 len. 11]: ` Yes , and then -- YOU know , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 10606 len. 15]: We 'll both jump up into the coach and six and go to Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 10607 len. 13]: This reminds me , godmother , to ask you a serious question .
Parsing [sent. 10608 len. 46]: You are as wise as wise can be -LRB- having been brought up by the fairies -RRB- , and you can tell me this : Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it , or never to have had it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10609 len. 7]: ` Explain , god-daughter . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10610 len. 23]: I feel so much more solitary and helpless without Lizzie now , than I used to feel before I knew her . '
Parsing [sent. 10611 len. 12]: -LRB- Tears were in her eyes as she said so . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 10612 len. 50]: ` Some beloved companionship fades out of most lives , my dear , ' said the Jew , -- ` that of a wife , and a fair daughter , and a son of promise , has faded out of my own life -- but the happiness was . '
Parsing [sent. 10613 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10614 len. 39]: said Miss Wren thoughtfully , by no means convinced , and chopping the exclamation with that sharp little hatchet of hers ; ` then I tell you what change I think you had better begin with , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 10615 len. 18]: You had better change Is into Was and Was into Is , and keep them so . '
Parsing [sent. 10616 len. 7]: ` Would that suit your case ?
Parsing [sent. 10617 len. 10]: Would you not be always in pain then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10618 len. 6]: asked the old man tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 10619 len. 4]: ` Right ! '
Parsing [sent. 10620 len. 7]: exclaimed Miss Wren with another chop .
Parsing [sent. 10621 len. 9]: ` You have changed me wiser , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 10622 len. 31]: -- Not , ' she added with the quaint hitch of her chin and eyes , ` that you need be a very wonderful godmother to do that deed . '
Parsing [sent. 10623 len. 53]: Thus conversing , and having crossed Westminster Bridge , they traversed the ground that Riah had lately traversed , and new ground likewise ; for , when they had recrossed the Thames by way of London Bridge , they struck down by the river and held their still foggier course that way .
Parsing [sent. 10624 len. 30]: But previously , as they were going along , Jenny twisted her venerable friend aside to a brilliantly-lighted toy-shop window , and said : ` Now look at 'em !
Parsing [sent. 10625 len. 5]: All my work ! '
Parsing [sent. 10626 len. 70]: This referred to a dazzling semicircle of dolls in all the colours of the rainbow , who were dressed for presentation at court , for going to balls , for going out driving , for going out on horseback , for going out walking , for going to get married , for going to help other dolls to get married , for all the gay events of life . '
Parsing [sent. 10627 len. 8]: ` Pretty , pretty , pretty ! '
Parsing [sent. 10628 len. 11]: said the old man with a clap of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 10629 len. 6]: ` Most elegant taste ! '
Parsing [sent. 10630 len. 13]: ` Glad you like 'em , ' returned Miss Wren , loftily .
Parsing [sent. 10631 len. 19]: ` But the fun is , godmother , how I make the great ladies try my dresses on .
Parsing [sent. 10632 len. 27]: Though it 's the hardest part of my business , and would be , even if my back were not bad and my legs queer . '
Parsing [sent. 10633 len. 11]: He looked at her as not understanding what she said .
Parsing [sent. 10634 len. 22]: ` Bless you , godmother , ' said Miss Wren , ' I have to scud about town at all hours .
Parsing [sent. 10635 len. 38]: If it was only sitting at my bench , cutting out and sewing , it would be comparatively easy work ; but it 's the trying-on by the great ladies that takes it out of me . '
Parsing [sent. 10636 len. 7]: ` How , the trying-on ? '
Parsing [sent. 10637 len. 3]: asked Riah .
Parsing [sent. 10638 len. 12]: ` What a mooney godmother you are , after all ! '
Parsing [sent. 10639 len. 4]: returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10640 len. 4]: ` Look here .
Parsing [sent. 10641 len. 27]: There 's a Drawing Room , or a grand day in the Park , or a Show , or a Fete , or what you like .
Parsing [sent. 10642 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 10643 len. 12]: I squeeze among the crowd , and I look about me .
Parsing [sent. 10644 len. 23]: When I see a great lady very suitable for my business , I say `` You 'll do , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 10645 len. 19]: and I take particular notice of her , and run home and cut her out and baste her .
Parsing [sent. 10646 len. 23]: Then another day , I come scudding back again to try on , and then I take particular notice of her again .
Parsing [sent. 10647 len. 16]: Sometimes she plainly seems to say , ` How that little creature is staring ! '
Parsing [sent. 10648 len. 17]: and sometimes likes it and sometimes do n't , but much more often yes than no .
Parsing [sent. 10649 len. 46]: All the time I am only saying to myself , `` I must hollow out a bit here ; I must slope away there ; '' and I am making a perfect slave of her , with making her try on my doll 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 10650 len. 46]: Evening parties are severer work for me , because there 's only a doorway for a full view , and what with hobbling among the wheels of the carriages and the legs of the horses , I fully expect to be run over some night .
Parsing [sent. 10651 len. 11]: However , there I have 'em , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 10652 len. 60]: When they go bobbing into the hall from the carriage , and catch a glimpse of my little physiognomy poked out from behind a policeman 's cape in the rain , I dare say they think I am wondering and admiring with all my eyes and heart , but they little think they 're only working for my dolls !
Parsing [sent. 10653 len. 6]: There was Lady Belinda Whitrose .
Parsing [sent. 10654 len. 10]: I made her do double duty in one night .
Parsing [sent. 10655 len. 19]: I said when she came out of the carriage , `` YOU 'll do , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10656 len. 13]: and I ran straight home and cut her out and basted her .
Parsing [sent. 10657 len. 15]: Back I came again , and waited behind the men that called the carriages .
Parsing [sent. 10658 len. 5]: Very bad night too .
Parsing [sent. 10659 len. 10]: At last , `` Lady Belinda Whitrose 's carriage !
Parsing [sent. 10660 len. 7]: Lady Belinda Whitrose coming down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10661 len. 9]: And I made her try on -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 10662 len. 12]: and take pains about it too -- before she got seated .
Parsing [sent. 10663 len. 27]: That 's Lady Belinda hanging up by the waist , much too near the gaslight for a wax one , with her toes turned in . '
Parsing [sent. 10664 len. 27]: When they had plodded on for some time nigh the river , Riah asked the way to a certain tavern called the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters .
Parsing [sent. 10665 len. 35]: Following the directions he received , they arrived , after two or three puzzled stoppages for consideration , and some uncertain looking about them , at the door of Miss Abbey Potterson 's dominions .
Parsing [sent. 10666 len. 34]: A peep through the glass portion of the door revealed to them the glories of the bar , and Miss Abbey herself seated in state on her snug throne , reading the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 10667 len. 10]: To whom , with deference , they presented themselves .
Parsing [sent. 10668 len. 51]: Taking her eyes off her newspaper , and pausing with a suspended expression of countenance , as if she must finish the paragraph in hand before undertaking any other business whatever , Miss Abbey demanded , with some slight asperity : ` Now then , what 's for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10669 len. 8]: ` Could we see Miss Potterson ? '
Parsing [sent. 10670 len. 9]: asked the old man , uncovering his head .
Parsing [sent. 10671 len. 18]: ` You not only could , but you can and you do , ' replied the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 10672 len. 10]: ` Might we speak with you , madam ? '
Parsing [sent. 10673 len. 19]: By this time Miss Abbey 's eyes had possessed themselves of the small figure of Miss Jenny Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10674 len. 25]: For the closer observation of which , Miss Abbey laid aside her newspaper , rose , and looked over the half-door of the bar .
Parsing [sent. 10675 len. 48]: The crutch-stick seemed to entreat for its owner leave to come in and rest by the fire ; so , Miss Abbey opened the half-door , and said , as though replying to the crutchstick : ` Yes , come in and rest by the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 10676 len. 25]: ` My name is Riah , ' said the old man , with courteous action , ` and my avocation is in London city .
Parsing [sent. 10677 len. 17]: This , my young companion -- ' ` Stop a bit , ' interposed Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10678 len. 10]: ` I 'll give the lady my card . '
Parsing [sent. 10679 len. 29]: She produced it from her pocket with an air , after struggling with the gigantic door-key which had got upon the top of it and kept it down .
Parsing [sent. 10680 len. 30]: Miss Abbey , with manifest tokens of astonishment , took the diminutive document , and found it to run concisely thus : -- MISS JENNY WREN DOLLS ' DRESSMAKER .
Parsing [sent. 10681 len. 7]: Dolls attended at their own residences .
Parsing [sent. 10682 len. 4]: ` Lud ! '
Parsing [sent. 10683 len. 6]: exclaimed Miss Potterson , staring .
Parsing [sent. 10684 len. 5]: And dropped the card .
Parsing [sent. 10685 len. 28]: ` We take the liberty of coming , my young companion and I , madam , ' said Riah , ` on behalf of Lizzie Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 10686 len. 14]: Miss Potterson was stooping to loosen the bonnet-strings of the dolls ' dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 10687 len. 20]: She looked round rather angrily , and said : ` Lizzie Hexam is a very proud young woman . '
Parsing [sent. 10688 len. 45]: ` She would be so proud , ' returned Riah , dexterously , ` to stand well in your good opinion , that before she quitted London for -- ' ` For where , in the name of the Cape of Good Hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 10689 len. 12]: asked Miss Potterson , as though supposing her to have emigrated .
Parsing [sent. 10690 len. 36]: ` For the country , ' was the cautious answer , -- ` she made us promise to come and show you a paper , which she left in our hands for that special purpose .
Parsing [sent. 10691 len. 20]: I am an unserviceable friend of hers , who began to know her after her departure from this neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 10692 len. 24]: She has been for some time living with my young companion , and has been a helpful and a comfortable friend to her .
Parsing [sent. 10693 len. 14]: Much needed , madam , ' he added , in a lower voice .
Parsing [sent. 10694 len. 14]: ` Believe me ; if you knew all , much needed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10695 len. 19]: I can believe that , ' said Miss Abbey , with a softening glance at the little creature .
Parsing [sent. 10696 len. 41]: ` And if it 's proud to have a heart that never hardens , and a temper that never tires , and a touch that never hurts , ' Miss Jenny struck in , flushed , ` she is proud .
Parsing [sent. 10697 len. 11]: And if it 's not , she is NOT . '
Parsing [sent. 10698 len. 26]: Her set purpose of contradicting Miss Abbey point blank , was so far from offending that dread authority , as to elicit a gracious smile .
Parsing [sent. 10699 len. 25]: ` You do right , child , ' said Miss Abbey , ` to speak well of those who deserve well of you . '
Parsing [sent. 10700 len. 41]: ` Right or wrong , ' muttered Miss Wren , inaudibly , with a visible hitch of her chin , ' I mean to do it , and you may make up your mind to THAT , old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 10701 len. 32]: ` Here is the paper , madam , ' said the Jew , delivering into Miss Potterson 's hands the original document drawn up by Rokesmith , and signed by Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 10702 len. 9]: ` Will you please to read it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10703 len. 22]: ` But first of all , ' said Miss Abbey , ' -- did you ever taste shrub , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 10704 len. 6]: Miss Wren shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 10705 len. 7]: ` Should you like to ? '
Parsing [sent. 10706 len. 12]: ` Should if it 's good , ' returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10707 len. 5]: ` You shall try .
Parsing [sent. 10708 len. 18]: And , if you find it good , I 'll mix some for you with hot water .
Parsing [sent. 10709 len. 9]: Put your poor little feet on the fender .
Parsing [sent. 10710 len. 15]: It 's a cold , cold night , and the fog clings so . '
Parsing [sent. 10711 len. 18]: As Miss Abbey helped her to turn her chair , her loosened bonnet dropped on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 10712 len. 8]: ` Why , what lovely hair ! '
Parsing [sent. 10713 len. 4]: cried Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 10714 len. 14]: ` And enough to make wigs for all the dolls in the world .
Parsing [sent. 10715 len. 5]: What a quantity ! '
Parsing [sent. 10716 len. 7]: ` Call THAT a quantity ? '
Parsing [sent. 10717 len. 4]: returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10718 len. 3]: ` Poof !
Parsing [sent. 10719 len. 11]: What do you say to the rest of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10720 len. 28]: As she spoke , she untied a band , and the golden stream fell over herself and over the chair , and flowed down to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 10721 len. 10]: Miss Abbey 's admiration seemed to increase her perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 10722 len. 27]: She beckoned the Jew towards her , as she reached down the shrub-bottle from its niche , and whispered : ` Child , or woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 10723 len. 18]: ` Child in years , ' was the answer ; ` woman in self-reliance and trial . '
Parsing [sent. 10724 len. 26]: ` You are talking about Me , good people , ' thought Miss Jenny , sitting in her golden bower , warming her feet . '
Parsing [sent. 10725 len. 18]: I ca n't hear what you say , but I know your tricks and your manners ! '
Parsing [sent. 10726 len. 34]: The shrub , when tasted from a spoon , perfectly harmonizing with Miss Jenny 's palate , a judicious amount was mixed by Miss Potterson 's skilful hands , whereof Riah too partook .
Parsing [sent. 10727 len. 42]: After this preliminary , Miss Abbey read the document ; and , as often as she raised her eyebrows in so doing , the watchful Miss Jenny accompanied the action with an expressive and emphatic sip of the shrub and water .
Parsing [sent. 10728 len. 44]: ` As far as this goes , ' said Miss Abbey Potterson , when she had read it several times , and thought about it , ` it proves -LRB- what did n't much need proving -RRB- that Rogue Riderhood is a villain .
Parsing [sent. 10729 len. 30]: I have my doubts whether he is not the villain who solely did the deed ; but I have no expectation of those doubts ever being cleared up now .
Parsing [sent. 10730 len. 45]: I believe I did Lizzie 's father wrong , but never Lizzie 's self ; because when things were at the worst I trusted her , had perfect confidence in her , and tried to persuade her to come to me for a refuge .
Parsing [sent. 10731 len. 19]: I am very sorry to have done a man wrong , particularly when it ca n't be undone .
Parsing [sent. 10732 len. 45]: Be kind enough to let Lizzie know what I say ; not forgetting that if she will come to the Porters , after all , bygones being bygones , she will find a home at the Porters , and a friend at the Porters .
Parsing [sent. 10733 len. 28]: She knows Miss Abbey of old , remind her , and she knows what-like the home , and what-like the friend , is likely to turn out .
Parsing [sent. 10734 len. 44]: I am generally short and sweet -- or short and sour , according as it may be and as opinions vary -- ' remarked Miss Abbey , ` and that 's about all I have got to say , and enough too . '
Parsing [sent. 10735 len. 28]: But before the shrub and water was sipped out , Miss Abbey bethought herself that she would like to keep a copy of the paper by her .
Parsing [sent. 10736 len. 27]: ` It 's not long , sir , ' said she to Riah , ` and perhaps you would n't mind just jotting it down . '
Parsing [sent. 10737 len. 55]: The old man willingly put on his spectacles , and , standing at the little desk in the corner where Miss Abbey filed her receipts and kept her sample phials -LRB- customers ' scores were interdicted by the strict administration of the Porters -RRB- , wrote out the copy in a fair round character .
Parsing [sent. 10738 len. 71]: As he stood there , doing his methodical penmanship , his ancient scribelike figure intent upon the work , and the little dolls ' dressmaker sitting in her golden bower before the fire , Miss Abbey had her doubts whether she had not dreamed those two rare figures into the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowships , and might not wake with a nod next moment and find them gone .
Parsing [sent. 10739 len. 35]: Miss Abbey had twice made the experiment of shutting her eyes and opening them again , still finding the figures there , when , dreamlike , a confused hubbub arose in the public room .
Parsing [sent. 10740 len. 53]: As she started up , and they all three looked at one another , it became a noise of clamouring voices and of the stir of feet ; then all the windows were heard to be hastily thrown up , and shouts and cries came floating into the house from the river .
Parsing [sent. 10741 len. 29]: A moment more , and Bob Gliddery came clattering along the passage , with the noise of all the nails in his boots condensed into every separate nail .
Parsing [sent. 10742 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10743 len. 4]: asked Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 10744 len. 16]: ` It 's summut run down in the fog , ma'am , ' answered Bob .
Parsing [sent. 10745 len. 12]: ` There 's ever so many people in the river . '
Parsing [sent. 10746 len. 11]: ` Tell 'em to put on all the kettles ! '
Parsing [sent. 10747 len. 4]: cried Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 10748 len. 8]: ` See that the boiler 's full .
Parsing [sent. 10749 len. 5]: Get a bath out .
Parsing [sent. 10750 len. 7]: Hang some blankets to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 10751 len. 5]: Heat some stone bottles .
Parsing [sent. 10752 len. 16]: Have your senses about you , you girls down stairs , and use 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 10753 len. 68]: While Miss Abbey partly delivered these directions to Bob -- whom she seized by the hair , and whose head she knocked against the wall , as a general injunction to vigilance and presence of mind -- and partly hailed the kitchen with them -- the company in the public room , jostling one another , rushed out to the causeway , and the outer noise increased .
Parsing [sent. 10754 len. 13]: ` Come and look , ' said Miss Abbey to her visitors .
Parsing [sent. 10755 len. 25]: They all three hurried to the vacated public room , and passed by one of the windows into the wooden verandah overhanging the river .
Parsing [sent. 10756 len. 11]: ` Does anybody down there know what has happened ? '
Parsing [sent. 10757 len. 10]: demanded Miss Abbey , in her voice of authority .
Parsing [sent. 10758 len. 18]: ` It 's a steamer , Miss Abbey , ' cried one blurred figure in the fog .
Parsing [sent. 10759 len. 14]: ` It always IS a steamer , Miss Abbey , ' cried another .
Parsing [sent. 10760 len. 19]: ` Them 's her lights , Miss Abbey , wot you see a-blinking yonder , ' cried another .
Parsing [sent. 10761 len. 29]: ` She 's a-blowing off her steam , Miss Abbey , and that 's what makes the fog and the noise worse , do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 10762 len. 3]: explained another .
Parsing [sent. 10763 len. 20]: Boats were putting off , torches were lighting up , people were rushing tumultuously to the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 10764 len. 19]: Some man fell in with a splash , and was pulled out again with a roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 10765 len. 6]: The drags were called for .
Parsing [sent. 10766 len. 11]: A cry for the life-buoy passed from mouth to mouth .
Parsing [sent. 10767 len. 35]: It was impossible to make out what was going on upon the river , for every boat that put off sculled into the fog and was lost to view at a boat 's length .
Parsing [sent. 10768 len. 16]: Nothing was clear but that the unpopular steamer was assailed with reproaches on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 10769 len. 82]: She was the Murderer , bound for Gallows Bay ; she was the Manslaughterer , bound for Penal Settlement ; her captain ought to be tried for his life ; her crew ran down men in row-boats with a relish ; she mashed up Thames lightermen with her paddles ; she fired property with her funnels ; she always was , and she always would be , wreaking destruction upon somebody or something , after the manner of all her kind .
Parsing [sent. 10770 len. 18]: The whole bulk of the fog teemed with such taunts , uttered in tones of universal hoarseness .
Parsing [sent. 10771 len. 27]: All the while , the steamer 's lights moved spectrally a very little , as she layto , waiting the upshot of whatever accident had happened .
Parsing [sent. 10772 len. 7]: Now , she began burning blue-lights .
Parsing [sent. 10773 len. 55]: These made a luminous patch about her , as if she had set the fog on fire , and in the patch -- the cries changing their note , and becoming more fitful and more excited -- shadows of men and boats could be seen moving , while voices shouted : ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 10774 len. 6]: ` There again ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10775 len. 7]: A couple more strokes ahead ! '
Parsing [sent. 10776 len. 4]: ` Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10777 len. 5]: ` Look out ! '
Parsing [sent. 10778 len. 5]: ` Hold on ! '
Parsing [sent. 10779 len. 5]: ` Haul in ! '
Parsing [sent. 10780 len. 4]: and the like .
Parsing [sent. 10781 len. 40]: Lastly , with a few tumbling clots of blue fire , the night closed in dark again , the wheels of the steamer were heard revolving , and her lights glided smoothly away in the direction of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 10782 len. 18]: It appeared to Miss Abbey and her two companions that a considerable time had been thus occupied .
Parsing [sent. 10783 len. 41]: There was now as eager a set towards the shore beneath the house as there had been from it ; and it was only on the first boat of the rush coming in that it was known what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 10784 len. 28]: ` If that 's Tom Tootle , ' Miss Abbey made proclamation , in her most commanding tones , ` let him instantly come underneath here . '
Parsing [sent. 10785 len. 10]: The submissive Tom complied , attended by a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 10786 len. 8]: ` What is it , Tootle ? '
Parsing [sent. 10787 len. 4]: demanded Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 10788 len. 15]: ` It 's a foreign steamer , miss , run down a wherry . '
Parsing [sent. 10789 len. 8]: ` How many in the wherry ? '
Parsing [sent. 10790 len. 8]: ` One man , Miss Abbey . '
Parsing [sent. 10791 len. 4]: ` Found ? '
Parsing [sent. 10792 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 10793 len. 20]: He 's been under water a long time , Miss ; but they 've grappled up the body . '
Parsing [sent. 10794 len. 7]: ` Let 'em bring it here .
Parsing [sent. 10795 len. 26]: You , Bob Gliddery , shut the house-door and stand by it on the inside , and do n't you open till I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 10796 len. 6]: Any police down there ? '
Parsing [sent. 10797 len. 11]: ` Here , Miss Abbey , ' was official rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 10798 len. 17]: ` After they have brought the body in , keep the crowd out , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 10799 len. 10]: And help Bob Gliddery to shut 'em out . '
Parsing [sent. 10800 len. 8]: ` All right , Miss Abbey . '
Parsing [sent. 10801 len. 37]: The autocratic landlady withdrew into the house with Riah and Miss Jenny , and disposed those forces , one on either side of her , within the half-door of the bar , as behind a breastwork .
Parsing [sent. 10802 len. 27]: ` You two stand close here , ' said Miss Abbey , ` and you 'll come to no hurt , and see it brought in .
Parsing [sent. 10803 len. 9]: Bob , you stand by the door . '
Parsing [sent. 10804 len. 20]: That sentinel , smartly giving his rolled shirt-sleeves an extra and a final tuck on his shoulders , obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 10805 len. 10]: Sound of advancing voices , sound of advancing steps .
Parsing [sent. 10806 len. 5]: Shuffle and talk without .
Parsing [sent. 10807 len. 3]: Momentary pause .
Parsing [sent. 10808 len. 31]: Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the door , as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with the soles of his motionless feet .
Parsing [sent. 10809 len. 27]: ` That 's the stretcher , or the shutter , whichever of the two they are carrying , ' said Miss Abbey , with experienced ear .
Parsing [sent. 10810 len. 7]: ` Open , you Bob ! '
Parsing [sent. 10811 len. 3]: Door opened .
Parsing [sent. 10812 len. 6]: Heavy tread of laden men .
Parsing [sent. 10813 len. 3]: A halt .
Parsing [sent. 10814 len. 3]: A rush .
Parsing [sent. 10815 len. 4]: Stoppage of rush .
Parsing [sent. 10816 len. 3]: Door shut .
Parsing [sent. 10817 len. 10]: Baffled boots from the vexed souls of disappointed outsiders .
Parsing [sent. 10818 len. 7]: ` Come on , men ! '
Parsing [sent. 10819 len. 21]: said Miss Abbey ; for so potent was she with her subjects that even then the bearers awaited her permission .
Parsing [sent. 10820 len. 5]: ` First floor . '
Parsing [sent. 10821 len. 28]: The entry being low , and the staircase being low , they so took up the burden they had set down , as to carry that low .
Parsing [sent. 10822 len. 16]: The recumbent figure , in passing , lay hardly as high as the half door .
Parsing [sent. 10823 len. 9]: Miss Abbey started back at sight of it .
Parsing [sent. 10824 len. 7]: ` Why , good God ! '
Parsing [sent. 10825 len. 27]: said she , turning to her two companions , ` that 's the very man who made the declaration we have just had in our hands .
Parsing [sent. 10826 len. 5]: That 's Riderhood ! '
Parsing [sent. 10827 len. 45]: Chapter 3 THE SAME RESPECTED FRIEND IN MORE ASPECTS THAN ONE In sooth , it is Riderhood and no other , or it is the outer husk and shell of Riderhood and no other , that is borne into Miss Abbey 's first-floor bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 10828 len. 63]: Supple to twist and turn as the Rogue has ever been , he is sufficiently rigid now ; and not without much shuffling of attendant feet , and tilting of his bier this way and that way , and peril even of his sliding off it and being tumbled in a heap over the balustrades , can he be got up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 10829 len. 10]: ` Fetch a doctor , ' quoth Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 10830 len. 9]: And then , ` Fetch his daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 10831 len. 10]: On both of which errands , quick messengers depart .
Parsing [sent. 10832 len. 14]: The doctor-seeking messenger meets the doctor halfway , coming under convoy of police .
Parsing [sent. 10833 len. 23]: Doctor examines the dank carcase , and pronounces , not hopefully , that it is worth while trying to reanimate the same .
Parsing [sent. 10834 len. 23]: All the best means are at once in action , and everybody present lends a hand , and a heart and soul .
Parsing [sent. 10835 len. 64]: No one has the least regard for the man ; with them all , he has been an object of avoidance , suspicion , and aversion ; but the spark of life within him is curiously separable from himself now , and they have a deep interest in it , probably because it IS life , and they are living and must die .
Parsing [sent. 10836 len. 36]: In answer to the doctor 's inquiry how did it happen , and was anyone to blame , Tom Tootle gives in his verdict , unavoidable accident and no one to blame but the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 10837 len. 49]: ` He was slinking about in his boat , ' says Tom , ` which slinking were , not to speak ill of the dead , the manner of the man , when he come right athwart the steamer 's bows and she cut him in two . '
Parsing [sent. 10838 len. 23]: Mr Tootle is so far figurative , touching the dismemberment , as that he means the boat , and not the man .
Parsing [sent. 10839 len. 9]: For , the man lies whole before them .
Parsing [sent. 10840 len. 103]: Captain Joey , the bottle-nosed regular customer in the glazed hat , is a pupil of the much-respected old school , and -LRB- having insinuated himself into the chamber , in the execution of the impontant service of carrying the drowned man 's neck-kerchief -RRB- favours the doctor with a sagacious old-scholastic suggestion that the body should be hung up by the heels , ` sim ` lar ' , says Captain Joey , ` to mutton in a butcher 's shop , ' and should then , as a particularly choice manoeuvre for promoting easy respiration , be rolled upon casks .
Parsing [sent. 10841 len. 47]: These scraps of the wisdom of the captain 's ancestors are received with such speechless indignation by Miss Abbey , that she instantly seizes the Captain by the collar , and without a single word ejects him , not presuming to remonstrate , from the scene .
Parsing [sent. 10842 len. 46]: There then remain , to assist the doctor and Tom , only those three other regular customers , Bob Glamour , William Williams , and Jonathan -LRB- family name of the latter , if any , unknown to man-kind -RRB- , who are quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 10843 len. 33]: Miss Abbey having looked in to make sure that nothing is wanted , descends to the bar , and there awaits the result , with the gentle Jew and Miss Jenny Wren .
Parsing [sent. 10844 len. 24]: If you are not gone for good , Mr Riderhood , it would be something to know where you are hiding at present .
Parsing [sent. 10845 len. 22]: This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with such patient perseverance , yields no sign of you .
Parsing [sent. 10846 len. 27]: If you are gone for good , Rogue , it is very solemn , and if you are coming back , it is hardly less so .
Parsing [sent. 10847 len. 67]: Nay , in the suspense and mystery of the latter question , involving that of where you may be now , there is a solemnity even added to that of death , making us who are in attendance alike afraid to look on you and to look off you , and making those below start at the least sound of a creaking plank in the floor .
Parsing [sent. 10848 len. 2]: Stay !
Parsing [sent. 10849 len. 5]: Did that eyelid tremble ?
Parsing [sent. 10850 len. 14]: So the doctor , breathing low , and closely watching , asks himself .
Parsing [sent. 10851 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10852 len. 5]: Did that nostril twitch ?
Parsing [sent. 10853 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10854 len. 18]: This artificial respiration ceasing , do I feel any faint flutter under my hand upon the chest ?
Parsing [sent. 10855 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10856 len. 6]: Over and over again No .
Parsing [sent. 10857 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10858 len. 9]: But try over and over again , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 10859 len. 2]: See !
Parsing [sent. 10860 len. 5]: A token of life !
Parsing [sent. 10861 len. 6]: An indubitable token of life !
Parsing [sent. 10862 len. 18]: The spark may smoulder and go out , or it may glow and expand , but see !
Parsing [sent. 10863 len. 10]: The four rough fellows , seeing , shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 10864 len. 31]: Neither Riderhood in this world , nor Riderhood in the other , could draw tears from them ; but a striving human soul between the two can do it easily .
Parsing [sent. 10865 len. 7]: He is struggling to come back .
Parsing [sent. 10866 len. 14]: Now , he is almost here , now he is far away again .
Parsing [sent. 10867 len. 9]: Now he is struggling harder to get back .
Parsing [sent. 10868 len. 46]: And yet-like us all , when we swoon -- like us all , every day of our lives when we wake -- he is instinctively unwilling to be restored to the consciousness of this existence , and would be left dormant , if he could .
Parsing [sent. 10869 len. 19]: Bob Gliddery returns with Pleasant Riderhood , who was out when sought for , and hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 10870 len. 33]: She has a shawl over her head , and her first action , when she takes it off weeping , and curtseys to Miss Abbey , is to wind her hair up .
Parsing [sent. 10871 len. 14]: ` Thank you , Miss Abbey , for having father here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10872 len. 39]: I am bound to say , girl , I did n't know who it was , ' returns Miss Abbey ; ` but I hope it would have been pretty much the same if I had known . '
Parsing [sent. 10873 len. 17]: Poor Pleasant , fortified with a sip of brandy , is ushered into the first-floor chamber .
Parsing [sent. 10874 len. 61]: She could not express much sentiment about her father if she were called upon to pronounce his funeral oration , but she has a greater tenderness for him than he ever had for her , and crying bitterly when she sees him stretched unconscious , asks the doctor , with clasped hands : ` Is there no hope , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 10875 len. 4]: O poor father !
Parsing [sent. 10876 len. 6]: Is poor father dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 10877 len. 50]: To which the doctor , on one knee beside the body , busy and watchful , only rejoins without looking round : ` Now , my girl , unless you have the self-command to be perfectly quiet , I can not allow you to remain in the room . '
Parsing [sent. 10878 len. 39]: Pleasant , consequently , wipes her eyes with her back-hair , which is in fresh need of being wound up , and having got it out of the way , watches with terrified interest all that goes on .
Parsing [sent. 10879 len. 15]: Her natural woman 's aptitude soon renders her able to give a little help .
Parsing [sent. 10880 len. 37]: Anticipating the doctor 's want of this or that , she quietly has it ready for him , and so by degrees is intrusted with the charge of supporting her father 's head upon her arm .
Parsing [sent. 10881 len. 56]: It is something so new to Pleasant to see her father an object of sympathy and interest , to find any one very willing to tolerate his society in this world , not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating him to belong to it , that it gives her a sensation she never experienced before .
Parsing [sent. 10882 len. 25]: Some hazy idea that if affairs could remain thus for a long time it would be a respectable change , floats in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 10883 len. 42]: Also some vague idea that the old evil is drowned out of him , and that if he should happily come back to resume his occupation of the empty form that lies upon the bed , his spirit will be altered .
Parsing [sent. 10884 len. 31]: In which state of mind she kisses the stony lips , and quite believes that the impassive hand she chafes will revive a tender hand , if it revive ever .
Parsing [sent. 10885 len. 6]: Sweet delusion for Pleasant Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 10886 len. 45]: But they minister to him with such extraordinary interest , their anxiety is so keen , their vigilance is so great , their excited joy grows so intense as the signs of life strengthen , that how can she resist it , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 10887 len. 38]: And now he begins to breathe naturally , and he stirs , and the doctor declares him to have come back from that inexplicable journey where he stopped on the dark road , and to be here .
Parsing [sent. 10888 len. 22]: Tom Tootle , who is nearest to the doctor when he says this , grasps the doctor fervently by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 10889 len. 27]: Bob Glamour , William Williams , and Jonathan of the no surname , all shake hands with one another round , and with the doctor too .
Parsing [sent. 10890 len. 30]: Bob Glamour blows his nose , and Jonathan of the no surname is moved to do likewise , but lacking a pocket handkerchief abandons that outlet for his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 10891 len. 17]: Pleasant sheds tears deserving her own name , and her sweet delusion is at its height .
Parsing [sent. 10892 len. 7]: There is intelligence in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10893 len. 7]: He wants to ask a question .
Parsing [sent. 10894 len. 6]: He wonders where he is .
Parsing [sent. 10895 len. 3]: Tell him .
Parsing [sent. 10896 len. 20]: ` Father , you were run down on the river , and are at Miss Abbey Potterson 's . '
Parsing [sent. 10897 len. 22]: He stares at his daughter , stares all around him , closes his eyes , and lies slumbering on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 10898 len. 7]: The short-lived delusion begins to fade .
Parsing [sent. 10899 len. 27]: The low , bad , unimpressible face is coming up from the depths of the river , or what other depths , to the surface again .
Parsing [sent. 10900 len. 13]: As he grows warm , the doctor and the four men cool .
Parsing [sent. 10901 len. 16]: As his lineaments soften with life , their faces and their hearts harden to him .
Parsing [sent. 10902 len. 24]: ` He will do now , ' says the doctor , washing his hands , and looking at the patient with growing disfavour .
Parsing [sent. 10903 len. 26]: ` Many a better man , ' moralizes Tom Tootle with a gloomy shake of the head , ` ai n't had his luck . '
Parsing [sent. 10904 len. 29]: ` It 's to be hoped he 'll make a better use of his life , ' says Bob Glamour , ` than I expect he will . '
Parsing [sent. 10905 len. 12]: ` Or than he done afore , ' adds William Williams .
Parsing [sent. 10906 len. 8]: ` But no , not he ! '
Parsing [sent. 10907 len. 11]: says Jonathan of the no surname , clinching the quartette .
Parsing [sent. 10908 len. 39]: They speak in a low tone because of his daughter , but she sees that they have all drawn off , and that they stand in a group at the other end of the room , shunning him .
Parsing [sent. 10909 len. 42]: It would be too much to suspect them of being sorry that he did n't die when he had done so much towards it , but they clearly wish that they had had a better subject to bestow their pains on .
Parsing [sent. 10910 len. 29]: Intelligence is conveyed to Miss Abbey in the bar , who reappears on the scene , and contemplates from a distance , holding whispered discourse with the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 10911 len. 48]: The spark of life was deeply interesting while it was in abeyance , but now that it has got established in Mr Riderhood , there appears to be a general desire that circumstances had admitted of its being developed in anybody else , rather than that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 10912 len. 41]: ` However , ' says Miss Abbey , cheering them up , ` you have done your duty like good and true men , and you had better come down and take something at the expense of the Porters . '
Parsing [sent. 10913 len. 12]: This they all do , leaving the daughter watching the father .
Parsing [sent. 10914 len. 12]: To whom , in their absence , Bob Gliddery presents himself .
Parsing [sent. 10915 len. 11]: ` His gills looks rum ; do n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 10916 len. 8]: says Bob , after inspecting the patient .
Parsing [sent. 10917 len. 4]: Pleasant faintly nods .
Parsing [sent. 10918 len. 15]: ` His gills 'll look rummer when he wakes ; wo n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 10919 len. 3]: says Bob .
Parsing [sent. 10920 len. 4]: Pleasant hopes not .
Parsing [sent. 10921 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 10922 len. 14]: ` When he finds himself here , you know , ' Bob explains .
Parsing [sent. 10923 len. 14]: 'Cause Miss Abbey forbid him the house and ordered him out of it .
Parsing [sent. 10924 len. 13]: But what you may call the Fates ordered him into it again .
Parsing [sent. 10925 len. 9]: Which is rumness ; ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10926 len. 25]: ` He would n't have come here of his own accord , ' returns poor Pleasant , with an effort at a little pride .
Parsing [sent. 10927 len. 7]: ` No , ' retorts Bob .
Parsing [sent. 10928 len. 15]: ` Nor he would n't have been let in , if he had . '
Parsing [sent. 10929 len. 8]: The short delusion is quite dispelled now .
Parsing [sent. 10930 len. 27]: As plainly as she sees on her arm the old father , unimproved , Pleasant sees that everybody there will cut him when he recovers consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 10931 len. 28]: ` I 'll take him away ever so soon as I can , ' thinks Pleasant with a sigh ; ` he 's best at home . '
Parsing [sent. 10932 len. 24]: Presently they all return , and wait for him to become conscious that they will all be glad to get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 10933 len. 26]: Some clothes are got together for him to wear , his own being saturated with water , and his present dress being composed of blankets .
Parsing [sent. 10934 len. 46]: Becoming more and more uncomfortable , as though the prevalent dislike were finding him out somewhere in his sleep and expressing itself to him , the patient at last opens his eyes wide , and is assisted by his daughter to sit up in bed .
Parsing [sent. 10935 len. 17]: ` Well , Riderhood , ' says the doctor , ` how do you feel ? '
Parsing [sent. 10936 len. 11]: He replies gruffly , ` Nothing to boast on . '
Parsing [sent. 10937 len. 15]: Having , in fact , returned to life in an uncommonly sulky state . '
Parsing [sent. 10938 len. 36]: I do n't mean to preach ; but I hope , ' says the doctor , gravely shaking his head , ` that this escape may have a good effect upon you , Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 10939 len. 39]: The patient 's discontented growl of a reply is not intelligible ; his daughter , however , could interpret , if she would , that what he says is , he ` do n't want no Poll-Parroting ' .
Parsing [sent. 10940 len. 31]: Mr Riderhood next demands his shirt ; and draws it on over his head -LRB- with his daughter 's help -RRB- exactly as if he had just had a Fight .
Parsing [sent. 10941 len. 8]: ` War n't it a steamer ? '
Parsing [sent. 10942 len. 6]: he pauses to ask her .
Parsing [sent. 10943 len. 6]: ` Yes , father . '
Parsing [sent. 10944 len. 12]: ` I 'll have the law on her , bust her !
Parsing [sent. 10945 len. 8]: and make her pay for it . '
Parsing [sent. 10946 len. 32]: He then buttons his linen very moodily , twice or thrice stopping to examine his arms and hands , as if to see what punishment he has received in the Fight .
Parsing [sent. 10947 len. 29]: He then doggedly demands his other garments , and slowly gets them on , with an appearance of great malevolence towards his late opponent and all the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 10948 len. 39]: He has an impression that his nose is bleeding , and several times draws the back of his hand across it , and looks for the result , in a pugilistic manner , greatly strengthening that incongruous resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 10949 len. 8]: ` Where 's my fur cap ? '
Parsing [sent. 10950 len. 15]: he asks in a surly voice , when he has shuffled his clothes on .
Parsing [sent. 10951 len. 9]: ` In the river , ' somebody rejoins .
Parsing [sent. 10952 len. 13]: ` And war n't there no honest man to pick it up ?
Parsing [sent. 10953 len. 15]: O ' course there was though , and to cut off with it arterwards .
Parsing [sent. 10954 len. 11]: You are a rare lot , all on you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10955 len. 32]: Thus , Mr Riderhood : taking from the hands of his daughter , with special ill-will , a lent cap , and grumbling as he pulls it down over his ears .
Parsing [sent. 10956 len. 24]: Then , getting on his unsteady legs , leaning heavily upon her , and growling , ` Hold still , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 10957 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 10958 len. 11]: You must be a staggering next , must you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10959 len. 19]: he takes his departure out of the ring in which he has had that little turn-up with Death .
Parsing [sent. 10960 len. 49]: Chapter 4 A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY Mr and Mrs Wilfer had seen a full quarter of a hundred more anniversaries of their wedding day than Mr and Mrs Lammle had seen of theirs , but they still celebrated the occasion in the bosom of their family .
Parsing [sent. 10961 len. 40]: Not that these celebrations ever resulted in anything particularly agreeable , or that the family was ever disappointed by that circumstance on account of having looked forward to the return of the auspicious day with sanguine anticipations of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 10962 len. 33]: It was kept morally , rather as a Fast than a Feast , enabling Mrs Wilfer to hold a sombre darkling state , which exhibited that impressive woman in her choicest colours .
Parsing [sent. 10963 len. 19]: The noble lady 's condition on these delightful occasions was one compounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 10964 len. 54]: Lurid indications of the better marriages she might have made , shone athwart the awful gloom of her composure , and fitfully revealed the cherub as a little monster unaccountably favoured by Heaven , who had possessed himself of a blessing for which many of his superiors had sued and contended in vain .
Parsing [sent. 10965 len. 27]: So firmly had this his position towards his treasure become established , that when the anniversary arrived , it always found him in an apologetic state .
Parsing [sent. 10966 len. 35]: It is not impossible that his modest penitence may have even gone the length of sometimes severely reproving him for that he ever took the liberty of making so exalted a character his wife .
Parsing [sent. 10967 len. 54]: As for the children of the union , their experience of these festivals had been sufficiently uncomfortable to lead them annually to wish , when out of their tenderest years , either that Ma had married somebody else instead of much-teased Pa , or that Pa had married somebody else instead of Ma .
Parsing [sent. 10968 len. 63]: When there came to be but two sisters left at home , the daring mind of Bella on the next of these occasions scaled the height of wondering with droll vexation ` what on earth Pa ever could have seen in Ma , to induce him to make such a little fool of himself as to ask her to have him . '
Parsing [sent. 10969 len. 25]: The revolving year now bringing the day round in its orderly sequence , Bella arrived in the Boffin chariot to assist at the celebration .
Parsing [sent. 10970 len. 42]: It was the family custom when the day recurred , to sacrifice a pair of fowls on the altar of Hymen ; and Bella had sent a note beforehand , to intimate that she would bring the votive offering with her .
Parsing [sent. 10971 len. 51]: So , Bella and the fowls , by the united energies of two horses , two men , four wheels , and a plum-pudding carriage dog with as uncomfortable a collar on as if he had been George the Fourth , were deposited at the door of the parental dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 10972 len. 29]: They were there received by Mrs Wilfer in person , whose dignity on this , as on most special occasions , was heightened by a mysterious toothache . '
Parsing [sent. 10973 len. 14]: I shall not require the carriage at night , ' said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 10974 len. 6]: I shall walk back . '
Parsing [sent. 10975 len. 55]: The male domestic of Mrs Boffin touched his hat , and in the act of departure had an awful glare bestowed upon him by Mrs Wilfer , intended to carry deep into his audacious soul the assurance that , whatever his private suspicions might be , male domestics in livery were no rarity there .
Parsing [sent. 10976 len. 19]: ` Well , dear Ma , ' said Bella , ` and how do you do ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10977 len. 19]: I am as well , Bella , ' replied Mrs Wilfer , ` as can be expected . '
Parsing [sent. 10978 len. 21]: ` Dear me , Ma , ' said Bella ; ` you talk as if one was just born ! '
Parsing [sent. 10979 len. 28]: ` That 's exactly what Ma has been doing , ' interposed Lavvy , over the maternal shoulder , ` ever since we got up this morning .
Parsing [sent. 10980 len. 21]: It 's all very well to laugh , Bella , but anything more exasperating it is impossible to conceive . '
Parsing [sent. 10981 len. 33]: Mrs Wilfer , with a look too full of majesty to be accompanied by any words , attended both her daughters to the kitchen , where the sacrifice was to be prepared .
Parsing [sent. 10982 len. 25]: ` Mr Rokesmith , ' said she , resignedly , ` has been so polite as to place his sitting-room at our disposal to-day .
Parsing [sent. 10983 len. 42]: You will therefore , Bella , be entertained in the humble abode of your parents , so far in accordance with your present style of living , that there will be a drawing-room for your reception as well as a dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 10984 len. 12]: Your papa invited Mr Rokesmith to partake of our lowly fare .
Parsing [sent. 10985 len. 19]: In excusing himself on account of a particular engagement , he offered the use of his apartment . '
Parsing [sent. 10986 len. 27]: Bella happened to know that he had no engagement out of his own room at Mr Boffin 's , but she approved of his staying away .
Parsing [sent. 10987 len. 29]: ` We should only have put one another out of countenance , ' she thought , ` and we do that quite often enough as it is . '
Parsing [sent. 10988 len. 29]: Yet she had sufficient curiosity about his room , to run up to it with the least possible delay , and make a close inspection of its contents .
Parsing [sent. 10989 len. 12]: It was tastefully though economically furnished , and very neatly arranged .
Parsing [sent. 10990 len. 41]: There were shelves and stands of books , English , French , and Italian ; and in a portfolio on the writing-table there were sheets upon sheets of memoranda and calculations in figures , evidently referring to the Boffin property .
Parsing [sent. 10991 len. 38]: On that table also , carefully backed with canvas , varnished , mounted , and rolled like a map , was the placard descriptive of the murdered man who had come from afar to be her husband .
Parsing [sent. 10992 len. 20]: She shrank from this ghostly surprise , and felt quite frightened as she rolled and tied it up again .
Parsing [sent. 10993 len. 32]: Peeping about here and there , she came upon a print , a graceful head of a pretty woman , elegantly framed , hanging in the corner by the easy chair .
Parsing [sent. 10994 len. 8]: ` Oh , indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 10995 len. 10]: said Bella , after stopping to ruminate before it .
Parsing [sent. 10996 len. 7]: ` Oh , indeed , sir !
Parsing [sent. 10997 len. 12]: I fancy I can guess whom you think THAT 'S like .
Parsing [sent. 10998 len. 16]: But I 'll tell you what it 's much more like -- your impudence ! '
Parsing [sent. 10999 len. 23]: Having said which she decamped : not solely because she was offended , but because there was nothing else to look at .
Parsing [sent. 11000 len. 39]: ` Now , Ma , ' said Bella , reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a blush , ` you and Lavvy think magnificent me fit for nothing , but I intend to prove the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 11001 len. 8]: I mean to be Cook today . '
Parsing [sent. 11002 len. 4]: ` Hold ! '
Parsing [sent. 11003 len. 6]: rejoined her majestic mother . '
Parsing [sent. 11004 len. 6]: I can not permit it .
Parsing [sent. 11005 len. 7]: Cook , in that dress ! '
Parsing [sent. 11006 len. 44]: ` As for my dress , Ma , ' returned Bella , merrily searching in a dresser-drawer , ' I mean to apron it and towel it all over the front ; and as to permission , I mean to do without . '
Parsing [sent. 11007 len. 5]: ` YOU cook ? '
Parsing [sent. 11008 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 11009 len. 13]: ` YOU , who never cooked when you were at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 11010 len. 20]: ` Yes , Ma , ' returned Bella ; ` that is precisely the state of the case . '
Parsing [sent. 11011 len. 41]: She girded herself with a white apron , and busily with knots and pins contrived a bib to it , coming close and tight under her chin , as if it had caught her round the neck to kiss her .
Parsing [sent. 11012 len. 18]: Over this bib her dimples looked delightful , and under it her pretty figure not less so .
Parsing [sent. 11013 len. 26]: ` Now , Ma , ' said Bella , pushing back her hair from her temples with both hands , ` what 's first ? '
Parsing [sent. 11014 len. 43]: ` First , ' returned Mrs Wilfer solemnly , ` if you persist in what I can not but regard as conduct utterly incompatible with the equipage in which you arrived -- ' -LRB- ` Which I do , Ma . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 11015 len. 15]: ` First , then , you put the fowls down to the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 11016 len. 8]: ` To -- be -- sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 11017 len. 19]: cried Bella ; ` and flour them , and twirl them round , and there they go ! '
Parsing [sent. 11018 len. 8]: sending them spinning at a great rate .
Parsing [sent. 11019 len. 8]: ` What 's next , Ma ? '
Parsing [sent. 11020 len. 51]: ` Next , ' said Mrs Wilfer with a wave of her gloves , expressive of abdication under protest from the culinary throne , ' I would recommend examination of the bacon in the saucepan on the fire , and also of the potatoes by the application of a fork .
Parsing [sent. 11021 len. 17]: Preparation of the greens will further become necessary if you persist in this unseemly demeanour . '
Parsing [sent. 11022 len. 10]: ` As of course I do , Ma . '
Parsing [sent. 11023 len. 63]: Persisting , Bella gave her attention to one thing and forgot the other , and gave her attention to the other and forgot the third , and remembering the third was distracted by the fourth , and made amends whenever she went wrong by giving the unfortunate fowls an extra spin , which made their chance of ever getting cooked exceedingly doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 11024 len. 7]: But it was pleasant cookery too .
Parsing [sent. 11025 len. 21]: Meantime Miss Lavinia , oscillating between the kitchen and the opposite room , prepared the dining-table in the latter chamber .
Parsing [sent. 11026 len. 63]: This office she -LRB- always doing her household spiriting with unwillingness -RRB- performed in a startling series of whisks and bumps ; laying the table-cloth as if she were raising the wind , putting down the glasses and salt-cellars as if she were knocking at the door , and clashing the knives and forks in a skirmishing manner suggestive of hand-to-hand conflict .
Parsing [sent. 11027 len. 23]: ` Look at Ma , ' whispered Lavinia to Bella when this was done , and they stood over the roasting fowls .
Parsing [sent. 11028 len. 46]: ` If one was the most dutiful child in existence -LRB- of course on the whole one hopes one is -RRB- , is n't she enough to make one want to poke her with something wooden , sitting there bolt upright in a corner ? '
Parsing [sent. 11029 len. 22]: ` Only suppose , ' returned Bella , ` that poor Pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner . '
Parsing [sent. 11030 len. 14]: ` My dear , he could n't do it , ' said Lavvy .
Parsing [sent. 11031 len. 6]: ` Pa would loll directly .
Parsing [sent. 11032 len. 33]: But indeed I do not believe there ever was any human creature who could keep so bolt upright as Ma , ` or put such an amount of aggravation into one back !
Parsing [sent. 11033 len. 7]: What 's the matter , Ma ?
Parsing [sent. 11034 len. 8]: Ai n't you well , Ma ? '
Parsing [sent. 11035 len. 24]: ` Doubtless I am very well , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , turning her eyes upon her youngest born , with scornful fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 11036 len. 10]: ` What should be the matter with Me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11037 len. 16]: ` You do n't seem very brisk , Ma , ' retorted Lavvy the bold .
Parsing [sent. 11038 len. 4]: ` Brisk ? '
Parsing [sent. 11039 len. 7]: repeated her parent , ` Brisk ?
Parsing [sent. 11040 len. 7]: Whence the low expression , Lavinia ?
Parsing [sent. 11041 len. 22]: If I am uncomplaining , if I am silently contented with my lot , let that suffice for my family . '
Parsing [sent. 11042 len. 64]: ` Well , Ma , ' returned Lavvy , ` since you will force it out of me , I must respectfully take leave to say that your family are no doubt under the greatest obligations to you for having an annual toothache on your wedding day , and that it 's very disinterested in you , and an immense blessing to them .
Parsing [sent. 11043 len. 19]: Still , on the whole , it is possible to be too boastful even of that boon . '
Parsing [sent. 11044 len. 20]: ` You incarnation of sauciness , ' said Mrs Wilfer , ` do you speak like that to me ?
Parsing [sent. 11045 len. 11]: On this day , of all days in the year ?
Parsing [sent. 11046 len. 30]: Pray do you know what would have become of you , if I had not bestowed my hand upon R. W. , your father , on this day ? '
Parsing [sent. 11047 len. 37]: ` No , Ma , ' replied Lavvy , ' I really do not ; and , with the greatest respect for your abilities and information , I very much doubt if you do either . '
Parsing [sent. 11048 len. 102]: Whether or no the sharp vigour of this sally on a weak point of Mrs Wilfer 's entrenchments might have routed that heroine for the time , is rendered uncertain by the arrival of a flag of truce in the person of Mr George Sampson : bidden to the feast as a friend of the family , whose affections were now understood to be in course of transference from Bella to Lavinia , and whom Lavinia kept -- possibly in remembrance of his bad taste in having overlooked her in the first instance -- under a course of stinging discipline . '
Parsing [sent. 11049 len. 29]: I congratulate you , Mrs Wilfer , ' said Mr George Sampson , who had meditated this neat address while coming along , ` on the day . '
Parsing [sent. 11050 len. 21]: Mrs Wilfer thanked him with a magnanimous sigh , and again became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache . '
Parsing [sent. 11051 len. 19]: I am surprised , ' said Mr Sampson feebly , ` that Miss Bella condescends to cook . '
Parsing [sent. 11052 len. 24]: Here Miss Lavinia descended on the ill-starred young gentleman with a crushing supposition that at all events it was no business of his .
Parsing [sent. 11053 len. 28]: This disposed of Mr Sampson in a melancholy retirement of spirit , until the cherub arrived , whose amazement at the lovely woman 's occupation was great .
Parsing [sent. 11054 len. 66]: However , she persisted in dishing the dinner as well as cooking it , and then sat down , bibless and apronless , to partake of it as an illustrious guest : Mrs Wilfer first responding to her husband 's cheerful ` For what we are about to receive -- ` with a sepulchral Amen , calculated to cast a damp upon the stoutest appetite .
Parsing [sent. 11055 len. 28]: ` But what , ' said Bella , as she watched the carving of the fowls , ` makes them pink inside , I wonder , Pa !
Parsing [sent. 11056 len. 6]: Is it the breed ? '
Parsing [sent. 11057 len. 31]: ` No , I do n't think it 's the breed , my dear , ' returned Pa. ' I rather think it is because they are not done . '
Parsing [sent. 11058 len. 10]: ` They ought to be , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 11059 len. 27]: ` Yes , I am aware they ought to be , my dear , ' rejoined her father , ` but they -- ai n't . '
Parsing [sent. 11060 len. 45]: So , the gridiron was put in requisition , and the good-tempered cherub , who was often as un-cherubically employed in his own family as if he had been in the employment of some of the Old Masters , undertook to grill the fowls .
Parsing [sent. 11061 len. 91]: Indeed , except in respect of staring about him -LRB- a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted -RRB- , this domestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype ; with the difference , say , that he performed with a blacking-brush on the family 's boots , instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and double-basses , and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose , instead of foreshortening himself in the air with the vaguest intentions .
Parsing [sent. 11062 len. 57]: Bella helped him with his supplemental cookery , and made him very happy , but put him in mortal terror too by asking him when they sat down at table again , how he supposed they cooked fowls at the Greenwich dinners , and whether he believed they really were such pleasant dinners as people said ?
Parsing [sent. 11063 len. 39]: His secret winks and nods of remonstrance , in reply , made the mischievous Bella laugh until she choked , and then Lavinia was obliged to slap her on the back , and then she laughed the more .
Parsing [sent. 11064 len. 46]: But her mother was a fine corrective at the other end of the table ; to whom her father , in the innocence of his good-fellowship , at intervals appealed with : ` My dear , I am afraid you are not enjoying yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 11065 len. 8]: ` Why so , R. W. ? '
Parsing [sent. 11066 len. 5]: she would sonorously reply .
Parsing [sent. 11067 len. 15]: ` Because , my dear , you seem a little out of sorts . '
Parsing [sent. 11068 len. 17]: ` Not at all , ' would be the rejoinder , in exactly the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 11069 len. 11]: ` Would you take a merry-thought , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11070 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 11071 len. 24]: I will take whatever you please , R. W. ' ` Well , but my dear , do you like it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11072 len. 46]: I like it as well as I like anything , R. W. ' The stately woman would then , with a meritorious appearance of devoting herself to the general good , pursue her dinner as if she were feeding somebody else on high public grounds .
Parsing [sent. 11073 len. 18]: Bella had brought dessert and two bottles of wine , thus shedding unprecedented splendour on the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 11074 len. 20]: Mrs Wilfer did the honours of the first glass by proclaiming : ` R. W. I drink to you .
Parsing [sent. 11075 len. 7]: ` Thank you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11076 len. 6]: And I to you . '
Parsing [sent. 11077 len. 6]: ` Pa and Ma ! '
Parsing [sent. 11078 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 11079 len. 13]: ` Permit me , ' Mrs Wilfer interposed , with outstretched glove .
Parsing [sent. 11080 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 11081 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 11082 len. 6]: I drank to your papa .
Parsing [sent. 11083 len. 19]: If , however , you insist on including me , I can in gratitude offer no objection . '
Parsing [sent. 11084 len. 29]: ` Why , Lor , Ma , ' interposed Lavvy the bold , ` is n't it the day that made you and Pa one and the same ?
Parsing [sent. 11085 len. 6]: I have no patience ! '
Parsing [sent. 11086 len. 33]: ` By whatever other circumstance the day may be marked , it is not the day , Lavinia , on which I will allow a child of mine to pounce upon me .
Parsing [sent. 11087 len. 7]: I beg -- nay , command !
Parsing [sent. 11088 len. 7]: -- that you will not pounce .
Parsing [sent. 11089 len. 21]: R. W. , it is appropriate to recall that it is for you to command and for me to obey .
Parsing [sent. 11090 len. 14]: It is your house , and you are master at your own table .
Parsing [sent. 11091 len. 5]: Both our healths ! '
Parsing [sent. 11092 len. 8]: Drinking the toast with tremendous stiffness . '
Parsing [sent. 11093 len. 25]: I really am a little afraid , my dear , ' hinted the cherub meekly , ` that you are not enjoying yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 11094 len. 14]: ` On the contrary , ' returned Mrs Wilfer , ` quite so .
Parsing [sent. 11095 len. 7]: Why should I not ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11096 len. 38]: I thought , my dear , that perhaps your face might -- ' ` My face might be a martyrdom , but what would that import , or who should know it , if I smiled ? '
Parsing [sent. 11097 len. 17]: And she did smile ; manifestly freezing the blood of Mr George Sampson by so doing .
Parsing [sent. 11098 len. 37]: For that young gentleman , catching her smiling eye , was so very much appalled by its expression as to cast about in his thoughts concerning what he had done to bring it down upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 11099 len. 27]: ` The mind naturally falls , ' said Mrs Wilfer , ` shall I say into a reverie , or shall I say into a retrospect ?
Parsing [sent. 11100 len. 7]: on a day like this . '
Parsing [sent. 11101 len. 37]: Lavvy , sitting with defiantly folded arms , replied -LRB- but not audibly -RRB- , ` For goodness ' sake say whichever of the two you like best , Ma , and get it over . '
Parsing [sent. 11102 len. 39]: ` The mind , ' pursued Mrs Wilfer in an oratorical manner , ` naturally reverts to Papa and Mamma -- I here allude to my parents -- at a period before the earliest dawn of this day .
Parsing [sent. 11103 len. 9]: I was considered tall ; perhaps I was .
Parsing [sent. 11104 len. 7]: Papa and Mamma were unquestionably tall .
Parsing [sent. 11105 len. 17]: I have rarely seen a finer women than my mother ; never than my father . '
Parsing [sent. 11106 len. 18]: The irrepressible Lavvy remarked aloud , ` Whatever grandpapa was , he was n't a female . '
Parsing [sent. 11107 len. 47]: ` Your grandpapa , ' retorted Mrs Wilfer , with an awful look , and in an awful tone , ` was what I describe him to have been , and would have struck any of his grandchildren to the earth who presumed to question it .
Parsing [sent. 11108 len. 20]: It was one of mamma 's cherished hopes that I should become united to a tall member of society .
Parsing [sent. 11109 len. 27]: It may have been a weakness , but if so , it was equally the weakness , I believe , of King Frederick of Prussia . '
Parsing [sent. 11110 len. 59]: These remarks being offered to Mr George Sampson , who had not the courage to come out for single combat , but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down , Mrs Wilfer proceeded , in a voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness , until she should force that skulker to give himself up .
Parsing [sent. 11111 len. 29]: ` Mamma would appear to have had an indefinable foreboding of what afterwards happened , for she would frequently urge upon me , `` Not a little man .
Parsing [sent. 11112 len. 11]: Promise me , my child , not a little man .
Parsing [sent. 11113 len. 12]: Never , never , never , marry a little man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11114 len. 27]: Papa also would remark to me -LRB- he possessed extraordinary humour -RRB- , `` that a family of whales must not ally themselves with sprats . ''
Parsing [sent. 11115 len. 26]: His company was eagerly sought , as may be supposed , by the wits of the day , and our house was their continual resort .
Parsing [sent. 11116 len. 23]: I have known as many as three copper-plate engravers exchanging the most exquisite sallies and retorts there , at one time . '
Parsing [sent. 11117 len. 35]: -LRB- Here Mr Sampson delivered himself captive , and said , with an uneasy movement on his chair , that three was a large number , and it must have been highly entertaining . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 11118 len. 21]: ` Among the most prominent members of that distinguished circle , was a gentleman measuring six feet four in height .
Parsing [sent. 11119 len. 7]: HE was NOT an engraver . '
Parsing [sent. 11120 len. 16]: -LRB- Here Mr Sampson said , with no reason whatever , Of course not . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 11121 len. 21]: ` This gentleman was so obliging as to honour me with attentions which I could not fail to understand . '
Parsing [sent. 11122 len. 19]: -LRB- Here Mr Sampson murmured that when it came to that , you could always tell . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 11123 len. 22]: I immediately announced to both my parents that those attentions were misplaced , and that I could not favour his suit .
Parsing [sent. 11124 len. 7]: They inquired was he too tall ?
Parsing [sent. 11125 len. 15]: I replied it was not the stature , but the intellect was too lofty .
Parsing [sent. 11126 len. 34]: At our house , I said , the tone was too brilliant , the pressure was too high , to be maintained by me , a mere woman , in every-day domestic life .
Parsing [sent. 11127 len. 22]: I well remember mamma 's clasping her hands , and exclaiming `` This will end in a little man ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 11128 len. 16]: -LRB- Here Mr Sampson glanced at his host and shook his head with despondency . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 11129 len. 39]: ` She afterwards went so far as to predict that it would end in a little man whose mind would be below the average , but that was in what I may denominate a paroxysm of maternal disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 11130 len. 35]: Within a month , ' said Mrs Wilfer , deepening her voice , as if she were relating a terrible ghost story , ` within a-month , I first saw R. W. my husband .
Parsing [sent. 11131 len. 8]: Within a year , I married him .
Parsing [sent. 11132 len. 17]: It is natural for the mind to recall these dark coincidences on the present day . '
Parsing [sent. 11133 len. 38]: Mr Sampson at length released from the custody of Mrs Wilfer 's eye , now drew a long breath , and made the original and striking remark that there was no accounting for these sort of presentiments .
Parsing [sent. 11134 len. 55]: R. W. scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his wife , when observing her as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than before , he once more hinted , ` My dear , I am really afraid you are not altogether enjoying yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 11135 len. 18]: To which she once more replied , ` On the contrary , R. W. Quite so . '
Parsing [sent. 11136 len. 14]: The wretched Mr Sampson 's position at this agreeable entertainment was truly pitiable .
Parsing [sent. 11137 len. 68]: For , not only was he exposed defenceless to the harangues of Mrs Wilfer , but he received the utmost contumely at the hands of Lavinia ; who , partly to show Bella that she -LRB- Lavinia -RRB- could do what she liked with him , and partly to pay him off for still obviously admiring Bella 's beauty , led him the life of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 11138 len. 50]: Illuminated on the one hand by the stately graces of Mrs Wilfer 's oratory , and shadowed on the other by the checks and frowns of the young lady to whom he had devoted himself in his destitution , the sufferings of this young gentleman were distressing to witness .
Parsing [sent. 11139 len. 37]: If his mind for the moment reeled under them , it may be urged , in extenuation of its weakness , that it was constitutionally a knock-knee 'd mind and never very strong upon its legs .
Parsing [sent. 11140 len. 19]: The rosy hours were thus beguiled until it was time for Bella to have Pa 's escort back .
Parsing [sent. 11141 len. 34]: The dimples duly tied up in the bonnetstrings and the leave-taking done , they got out into the air , and the cherub drew a long breath as if he found it refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 11142 len. 19]: ` Well , dear Pa , ' said Bella , ` the anniversary may be considered over . '
Parsing [sent. 11143 len. 20]: ` Yes , my dear , ' returned the cherub , ` there 's another of 'em gone . '
Parsing [sent. 11144 len. 21]: Bella drew his arm closer through hers as they walked along , and gave it a number of consolatory pats .
Parsing [sent. 11145 len. 26]: ` Thank you , my dear , ' he said , as if she had spoken ; ' I am all right , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11146 len. 13]: Well , and how do you get on , Bella ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11147 len. 17]: I am not at all improved , Pa. ' ` Ai n't you really though ? '
Parsing [sent. 11148 len. 5]: ` No , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 11149 len. 9]: On the contrary , I am worse . '
Parsing [sent. 11150 len. 4]: ` Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 11151 len. 5]: said the cherub . '
Parsing [sent. 11152 len. 6]: I am worse , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 11153 len. 39]: I make so many calculations how much a year I must have when I marry , and what is the least I can manage to do with , that I am beginning to get wrinkles over my nose .
Parsing [sent. 11154 len. 14]: Did you notice any wrinkles over my nose this evening , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 11155 len. 13]: Pa laughing at this , Bella gave him two or three shakes .
Parsing [sent. 11156 len. 17]: ` You wo n't laugh , sir , when you see your lovely woman turning haggard .
Parsing [sent. 11157 len. 13]: You had better be prepared in time , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 11158 len. 39]: I shall not be able to keep my greediness for money out of my eyes long , and when you see it there you 'll be sorry , and serve you right for not being warned in time .
Parsing [sent. 11159 len. 12]: Now , sir , we entered into a bond of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11160 len. 8]: Have you anything to impart ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11161 len. 14]: I thought it was you who was to impart , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 11162 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11163 len. 6]: did you indeed , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 11164 len. 14]: Then why did n't you ask me , the moment we came out ?
Parsing [sent. 11165 len. 11]: The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted .
Parsing [sent. 11166 len. 49]: However , I forgive you this once , and look here , Pa ; that 's ' -- Bella laid the little forefinger of her right glove on her lip , and then laid it on her father 's lip -- ` that 's a kiss for you .
Parsing [sent. 11167 len. 19]: And now I am going seriously to tell you -- let me see how many -- four secrets .
Parsing [sent. 11168 len. 2]: Mind !
Parsing [sent. 11169 len. 7]: Serious , grave , weighty secrets .
Parsing [sent. 11170 len. 5]: Strictly between ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 11171 len. 8]: ` Number one , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11172 len. 11]: said her father , settling her arm comfortably and confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 11173 len. 15]: ` Number one , ' said Bella , ` will electrify you , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 11174 len. 28]: Who do you think has ' -- she was confused here in spite of her merry way of beginning ` has made an offer to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11175 len. 26]: Pa looked in her face , and looked at the ground , and looked in her face again , and declared he could never guess .
Parsing [sent. 11176 len. 5]: ` Mr Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 11177 len. 12]: ` You do n't tell me so , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 11178 len. 19]: ` Mis -- ter Roke -- smith , Pa , ' said Bella separating the syllables for emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 11179 len. 9]: ` What do you say to THAT ? '
Parsing [sent. 11180 len. 20]: Pa answered quietly with the counter-question , ` What did YOU say to that , my love ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11181 len. 9]: I said No , ' returned Bella sharply .
Parsing [sent. 11182 len. 5]: ` Of course . '
Parsing [sent. 11183 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 11184 len. 10]: Of course , ' said her father , meditating .
Parsing [sent. 11185 len. 27]: ` And I told him why I thought it a betrayal of trust on his part , and an affront to me , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 11186 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 11187 len. 4]: To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 11188 len. 5]: I am astonished indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11189 len. 13]: I wonder he committed himself without seeing more of his way first .
Parsing [sent. 11190 len. 20]: Now I think of it , I suspect he always has admired you though , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11191 len. 20]: A hackney coachman may admire me , ' remarked Bella , with a touch of her mother 's loftiness .
Parsing [sent. 11192 len. 9]: ` It 's highly probable , my love .
Parsing [sent. 11193 len. 7]: Number two , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11194 len. 18]: ` Number two , Pa , is much to the same purpose , though not so preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 11195 len. 14]: Mr Lightwood would propose to me , if I would let him . '
Parsing [sent. 11196 len. 18]: ` Then I understand , my dear , that you do n't intend to let him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11197 len. 17]: Bella again saying , with her former emphasis , ` Why , of course not ! '
Parsing [sent. 11198 len. 15]: her father felt himself bound to echo , ` Of course not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11199 len. 11]: I do n't care for him , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 11200 len. 10]: ` That 's enough , ' her father interposed .
Parsing [sent. 11201 len. 21]: ` No , Pa , it 's NOT enough , ' rejoined Bella , giving him another shake or two .
Parsing [sent. 11202 len. 14]: ` Have n't I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am ?
Parsing [sent. 11203 len. 25]: It only becomes enough when he has no money , and no clients , and no expectations , and no anything but debts . '
Parsing [sent. 11204 len. 4]: ` Hah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11205 len. 8]: said the cherub , a little depressed .
Parsing [sent. 11206 len. 8]: ` Number three , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11207 len. 11]: ` Number three , Pa , is a better thing .
Parsing [sent. 11208 len. 12]: A generous thing , a noble thing , a delightful thing .
Parsing [sent. 11209 len. 57]: Mrs Boffin has herself told me , as a secret , with her own kind lips -- and truer lips never opened or closed in this life , I am sure -- that they wish to see me well married ; and that when I marry with their consent they will portion me most handsomely . '
Parsing [sent. 11210 len. 10]: Here the grateful girl burst out crying very heartily .
Parsing [sent. 11211 len. 68]: ` Do n't cry , my darling , ' said her father , with his hand to his eyes ; ` it 's excusable in me to be a little overcome when I find that my dear favourite child is , after all disappointments , to be so provided for and so raised in the world ; but do n't YOU cry , do n't YOU cry .
Parsing [sent. 11212 len. 5]: I am very thankful .
Parsing [sent. 11213 len. 12]: I congratulate you with all my heart , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 11214 len. 85]: The good soft little fellow , drying his eyes , here , Bella put her arms round his neck and tenderly kissed him on the high road , passionately telling him he was the best of fathers and the best of friends , and that on her wedding-morning she would go down on her knees to him and beg his pardon for having ever teased him or seemed insensible to the worth of such a patient , sympathetic , genial , fresh young heart .
Parsing [sent. 11215 len. 33]: At every one of her adjectives she redoubled her kisses , and finally kissed his hat off , and then laughed immoderately when the wind took it and he ran after it .
Parsing [sent. 11216 len. 32]: When he had recovered his hat and his breath , and they were going on again once more , said her father then : ` Number four , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11217 len. 11]: Bella 's countenance fell in the midst of her mirth .
Parsing [sent. 11218 len. 15]: ` After all , perhaps I had better put off number four , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 11219 len. 25]: Let me try once more , if for never so short a time , to hope that it may not really be so . '
Parsing [sent. 11220 len. 28]: The change in her , strengthened the cherub 's interest in number four , and he said quietly : ` May not be so , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 11221 len. 9]: May not be how , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11222 len. 11]: Bella looked at him pensively , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 11223 len. 13]: ` And yet I know right well it is so , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 11224 len. 8]: I know it only too well . '
Parsing [sent. 11225 len. 16]: ` My love , ' returned her father , ` you make me quite uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 11226 len. 12]: Have you said No to anybody else , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11227 len. 11]: ` No , Pa. ' ` Yes to anybody ? '
Parsing [sent. 11228 len. 8]: he suggested , lifting up his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 11229 len. 30]: ` No , Pa. ' ` Is there anybody else who would take his chance between Yes and No , if you would let him , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11230 len. 28]: ` Not that I know of , Pa. ' ` There ca n't be somebody who wo n't take his chance when you want him to ? '
Parsing [sent. 11231 len. 9]: said the cherub , as a last resource .
Parsing [sent. 11232 len. 19]: ` Why , of course not , Pa , said Bella , giving him another shake or two .
Parsing [sent. 11233 len. 11]: ` No , of course not , ' he assented .
Parsing [sent. 11234 len. 26]: ` Bella , my dear , I am afraid I must either have no sleep to-night , or I must press for number four . '
Parsing [sent. 11235 len. 13]: ` Oh , Pa , there is no good in number four !
Parsing [sent. 11236 len. 37]: I am so sorry for it , I am so unwilling to believe it , I have tried so earnestly not to see it , that it is very hard to tell , even to you .
Parsing [sent. 11237 len. 16]: But Mr Boffin is being spoilt by prosperity , and is changing every day . '
Parsing [sent. 11238 len. 13]: ` My dear Bella , I hope and trust not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11239 len. 24]: I have hoped and trusted not too , Pa ; but every day he changes for the worse , and for the worse .
Parsing [sent. 11240 len. 19]: Not to me -- he is always much the same to me -- but to others about him .
Parsing [sent. 11241 len. 15]: Before my eyes he grows suspicious , capricious , hard , tyrannical , unjust .
Parsing [sent. 11242 len. 16]: If ever a good man were ruined by good fortune , it is my benefactor .
Parsing [sent. 11243 len. 14]: And yet , Pa , think how terrible the fascination of money is !
Parsing [sent. 11244 len. 28]: I see this , and hate this , and dread this , and do n't know but that money might make a much worse change in me .
Parsing [sent. 11245 len. 37]: And yet I have money always in my thoughts and my desires ; and the whole life I place before myself is money , money , money , and what money can make of life ! '
Parsing [sent. 11246 len. 37]: Chapter 5 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO BAD COMPANY Were Bella Wilfer 's bright and ready little wits at fault , or was the Golden Dustman passing through the furnace of proof and coming out dross ?
Parsing [sent. 11247 len. 5]: Ill news travels fast .
Parsing [sent. 11248 len. 6]: We shall know full soon .
Parsing [sent. 11249 len. 24]: On that very night of her return from the Happy Return , something chanced which Bella closely followed with her eyes and ears .
Parsing [sent. 11250 len. 19]: There was an apartment at the side of the Boffin mansion , known as Mr Boffin 's room .
Parsing [sent. 11251 len. 54]: Far less grand than the rest of the house , it was far more comfortable , being pervaded by a certain air of homely snugness , which upholstering despotism had banished to that spot when it inexorably set its face against Mr Boffin 's appeals for mercy in behalf of any other chamber .
Parsing [sent. 11252 len. 83]: Thus , although a room of modest situation -- for its windows gave on Silas Wegg 's old corner -- and of no pretensions to velvet , satin , or gilding , it had got itself established in a domestic position analogous to that of an easy dressing-gown or pair of slippers ; and whenever the family wanted to enjoy a particularly pleasant fireside evening , they enjoyed it , as an institution that must be , in Mr Boffin 's room .
Parsing [sent. 11253 len. 16]: Mr and Mrs Boffin were reported sitting in this room , when Bella got back .
Parsing [sent. 11254 len. 49]: Entering it , she found the Secretary there too ; in official attendance it would appear , for he was standing with some papers in his hand by a table with shaded candles on it , at which Mr Boffin was seated thrown back in his easy chair .
Parsing [sent. 11255 len. 16]: ` You are busy , sir , ' said Bella , hesitating at the door .
Parsing [sent. 11256 len. 12]: ` Not at all , my dear , not at all .
Parsing [sent. 11257 len. 6]: You 're one of ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 11258 len. 7]: We never make company of you .
Parsing [sent. 11259 len. 6]: Come in , come in .
Parsing [sent. 11260 len. 11]: Here 's the old lady in her usual place . '
Parsing [sent. 11261 len. 33]: Mrs Boffin adding her nod and smile of welcome to Mr Boffin 's words , Bella took her book to a chair in the fireside corner , by Mrs Boffin 's work-table .
Parsing [sent. 11262 len. 10]: Mr Boffin 's station was on the opposite side .
Parsing [sent. 11263 len. 39]: ` Now , Rokesmith , ' said the Golden Dustman , so sharply rapping the table to bespeak his attention as Bella turned the leaves of her book , that she started ; ` where were we ? '
Parsing [sent. 11264 len. 42]: ` You were saying , sir , ' returned the Secretary , with an air of some reluctance and a glance towards those others who were present , ` that you considered the time had come for fixing my salary . '
Parsing [sent. 11265 len. 18]: ` Do n't be above calling it wages , man , ' said Mr Boffin , testily .
Parsing [sent. 11266 len. 5]: ` What the deuce !
Parsing [sent. 11267 len. 13]: I never talked of any salary when I was in service . '
Parsing [sent. 11268 len. 12]: ` My wages , ' said the Secretary , correcting himself .
Parsing [sent. 11269 len. 12]: ` Rokesmith , you are not proud , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 11270 len. 9]: observed Mr Boffin , eyeing him askance . '
Parsing [sent. 11271 len. 7]: I hope not , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11272 len. 16]: ` Because I never was , when I was poor , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11273 len. 12]: ` Poverty and pride do n't go at all well together .
Parsing [sent. 11274 len. 3]: Mind that .
Parsing [sent. 11275 len. 7]: How can they go well together ?
Parsing [sent. 11276 len. 6]: Why it stands to reason .
Parsing [sent. 11277 len. 13]: A man , being poor , has nothing to be proud of .
Parsing [sent. 11278 len. 5]: It 's nonsense . '
Parsing [sent. 11279 len. 34]: With a slight inclination of his head , and a look of some surprise , the Secretary seemed to assent by forming the syllables of the word ` nonsense ' on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 11280 len. 13]: ` Now , concerning these same wages , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11281 len. 5]: ` Sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 11282 len. 5]: The Secretary sat down .
Parsing [sent. 11283 len. 10]: ` Why did n't you sit down before ? '
Parsing [sent. 11284 len. 7]: asked Mr Boffin , distrustfully . '
Parsing [sent. 11285 len. 7]: I hope that was n't pride ?
Parsing [sent. 11286 len. 5]: But about these wages .
Parsing [sent. 11287 len. 17]: Now , I 've gone into the matter , and I say two hundred a year .
Parsing [sent. 11288 len. 7]: What do you think of it ?
Parsing [sent. 11289 len. 8]: Do you think it 's enough ? '
Parsing [sent. 11290 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 11291 len. 8]: It is a fair proposal . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11292 len. 23]: I do n't say , you know , ' Mr Boffin stipulated , ` but what it may be more than enough .
Parsing [sent. 11293 len. 9]: And I 'll tell you why , Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 11294 len. 15]: A man of property , like me , is bound to consider the market-price .
Parsing [sent. 11295 len. 39]: At first I did n't enter into that as much as I might have done ; but I 've got acquainted with other men of property since , and I 've got acquainted with the duties of property .
Parsing [sent. 11296 len. 21]: I must n't go putting the market-price up , because money may happen not to be an object with me .
Parsing [sent. 11297 len. 20]: A sheep is worth so much in the market , and I ought to give it and no more .
Parsing [sent. 11298 len. 20]: A secretary is worth so much in the market , and I ought to give it and no more .
Parsing [sent. 11299 len. 13]: However , I do n't mind stretching a point with you . '
Parsing [sent. 11300 len. 18]: ` Mr Boffin , you are very good , ' replied the Secretary , with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 11301 len. 19]: ` Then we put the figure , ' said Mr Boffin , ` at two hundred a year .
Parsing [sent. 11302 len. 7]: Then the figure 's disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 11303 len. 17]: Now , there must be no misunderstanding regarding what I buy for two hundred a year .
Parsing [sent. 11304 len. 14]: If I pay for a sheep , I buy it out and out .
Parsing [sent. 11305 len. 17]: Similarly , if I pay for a secretary , I buy HIM out and out . '
Parsing [sent. 11306 len. 12]: ` In other words , you purchase my whole time ? '
Parsing [sent. 11307 len. 5]: ` Certainly I do .
Parsing [sent. 11308 len. 55]: Look here , ' said Mr Boffin , ` it ai n't that I want to occupy your whole time ; you can take up a book for a minute or two when you 've nothing better to do , though I think you 'll a ` most always find something useful to do .
Parsing [sent. 11309 len. 9]: But I want to keep you in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 11310 len. 14]: It 's convenient to have you at all times ready on the premises .
Parsing [sent. 11311 len. 20]: Therefore , betwixt your breakfast and your supper , -- on the premises I expect to find you . '
Parsing [sent. 11312 len. 4]: The Secretary bowed .
Parsing [sent. 11313 len. 45]: ` In bygone days , when I was in service myself , ' said Mr Boffin , ' I could n't go cutting about at my will and pleasure , and you wo n't expect to go cutting about at your will and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 11314 len. 25]: You 've rather got into a habit of that , lately ; but perhaps it was for want of a right specification betwixt us .
Parsing [sent. 11315 len. 17]: Now , let there be a right specification betwixt us , and let it be this .
Parsing [sent. 11316 len. 10]: If you want leave , ask for it . '
Parsing [sent. 11317 len. 5]: Again the Secretary bowed .
Parsing [sent. 11318 len. 14]: His manner was uneasy and astonished , and showed a sense of humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 11319 len. 31]: ` I 'll have a bell , ' said Mr Boffin , ` hung from this room to yours , and when I want you , I 'll touch it .
Parsing [sent. 11320 len. 19]: I do n't call to mind that I have anything more to say at the present moment . '
Parsing [sent. 11321 len. 12]: The Secretary rose , gathered up his papers , and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 11322 len. 28]: Bella 's eyes followed him to the door , lighted on Mr Boffin complacently thrown back in his easy chair , and drooped over her book . '
Parsing [sent. 11323 len. 31]: I have let that chap , that young man of mine , ' said Mr Boffin , taking a trot up and down the room , get above his work .
Parsing [sent. 11324 len. 5]: It wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 11325 len. 8]: I must have him down a peg .
Parsing [sent. 11326 len. 22]: A man of property owes a duty to other men of property , and must look sharp after his inferiors . '
Parsing [sent. 11327 len. 41]: Bella felt that Mrs Boffin was not comfortable , and that the eyes of that good creature sought to discover from her face what attention she had given to this discourse , and what impression it had made upon her .
Parsing [sent. 11328 len. 27]: For which reason Bella 's eyes drooped more engrossedly over her book , and she turned the page with an air of profound absorption in it .
Parsing [sent. 11329 len. 15]: ` Noddy , ' said Mrs Boffin , after thoughtfully pausing in her work .
Parsing [sent. 11330 len. 16]: ` My dear , ' returned the Golden Dustman , stopping short in his trot .
Parsing [sent. 11331 len. 14]: ` Excuse my putting it to you , Noddy , but now really !
Parsing [sent. 11332 len. 12]: Have n't you been a little strict with Mr Rokesmith to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 11333 len. 20]: Have n't you been a little -- just a little little -- not quite like your old self ? '
Parsing [sent. 11334 len. 21]: ` Why , old woman , I hope so , ' returned Mr Boffin , cheerfully , if not boastfully .
Parsing [sent. 11335 len. 7]: ` Hope so , deary ? '
Parsing [sent. 11336 len. 12]: ` Our old selves would n't do here , old lady .
Parsing [sent. 11337 len. 8]: Have n't you found that out yet ?
Parsing [sent. 11338 len. 17]: Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and imposed upon .
Parsing [sent. 11339 len. 21]: Our old selves were n't people of fortune ; our new selves are ; it 's a great difference . '
Parsing [sent. 11340 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11341 len. 24]: said Mrs Boffin , pausing in her work again , softly to draw a long breath and to look at the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 11342 len. 5]: A great difference . '
Parsing [sent. 11343 len. 31]: ` And we must be up to the difference , ' pursued her husband ; ` we must be equal to the change ; that 's what we must be .
Parsing [sent. 11344 len. 46]: We 've got to hold our own now , against everybody -LRB- for everybody 's hand is stretched out to be dipped into our pockets -RRB- , and we have got to recollect that money makes money , as well as makes everything else . '
Parsing [sent. 11345 len. 99]: ` Mentioning recollecting , ' said Mrs Boffin , with her work abandoned , her eyes upon the fire , and her chin upon her hand , ` do you recollect , Noddy , how you said to Mr Rokesmith when he first came to see us at the Bower , and you engaged him -- how you said to him that if it had pleased Heaven to send John Harmon to his fortune safe , we could have been content with the one Mound which was our legacy , and should never have wanted the rest ? '
Parsing [sent. 11346 len. 9]: ` Ay , I remember , old lady .
Parsing [sent. 11347 len. 14]: But we had n't tried what it was to have the rest then .
Parsing [sent. 11348 len. 15]: Our new shoes had come home , but we had n't put 'em on .
Parsing [sent. 11349 len. 18]: We 're wearing 'em now , we 're wearing 'em , and must step out accordingly . '
Parsing [sent. 11350 len. 15]: Mrs Boffin took up her work again , and plied her needle in silence .
Parsing [sent. 11351 len. 47]: ` As to Rokesmith , that young man of mine , ' said Mr Boffin , dropping his voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there , ` it 's the same with him as with the footmen .
Parsing [sent. 11352 len. 17]: I have found out that you must either scrunch them , or let them scrunch you .
Parsing [sent. 11353 len. 39]: If you ai n't imperious with 'em , they wo n't believe in your being any better than themselves , if as good , after the stories -LRB- lies mostly -RRB- that they have heard of your beginnings .
Parsing [sent. 11354 len. 23]: There 's nothing betwixt stiffening yourself up , and throwing yourself away ; take my word for that , old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 11355 len. 34]: Bella ventured for a moment to look stealthily towards him under her eyelashes , and she saw a dark cloud of suspicion , covetousness , and conceit , overshadowing the once open face .
Parsing [sent. 11356 len. 18]: ` Hows ` ever , ' said he , ` this is n't entertaining to Miss Bella .
Parsing [sent. 11357 len. 6]: Is it , Bella ? '
Parsing [sent. 11358 len. 35]: A deceiving Bella she was , to look at him with that pensively abstracted air , as if her mind were full of her book , and she had not heard a single word !
Parsing [sent. 11359 len. 3]: ` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 11360 len. 13]: Better employed than to attend to it , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11361 len. 9]: ` That 's right , that 's right .
Parsing [sent. 11362 len. 18]: Especially as you have no call to be told how to value yourself , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 11363 len. 23]: Colouring a little under this compliment , Bella returned , ' I hope sir , you do n't think me vain ? '
Parsing [sent. 11364 len. 13]: ` Not a bit , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11365 len. 36]: ` But I think it 's very creditable in you , at your age , to be so well up with the pace of the world , and to know what to go in for .
Parsing [sent. 11366 len. 4]: You are right .
Parsing [sent. 11367 len. 8]: Go in for money , my love .
Parsing [sent. 11368 len. 5]: Money 's the article .
Parsing [sent. 11369 len. 34]: You 'll make money of your good looks , and of the money Mrs Boffin and me will have the pleasure of settling upon you , and you 'll live and die rich .
Parsing [sent. 11370 len. 11]: That 's the state to live and die in ! '
Parsing [sent. 11371 len. 9]: said Mr Boffin , in an unctuous manner .
Parsing [sent. 11372 len. 7]: R -- r -- rich ! '
Parsing [sent. 11373 len. 42]: There was an expression of distress in Mrs Boffin 's face , as , after watching her husband 's , she turned to their adopted girl , and said : ` Do n't mind him , Bella , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 11374 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 11375 len. 4]: cried Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11376 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 11377 len. 6]: Not mind him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11378 len. 43]: I do n't mean that , ' said Mrs Boffin , with a worried look , ` but I mean , do n't believe him to be anything but good and generous , Bella , because he is the best of men .
Parsing [sent. 11379 len. 10]: No , I must say that much , Noddy .
Parsing [sent. 11380 len. 9]: You are always the best of men . '
Parsing [sent. 11381 len. 21]: She made the declaration as if he were objecting to it : which assuredly he was not in any way .
Parsing [sent. 11382 len. 56]: ` And as to you , my dear Bella , ' said Mrs Boffin , still with that distressed expression , ` he is so much attached to you , whatever he says , that your own father has not a truer interest in you and can hardly like you better than he does . '
Parsing [sent. 11383 len. 5]: ` Says too ! '
Parsing [sent. 11384 len. 4]: cried Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11385 len. 5]: ` Whatever he says !
Parsing [sent. 11386 len. 8]: Why , I say so , openly .
Parsing [sent. 11387 len. 25]: Give me a kiss , my dear child , in saying Good Night , and let me confirm what my old lady tells you .
Parsing [sent. 11388 len. 31]: I am very fond of you , my dear , and I am entirely of your mind , and you and I will take care that you shall be rich .
Parsing [sent. 11389 len. 39]: These good looks of yours -LRB- which you have some right to be vain of ; my dear , though you are not , you know -RRB- are worth money , and you shall make money of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 11390 len. 20]: The money you will have , will be worth money , and you shall make money of that too .
Parsing [sent. 11391 len. 9]: There 's a golden ball at your feet .
Parsing [sent. 11392 len. 7]: Good night , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 11393 len. 20]: Somehow , Bella was not so well pleased with this assurance and this prospect as she might have been .
Parsing [sent. 11394 len. 41]: Somehow , when she put her arms round Mrs Boffin 's neck and said Good Night , she derived a sense of unworthiness from the still anxious face of that good woman and her obvious wish to excuse her husband .
Parsing [sent. 11395 len. 10]: ` Why , what need to excuse him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11396 len. 10]: thought Bella , sitting down in her own room .
Parsing [sent. 11397 len. 20]: ` What he said was very sensible , I am sure , and very true , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 11398 len. 10]: It is only what I often say to myself .
Parsing [sent. 11399 len. 7]: Do n't I like it then ?
Parsing [sent. 11400 len. 23]: No , I do n't like it , and , though he is my liberal benefactor , I disparage him for it .
Parsing [sent. 11401 len. 33]: Then pray , ' said Bella , sternly putting the question to herself in the looking-glass as usual , ` what do you mean by this , you inconsistent little Beast ? '
Parsing [sent. 11402 len. 35]: The looking-glass preserving a discreet ministerial silence when thus called upon for explanation , Bella went to bed with a weariness upon her spirit which was more than the weariness of want of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 11403 len. 27]: And again in the morning , she looked for the cloud , and for the deepening of the cloud , upon the Golden Dustman 's face .
Parsing [sent. 11404 len. 39]: She had begun by this time to be his frequent companion in his morning strolls about the streets , and it was at this time that he made her a party to his engaging in a curious pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 11405 len. 24]: Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life , he had a child 's delight in looking at shops .
Parsing [sent. 11406 len. 23]: It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom , and was equally the delight of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 11407 len. 54]: For many years their only walks in London had been taken on Sundays when the shops were shut ; and when every day in the week became their holiday , they derived an enjoyment from the variety and fancy and beauty of the display in the windows , which seemed incapable of exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 11408 len. 51]: As if the principal streets were a great Theatre and the play were childishly new to them , Mr and Mrs Boffin , from the beginning of Bella 's intimacy in their house , had been constantly in the front row , charmed with all they saw and applauding vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 11409 len. 35]: But now , Mr Boffin 's interest began to centre in book-shops ; and more than that -- for that of itself would not have been much -- in one exceptional kind of book .
Parsing [sent. 11410 len. 42]: ` Look in here , my dear , ' Mr Boffin would say , checking Bella 's arm at a bookseller 's window ; ` you can read at sight , and your eyes are as sharp as they 're bright .
Parsing [sent. 11411 len. 23]: Now , look well about you , my dear , and tell me if you see any book about a Miser . '
Parsing [sent. 11412 len. 17]: If Bella saw such a book , Mr Boffin would instantly dart in and buy it .
Parsing [sent. 11413 len. 61]: And still , as if they had not found it , they would seek out another book-shop , and Mr Boffin would say , ` Now , look well all round , my dear , for a Life of a Miser , or any book of that sort ; any Lives of odd characters who may have been Misers . '
Parsing [sent. 11414 len. 22]: Bella , thus directed , would examine the window with the greatest attention , while Mr Boffin would examine her face .
Parsing [sent. 11415 len. 49]: The moment she pointed out any book as being entitled Lives of eccentric personages , Anecdotes of strange characters , Records of remarkable individuals , or anything to that purpose , Mr Boffin 's countenance would light up , and he would instantly dart in and buy it .
Parsing [sent. 11416 len. 11]: Size , price , quality , were of no account .
Parsing [sent. 11417 len. 24]: Any book that seemed to promise a chance of miserly biography , Mr Boffin purchased without a moment 's delay and carried home .
Parsing [sent. 11418 len. 53]: Happening to be informed by a bookseller that a portion of the Annual Register was devoted to ` Characters ' , Mr Boffin at once bought a whole set of that ingenious compilation , and began to carry it home piecemeal , confiding a volume to Bella , and bearing three himself .
Parsing [sent. 11419 len. 11]: The completion of this labour occupied them about a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 11420 len. 25]: When the task was done , Mr Boffin , with his appetite for Misers whetted instead of satiated , began to look out again .
Parsing [sent. 11421 len. 34]: It very soon became unnecessary to tell Bella what to look for , and an understanding was established between her and Mr Boffin that she was always to look for Lives of Misers .
Parsing [sent. 11422 len. 15]: Morning after morning they roamed about the town together , pursuing this singular research .
Parsing [sent. 11423 len. 42]: Miserly literature not being abundant , the proportion of failures to successes may have been as a hundred to one ; still Mr Boffin , never wearied , remained as avaricious for misers as he had been at the first onset .
Parsing [sent. 11424 len. 29]: It was curious that Bella never saw the books about the house , nor did she ever hear from Mr Boffin one word of reference to their contents .
Parsing [sent. 11425 len. 15]: He seemed to save up his Misers as they had saved up their money .
Parsing [sent. 11426 len. 34]: As they had been greedy for it , and secret about it , and had hidden it , so he was greedy for them , and secret about them , and hid them .
Parsing [sent. 11427 len. 53]: But beyond all doubt it was to be noticed , and was by Bella very clearly noticed , that , as he pursued the acquisition of those dismal records with the ardour of Don Quixote for his books of chivalry , he began to spend his money with a more sparing hand .
Parsing [sent. 11428 len. 41]: And often when he came out of a shop with some new account of one of those wretched lunatics , she would almost shrink from the sly dry chuckle with which he would take her arm again and trot away .
Parsing [sent. 11429 len. 12]: It did not appear that Mrs Boffin knew of this taste .
Parsing [sent. 11430 len. 55]: He made no allusion to it , except in the morning walks when he and Bella were always alone ; and Bella , partly under the impression that he took her into his confidence by implication , and partly in remembrance of Mrs Boffin 's anxious face that night , held the same reserve .
Parsing [sent. 11431 len. 21]: While these occurrences were in progress , Mrs Lammle made the discovery that Bella had a fascinating influence over her .
Parsing [sent. 11432 len. 39]: The Lammles , originally presented by the dear Veneerings , visited the Boffins on all grand occasions , and Mrs Lammle had not previously found this out ; but now the knowledge came upon her all at once .
Parsing [sent. 11433 len. 78]: It was a most extraordinary thing -LRB- she said to Mrs Boffin -RRB- ; she was foolishly susceptible of the power of beauty , but it was n't altogether that ; she never had been able to resist a natural grace of manner , but it was n't altogether that ; it was more than that , and there was no name for the indescribable extent and degree to which she was captivated by this charming girl .
Parsing [sent. 11434 len. 44]: This charming girl having the words repeated to her by Mrs Boffin -LRB- who was proud of her being admired , and would have done anything to give her pleasure -RRB- , naturally recognized in Mrs Lammle a woman of penetration and taste .
Parsing [sent. 11435 len. 51]: Responding to the sentiments , by being very gracious to Mrs Lammle , she gave that lady the means of so improving her opportunity , as that the captivation became reciprocal , though always wearing an appearance of greater sobriety on Bella 's part than on the enthusiastic Sophronia 's .
Parsing [sent. 11436 len. 58]: Howbeit , they were so much together that , for a time , the Boffin chariot held Mrs Lammle oftener than Mrs Boffin : a preference of which the latter worthy soul was not in the least jealous , placidly remarking , ` Mrs Lammle is a younger companion for her than I am , and Lor !
Parsing [sent. 11437 len. 6]: she 's more fashionable . '
Parsing [sent. 11438 len. 29]: But between Bella Wilfer and Georgiana Podsnap there was this one difference , among many others , that Bella was in no danger of being captivated by Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 11439 len. 6]: She distrusted and disliked him .
Parsing [sent. 11440 len. 48]: Indeed , her perception was so quick , and her observation so sharp , that after all she mistrusted his wife too , though with her giddy vanity and wilfulness she squeezed the mistrust away into a corner of her mind , and blocked it up there .
Parsing [sent. 11441 len. 14]: Mrs Lammle took the friendliest interest in Bella 's making a good match .
Parsing [sent. 11442 len. 39]: Mrs Lammle said , in a sportive way , she really must show her beautiful Bella what kind of wealthy creatures she and Alfred had on hand , who would as one man fall at her feet enslaved .
Parsing [sent. 11443 len. 55]: Fitting occasion made , Mrs Lammle accordingly produced the most passable of those feverish , boastful , and indefinably loose gentlemen who were always lounging in and out of the City on questions of the Bourse and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three-quarters and seven-eighths .
Parsing [sent. 11444 len. 29]: Who in their agreeable manner did homage to Bella as if she were a compound of fine girl , thorough-bred horse , well-built drag , and remarkable pipe .
Parsing [sent. 11445 len. 19]: But without the least effect , though even Mr Fledgeby 's attractions were cast into the scale . '
Parsing [sent. 11446 len. 28]: I fear , Bella dear , ' said Mrs Lammle one day in the chariot , ` that you will be very hard to please . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11447 len. 22]: I do n't expect to be pleased , dear , ' said Bella , with a languid turn of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11448 len. 37]: ` Truly , my love , ' returned Sophronia , shaking her head , and smiling her best smile , ` it would not be very easy to find a man worthy of your attractions . '
Parsing [sent. 11449 len. 23]: ` The question is not a man , my dear , ' said Bella , coolly , ` but an establishment . '
Parsing [sent. 11450 len. 23]: ` My love , ' returned Mrs Lammle , ` your prudence amazes me -- where DID you study life so well !
Parsing [sent. 11451 len. 5]: -- you are right .
Parsing [sent. 11452 len. 14]: In such a case as yours , the object is a fitting establishment .
Parsing [sent. 11453 len. 41]: You could not descend to an inadequate one from Mr Boffin 's house , and even if your beauty alone could not command it , it is to be assumed that Mr and Mrs Boffin will -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11454 len. 8]: they have already , ' Bella interposed .
Parsing [sent. 11455 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 11456 len. 5]: Have they really ? '
Parsing [sent. 11457 len. 28]: A little vexed by a suspicion that she had spoken precipitately , and withal a little defiant of her own vexation , Bella determined not to retreat .
Parsing [sent. 11458 len. 30]: ` That is to say , ' she explained , ` they have told me they mean to portion me as their adopted child , if you mean that .
Parsing [sent. 11459 len. 7]: But do n't mention it . '
Parsing [sent. 11460 len. 5]: ` Mention it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11461 len. 20]: replied Mrs Lammle , as if she were full of awakened feeling at the suggestion of such an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 11462 len. 6]: ` Men-tion it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11463 len. 15]: I do n't mind telling you , Mrs Lammle -- ' Bella began again .
Parsing [sent. 11464 len. 15]: ` My love , say Sophronia , or I must not say Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 11465 len. 10]: With a little short , petulant ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 11466 len. 3]: Bella complied .
Parsing [sent. 11467 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11468 len. 39]: -- Sophronia then -- I do n't mind telling you , Sophronia , that I am convinced I have no heart , as people call it ; and that I think that sort of thing is nonsense . '
Parsing [sent. 11469 len. 5]: ` Brave girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 11470 len. 4]: murmured Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 11471 len. 29]: ` And so , ' pursued Bella , ` as to seeking to please myself , I do n't ; except in the one respect I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 11472 len. 6]: I am indifferent otherwise . '
Parsing [sent. 11473 len. 39]: ` But you ca n't help pleasing , Bella , ' said Mrs Lammle , rallying her with an arch look and her best smile , ` you ca n't help making a proud and an admiring husband .
Parsing [sent. 11474 len. 64]: You may not care to please yourself , and you may not care to please him , but you are not a free agent as to pleasing : you are forced to do that , in spite of yourself , my dear ; so it may be a question whether you may not as well please yourself too , if you can . '
Parsing [sent. 11475 len. 22]: Now , the very grossness of this flattery put Bella upon proving that she actually did please in spite of herself .
Parsing [sent. 11476 len. 44]: She had a misgiving that she was doing wrong -- though she had an indistinct foreshadowing that some harm might come of it thereafter , she little thought what consequences it would really bring about -- but she went on with her confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11477 len. 20]: ` Do n't talk of pleasing in spite of one 's self , dear , ' said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 11478 len. 8]: I have had enough of that . '
Parsing [sent. 11479 len. 4]: ` Ay ? '
Parsing [sent. 11480 len. 4]: cried Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 11481 len. 9]: ` Am I already corroborated , Bella ? '
Parsing [sent. 11482 len. 15]: ` Never mind , Sophronia , we will not speak of it any more .
Parsing [sent. 11483 len. 8]: Do n't ask me about it . '
Parsing [sent. 11484 len. 17]: This plainly meaning Do ask me about it , Mrs Lammle did as she was requested .
Parsing [sent. 11485 len. 6]: ` Tell me , Bella .
Parsing [sent. 11486 len. 5]: Come , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11487 len. 19]: What provoking burr has been inconveniently attracted to the charming skirts , and with difficulty shaken off ? '
Parsing [sent. 11488 len. 16]: ` Provoking indeed , ' said Bella , ` and no burr to boast of !
Parsing [sent. 11489 len. 7]: But do n't ask me . '
Parsing [sent. 11490 len. 6]: ` Shall I guess ? '
Parsing [sent. 11491 len. 6]: ` You would never guess .
Parsing [sent. 11492 len. 9]: What would you say to our Secretary ? '
Parsing [sent. 11493 len. 4]: ` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 11494 len. 20]: The hermit Secretary , who creeps up and down the back stairs , and is never seen ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11495 len. 60]: I do n't know about his creeping up and down the back stairs , ' said Bella , rather contemptuously , ` further than knowing that he does no such thing ; and as to his never being seen , I should be content never to have seen him , though he is quite as visible as you are .
Parsing [sent. 11496 len. 20]: But I pleased HIM -LRB- for my sins -RRB- and he had the presumption to tell me so . '
Parsing [sent. 11497 len. 15]: ` The man never made a declaration to you , my dear Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 11498 len. 10]: ` Are you sure of that , Sophronia ? '
Parsing [sent. 11499 len. 4]: said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 11500 len. 4]: I am not .
Parsing [sent. 11501 len. 11]: In fact , I am sure of the contrary . '
Parsing [sent. 11502 len. 18]: ` The man must be mad , ' said Mrs Lammle , with a kind of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 11503 len. 27]: ` He appeared to be in his senses , ' returned Bella , tossing her head , ` and he had plenty to say for himself .
Parsing [sent. 11504 len. 16]: I told him my opinion of his declaration and his conduct , and dismissed him .
Parsing [sent. 11505 len. 15]: Of course this has all been very inconvenient to me , and very disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 11506 len. 8]: It has remained a secret , however .
Parsing [sent. 11507 len. 32]: That word reminds me to observe , Sophronia , that I have glided on into telling you the secret , and that I rely upon you never to mention it . '
Parsing [sent. 11508 len. 5]: ` Mention it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11509 len. 9]: repeated Mrs Lammle with her former feeling . '
Parsing [sent. 11510 len. 4]: Mention it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11511 len. 25]: This time Sophronia was so much in earnest that she found it necessary to bend forward in the carriage and give Bella a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 11512 len. 50]: A Judas order of kiss ; for she thought , while she yet pressed Bella 's hand after giving it , ` Upon your own showing , you vain heartless girl , puffed up by the doting folly of a dustman , I need have no relenting towards YOU .
Parsing [sent. 11513 len. 28]: If my husband , who sends me here , should form any schemes for making YOU a victim , I should certainly not cross him again . '
Parsing [sent. 11514 len. 20]: In those very same moments , Bella was thinking , ` Why am I always at war with myself ?
Parsing [sent. 11515 len. 21]: Why have I told , as if upon compulsion , what I knew all along I ought to have withheld ?
Parsing [sent. 11516 len. 27]: Why am I making a friend of this woman beside me , in spite of the whispers against her that I hear in my heart ? '
Parsing [sent. 11517 len. 21]: As usual , there was no answer in the looking-glass when she got home and referred these questions to it .
Parsing [sent. 11518 len. 32]: Perhaps if she had consulted some better oracle , the result might have been more satisfactory ; but she did not , and all things consequent marched the march before them .
Parsing [sent. 11519 len. 44]: On one point connected with the watch she kept on Mr Boffin , she felt very inquisitive , and that was the question whether the Secretary watched him too , and followed the sure and steady change in him , as she did ?
Parsing [sent. 11520 len. 14]: Her very limited intercourse with Mr Rokesmith rendered this hard to find out .
Parsing [sent. 11521 len. 39]: Their communication now , at no time extended beyond the preservation of commonplace appearances before Mr and Mrs Boffin ; and if Bella and the Secretary were ever left alone together by any chance , he immediately withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 11522 len. 24]: She consulted his face when she could do so covertly , as she worked or read , and could make nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 11523 len. 47]: He looked subdued ; but he had acquired a strong command of feature , and , whenever Mr Boffin spoke to him in Bella 's presence , or whatever revelation of himself Mr Boffin made , the Secretary 's face changed no more than a wall .
Parsing [sent. 11524 len. 63]: A slightly knitted brow , that expressed nothing but an almost mechanical attention , and a compression of the mouth , that might have been a guard against a scornful smile -- these she saw from morning to night , from day to day , from week to week , monotonous , unvarying , set , as in a piece of sculpture .
Parsing [sent. 11525 len. 44]: The worst of the matter was , that it thus fell out insensibly -- and most provokingly , as Bella complained to herself , in her impetuous little manner -- that her observation of Mr Boffin involved a continual observation of Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 11526 len. 11]: ` Wo n't THAT extract a look from him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11527 len. 14]: -- ` Can it be possible THAT makes no impression on him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11528 len. 22]: Such questions Bella would propose to herself , often as many times in a day as there were hours in it .
Parsing [sent. 11529 len. 4]: Impossible to know .
Parsing [sent. 11530 len. 6]: Always the same fixed face .
Parsing [sent. 11531 len. 19]: ` Can he be so base as to sell his very nature for two hundred a year ? '
Parsing [sent. 11532 len. 4]: Bella would think .
Parsing [sent. 11533 len. 8]: And then , ` But why not ?
Parsing [sent. 11534 len. 12]: It 's a mere question of price with others besides him .
Parsing [sent. 11535 len. 16]: I suppose I would sell mine , if I could get enough for it . '
Parsing [sent. 11536 len. 13]: And so she would come round again to the war with herself .
Parsing [sent. 11537 len. 17]: A kind of illegibility , though a different kind , stole over Mr Boffin 's face .
Parsing [sent. 11538 len. 19]: Its old simplicity of expression got masked by a certain craftiness that assimilated even his good-humour to itself .
Parsing [sent. 11539 len. 20]: His very smile was cunning , as if he had been studying smiles among the portraits of his misers .
Parsing [sent. 11540 len. 73]: Saving an occasional burst of impatience , or coarse assertion of his mastery , his good-humour remained to him , but it had now a sordid alloy of distrust ; and though his eyes should twinkle and all his face should laugh , he would sit holding himself in his own arms , as if he had an inclination to hoard himself up , and must always grudgingly stand on the defensive .
Parsing [sent. 11541 len. 49]: What with taking heed of these two faces , and what with feeling conscious that the stealthy occupation must set some mark on her own , Bella soon began to think that there was not a candid or a natural face among them all but Mrs Boffin 's .
Parsing [sent. 11542 len. 30]: None the less because it was far less radiant than of yore , faithfully reflecting in its anxiety and regret every line of change in the Golden Dustman 's .
Parsing [sent. 11543 len. 38]: ` Rokesmith , ' said Mr Boffin one evening when they were all in his room again , and he and the Secretary had been going over some accounts , ' I am spending too much money .
Parsing [sent. 11544 len. 12]: Or leastways , you are spending too much for me . '
Parsing [sent. 11545 len. 9]: ` You are rich , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11546 len. 9]: I am not , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11547 len. 15]: The sharpness of the retort was next to telling the Secretary that he lied .
Parsing [sent. 11548 len. 13]: But it brought no change of expression into the set face . '
Parsing [sent. 11549 len. 22]: I tell you I am not rich , ' repeated Mr Boffin , ` and I wo n't have it . '
Parsing [sent. 11550 len. 9]: ` You are not rich , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11551 len. 8]: repeated the Secretary , in measured words .
Parsing [sent. 11552 len. 18]: ` Well , ' returned Mr Boffin , ` if I am , that 's my business .
Parsing [sent. 11553 len. 17]: I am not going to spend at this rate , to please you , or anybody .
Parsing [sent. 11554 len. 13]: You would n't like it , if it was your money . '
Parsing [sent. 11555 len. 18]: ` Even in that impossible case , sir , I -- ' ` Hold your tongue ! '
Parsing [sent. 11556 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11557 len. 11]: ` You ought n't to like it in any case .
Parsing [sent. 11558 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 11559 len. 22]: I did n't mean to he rude , but you put me out so , and after all I 'm master .
Parsing [sent. 11560 len. 12]: I did n't intend to tell you to hold your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 11561 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 11562 len. 6]: Do n't hold your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 11563 len. 6]: Only , do n't contradict .
Parsing [sent. 11564 len. 12]: Did you ever come across the life of Mr Elwes ? '
Parsing [sent. 11565 len. 8]: referring to his favourite subject at last .
Parsing [sent. 11566 len. 5]: ` The miser ? '
Parsing [sent. 11567 len. 9]: ` Ah , people called him a miser .
Parsing [sent. 11568 len. 8]: People are always calling other people something .
Parsing [sent. 11569 len. 9]: Did you ever read about him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11570 len. 5]: I think so . '
Parsing [sent. 11571 len. 18]: ` He never owned to being rich , and yet he might have bought me twice over .
Parsing [sent. 11572 len. 9]: Did you ever hear of Daniel Dancer ? '
Parsing [sent. 11573 len. 4]: ` Another miser ?
Parsing [sent. 11574 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 11575 len. 23]: ` He was a good ` un , ' said Mr Boffin , ` and he had a sister worthy of him .
Parsing [sent. 11576 len. 7]: They never called themselves rich neither .
Parsing [sent. 11577 len. 17]: If they HAD called themselves rich , most likely they would n't have been so . '
Parsing [sent. 11578 len. 8]: ` They lived and died very miserably .
Parsing [sent. 11579 len. 7]: Did they not , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11580 len. 18]: ` No , I do n't know that they did , ' said Mr Boffin , curtly .
Parsing [sent. 11581 len. 10]: ` Then they are not the Misers I mean .
Parsing [sent. 11582 len. 19]: Those abject wretches -- ' ` Do n't call names , Rokesmith , ' said Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 11583 len. 18]: -- That exemplary brother and sister -- lived and died in the foulest and filthiest degradation . '
Parsing [sent. 11584 len. 27]: ` They pleased themselves , ' said Mr Boffin , ` and I suppose they could have done no more if they had spent their money .
Parsing [sent. 11585 len. 12]: But however , I ai n't going to fling mine away .
Parsing [sent. 11586 len. 5]: Keep the expenses down .
Parsing [sent. 11587 len. 12]: The fact is , you ai n't enough here , Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 11588 len. 9]: It wants constant attention in the littlest things .
Parsing [sent. 11589 len. 12]: Some of us will be dying in a workhouse next . '
Parsing [sent. 11590 len. 26]: ` As the persons you have cited , ' quietly remarked the Secretary , ` thought they would , if I remember , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11591 len. 13]: ` And very creditable in 'em too , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11592 len. 6]: ` Very independent in 'em !
Parsing [sent. 11593 len. 7]: But never mind them just now .
Parsing [sent. 11594 len. 10]: Have you given notice to quit your lodgings ? '
Parsing [sent. 11595 len. 11]: ` Under your direction , I have , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11596 len. 61]: ` Then I tell you what , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` pay the quarter 's rent -- pay the quarter 's rent , it 'll be the cheapest thing in the end -- and come here at once , so that you may be always on the spot , day and night , and keep the expenses down .
Parsing [sent. 11597 len. 19]: You 'll charge the quarter 's rent to me , and we must try and save it somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 11598 len. 12]: You 've got some lovely furniture ; have n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11599 len. 11]: ` The furniture in my rooms is my own . '
Parsing [sent. 11600 len. 12]: ` Then we sha n't have to buy any for you .
Parsing [sent. 11601 len. 64]: In case you was to think it , ' said Mr Boffin , with a look of peculiar shrewdness , ` so honourably independent in you as to make it a relief to your mind , to make that furniture over to me in the light of a set-off against the quarter 's rent , why ease your mind , ease your mind .
Parsing [sent. 11602 len. 23]: I do n't ask it , but I wo n't stand in your way if you should consider it due to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 11603 len. 17]: As to your room , choose any empty room at the top of the house . '
Parsing [sent. 11604 len. 14]: ` Any empty room will do for me , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 11605 len. 31]: ` You can take your pick , ' said Mr Boffin , ` and it 'll be as good as eight or ten shillings a week added to your income .
Parsing [sent. 11606 len. 22]: I wo n't deduct for it ; I look to you to make it up handsomely by keeping the expenses down .
Parsing [sent. 11607 len. 24]: Now , if you 'll show a light , I 'll come to your office-room and dispose of a letter or two . '
Parsing [sent. 11608 len. 47]: On that clear , generous face of Mrs Boffin 's , Bella had seen such traces of a pang at the heart while this dialogue was being held , that she had not the courage to turn her eyes to it when they were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 11609 len. 30]: Feigning to be intent on her embroidery , she sat plying her needle until her busy hand was stopped by Mrs Boffin 's hand being lightly laid upon it .
Parsing [sent. 11610 len. 25]: Yielding to the touch , she felt her hand carried to the good soul 's lips , and felt a tear fall on it .
Parsing [sent. 11611 len. 8]: ` Oh , my loved husband ! '
Parsing [sent. 11612 len. 4]: said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11613 len. 9]: ` This is hard to see and hear .
Parsing [sent. 11614 len. 25]: But my dear Bella , believe me that in spite of all the change in him , he is the best of men . '
Parsing [sent. 11615 len. 18]: He came back , at the moment when Bella had taken the hand comfortingly between her own .
Parsing [sent. 11616 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 11617 len. 10]: said he , mistrustfully looking in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 11618 len. 8]: ` What 's she telling you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11619 len. 13]: ` She is only praising you , sir , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 11620 len. 4]: ` Praising me ?
Parsing [sent. 11621 len. 4]: You are sure ?
Parsing [sent. 11622 len. 23]: Not blaming me for standing on my own defence against a crew of plunderers , who could suck me dry by driblets ?
Parsing [sent. 11623 len. 11]: Not blaming me for getting a little hoard together ? '
Parsing [sent. 11624 len. 28]: He came up to them , and his wife folded her hands upon his shoulder , and shook her head as she laid it on her hands .
Parsing [sent. 11625 len. 8]: ` There , there , there ! '
Parsing [sent. 11626 len. 7]: urged Mr Boffin , not unkindly .
Parsing [sent. 11627 len. 10]: ` Do n't take on , old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 11628 len. 15]: ` But I ca n't bear to see you so , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 11629 len. 3]: ` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 11630 len. 8]: Recollect we are not our old selves .
Parsing [sent. 11631 len. 9]: Recollect , we must scrunch or be scrunched .
Parsing [sent. 11632 len. 8]: Recollect , we must hold our own .
Parsing [sent. 11633 len. 6]: Recollect , money makes money .
Parsing [sent. 11634 len. 17]: Do n't you be uneasy , Bella , my child ; do n't you be doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 11635 len. 12]: The more I save , the more you shall have . '
Parsing [sent. 11636 len. 54]: Bella thought it was well for his wife that she was musing with her affectionate face on his shoulder ; for there was a cunning light in his eyes as he said all this , which seemed to cast a disagreeable illumination on the change in him , and make it morally uglier .
Parsing [sent. 11637 len. 63]: Chapter 6 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO WORSE COMPANY It had come to pass that Mr Silas Wegg now rarely attended the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour , at his -LRB- the worm 's and minion 's -RRB- own house , but lay under general instructions to await him within a certain margin of hours at the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 11638 len. 30]: Mr Wegg took this arrangement in great dudgeon , because the appointed hours were evening hours , and those he considered precious to the progress of the friendly move .
Parsing [sent. 11639 len. 44]: But it was quite in character , he bitterly remarked to Mr Venus , that the upstart who had trampled on those eminent creatures , Miss Elizabeth , Master George , Aunt Jane , and Uncle Parker , should oppress his literary man .
Parsing [sent. 11640 len. 74]: The Roman Empire having worked out its destruction , Mr Boffin next appeared in a cab with Rollin 's Ancient History , which valuable work being found to possess lethargic properties , broke down , at about the period when the whole of the army of Alexander the Macedonian -LRB- at that time about forty thousand strong -RRB- burst into tears simultaneously , on his being taken with a shivering fit after bathing .
Parsing [sent. 11641 len. 46]: The Wars of the Jews , likewise languishing under Mr Wegg 's generalship , Mr Boffin arrived in another cab with Plutarch : whose Lives he found in the sequel extremely entertaining , though he hoped Plutarch might not expect him to believe them all .
Parsing [sent. 11642 len. 62]: What to believe , in the course of his reading , was Mr Boffin 's chief literary difficulty indeed ; for some time he was divided in his mind between half , all , or none ; at length , when he decided , as a moderate man , to compound with half , the question still remained , which half ?
Parsing [sent. 11643 len. 8]: And that stumblingblock he never got over .
Parsing [sent. 11644 len. 78]: One evening , when Silas Wegg had grown accustomed to the arrival of his patron in a cab , accompanied by some profane historian charged with unutterable names of incomprehensible peoples , of impossible descent , waging wars any number of years and syllables long , and carrying illimitable hosts and riches about , with the greatest ease , beyond the confines of geography -- one evening the usual time passed by , and no patron appeared .
Parsing [sent. 11645 len. 41]: After half an hour 's grace , Mr Wegg proceeded to the outer gate , and there executed a whistle , conveying to Mr Venus , if perchance within hearing , the tidings of his being at home and disengaged .
Parsing [sent. 11646 len. 14]: Forth from the shelter of a neighbouring wall , Mr Venus then emerged .
Parsing [sent. 11647 len. 18]: ` Brother in arms , ' said Mr Wegg , in excellent spirits , ` welcome ! '
Parsing [sent. 11648 len. 13]: In return , Mr Venus gave him a rather dry good evening .
Parsing [sent. 11649 len. 32]: ` Walk in , brother , ' said Silas , clapping him on the shoulder , ` and take your seat in my chimley corner ; for what says the ballad ?
Parsing [sent. 11650 len. 30]: `` No malice to dread , sir , And no falsehood to fear , But truth to delight me , Mr Venus , And I forgot what to cheer .
Parsing [sent. 11651 len. 6]: Li toddle de om dee .
Parsing [sent. 11652 len. 17]: And something to guide , My ain fireside , sir , My ain fireside . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11653 len. 26]: With this quotation -LRB- depending for its neatness rather on the spirit than the words -RRB- , Mr Wegg conducted his guest to his hearth .
Parsing [sent. 11654 len. 47]: ` And you come , brother , ' said Mr Wegg , in a hospitable glow , ` you come like I do n't know what -- exactly like it -- I should n't know you from it -- shedding a halo all around you . '
Parsing [sent. 11655 len. 7]: ` What kind of halo ? '
Parsing [sent. 11656 len. 5]: asked Mr Venus . ''
Parsing [sent. 11657 len. 7]: Ope sir , ' replied Silas .
Parsing [sent. 11658 len. 7]: ` That 's YOUR halo . '
Parsing [sent. 11659 len. 16]: Mr Venus appeared doubtful on the point , and looked rather discontentedly at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 11660 len. 20]: ` We 'll devote the evening , brother , ' exclaimed Wegg , ` to prosecute our friendly move .
Parsing [sent. 11661 len. 23]: And arterwards , crushing a flowing wine-cup -- which I allude to brewing rum and water -- we 'll pledge one another .
Parsing [sent. 11662 len. 6]: For what says the Poet ?
Parsing [sent. 11663 len. 45]: `` And you need n't Mr Venus be your black bottle , For surely I 'll be mine , And we 'll take a glass with a slice of lemon in it to which you 're partial , For auld lang syne . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11664 len. 21]: This flow of quotation and hospitality in Wegg indicated his observation of some little querulousness on the part of Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11665 len. 36]: ` Why , as to the friendly move , ' observed the last-named gentleman , rubbing his knees peevishly , ` one of my objections to it is , that it DO N'T move . '
Parsing [sent. 11666 len. 42]: ` Rome , brother , ' returned Wegg : ' a city which -LRB- it may not be generally known -RRB- originated in twins and a wolf ; and ended in Imperial marble : was n't built in a day . '
Parsing [sent. 11667 len. 8]: ` Did I say it was ? '
Parsing [sent. 11668 len. 3]: asked Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11669 len. 9]: ` No , you did not , brother .
Parsing [sent. 11670 len. 3]: Well-inquired . '
Parsing [sent. 11671 len. 41]: ` But I do say , ' proceeded Venus , ` that I am taken from among my trophies of anatomy , am called upon to exchange my human warious for mere coal-ashes warious , and nothing comes of it .
Parsing [sent. 11672 len. 8]: I think I must give up . '
Parsing [sent. 11673 len. 6]: ` No , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11674 len. 5]: remonstrated Wegg , enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 11675 len. 5]: ` No , Sir !
Parsing [sent. 11676 len. 15]: `` Charge , Chester , charge , On , Mr Venus , on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11677 len. 6]: Never say die , sir !
Parsing [sent. 11678 len. 7]: A man of your mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 11679 len. 23]: ` It 's not so much saying it that I object to , ' returned Mr Venus , ` as doing it .
Parsing [sent. 11680 len. 26]: And having got to do it whether or no , I ca n't afford to waste my time on groping for nothing in cinders . '
Parsing [sent. 11681 len. 22]: ` But think how little time you have given to the move , sir , after all , ' urged Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 11682 len. 15]: ` Add the evenings so occupied together , and what do they come to ?
Parsing [sent. 11683 len. 47]: And you , sir , harmonizer with myself in opinions , views , and feelings , you with the patience to fit together on wires the whole framework of society -- I allude to the human skelinton -- you to give in so soon ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11684 len. 27]: I do n't like it , ' returned Mr Venus moodily , as he put his head between his knees and stuck up his dusty hair .
Parsing [sent. 11685 len. 11]: ` And there 's no encouragement to go on . '
Parsing [sent. 11686 len. 25]: ` Not them Mounds without , ' said Mr Wegg , extending his right hand with an air of solemn reasoning , ` encouragement ?
Parsing [sent. 11687 len. 10]: Not them Mounds now looking down upon us ? '
Parsing [sent. 11688 len. 10]: ` They 're too big , ' grumbled Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11689 len. 26]: ` What 's a scratch here and a scrape there , a poke in this place and a dig in the other , to them .
Parsing [sent. 11690 len. 8]: Besides ; what have we found ? '
Parsing [sent. 11691 len. 7]: ` What HAVE we found ? '
Parsing [sent. 11692 len. 10]: cried Wegg , delighted to be able to acquiesce .
Parsing [sent. 11693 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 11694 len. 7]: There I grant you , comrade .
Parsing [sent. 11695 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 11696 len. 12]: But on the contrary , comrade , what MAY we find ?
Parsing [sent. 11697 len. 6]: There you 'll grant me .
Parsing [sent. 11698 len. 4]: Anything . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11699 len. 14]: I do n't like it , ' pettishly returned Venus as before . '
Parsing [sent. 11700 len. 8]: I came into it without enough consideration .
Parsing [sent. 11701 len. 4]: And besides again .
Parsing [sent. 11702 len. 12]: Is n't your own Mr Boffin well acquainted with the Mounds ?
Parsing [sent. 11703 len. 13]: And was n't he well acquainted with the deceased and his ways ?
Parsing [sent. 11704 len. 12]: And has he ever showed any expectation of finding anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 11705 len. 7]: At that moment wheels were heard .
Parsing [sent. 11706 len. 40]: ` Now , I should be loth , ' said Mr Wegg , with an air of patient injury , ` to think so ill of him as to suppose him capable of coming at this time of night .
Parsing [sent. 11707 len. 8]: And yet it sounds like him . '
Parsing [sent. 11708 len. 7]: A ring at the yard bell .
Parsing [sent. 11709 len. 18]: ` It is him , ' said Mr Wegg , ` and he it capable of it .
Parsing [sent. 11710 len. 22]: I am sorry , because I could have wished to keep up a little lingering fragment of respect for him . '
Parsing [sent. 11711 len. 15]: Here Mr Boffin was heard lustily calling at the yard gate , ` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 11712 len. 2]: Wegg !
Parsing [sent. 11713 len. 3]: Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 11714 len. 12]: ` Keep your seat , Mr Venus , ' said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 11715 len. 7]: ` He may not stop . '
Parsing [sent. 11716 len. 10]: And then called out , ` Halloa , sir !
Parsing [sent. 11717 len. 2]: Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 11718 len. 8]: I 'm with you directly , sir !
Parsing [sent. 11719 len. 7]: Half a minute , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11720 len. 14]: Coming , sir , as fast as my leg will bring me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11721 len. 38]: And so with a show of much cheerful alacrity stumped out to the gate with a light , and there , through the window of a cab , descried Mr Boffin inside , blocked up with books .
Parsing [sent. 11722 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 11723 len. 26]: lend a hand , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin excitedly , ' I ca n't get out till the way is cleared for me .
Parsing [sent. 11724 len. 14]: This is the Annual Register , Wegg , in a cab-full of wollumes .
Parsing [sent. 11725 len. 6]: Do you know him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11726 len. 9]: ` Know the Animal Register , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11727 len. 11]: returned the Impostor , who had caught the name imperfectly .
Parsing [sent. 11728 len. 22]: ` For a trifling wager , I think I could find any Animal in him , blindfold , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 11729 len. 24]: ` And here 's Kirby 's Wonderful Museum , ' said Mr Boffin , ` and Caulfield 's Characters , and Wilson 's .
Parsing [sent. 11730 len. 8]: Such Characters , Wegg , such Characters !
Parsing [sent. 11731 len. 13]: I must have one or two of the best of 'em tonight .
Parsing [sent. 11732 len. 18]: It 's amazing what places they used to put the guineas in , wrapped up in rags .
Parsing [sent. 11733 len. 21]: Catch hold of that pile of wollumes , Wegg , or it 'll bulge out and burst into the mud .
Parsing [sent. 11734 len. 9]: Is there anyone about , to help ? '
Parsing [sent. 11735 len. 36]: ` There 's a friend of mine , sir , that had the intention of spending the evening with me when I gave you up -- much against my will -- for the night . '
Parsing [sent. 11736 len. 21]: ` Call him out , ' cried Mr Boffin in a bustle ; ` get him to bear a hand .
Parsing [sent. 11737 len. 9]: Do n't drop that one under your arm .
Parsing [sent. 11738 len. 4]: It 's Dancer .
Parsing [sent. 11739 len. 19]: Him and his sister made pies of a dead sheep they found when they were out a walking .
Parsing [sent. 11740 len. 5]: Where 's your friend ?
Parsing [sent. 11741 len. 7]: Oh , here 's your friend .
Parsing [sent. 11742 len. 14]: Would you be so good as help Wegg and myself with these books ?
Parsing [sent. 11743 len. 16]: But do n't take Jemmy Taylor of Southwark , nor yet Jemmy Wood of Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 11744 len. 6]: These are the two Jemmys .
Parsing [sent. 11745 len. 7]: I 'll carry them myself . '
Parsing [sent. 11746 len. 48]: Not ceasing to talk and bustle , in a state of great excitement , Mr Boffin directed the removal and arrangement of the books , appearing to be in some sort beside himself until they were all deposited on the floor , and the cab was dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 11747 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 11748 len. 8]: said Mr Boffin , gloating over them .
Parsing [sent. 11749 len. 15]: ` There they are , like the four-and-twenty fiddlers -- all of a row .
Parsing [sent. 11750 len. 33]: Get on your spectacles , Wegg ; I know where to find the best of 'em , and we 'll have a taste at once of what we have got before us .
Parsing [sent. 11751 len. 8]: What 's your friend 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 11752 len. 9]: Mr Wegg presented his friend as Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11753 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 11754 len. 9]: cried Mr Boffin , catching at the name .
Parsing [sent. 11755 len. 5]: ` Of Clerkenwell ? '
Parsing [sent. 11756 len. 11]: ` Of Clerkenwell , sir , ' said Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11757 len. 26]: ` Why , I 've heard of you , ' cried Mr Boffin , ' I heard of you in the old man 's time .
Parsing [sent. 11758 len. 4]: You knew him .
Parsing [sent. 11759 len. 9]: Did you ever buy anything of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11760 len. 4]: With piercing eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 11761 len. 9]: ` No , sir , ' returned Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11762 len. 12]: ` But he showed you things ; did n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 11763 len. 15]: Mr Venus , with a glance at his friend , replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 11764 len. 8]: ` What did he show you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11765 len. 16]: asked Mr Boffin , putting his hands behind him , and eagerly advancing his head .
Parsing [sent. 11766 len. 24]: ` Did he show you boxes , little cabinets , pocket-books , parcels , anything locked or sealed , anything tied up ? '
Parsing [sent. 11767 len. 6]: Mr Venus shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 11768 len. 9]: ` Are you a judge of china ? '
Parsing [sent. 11769 len. 7]: Mr Venus again shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 11770 len. 25]: ` Because if he had ever showed you a teapot , I should be glad to know of it , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11771 len. 48]: And then , with his right hand at his lips , repeated thoughtfully , ' a Teapot , a Teapot ' , and glanced over the books on the floor , as if he knew there was something interesting connected with a teapot , somewhere among them .
Parsing [sent. 11772 len. 51]: Mr Wegg and Mr Venus looked at one another wonderingly : and Mr Wegg , in fitting on his spectacles , opened his eyes wide , over their rims , and tapped the side of his nose : as an admonition to Venus to keep himself generally wide awake . '
Parsing [sent. 11773 len. 23]: A Teapot , ' repeated Mr Boffin , continuing to muse and survey the books ; ' a Teapot , a Teapot .
Parsing [sent. 11774 len. 8]: Are you ready , Wegg ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11775 len. 33]: I am at your service , sir , ' replied that gentleman , taking his usual seat on the usual settle , and poking his wooden leg under the table before it .
Parsing [sent. 11776 len. 28]: ` Mr Venus , would you make yourself useful , and take a seat beside me , sir , for the conveniency of snuffing the candles ? '
Parsing [sent. 11777 len. 43]: Venus complying with the invitation while it was yet being given , Silas pegged at him with his wooden leg , to call his particular attention to Mr Boffin standing musing before the fire , in the space between the two settles .
Parsing [sent. 11778 len. 3]: ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 11779 len. 3]: Ahem ! '
Parsing [sent. 11780 len. 10]: coughed Mr Wegg to attract his employer 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 11781 len. 17]: ` Would you wish to commence with an Animal , sir -- from the Register ? '
Parsing [sent. 11782 len. 14]: ` No , ' said Mr Boffin , ` no , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 11783 len. 35]: With that , producing a little book from his breast-pocket , he handed it with great care to the literary gentlemen , and inquired , ` What do you call that , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 11784 len. 29]: ` This , sir , ' replied Silas , adjusting his spectacles , and referring to the title-page , ` is Merryweather 's Lives and Anecdotes of Misers .
Parsing [sent. 11785 len. 19]: Mr Venus , would you make yourself useful and draw the candles a little nearer , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11786 len. 14]: This to have a special opportunity of bestowing a stare upon his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 11787 len. 12]: ` Which of 'em have you got in that lot ? '
Parsing [sent. 11788 len. 4]: asked Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11789 len. 9]: ` Can you find out pretty easy ? '
Parsing [sent. 11790 len. 91]: ` Well , sir , ' replied Silas , turning to the table of contents and slowly fluttering the leaves of the book , ' I should say they must be pretty well all here , sir ; here 's a large assortment , sir ; my eye catches John Overs , sir , John Little , sir , Dick Jarrel , John Elwes , the Reverend Mr Jones of Blewbury , Vulture Hopkins , Daniel Dancer - ' ` Give us Dancer , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11791 len. 14]: With another stare at his comrade , Silas sought and found the place .
Parsing [sent. 11792 len. 10]: ` Page a hundred and nine , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11793 len. 3]: Chapter eight .
Parsing [sent. 11794 len. 10]: Contents of chapter , `` His birth and estate .
Parsing [sent. 11795 len. 6]: His garments and outward appearance .
Parsing [sent. 11796 len. 7]: Miss Dancer and her feminine graces .
Parsing [sent. 11797 len. 5]: The Miser 's Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 11798 len. 6]: The finding of a treasure .
Parsing [sent. 11799 len. 7]: The Story of the Mutton Pies .
Parsing [sent. 11800 len. 7]: A Miser 's Idea of Death .
Parsing [sent. 11801 len. 7]: Bob , the Miser 's cur .
Parsing [sent. 11802 len. 5]: Griffiths and his Master .
Parsing [sent. 11803 len. 6]: How to turn a penny .
Parsing [sent. 11804 len. 6]: A substitute for a Fire .
Parsing [sent. 11805 len. 7]: The Advantages of keeping a Snuff-box .
Parsing [sent. 11806 len. 7]: The Miser dies without a Shirt .
Parsing [sent. 11807 len. 11]: The Treasures of a Dunghill -- '' ' ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 11808 len. 5]: What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 11809 len. 5]: demanded Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 11810 len. 22]: `` The Treasures , '' sir , ' repeated Silas , reading very distinctly , ' `` of a Dunghill . ''
Parsing [sent. 11811 len. 13]: Mr Venus , sir , would you obleege with the snuffers ? '
Parsing [sent. 11812 len. 17]: This , to secure attention to his adding with his lips only , ` Mounds ! '
Parsing [sent. 11813 len. 29]: Mr Boffin drew an arm-chair into the space where he stood , and said , seating himself and slyly rubbing his hands : ` Give us Dancer . '
Parsing [sent. 11814 len. 66]: Mr Wegg pursued the biography of that eminent man through its various phases of avarice and dirt , through Miss Dancer 's death on a sick regimen of cold dumpling , and through Mr Dancer 's keeping his rags together with a hayband , and warming his dinner by sitting upon it , down to the consolatory incident of his dying naked in a sack .
Parsing [sent. 11815 len. 62]: After which he read on as follows : ' `` The house , or rather the heap of ruins , in which Mr Dancer lived , and which at his death devolved to the right of Captain Holmes , was a most miserable , decayed building , for it had not been repaired for more than half a century . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11816 len. 27]: -LRB- Here Mr Wegg eyes his comrade and the room in which they sat : which had not been repaired for a long time . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 11817 len. 18]: `` But though poor in external structure , the ruinous fabric was very rich in the interior .
Parsing [sent. 11818 len. 30]: It took many weeks to explore its whole contents ; and Captain Holmes found it a very agreeable task to dive into the miser 's secret hoards . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11819 len. 18]: -LRB- Here Mr Wegg repeated ` secret hoards ' , and pegged his comrade again . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 11820 len. 69]: `` One of Mr Dancer 's richest escretoires was found to be a dungheap in the cowhouse ; a sum but little short of two thousand five hundred pounds was contained in this rich piece of manure ; and in an old jacket , carefully tied , and strongly nailed down to the manger , in bank notes and gold were found five hundred pounds more . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11821 len. 24]: -LRB- Here Mr Wegg 's wooden leg started forward under the table , and slowly elevated itself as he read on . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 11822 len. 30]: `` Several bowls were discovered filled with guineas and halfguineas ; and at different times on searching the corners of the house they found various parcels of bank notes .
Parsing [sent. 11823 len. 23]: Some were crammed into the crevices of the wall '' ' ; -LRB- Here Mr Venus looked at the wall . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 11824 len. 28]: `` Bundles were hid under the cushions and covers of the chairs '' ' ; -LRB- Here Mr Venus looked under himself on the settle . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 11825 len. 32]: `` Some were reposing snugly at the back of the drawers ; and notes amounting to six hundred pounds were found neatly doubled up in the inside of an old teapot .
Parsing [sent. 11826 len. 14]: In the stable the Captain found jugs full of old dollars and shillings .
Parsing [sent. 11827 len. 44]: The chimney was not left unsearched , and paid very well for the trouble ; for in nineteen different holes , all filled with soot , were found various sums of money , amounting together to more than two hundred pounds . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11828 len. 66]: On the way to this crisis Mr Wegg 's wooden leg had gradually elevated itself more and more , and he had nudged Mr Venus with his opposite elbow deeper and deeper , until at length the preservation of his balance became incompatible with the two actions , and he now dropped over sideways upon that gentleman , squeezing him against the settle 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 11829 len. 28]: Nor did either of the two , for some few seconds , make any effort to recover himself ; both remaining in a kind of pecuniary swoon .
Parsing [sent. 11830 len. 25]: But the sight of Mr Boffin sitting in the arm-chair hugging himself , with his eyes upon the fire , acted as a restorative .
Parsing [sent. 11831 len. 18]: Counterfeiting a sneeze to cover their movements , Mr Wegg , with a spasmodic 'T ish-ho ! '
Parsing [sent. 11832 len. 11]: pulled himself and Mr Venus up in a masterly manner .
Parsing [sent. 11833 len. 14]: ` Let 's have some more , ' said Mr Boffin , hungrily .
Parsing [sent. 11834 len. 9]: ` John Elwes is the next , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11835 len. 10]: Is it your pleasure to take John Elwes ? '
Parsing [sent. 11836 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11837 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11838 len. 9]: ` Let 's hear what John did . '
Parsing [sent. 11839 len. 15]: He did not appear to have hidden anything , so went off rather flatly .
Parsing [sent. 11840 len. 46]: But an exemplary lady named Wilcocks , who had stowed away gold and silver in a pickle-pot in a clock-case , a canister-full of treasure in a hole under her stairs , and a quantity of money in an old rat-trap , revived the interest .
Parsing [sent. 11841 len. 27]: To her succeeded another lady , claiming to be a pauper , whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag .
Parsing [sent. 11842 len. 40]: To her , another lady , applewoman by trade , who had saved a fortune of ten thousand pounds and hidden it ` here and there , in cracks and corners , behind bricks and under the flooring . '
Parsing [sent. 11843 len. 54]: To her , a French gentleman , who had crammed up his chimney , rather to the detriment of its drawing powers , ' a leather valise , containing twenty thousand francs , gold coins , and a large quantity of precious stones , ' as discovered by a chimneysweep after his death .
Parsing [sent. 11844 len. 61]: By these steps Mr Wegg arrived at a concluding instance of the human Magpie : ' `` Many years ago , there lived at Cambridge a miserly old couple of the name of Jardine : they had two sons : the father was a perfect miser , and at his death one thousand guineas were discovered secreted in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 11845 len. 11]: The two sons grew up as parsimonious as their sire .
Parsing [sent. 11846 len. 23]: When about twenty years of age , they commenced business at Cambridge as drapers , and they continued there until their death .
Parsing [sent. 11847 len. 17]: The establishment of the Messrs Jardine was the most dirty of all the shops in Cambridge .
Parsing [sent. 11848 len. 13]: Customers seldom went in to purchase , except perhaps out of curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 11849 len. 28]: The brothers were most disreputable-looking beings ; for , although surrounded with gay apparel as their staple in trade , they wore the most filthy rags themselves .
Parsing [sent. 11850 len. 29]: It is said that they had no bed , and , to save the expense of one , always slept on a bundle of packing-cloths under the counter .
Parsing [sent. 11851 len. 10]: In their housekeeping they were penurious in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 11852 len. 13]: A joint of meat did not grace their board for twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 11853 len. 31]: Yet when the first of the brothers died , the other , much to his surprise , found large sums of money which had been secreted even from him . '
Parsing [sent. 11854 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 11855 len. 4]: cried Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11856 len. 8]: ` Even from him , you see !
Parsing [sent. 11857 len. 18]: There was only two of 'em , and yet one of 'em hid from the other . '
Parsing [sent. 11858 len. 38]: Mr Venus , who since his introduction to the French gentleman , had been stooping to peer up the chimney , had his attention recalled by the last sentence , and took the liberty of repeating it .
Parsing [sent. 11859 len. 7]: ` Do you like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 11860 len. 8]: asked Mr Boffin , turning suddenly . '
Parsing [sent. 11861 len. 8]: I beg your pardon , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11862 len. 11]: ` Do you like what Wegg 's been a-reading ? '
Parsing [sent. 11863 len. 10]: Mr Venus answered that he found it extremely interesting .
Parsing [sent. 11864 len. 16]: ` Then come again , ' said Mr Boffin , ` and hear some more .
Parsing [sent. 11865 len. 16]: Come when you like ; come the day after to-morrow , half an hour sooner .
Parsing [sent. 11866 len. 13]: There 's plenty more ; there 's no end to it . '
Parsing [sent. 11867 len. 10]: Mr Venus expressed his acknowledgments and accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 11868 len. 27]: ` It 's wonderful what 's been hid , at one time and another , ' said Mr Boffin , ruminating ; ` truly wonderful . '
Parsing [sent. 11869 len. 35]: ` Meaning sir , ' observed Wegg , with a propitiatory face to draw him out , and with another peg at his friend and brother , ` in the way of money ? '
Parsing [sent. 11870 len. 8]: ` Money , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11871 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 11872 len. 4]: And papers . '
Parsing [sent. 11873 len. 27]: Mr Wegg , in a languid transport , again dropped over on Mr Venus , and again recovering himself , masked his emotions with a sneeze .
Parsing [sent. 11874 len. 3]: 'T ish-ho !
Parsing [sent. 11875 len. 8]: Did you say papers too , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 11876 len. 6]: Been hidden , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11877 len. 10]: ` Hidden and forgot , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11878 len. 18]: ` Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum -- where 's the Wonderful Museum ? '
Parsing [sent. 11879 len. 18]: He was on his knees on the floor in a moment , groping eagerly among the books .
Parsing [sent. 11880 len. 9]: ` Can I assist you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11881 len. 3]: asked Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 11882 len. 26]: ` No , I have got it ; here it is , ' said Mr Boflin , dusting it with the sleeve of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 11883 len. 4]: ` Wollume four .
Parsing [sent. 11884 len. 18]: I know it was the fourth wollume , that the bookseller read it to me out of .
Parsing [sent. 11885 len. 7]: Look for it , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 11886 len. 9]: Silas took the book and turned the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 11887 len. 7]: ` Remarkable petrefaction , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11888 len. 13]: ` No , that 's not it , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11889 len. 10]: ` It ca n't have been a petrefaction . '
Parsing [sent. 11890 len. 15]: ` Memoirs of General John Reid , commonly called The Walking Rushlight , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 11891 len. 4]: With portrait ? '
Parsing [sent. 11892 len. 12]: ` No , nor yet him , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11893 len. 14]: ` Remarkable case of a person who swallowed a crown-piece , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11894 len. 6]: ` To hide it ? '
Parsing [sent. 11895 len. 4]: asked Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11896 len. 25]: ` Why , no , sir , ' replied Wegg , consulting the text , ` it appears to have been done by accident .
Parsing [sent. 11897 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11898 len. 6]: This next must be it .
Parsing [sent. 11899 len. 13]: `` Singular discovery of a will , lost twenty-one years . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11900 len. 6]: ` That 's it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11901 len. 4]: cried Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11902 len. 6]: ` Read that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11903 len. 25]: `` A most extraordinary case , '' ' read Silas Wegg aloud , ' `` was tried at the last Maryborough assizes in Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 11904 len. 5]: It was briefly this .
Parsing [sent. 11905 len. 50]: Robert Baldwin , in March 1782 , made his will , in which he devised the lands now in question , to the children of his youngest son ; soon after which his faculties failed him , and he became altogether childish and died , above eighty years old .
Parsing [sent. 11906 len. 60]: The defendant , the eldest son , immediately afterwards gave out that his father had destroyed the will ; and no will being found , he entered into possession of the lands in question , and so matters remained for twenty-one years , the whole family during all that time believing that the father had died without a will .
Parsing [sent. 11907 len. 97]: But after twentyone years the defendant 's wife died , and he very soon afterwards , at the age of seventy-eight , married a very young woman : which caused some anxiety to his two sons , whose poignant expressions of this feeling so exasperated their father , that he in his resentment executed a will to disinherit his eldest son , and in his fit of anger showed it to his second son , who instantly determined to get at it , and destroy it , in order to preserve the property to his brother .
Parsing [sent. 11908 len. 44]: With this view , he broke open his father 's desk , where he found -- not his father 's will which he sought after , but the will of his grandfather , which was then altogether forgotten in the family . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11909 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 11910 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 11911 len. 19]: ` See what men put away and forget , or mean to destroy , and do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 11912 len. 18]: He then added in a slow tone , ` As -- ton -- ish -- ing ! '
Parsing [sent. 11913 len. 23]: And as he rolled his eyes all round the room , Wegg and Venus likewise rolled their eyes all round the room .
Parsing [sent. 11914 len. 36]: And then Wegg , singly , fixed his eyes on Mr Boffin looking at the fire again ; as if he had a mind to spring upon him and demand his thoughts or his life .
Parsing [sent. 11915 len. 21]: ` However , time 's up for to-night , ' said Mr Boffin , waving his hand after a silence .
Parsing [sent. 11916 len. 8]: ` More , the day after to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 11917 len. 9]: Range the books upon the shelves , Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 11918 len. 14]: I dare say Mr Venus will be so kind as help you . '
Parsing [sent. 11919 len. 31]: While speaking , he thrust his hand into the breast of his outer coat , and struggled with some object there that was too large to be got out easily .
Parsing [sent. 11920 len. 23]: What was the stupefaction of the friendly movers when this object at last emerging , proved to be a much-dilapidated dark lantern !
Parsing [sent. 11921 len. 50]: Without at all noticing the effect produced by this little instrument , Mr Boffin stood it on his knee , and , producing a box of matches , deliberately lighted the candle in the lantern , blew out the kindled match , and cast the end into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 11922 len. 25]: ` I 'm going , Wegg , ' he then announced , ` to take a turn about the place and round the yard .
Parsing [sent. 11923 len. 6]: I do n't want you .
Parsing [sent. 11924 len. 20]: Me and this same lantern have taken hundreds -- thousands -- of such turns in our time together . '
Parsing [sent. 11925 len. 56]: ` But I could n't think , sir -- not on any account , I could n't , ' -- Wegg was politely beginning , when Mr Boffin , who had risen and was going towards the door , stopped : ' I have told you that I do n't want you , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 11926 len. 25]: Wegg looked intelligently thoughtful , as if that had not occurred to his mind until he now brought it to bear on the circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 11927 len. 19]: He had nothing for it but to let Mr Boffin go out and shut the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 11928 len. 60]: But , the instant he was on the other side of it , Wegg clutched Venus with both hands , and said in a choking whisper , as if he were being strangled : ` Mr Venus , he must be followed , he must be watched , he must n't be lost sight of for a moment . '
Parsing [sent. 11929 len. 7]: ` Why must n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 11930 len. 6]: asked Venus , also strangling .
Parsing [sent. 11931 len. 20]: ` Comrade , you might have noticed I was a little elewated in spirits when you come in to-night .
Parsing [sent. 11932 len. 6]: I 've found something . '
Parsing [sent. 11933 len. 7]: ` What have you found ? '
Parsing [sent. 11934 len. 21]: asked Venus , clutching him with both hands , so that they stood interlocked like a couple of preposterous gladiators .
Parsing [sent. 11935 len. 10]: ` There 's no time to tell you now .
Parsing [sent. 11936 len. 11]: I think he must have gone to look for it .
Parsing [sent. 11937 len. 10]: We must have an eye upon him instantly . '
Parsing [sent. 11938 len. 18]: Releasing each other , they crept to the door , opened it softly , and peeped out .
Parsing [sent. 11939 len. 19]: It was a cloudy night , and the black shadow of the Mounds made the dark yard darker .
Parsing [sent. 11940 len. 17]: ` If not a double swindler , ' whispered Wegg , ` why a dark lantern ?
Parsing [sent. 11941 len. 17]: We could have seen what he was about , if he had carried a light one .
Parsing [sent. 11942 len. 6]: Softly , this way . '
Parsing [sent. 11943 len. 21]: Cautiously along the path that was bordered by fragments of crockery set in ashes , the two stole after him .
Parsing [sent. 11944 len. 17]: They could hear him at his peculiar trot , crushing the loose cinders as he went .
Parsing [sent. 11945 len. 27]: ` He knows the place by heart , ' muttered Silas , ` and do n't need to turn his lantern on , confound him ! '
Parsing [sent. 11946 len. 24]: But he did turn it on , almost in that same instant , and flashed its light upon the first of the Mounds .
Parsing [sent. 11947 len. 7]: ` Is that the spot ? '
Parsing [sent. 11948 len. 6]: asked Venus in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 11949 len. 13]: ` He 's warm , ' said Silas in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 11950 len. 6]: ` He 's precious warm .
Parsing [sent. 11951 len. 4]: He 's close .
Parsing [sent. 11952 len. 11]: I think he must be going to look for it .
Parsing [sent. 11953 len. 12]: What 's that he 's got in his hand ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11954 len. 7]: A shovel , ' answered Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11955 len. 21]: ` And he knows how to use it , remember , fifty times as well as either of us . '
Parsing [sent. 11956 len. 23]: ` If he looks for it and misses it , partner , ' suggested Wegg , ` what shall we do ? '
Parsing [sent. 11957 len. 14]: ` First of all , wait till he does , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11958 len. 17]: Discreet advice too , for he darkened his lantern again , and the mound turned black .
Parsing [sent. 11959 len. 54]: After a few seconds , he turned the light on once more , and was seen standing at the foot of the second mound , slowly raising the lantern little by little until he held it up at arm 's length , as if he were examining the condition of the whole surface .
Parsing [sent. 11960 len. 10]: ` That ca n't be the spot too ? '
Parsing [sent. 11961 len. 3]: said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11962 len. 14]: ` No , ' said Wegg , ` he 's getting cold . '
Parsing [sent. 11963 len. 26]: ` It strikes me , ' whispered Venus , ` that he wants to find out whether any one has been groping about there . '
Parsing [sent. 11964 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 11965 len. 11]: returned Wegg , ` he 's getting colder and colder .
Parsing [sent. 11966 len. 7]: -- Now he 's freezing ! '
Parsing [sent. 11967 len. 28]: This exclamation was elicited by his having turned the lantern off again , and on again , and being visible at the foot of the third mound .
Parsing [sent. 11968 len. 10]: ` Why , he 's going up it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11969 len. 3]: said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11970 len. 6]: ` Shovel and all ! '
Parsing [sent. 11971 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 11972 len. 49]: At a nimbler trot , as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated him by reviving old associations , Mr Boffin ascended the ` serpentining walk ' , up the Mound which he had described to Silas Wegg on the occasion of their beginning to decline and fall .
Parsing [sent. 11973 len. 10]: On striking into it he turned his lantern off .
Parsing [sent. 11974 len. 30]: The two followed him , stooping low , so that their figures might make no mark in relief against the sky when he should turn his lantern on again .
Parsing [sent. 11975 len. 29]: Mr Venus took the lead , towing Mr Wegg , in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself .
Parsing [sent. 11976 len. 13]: They could just make out that the Golden Dustman stopped to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 11977 len. 8]: Of course they stopped too , instantly .
Parsing [sent. 11978 len. 21]: ` This is his own Mound , ' whispered Wegg , as he recovered his wind , ` this one .
Parsing [sent. 11979 len. 12]: ` Why all three are his own , ' returned Venus .
Parsing [sent. 11980 len. 42]: ` So he thinks ; but he 's used to call this his own , because it 's the one first left to him ; the one that was his legacy when it was all he took under the will . '
Parsing [sent. 11981 len. 29]: ` When he shows his light , ' said Venus , keeping watch upon his dusky figure all the time , ` drop lower and keep closer . '
Parsing [sent. 11982 len. 10]: He went on again , and they followed again .
Parsing [sent. 11983 len. 24]: Gaining the top of the Mound , he turned on his light -- but only partially -- and stood it on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 11984 len. 20]: A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole was planted in the ashes there , and had been there many a year .
Parsing [sent. 11985 len. 43]: Hard by this pole , his lantern stood : lighting a few feet of the lower part of it and a little of the ashy surface around , and then casting off a purposeless little clear trail of light into the air .
Parsing [sent. 11986 len. 13]: ` He can never be going to dig up the pole ! '
Parsing [sent. 11987 len. 10]: whispered Venus as they dropped low and kept close .
Parsing [sent. 11988 len. 14]: ` Perhaps it 's holler and full of something , ' whispered Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 11989 len. 35]: He was going to dig , with whatsoever object , for he tucked up his cuffs and spat on his hands , and then went at it like an old digger as he was .
Parsing [sent. 11990 len. 30]: He had no design upon the pole , except that he measured a shovel 's length from it before beginning , nor was it his purpose to dig deep .
Parsing [sent. 11991 len. 9]: Some dozen or so of expert strokes sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 11992 len. 47]: Then , he stopped , looked down into the cavity , bent over it , and took out what appeared to be an ordinary case-bottle : one of those squat , high-shouldered , short-necked glass bottles which the Dutchman is said to keep his Courage in .
Parsing [sent. 11993 len. 29]: As soon as he had done this , he turned off his lantern , and they could hear that he was filling up the hole in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 11994 len. 24]: The ashes being easily moved by a skilful hand , the spies took this as a hint to make off in good time .
Parsing [sent. 11995 len. 13]: Accordingly , Mr Venus slipped past Mr Wegg and towed him down .
Parsing [sent. 11996 len. 81]: But Mr Wegg 's descent was not accomplished without some personal inconvenience , for his self-willed leg sticking into the ashes about half way down , and time pressing , Mr Venus took the liberty of hauling him from his tether by the collar : which occasioned him to make the rest of the journey on his back , with his head enveloped in the skirts of his coat , and his wooden leg coming last , like a drag .
Parsing [sent. 11997 len. 58]: So flustered was Mr Wegg by this mode of travelling , that when he was set on the level ground with his intellectual developments uppermost , he was quite unconscious of his bearings , and had not the least idea where his place of residence was to be found , until Mr Venus shoved him into it .
Parsing [sent. 11998 len. 32]: Even then he staggered round and round , weakly staring about him , until Mr Venus with a hard brush brushed his senses into him and the dust out of him .
Parsing [sent. 11999 len. 30]: Mr Boffin came down leisurely , for this brushing process had been well accomplished , and Mr Venus had had time to take his breath , before he reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 12000 len. 20]: That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be doubted ; where , was not so clear .
Parsing [sent. 12001 len. 23]: He wore a large rough coat , buttoned over , and it might be in any one of half a dozen pockets .
Parsing [sent. 12002 len. 9]: ` What 's the matter , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 12003 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 12004 len. 10]: ` You are as pale as a candle . '
Parsing [sent. 12005 len. 19]: Mr Wegg replied , with literal exactness , that he felt as if he had had a turn .
Parsing [sent. 12006 len. 33]: ` Bile , ' said Mr Boffin , blowing out the light in the lantern , shutting it up , and stowing it away in the breast of his coat as before .
Parsing [sent. 12007 len. 10]: ` Are you subject to bile , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 12008 len. 34]: Mr Wegg again replied , with strict adherence to truth , that he did n't think he had ever had a similar sensation in his head , to anything like the same extent .
Parsing [sent. 12009 len. 21]: ` Physic yourself to-morrow , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin , ` to be in order for next night .
Parsing [sent. 12010 len. 15]: By-the-by , this neighbourhood is going to have a loss , Wegg . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12011 len. 6]: A loss , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12012 len. 8]: ` Going to lose the Mounds . '
Parsing [sent. 12013 len. 30]: The friendly movers made such an obvious effort not to look at one another , that they might as well have stared at one another with all their might .
Parsing [sent. 12014 len. 11]: ` Have you parted with them , Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 12015 len. 3]: asked Silas .
Parsing [sent. 12016 len. 7]: ` Yes ; they 're going .
Parsing [sent. 12017 len. 9]: Mine 's as good as gone already . '
Parsing [sent. 12018 len. 18]: ` You mean the little one of the three , with the pole atop , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12019 len. 26]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Boffin , rubbing his ear in his old way , with that new touch of craftiness added to it .
Parsing [sent. 12020 len. 7]: ` It has fetched a penny .
Parsing [sent. 12021 len. 10]: It 'll begin to be carted off to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 12022 len. 16]: ` Have you been out to take leave of your old friend , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12023 len. 5]: asked Silas , jocosely .
Parsing [sent. 12024 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 12025 len. 11]: ` What the devil put that in your head ? '
Parsing [sent. 12026 len. 44]: He was so sudden and rough , that Wegg , who had been hovering closer and closer to his skirts , despatching the back of his hand on exploring expeditions in search of the bottle 's surface , retired two or three paces .
Parsing [sent. 12027 len. 12]: ` No offence , sir , ' said Wegg , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 12028 len. 5]: ` No offence . '
Parsing [sent. 12029 len. 31]: Mr Boffin eyed him as a dog might eye another dog who wanted his bone ; and actually retorted with a low growl , as the dog might have retorted .
Parsing [sent. 12030 len. 30]: ` Good-night , ' he said , after having sunk into a moody silence , with his hands clasped behind him , and his eyes suspiciously wandering about Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12031 len. 4]: -- ` No !
Parsing [sent. 12032 len. 3]: stop there .
Parsing [sent. 12033 len. 13]: I know the way out , and I want no light . '
Parsing [sent. 12034 len. 64]: Avarice , and the evening 's legends of avarice , and the inflammatory effect of what he had seen , and perhaps the rush of his ill-conditioned blood to his brain in his descent , wrought Silas Wegg to such a pitch of insatiable appetite , that when the door closed he made a swoop at it and drew Venus along with him .
Parsing [sent. 12035 len. 10]: ` He must n't go , ' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 12036 len. 8]: ` We must n't let him go ?
Parsing [sent. 12037 len. 8]: He has got that bottle about him .
Parsing [sent. 12038 len. 7]: We must have that bottle . '
Parsing [sent. 12039 len. 12]: ` Why , you would n't take it by force ? '
Parsing [sent. 12040 len. 6]: said Venus , restraining him .
Parsing [sent. 12041 len. 5]: ` Would n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 12042 len. 4]: Yes I would .
Parsing [sent. 12043 len. 16]: I 'd take it by any force , I 'd have it at any price !
Parsing [sent. 12044 len. 19]: Are you so afraid of one old man as to let him go , you coward ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12045 len. 26]: I am so afraid of you , as not to let YOU go , ' muttered Venus , sturdily , clasping him in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 12046 len. 7]: ` Did you hear him ? '
Parsing [sent. 12047 len. 3]: retorted Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12048 len. 14]: ` Did you hear him say that he was resolved to disappoint us ?
Parsing [sent. 12049 len. 30]: Did you hear him say , you cur , that he was going to have the Mounds cleared off , when no doubt the whole place will be rummaged ?
Parsing [sent. 12050 len. 17]: If you have n't the spirit of a mouse to defend your rights , I have .
Parsing [sent. 12051 len. 7]: Let me go after him . '
Parsing [sent. 12052 len. 49]: As in his wildness he was making a strong struggle for it , Mr Venus deemed it expedient to lift him , throw him , and fall with him ; well knowing that , once down , he would not he up again easily with his wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 12053 len. 21]: So they both rolled on the floor , and , as they did so , Mr Boffin shut the gate .
Parsing [sent. 12054 len. 36]: Chapter 7 THE FRIENDLY MOVE TAKES UP A STRONG POSITION The friendly movers sat upright on the floor , panting and eyeing one another , after Mr Boffin had slammed the gate and gone away .
Parsing [sent. 12055 len. 39]: In the weak eyes of Venus , and in every reddish dust-coloured hair in his shock of hair , there was a marked distrust of Wegg and an alertness to fly at him on perceiving the smallest occasion .
Parsing [sent. 12056 len. 37]: In the hard-grained face of Wegg , and in his stiff knotty figure -LRB- he looked like a German wooden toy -RRB- , there was expressed a politic conciliation , which had no spontaneity in it .
Parsing [sent. 12057 len. 56]: Both were flushed , flustered , and rumpled , by the late scuffle ; and Wegg , in coming to the ground , had received a humming knock on the back of his devoted head , which caused him still to rub it with an air of having been highly -- but disagreeably -- astonished .
Parsing [sent. 12058 len. 15]: Each was silent for some time , leaving it to the other to begin .
Parsing [sent. 12059 len. 23]: ` Brother , ' said Wegg , at length breaking the silence , ` you were right , and I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 12060 len. 5]: I forgot myself . '
Parsing [sent. 12061 len. 26]: Mr Venus knowingly cocked his shock of hair , as rather thinking Mr Wegg had remembered himself , in respect of appearing without any disguise .
Parsing [sent. 12062 len. 30]: ` But comrade , ' pursued Wegg , ` it was never your lot to know Miss Elizabeth , Master George , Aunt Jane , nor Uncle Parker . '
Parsing [sent. 12063 len. 32]: Mr Venus admitted that he had never known those distinguished persons , and added , in effect , that he had never so much as desired the honour of their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 12064 len. 9]: ` Do n't say that , comrade ! '
Parsing [sent. 12065 len. 11]: retorted Wegg : ` No , do n't say that !
Parsing [sent. 12066 len. 28]: Because , without having known them , you never can fully know what it is to be stimilated to frenzy by the sight of the Usurper . '
Parsing [sent. 12067 len. 45]: Offering these excusatory words as if they reflected great credit on himself , Mr Wegg impelled himself with his hands towards a chair in a corner of the room , and there , after a variety of awkward gambols , attained a perpendicular position .
Parsing [sent. 12068 len. 5]: Mr Venus also rose .
Parsing [sent. 12069 len. 12]: ` Comrade , ' said Wegg , ` take a seat .
Parsing [sent. 12070 len. 10]: Comrade , what a speaking countenance is yours ! '
Parsing [sent. 12071 len. 26]: Mr Venus involuntarily smoothed his countenance , and looked at his hand , as if to see whether any of its speaking properties came off .
Parsing [sent. 12072 len. 36]: ` For clearly do I know , mark you , ' pursued Wegg , pointing his words with his forefinger , ` clearly do I know what question your expressive features puts to me . '
Parsing [sent. 12073 len. 5]: ` What question ? '
Parsing [sent. 12074 len. 3]: said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12075 len. 29]: ` The question , ' returned Wegg , with a sort of joyful affability , ` why I did n't mention sooner , that I had found something .
Parsing [sent. 12076 len. 23]: Says your speaking countenance to me : `` Why did n't you communicate that , when I first come in this evening ?
Parsing [sent. 12077 len. 20]: Why did you keep it back till you thought Mr Boffin had come to look for the article ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12078 len. 15]: Your speaking countenance , ' said Wegg , ` puts it plainer than language .
Parsing [sent. 12079 len. 15]: Now , you ca n't read in my face what answer I give ? '
Parsing [sent. 12080 len. 12]: ` No , I ca n't , ' said Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 12081 len. 4]: I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 12082 len. 5]: And why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12083 len. 9]: returned Wegg , with the same joyful candour .
Parsing [sent. 12084 len. 11]: ` Because I lay no claims to a speaking countenance .
Parsing [sent. 12085 len. 9]: Because I am well aware of my deficiencies .
Parsing [sent. 12086 len. 7]: All men are not gifted alike .
Parsing [sent. 12087 len. 7]: But I can answer in words .
Parsing [sent. 12088 len. 5]: And in what words ?
Parsing [sent. 12089 len. 2]: These .
Parsing [sent. 12090 len. 14]: I wanted to give you a delightful sap -- pur -- IZE ! '
Parsing [sent. 12091 len. 54]: Having thus elongated and emphasized the word Surprise , Mr Wegg shook his friend and brother by both hands , and then clapped him on both knees , like an affectionate patron who entreated him not to mention so small a service as that which it had been his happy privilege to render .
Parsing [sent. 12092 len. 27]: ` Your speaking countenance , ' said Wegg , ` being answered to its satisfaction , only asks then , `` What have you found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12093 len. 10]: Why , I hear it say the words ! '
Parsing [sent. 12094 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 12095 len. 9]: retorted Venus snappishly , after waiting in vain .
Parsing [sent. 12096 len. 17]: ` If you hear it say the words , why do n't you answer it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12097 len. 6]: ` Hear me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 12098 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12099 len. 6]: ` I 'm a-going to .
Parsing [sent. 12100 len. 4]: Hear me out !
Parsing [sent. 12101 len. 20]: Man and brother , partner in feelings equally with undertakings and actions , I have found a cash-box . '
Parsing [sent. 12102 len. 5]: ` Where ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12103 len. 6]: -- Hear me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 12104 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12105 len. 29]: -LRB- He tried to reserve whatever he could , and , whenever disclosure was forced upon him , broke into a radiant gush of Hear me out . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12106 len. 13]: ` On a certain day , sir -- ' ` When ? '
Parsing [sent. 12107 len. 4]: said Venus bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 12108 len. 21]: ` N -- no , ' returned Wegg , shaking his head at once observantly , thoughtfully , and playfully .
Parsing [sent. 12109 len. 5]: ` No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 12110 len. 11]: That 's not your expressive countenance which asks that question .
Parsing [sent. 12111 len. 9]: That 's your voice ; merely your voice .
Parsing [sent. 12112 len. 3]: To proceed .
Parsing [sent. 12113 len. 166]: On a certain day , sir , I happened to be walking in the yard -- taking my lonely round -- for in the words of a friend of my own family , the author of All 's Well arranged as a duett : `` Deserted , as you will remember Mr Venus , by the waning moon , When stars , it will occur to you before I mention it , proclaim night 's cheerless noon , On tower , fort , or tented ground , The sentry walks his lonely round , The sentry walks : '' -- under those circumstances , sir , I happened to be walking in the yard early one afternoon , and happened to have an iron rod in my hand , with which I have been sometimes accustomed to beguile the monotony of a literary life , when I struck it against an object not necessary to trouble you by naming -- ' ` It is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 12114 len. 4]: What object ? '
Parsing [sent. 12115 len. 9]: demanded Venus , in a wrathful tone . '
Parsing [sent. 12116 len. 6]: -- Hear me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 12117 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12118 len. 4]: ` The Pump .
Parsing [sent. 12119 len. 32]: -- When I struck it against the Pump , and found , not only that the top was loose and opened with a lid , but that something in it rattled .
Parsing [sent. 12120 len. 15]: That something , comrade , I discovered to be a small flat oblong cash-box .
Parsing [sent. 12121 len. 9]: Shall I say it was disappintingly light ? '
Parsing [sent. 12122 len. 11]: ` There were papers in it , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12123 len. 9]: ` There your expressive countenance speaks indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 12124 len. 4]: cried Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 12125 len. 3]: A paper .
Parsing [sent. 12126 len. 37]: The box was locked , tied up , and sealed , and on the outside was a parchment label , with the writing , `` MY WILL , JOHN HARMON , TEMPORARILY DEPOSITED HERE . '' '
Parsing [sent. 12127 len. 12]: ` We must know its contents , ' said Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 12128 len. 6]: -- Hear me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 12129 len. 4]: cried Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 12130 len. 11]: I said so , and I broke the box open .
Parsing [sent. 12131 len. 7]: ` Without coming to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12132 len. 3]: exclaimed Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12133 len. 7]: ` Exactly so , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12134 len. 8]: returned Wegg , blandly and buoyantly . '
Parsing [sent. 12135 len. 8]: I see I take you with me !
Parsing [sent. 12136 len. 6]: Hear , hear , hear !
Parsing [sent. 12137 len. 27]: Resolved , as your discriminating good sense perceives , that if you was to have a sap-pur -- IZE , it should be a complete one !
Parsing [sent. 12138 len. 4]: Well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12139 len. 16]: And so , as you have honoured me by anticipating , I examined the document .
Parsing [sent. 12140 len. 9]: Regularly executed , regularly witnessed , very short .
Parsing [sent. 12141 len. 51]: Inasmuch as he has never made friends , and has ever had a rebellious family , he , John Harmon , gives to Nicodemus Boffin the Little Mound , which is quite enough for him , and gives the whole rest and residue of his property to the Crown . '
Parsing [sent. 12142 len. 20]: ` The date of the will that has been proved , must be looked to , ' remarked Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12143 len. 11]: ` It may be later than this one . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12144 len. 6]: -- Hear me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 12145 len. 4]: cried Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 12146 len. 4]: I said so .
Parsing [sent. 12147 len. 18]: I paid a shilling -LRB- never mind your sixpence of it -RRB- to look up that will .
Parsing [sent. 12148 len. 11]: Brother , that will is dated months before this will .
Parsing [sent. 12149 len. 60]: And now , as a fellow-man , and as a partner in a friendly move , ' added Wegg , benignantly taking him by both hands again , and clapping him on both knees again , ` say have I completed my labour of love to your perfect satisfaction , and are you sap -- pur -- IZED ? '
Parsing [sent. 12150 len. 26]: Mr Venus contemplated his fellow-man and partner with doubting eyes , and then rejoined stiffly : ` This is great news indeed , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12151 len. 6]: There 's no denying it .
Parsing [sent. 12152 len. 47]: But I could have wished you had told it me before you got your fright tonight , and I could have wished you had ever asked me as your partner what we were to do , before you thought you were dividing a responsibility . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12153 len. 6]: -- Hear me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 12154 len. 4]: cried Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 12155 len. 9]: I knew you was a-going to say so .
Parsing [sent. 12156 len. 16]: But alone I bore the anxiety , and alone I 'll bear the blame ! '
Parsing [sent. 12157 len. 8]: This with an air of great magnanimity .
Parsing [sent. 12158 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12159 len. 11]: ` Let 's see this will and this box . '
Parsing [sent. 12160 len. 29]: ` Do I understand , brother , ' returned Wegg with considerable reluctance , ` that it is your wish to see this will and this -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 12161 len. 10]: Mr Venus smote the table with his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 12162 len. 6]: -- Hear me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 12163 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12164 len. 5]: ` Hear me out !
Parsing [sent. 12165 len. 8]: I 'll go and fetch 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 12166 len. 58]: After being some time absent , as if in his covetousness he could hardly make up his mind to produce the treasure to his partner , he returned with an old leathern hat-box , into which he had put the other box , for the better preservation of commonplace appearances , and for the disarming of suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 12167 len. 52]: ` But I do n't half like opening it here , ' said Silas in a low voice , looking around : ` he might come back , he may not be gone ; we do n't know what he may be up to , after what we 've seen . '
Parsing [sent. 12168 len. 11]: ` There 's something in that , ' assented Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12169 len. 7]: ` Come to my place . '
Parsing [sent. 12170 len. 22]: Jealous of the custody of the box , and yet fearful of opening it under the existing circumstances , Wegg hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 12171 len. 19]: ` Come , I tell you , ' repeated Venus , chafing , ` to my place . '
Parsing [sent. 12172 len. 24]: Not very well seeing his way to a refusal , Mr Wegg then rejoined in a gush , ' -- Hear me out !
Parsing [sent. 12173 len. 4]: -- Certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 12174 len. 24]: So he locked up the Bower and they set forth : Mr Venus taking his arm , and keeping it with remarkable tenacity .
Parsing [sent. 12175 len. 40]: They found the usual dim light burning in the window of Mr Venus 's establishment , imperfectly disclosing to the public the usual pair of preserved frogs , sword in hand , with their point of honour still unsettled .
Parsing [sent. 12176 len. 45]: Mr Venus had closed his shop door on coming out , and now opened it with the key and shut it again as soon as they were within ; but not before he had put up and barred the shutters of the shop window .
Parsing [sent. 12177 len. 28]: ` No one can get in without being let in , ' said he then , ` and we could n't be more snug than here . '
Parsing [sent. 12178 len. 27]: So he raked together the yet warm cinders in the rusty grate , and made a fire , and trimmed the candle on the little counter .
Parsing [sent. 12179 len. 71]: As the fire cast its flickering gleams here and there upon the dark greasy walls ; the Hindoo baby , the African baby , the articulated English baby , the assortment of skulls , and the rest of the collection , came starting to their various stations as if they had all been out , like their master and were punctual in a general rendezvous to assist at the secret .
Parsing [sent. 12180 len. 33]: The French gentleman had grown considerably since Mr Wegg last saw him , being now accommodated with a pair of legs and a head , though his arms were yet in abeyance .
Parsing [sent. 12181 len. 28]: To whomsoever the head had originally belonged , Silas Wegg would have regarded it as a personal favour if he had not cut quite so many teeth .
Parsing [sent. 12182 len. 39]: Silas took his seat in silence on the wooden box before the fire , and Venus dropping into his low chair produced from among his skeleton hands , his tea-tray and tea-cups , and put the kettle on .
Parsing [sent. 12183 len. 19]: Silas inwardly approved of these preparations , trusting they might end in Mr Venus 's diluting his intellect .
Parsing [sent. 12184 len. 16]: ` Now , sir , ' said Venus , ` all is safe and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 12185 len. 7]: Let us see this discovery . '
Parsing [sent. 12186 len. 49]: With still reluctant hands , and not without several glances towards the skeleton hands , as if he mistrusted that a couple of them might spring forth and clutch the document , Wegg opened the hat-box and revealed the cash-box , opened the cash-box and revealed the will .
Parsing [sent. 12187 len. 23]: He held a corner of it tight , while Venus , taking hold of another corner , searchingly and attentively read it .
Parsing [sent. 12188 len. 13]: ` Was I correct in my account of it , partner ? '
Parsing [sent. 12189 len. 6]: said Mr Wegg at length .
Parsing [sent. 12190 len. 11]: ` Partner , you were , ' said Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12191 len. 27]: Mr Wegg thereupon made an easy , graceful movement , as though he would fold it up ; but Mr Venus held on by his corner .
Parsing [sent. 12192 len. 19]: ` No , sir , ' said Mr Venus , winking his weak eyes and shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 12193 len. 5]: ` No , partner .
Parsing [sent. 12194 len. 16]: The question is now brought up , who is going to take care of this .
Parsing [sent. 12195 len. 16]: Do you know who is going to take care of this , partner ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12196 len. 7]: I am , ' said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12197 len. 11]: ` Oh dear no , partner , ' retorted Venus .
Parsing [sent. 12198 len. 6]: ` That 's a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 12199 len. 3]: I am .
Parsing [sent. 12200 len. 7]: Now look here , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12201 len. 26]: I do n't want to have any words with you , and still less do I want to have any anatomical pursuits with you . '
Parsing [sent. 12202 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 12203 len. 6]: said Wegg , quickly . '
Parsing [sent. 12204 len. 40]: I mean , partner , ' replied Venus , slowly , ` that it 's hardly possible for a man to feel in a more amiable state towards another man than I do towards you at this present moment .
Parsing [sent. 12205 len. 26]: But I am on my own ground , I am surrounded by the trophies of my art , and my tools is very handy . '
Parsing [sent. 12206 len. 10]: ` What do you mean , Mr Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 12207 len. 5]: asked Wegg again . '
Parsing [sent. 12208 len. 24]: I am surrounded , as I have observed , ' said Mr Venus , placidly , ` by the trophies of my art .
Parsing [sent. 12209 len. 33]: They are numerous , my stock of human warious is large , the shop is pretty well crammed , and I do n't just now want any more trophies of my art .
Parsing [sent. 12210 len. 16]: But I like my art , and I know how to exercise my art . '
Parsing [sent. 12211 len. 16]: ` No man better , ' assented Mr Wegg , with a somewhat staggered air .
Parsing [sent. 12212 len. 32]: ` There 's the Miscellanies of several human specimens , ' said Venus , ' -LRB- though you might n't think it -RRB- in the box on which you 're sitting .
Parsing [sent. 12213 len. 26]: There 's the Miscellanies of several human specimens , in the lovely compo-one behind the door ' ; with a nod towards the French gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 12214 len. 9]: ` It still wants a pair of arms .
Parsing [sent. 12215 len. 14]: I DO N'T say that I 'm in any hurry for 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 12216 len. 15]: ` You must be wandering in your mind , partner , ' Silas remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 12217 len. 22]: ` You 'll excuse me if I wander , ' returned Venus ; ' I am sometimes rather subject to it .
Parsing [sent. 12218 len. 26]: I like my art , and I know how to exercise my art , and I mean to have the keeping of this document . '
Parsing [sent. 12219 len. 15]: ` But what has that got to do with your art , partner ? '
Parsing [sent. 12220 len. 8]: asked Wegg , in an insinuating tone .
Parsing [sent. 12221 len. 38]: Mr Venus winked his chronically-fatigued eyes both at once , and adjusting the kettle on the fire , remarked to himself , in a hollow voice , ` She 'll bile in a couple of minutes . '
Parsing [sent. 12222 len. 55]: Silas Wegg glanced at the kettle , glanced at the shelves , glanced at the French gentleman behind the door , and shrank a little as he glanced at Mr Venus winking his red eyes , and feeling in his waistcoat pocket -- as for a lancet , say -- with his unoccupied hand .
Parsing [sent. 12223 len. 27]: He and Venus were necessarily seated close together , as each held a corner of the document , which was but a common sheet of paper .
Parsing [sent. 12224 len. 30]: ` Partner , ' said Wegg , even more insinuatingly than before , ' I propose that we cut it in half , and each keep a half . '
Parsing [sent. 12225 len. 22]: Venus shook his shock of hair , as he replied , ` It would n't do to mutilate it , partner .
Parsing [sent. 12226 len. 8]: It might seem to be cancelled . '
Parsing [sent. 12227 len. 37]: ` Partner , ' said Wegg , after a silence , during which they had contemplated one another , ` do n't your speaking countenance say that you 're a-going to suggest a middle course ? '
Parsing [sent. 12228 len. 22]: Venus shook his shock of hair as he replied , ` Partner , you have kept this paper from me once .
Parsing [sent. 12229 len. 9]: You shall never keep it from me again .
Parsing [sent. 12230 len. 23]: I offer you the box and the label to take care of , but I 'll take care of the paper . '
Parsing [sent. 12231 len. 30]: Silas hesitated a little longer , and then suddenly releasing his corner , and resuming his buoyant and benignant tone , exclaimed , ` What 's life without trustfulness !
Parsing [sent. 12232 len. 7]: What 's a fellow-man without honour !
Parsing [sent. 12233 len. 17]: You 're welcome to it , partner , in a spirit of trust and confidence . '
Parsing [sent. 12234 len. 47]: Continuing to wink his red eyes both together -- but in a selfcommuning way , and without any show of triumph -- Mr Venus folded the paper now left in his hand , and locked it in a drawer behind him , and pocketed the key .
Parsing [sent. 12235 len. 12]: He then proposed ' A cup of tea , partner ? '
Parsing [sent. 12236 len. 23]: To which Mr Wegg returned , ` Thank ` ee , partner , ' and the tea was made and poured out .
Parsing [sent. 12237 len. 38]: ` Next , ' said Venus , blowing at his tea in his saucer , and looking over it at his confidential friend , ` comes the question , What 's the course to be pursued ? '
Parsing [sent. 12238 len. 11]: On this head , Silas Wegg had much to say .
Parsing [sent. 12239 len. 65]: Silas had to say That , he would beg to remind his comrade , brother , and partner , of the impressive passages they had read that evening ; of the evident parallel in Mr Boffin 's mind between them and the late owner of the Bower , and the present circumstances of the Bower ; of the bottle ; and of the box .
Parsing [sent. 12240 len. 66]: That , the fortunes of his brother and comrade , and of himself were evidently made , inasmuch as they had but to put their price upon this document , and get that price from the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour : who now appeared to be less of a minion and more of a worm than had been previously supposed .
Parsing [sent. 12241 len. 27]: That , he considered it plain that such price was stateable in a single expressive word , and that the word was , ` Halves ! '
Parsing [sent. 12242 len. 11]: That , the question then arose when ` Halves ! '
Parsing [sent. 12243 len. 4]: should be called .
Parsing [sent. 12244 len. 17]: That , here he had a plan of action to recommend , with a conditional clause .
Parsing [sent. 12245 len. 121]: That , the plan of action was that they should lie by with patience ; that , they should allow the Mounds to be gradually levelled and cleared away , while retaining to themselves their present opportunity of watching the process -- which would be , he conceived , to put the trouble and cost of daily digging and delving upon somebody else , while they might nightly turn such complete disturbance of the dust to the account of their own private investigations -- and that , when the Mounds were gone , and they had worked those chances for their own joint benefit solely , they should then , and not before , explode on the minion and worm .
Parsing [sent. 12246 len. 24]: But here came the conditional clause , and to this he entreated the special attention of his comrade , brother , and partner .
Parsing [sent. 12247 len. 29]: It was not to be borne that the minion and worm should carry off any of that property which was now to be regarded as their own property .
Parsing [sent. 12248 len. 64]: When he , Mr Wegg , had seen the minion surreptitiously making off with that bottle , and its precious contents unknown , he had looked upon him in the light of a mere robber , and , as such , would have despoiled him of his ill-gotten gain , but for the judicious interference of his comrade , brother , and partner .
Parsing [sent. 12249 len. 114]: Therefore , the conditional clause he proposed was , that , if the minion should return in his late sneaking manner , and if , being closely watched , he should be found to possess himself of anything , no matter what , the sharp sword impending over his head should be instantly shown him , he should be strictly examined as to what he knew or suspected , should be severely handled by them his masters , and should be kept in a state of abject moral bondage and slavery until the time when they should see fit to permit him to purchase his freedom at the price of half his possessions .
Parsing [sent. 12250 len. 20]: If , said Mr Wegg by way of peroration , he had erred in saying only ` Halves ! '
Parsing [sent. 12251 len. 24]: he trusted to his comrade , brother , and partner not to hesitate to set him right , and to reprove his weakness .
Parsing [sent. 12252 len. 30]: It might be more according to the rights of things , to say Two-thirds ; it might be more according to the rights of things , to say Three-fourths .
Parsing [sent. 12253 len. 10]: On those points he was ever open to correction .
Parsing [sent. 12254 len. 25]: Mr Venus , having wafted his attention to this discourse over three successive saucers of tea , signified his concurrence in the views advanced .
Parsing [sent. 12255 len. 21]: Inspirited hereby , Mr Wegg extended his right hand , and declared it to be a hand which never yet .
Parsing [sent. 12256 len. 7]: Without entering into more minute particulars .
Parsing [sent. 12257 len. 28]: Mr Venus , sticking to his tea , briefly professed his beliet as polite forms required of him , that it WAS a hand which never yet .
Parsing [sent. 12258 len. 17]: But contented himself with looking at it , and did not take it to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 12259 len. 23]: ` Brother , ' said Wegg , when this happy understanding was established , ' I should like to ask you something .
Parsing [sent. 12260 len. 22]: You remember the night when I first looked in here , and found you floating your powerful mind in tea ? '
Parsing [sent. 12261 len. 9]: Still swilling tea , Mr Venus nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 12262 len. 27]: ` And there you sit , sir , ' pursued Wegg with an air of thoughtful admiration , ` as if you had never left off !
Parsing [sent. 12263 len. 19]: There you sit , sir , as if you had an unlimited capacity of assimilating the flagrant article !
Parsing [sent. 12264 len. 33]: There you sit , sir , in the midst of your works , looking as if you 'd been called upon for Home , Sweet Home , and was obleeging the company !
Parsing [sent. 12265 len. 46]: `` A exile from home splendour dazzles in vain , O give you your lowly Preparations again , The birds stuffed so sweetly that ca n't be expected to come at your call , Give you these with the peace of mind dearer than all .
Parsing [sent. 12266 len. 10]: Home , Home , Home , sweet Home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12267 len. 34]: -- Be it ever , ' added Mr Wegg in prose as he glanced about the shop , ` ever so ghastly , all things considered there 's no place like it . '
Parsing [sent. 12268 len. 26]: ` You said you 'd like to ask something ; but you have n't asked it , ' remarked Venus , very unsympathetic in manner .
Parsing [sent. 12269 len. 26]: ` Your peace of mind , ' said Wegg , offering condolence , ` your peace of mind was in a poor way that night .
Parsing [sent. 12270 len. 6]: HOW 'S it going on ?
Parsing [sent. 12271 len. 8]: IS it looking up at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 12272 len. 37]: ` She does not wish , ' replied Mr Venus with a comical mixture of indignant obstinacy and tender melancholy , ` to regard herself , nor yet to be regarded , in that particular light .
Parsing [sent. 12273 len. 9]: There 's no more to be said . '
Parsing [sent. 12274 len. 10]: ` Ah , dear me , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12275 len. 25]: exclaimed Wegg with a sigh , but eyeing him while pretending to keep him company in eyeing the fire , ` such is Woman !
Parsing [sent. 12276 len. 39]: And I remember you said that night , sitting there as I sat here -- said that night when your peace of mind was first laid low , that you had taken an interest in these very affairs .
Parsing [sent. 12277 len. 5]: Such is coincidence ! '
Parsing [sent. 12278 len. 26]: ` Her father , ' rejoined Venus , and then stopped to swallow more tea , ` her father was mixed up in them . '
Parsing [sent. 12279 len. 14]: ` You did n't mention her name , sir , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 12280 len. 5]: observed Wegg , pensively .
Parsing [sent. 12281 len. 13]: ` No , you did n't mention her name that night . '
Parsing [sent. 12282 len. 5]: ` Pleasant Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 12283 len. 6]: ` In -- deed ! '
Parsing [sent. 12284 len. 3]: cried Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12285 len. 4]: ` Pleasant Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 12286 len. 8]: There 's something moving in the name .
Parsing [sent. 12287 len. 2]: Pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 12288 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 12289 len. 31]: Seems to express what she might have been , if she had n't made that unpleasant remark -- and what she ai n't , in consequence of having made it .
Parsing [sent. 12290 len. 24]: Would it at all pour balm into your wounds , Mr Venus , to inquire how you came acquainted with her ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12291 len. 35]: I was down at the water-side , ' said Venus , taking another gulp of tea and mournfully winking at the fire -- ` looking for parrots ' -- taking another gulp and stopping .
Parsing [sent. 12292 len. 26]: Mr Wegg hinted , to jog his attention : ` You could hardly have been out parrot-shooting , in the British climate , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12293 len. 13]: ` No , no , no , ' said Venus fretfully . '
Parsing [sent. 12294 len. 21]: I was down at the water-side , looking for parrots brought home by sailors , to buy for stuffing . '
Parsing [sent. 12295 len. 11]: ` Ay , ay , ay , sir ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12296 len. 30]: -- And looking for a nice pair of rattlesnakes , to articulate for a Museum -- when I was doomed to fall in with her and deal with her .
Parsing [sent. 12297 len. 13]: It was just at the time of that discovery in the river .
Parsing [sent. 12298 len. 12]: Her father had seen the discovery being towed in the river .
Parsing [sent. 12299 len. 28]: I made the popularity of the subject a reason for going back to improve the acquaintance , and I have never since been the man I was .
Parsing [sent. 12300 len. 11]: My very bones is rendered flabby by brooding over it .
Parsing [sent. 12301 len. 24]: If they could be brought to me loose , to sort , I should hardly have the face to claim 'em as mine .
Parsing [sent. 12302 len. 12]: To such an extent have I fallen off under it . '
Parsing [sent. 12303 len. 19]: Mr Wegg , less interested than he had been , glanced at one particular shelf in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 12304 len. 59]: ` Why I remember , Mr Venus , ' he said in a tone of friendly commiseration ' -LRB- for I remember every word that falls from you , sir -RRB- , I remember that you said that night , you had got up there -- and then your words was , `` Never mind . '' ' '
Parsing [sent. 12305 len. 23]: -- The parrot that I bought of her , ' said Venus , with a despondent rise and fall of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12306 len. 22]: ` Yes ; there it lies on its side , dried up ; except for its plumage , very like myself .
Parsing [sent. 12307 len. 18]: I 've never had the heart to prepare it , and I never shall have now . '
Parsing [sent. 12308 len. 62]: With a disappointed face , Silas mentally consigned this parrot to regions more than tropical , and , seeming for the time to have lost his power of assuming an interest in the woes of Mr Venus , fell to tightening his wooden leg as a preparation for departure : its gymnastic performances of that evening having severely tried its constitution .
Parsing [sent. 12309 len. 46]: After Silas had left the shop , hat-box in hand , and had left Mr Venus to lower himself to oblivion-point with the requisite weight of tea , it greatly preyed on his ingenuous mind that he had taken this artist into partnership at all .
Parsing [sent. 12310 len. 32]: He bitterly felt that he had overreached himself in the beginning , by grasping at Mr Venus 's mere straws of hints , now shown to be worthless for his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12311 len. 54]: Casting about for ways and means of dissolving the connexion without loss of money , reproaching himself for having been betrayed into an avowal of his secret , and complimenting himself beyond measure on his purely accidental good luck , he beguiled the distance between Clerkenwell and the mansion of the Golden Dustman .
Parsing [sent. 12312 len. 42]: For , Silas Wegg felt it to be quite out of the question that he could lay his head upon his pillow in peace , without first hovering over Mr Boffin 's house in the superior character of its Evil Genius .
Parsing [sent. 12313 len. 62]: Power -LRB- unless it be the power of intellect or virtue -RRB- has ever the greatest attraction for the lowest natures ; and the mere defiance of the unconscious house-front , with his power to strip the roof off the inhabiting family like the roof of a house of cards , was a treat which had a charm for Silas Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12314 len. 18]: As he hovered on the opposite side of the street , exulting , the carriage drove up .
Parsing [sent. 12315 len. 20]: ` There 'll shortly be an end of YOU , ' said Wegg , threatening it with the hat-box .
Parsing [sent. 12316 len. 7]: ` YOUR varnish is fading . '
Parsing [sent. 12317 len. 7]: Mrs Boffin descended and went in .
Parsing [sent. 12318 len. 15]: ` Look out for a fall , my Lady Dustwoman , ' said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12319 len. 10]: Bella lightly descended , and ran in after her .
Parsing [sent. 12320 len. 7]: ` How brisk we are ! '
Parsing [sent. 12321 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12322 len. 16]: ` You wo n't run so gaily to your old shabby home , my girl .
Parsing [sent. 12323 len. 10]: You 'll have to go there , though . '
Parsing [sent. 12324 len. 11]: A little while , and the Secretary came out . '
Parsing [sent. 12325 len. 11]: I was passed over for you , ' said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12326 len. 15]: ` But you had better provide yourself with another situation , young man . '
Parsing [sent. 12327 len. 27]: Mr Boffin 's shadow passed upon the blinds of three large windows as he trotted down the room , and passed again as he went back .
Parsing [sent. 12328 len. 3]: ` Yoop !
Parsing [sent. 12329 len. 4]: ` cried Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 12330 len. 8]: ` You 're there , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 12331 len. 5]: Where 's the bottle ?
Parsing [sent. 12332 len. 12]: You would give your bottle for my box , Dustman ! '
Parsing [sent. 12333 len. 12]: Having now composed his mind for slumber , he turned homeward .
Parsing [sent. 12334 len. 29]: Such was the greed of the fellow , that his mind had shot beyond halves , two-thirds , three-fourths , and gone straight to spoliation of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 12335 len. 19]: ` Though that would n't quite do , ' he considered , growing cooler as he got away .
Parsing [sent. 12336 len. 16]: ` That 's what would happen to him if he did n't buy us up .
Parsing [sent. 12337 len. 8]: We should get nothing by that . '
Parsing [sent. 12338 len. 36]: We so judge others by ourselves , that it had never come into his head before , that he might not buy us up , and might prove honest , and prefer to be poor .
Parsing [sent. 12339 len. 24]: It caused him a slight tremor as it passed ; but a very slight one , for the idle thought was gone directly .
Parsing [sent. 12340 len. 25]: ` He 's grown too fond of money for that , ' said Wegg ; ` he 's grown too fond of money . '
Parsing [sent. 12341 len. 15]: The burden fell into a strain or tune as he stumped along the pavements .
Parsing [sent. 12342 len. 46]: All the way home he stumped it out of the rattling streets , PIANO with his own foot , and FORTE with his wooden leg , ` He 's GROWN too FOND of MONEY for THAT , he 's GROWN too FOND of MONEY . '
Parsing [sent. 12343 len. 43]: Even next day Silas soothed himself with this melodious strain , when he was called out of bed at daybreak , to set open the yardgate and admit the train of carts and horses that came to carry off the little Mound .
Parsing [sent. 12344 len. 82]: And all day long , as he kept unwinking watch on the slow process which promised to protract itself through many days and weeks , whenever -LRB- to save himself from being choked with dust -RRB- he patrolled a little cinderous beat he established for the purpose , without taking his eyes from the diggers , he still stumped to the tune : He 's GROWN too FOND of MONEY for THAT , he 's GROWN too FOND of MONEY . '
Parsing [sent. 12345 len. 53]: Chapter 8 THE END OF A LONG JOURNEY The train of carts and horses came and went all day from dawn to nightfall , making little or no daily impression on the heap of ashes , though , as the days passed on , the heap was seen to be slowly melting .
Parsing [sent. 12346 len. 72]: My lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , when you in the course of your dust-shovelling and cinder-raking have piled up a mountain of pretentious failure , you must off with your honourable coats for the removal of it , and fall to the work with the power of all the queen 's horses and all the queen 's men , or it will come rushing down and bury us alive .
Parsing [sent. 12347 len. 28]: Yes , verily , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , adapting your Catechism to the occasion , and by God 's help so you must .
Parsing [sent. 12348 len. 61]: For when we have got things to the pass that with an enormous treasure at disposal to relieve the poor , the best of the poor detest our mercies , hide their heads from us , and shame us by starving to death in the midst of us , it is a pass impossible of prosperity , impossible of continuance .
Parsing [sent. 12349 len. 70]: It may not be so wrirten in the Gospel according to Podsnappery ; you may not ` find these words ' for the text of a sermon , in the Returns of the Board of Trade ; but they have been the truth since the foundations of the universe were laid , and they will be the truth until the foundations of the universe are shaken by the Builder .
Parsing [sent. 12350 len. 51]: This boastful handiwork of ours , which fails in its terrors for the professional pauper , the sturdy breaker of windows and the rampant tearer of clothes , strikes with a cruel and a wicked stab at the stricken sufferer , and is a horror to the deserving and unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 12351 len. 26]: We must mend it , lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , or in its own evil hour it will mar every one of us .
Parsing [sent. 12352 len. 28]: Old Betty Higden fared upon her pilgrimage as many ruggedly honest creatures , women and men , fare on their toiling way along the roads of life .
Parsing [sent. 12353 len. 25]: Patiently to earn a spare bare living , and quietly to die , untouched by workhouse hands -- this was her highest sublunary hope .
Parsing [sent. 12354 len. 16]: Nothing had been heard of her at Mr Boffin 's house since she trudged off .
Parsing [sent. 12355 len. 18]: The weather had been hard and the roads had been bad , and her spirit was up .
Parsing [sent. 12356 len. 51]: A less stanch spirit might have been subdued by such adverse influences ; but the loan for her little outfit was in no part repaid , and it had gone worse with her than she had foreseen , and she was put upon proving her case and maintaining her independence .
Parsing [sent. 12357 len. 3]: Faithful soul !
Parsing [sent. 12358 len. 28]: When she had spoken to the Secretary of that ` deadness that steals over me at times ' , her fortitude had made too little of it .
Parsing [sent. 12359 len. 23]: Oftener and ever oftener , it came stealing over her ; darker and ever darker , like the shadow of advancing Death .
Parsing [sent. 12360 len. 43]: That the shadow should be deep as it came on , like the shadow of an actual presence , was in accordance with the laws of the physical world , for all the Light that shone on Betty Higden lay beyond Death .
Parsing [sent. 12361 len. 41]: The poor old creature had taken the upward course of the river Thames as her general track ; it was the track in which her last home lay , and of which she had last had local love and knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 12362 len. 29]: She had hovered for a little while in the near neighbourhood of her abandoned dwelling , and had sold , and knitted and sold , and gone on .
Parsing [sent. 12363 len. 33]: In the pleasant towns of Chertsey , Walton , Kingston , and Staines , her figure came to be quite well known for some short weeks , and then again passed on .
Parsing [sent. 12364 len. 75]: She would take her stand in market-places , where there were such things , on market days ; at other times , in the busiest -LRB- that was seldom very busy -RRB- portion of the little quiet High Street ; at still other times she would explore the outlying roads for great houses , and would ask leave at the Lodge to pass in with her basket , and would not often get it .
Parsing [sent. 12365 len. 26]: But ladies in carriages would frequently make purchases from her trifling stock , and were usually pleased with her bright eyes and her hopeful speech .
Parsing [sent. 12366 len. 29]: In these and her clean dress originated a fable that she was well to do in the world : one might say , for her station , rich .
Parsing [sent. 12367 len. 22]: As making a comfortable provision for its subject which costs nobody anything , this class of fable has long been popular .
Parsing [sent. 12368 len. 85]: In those pleasant little towns on Thames , you may hear the fall of the water over the weirs , or even , in still weather , the rustle of the rushes ; and from the bridge you may see the young river , dimpled like a young child , playfully gliding away among the trees , unpolluted by the defilements that lie in wait for it on its course , and as yet out of hearing of the deep summons of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 12369 len. 37]: It were too much to pretend that Betty Higden made out such thoughts ; no ; but she heard the tender river whispering to many like herself , ` Come to me , come to me !
Parsing [sent. 12370 len. 21]: When the cruel shame and terror you have so long fled from , most beset you , come to me !
Parsing [sent. 12371 len. 26]: I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work ; I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it .
Parsing [sent. 12372 len. 20]: My breast is softer than the pauper-nurse 's ; death in my arms is peacefuller than among the pauper-wards .
Parsing [sent. 12373 len. 5]: Come to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12374 len. 14]: There was abundant place for gentler fancies too , in her untutored mind .
Parsing [sent. 12375 len. 32]: Those gentlefolks and their children inside those fine houses , could they think , as they looked out at her , what it was to be really hungry , really cold ?
Parsing [sent. 12376 len. 16]: Did they feel any of the wonder about her , that she felt about them ?
Parsing [sent. 12377 len. 6]: Bless the dear laughing children !
Parsing [sent. 12378 len. 18]: If they could have seen sick Johnny in her arms , would they have cried for pity ?
Parsing [sent. 12379 len. 18]: If they could have seen dead Johnny on that little bed , would they have understood it ?
Parsing [sent. 12380 len. 10]: Bless the dear children for his sake , anyhow !
Parsing [sent. 12381 len. 23]: So with the humbler houses in the little street , the inner firelight shining on the panes as the outer twilight darkened .
Parsing [sent. 12382 len. 37]: When the families gathered in-doors there , for the night , it was only a foolish fancy to feel as if it were a little hard in them to close the shutter and blacken the flame .
Parsing [sent. 12383 len. 66]: So with the lighted shops , and speculations whether their masters and mistresses taking tea in a perspective of back-parlour -- not so far within but that the flavour of tea and toast came out , mingled with the glow of light , into the street -- ate or drank or wore what they sold , with the greater relish because they dealt in it .
Parsing [sent. 12384 len. 17]: So with the churchyard on a branch of the solitary way to the night 's sleepingplace .
Parsing [sent. 12385 len. 4]: ` Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 12386 len. 20]: The dead and I seem to have it pretty much to ourselves in the dark and in this weather !
Parsing [sent. 12387 len. 15]: But so much the better for all who are warmly housed at home . '
Parsing [sent. 12388 len. 15]: The poor soul envied no one in bitterness , and grudged no one anything .
Parsing [sent. 12389 len. 27]: But , the old abhorrence grew stronger on her as she grew weaker , and it found more sustaining food than she did in her wanderings .
Parsing [sent. 12390 len. 76]: Now , she would light upon the shameful spectacle of some desolate creature -- or some wretched ragged groups of either sex , or of both sexes , with children among them , huddled together like the smaller vermin for a little warmth -- lingering and lingering on a doorstep , while the appointed evader of the public trust did his dirty office of trying to weary them out and so get rid of them .
Parsing [sent. 12391 len. 93]: Now , she would light upon some poor decent person , like herself , going afoot on a pilgrimage of many weary miles to see some worn-out relative or friend who had been charitably clutched off to a great blank barren Union House , as far from old home as the County Jail -LRB- the remoteness of which is always its worst punishment for small rural offenders -RRB- , and in its dietary , and in its lodging , and in its tending of the sick , a much more penal establishment .
Parsing [sent. 12392 len. 59]: Sometimes she would hear a newspaper read out , and would learn how the Registrar General cast up the units that had within the last week died of want and of exposure to the weather : for which that Recording Angel seemed to have a regular fixed place in his sum , as if they were its halfpence .
Parsing [sent. 12393 len. 42]: All such things she would hear discussed , as we , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , in our unapproachable magnificence never hear them , and from all such things she would fly with the wings of raging Despair .
Parsing [sent. 12394 len. 12]: This is not to be received as a figure of speech .
Parsing [sent. 12395 len. 28]: Old Betty Higden however tired , however footsore , would start up and be driven away by her awakened horror of falling into the hands of Charity .
Parsing [sent. 12396 len. 38]: It is a remarkable Christian improvement , to have made a pursuing Fury of the Good Samaritan ; but it was so in this case , and it is a type of many , many , many .
Parsing [sent. 12397 len. 39]: Two incidents united to intensify the old unreasoning abhorrence -- granted in a previous place to be unreasoning , because the people always are unreasoning , and invaRiahly make a point of producing all their smoke without fire .
Parsing [sent. 12398 len. 69]: One day she was sitting in a market-place on a bench outside an inn , with her little wares for sale , when the deadness that she strove against came over her so heavily that the scene departed from before her eyes ; when it returned , she found herself on the ground , her head supported by some good-natured market-women , and a little crowd about her .
Parsing [sent. 12399 len. 9]: ` Are you better now , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 12400 len. 6]: asked one of the women .
Parsing [sent. 12401 len. 11]: ` Do you think you can do nicely now ? '
Parsing [sent. 12402 len. 8]: ` Have I been ill then ? '
Parsing [sent. 12403 len. 4]: asked old Betty .
Parsing [sent. 12404 len. 18]: ` You have had a faint like , ' was the answer , ` or a fit .
Parsing [sent. 12405 len. 20]: It ai n't that you 've been a-struggling , mother , but you 've been stiff and numbed . '
Parsing [sent. 12406 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 12407 len. 7]: said Betty , recovering her memory .
Parsing [sent. 12408 len. 6]: ` It 's the numbness .
Parsing [sent. 12409 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12410 len. 8]: It comes over me at times . '
Parsing [sent. 12411 len. 4]: Was it gone ?
Parsing [sent. 12412 len. 5]: the women asked her .
Parsing [sent. 12413 len. 11]: ` It 's gone now , ' said Betty . '
Parsing [sent. 12414 len. 9]: I shall be stronger than I was afore .
Parsing [sent. 12415 len. 29]: Many thanks to ye , my dears , and when you come to be as old as I am , may others do as much for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12416 len. 26]: They assisted her to rise , but she could not stand yet , and they supported her when she sat down again upon the bench .
Parsing [sent. 12417 len. 36]: ` My head 's a bit light , and my feet are a bit heavy , ' said old Betty , leaning her face drowsily on the breast of the woman who had spoken before .
Parsing [sent. 12418 len. 12]: ` They 'll both come nat ` ral in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 12419 len. 8]: There 's nothing more the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 12420 len. 26]: ` Ask her , ' said some farmers standing by , who had come out from their market-dinner , ` who belongs to her . '
Parsing [sent. 12421 len. 12]: ` Are there any folks belonging to you , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 12422 len. 4]: said the woman .
Parsing [sent. 12423 len. 9]: ` Yes sure , ' answered Betty . '
Parsing [sent. 12424 len. 15]: I heerd the gentleman say it , but I could n't answer quick enough .
Parsing [sent. 12425 len. 7]: There 's plenty belonging to me .
Parsing [sent. 12426 len. 11]: Do n't ye fear for me , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 12427 len. 9]: ` But are any of 'em near here ?
Parsing [sent. 12428 len. 23]: ` said the men 's voices ; the women 's voices chiming in when it was said , and prolonging the strain .
Parsing [sent. 12429 len. 12]: ` Quite near enough , ' said Betty , rousing herself .
Parsing [sent. 12430 len. 12]: ` Do n't ye be afeard for me , neighbours . '
Parsing [sent. 12431 len. 9]: ` But you are not fit to travel .
Parsing [sent. 12432 len. 6]: Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 12433 len. 8]: was the next compassionate chorus she heard .
Parsing [sent. 12434 len. 22]: ` I 'm a going to London when I 've sold out all , ' said Betty , rising with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 12435 len. 9]: ` I 've right good friends in London .
Parsing [sent. 12436 len. 5]: I want for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 12437 len. 7]: I shall come to no harm .
Parsing [sent. 12438 len. 2]: Thankye .
Parsing [sent. 12439 len. 9]: Do n't ye be afeard for me . '
Parsing [sent. 12440 len. 34]: A well-meaning bystander , yellow-legginged and purple-faced , said hoarsely over his red comforter , as she rose to her feet , that she ` ought n't to be let to go ' .
Parsing [sent. 12441 len. 13]: ` For the Lord 's love do n't meddle with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12442 len. 12]: cried old Betty , all her fears crowding on her . '
Parsing [sent. 12443 len. 14]: I am quite well now , and I must go this minute . '
Parsing [sent. 12444 len. 43]: She caught up her basket as she spoke and was making an unsteady rush away from them , when the same bystander checked her with his hand on her sleeve , and urged her to come with him and see the parish-doctor .
Parsing [sent. 12445 len. 26]: Strengthening herself by the utmost exercise of her resolution , the poor trembling creature shook him off , almost fiercely , and took to flight .
Parsing [sent. 12446 len. 39]: Nor did she feel safe until she had set a mile or two of by-road between herself and the marketplace , and had crept into a copse , like a hunted animal , to hide and recover breath .
Parsing [sent. 12447 len. 66]: Not until then for the first time did she venture to recall how she had looked over her shoulder before turning out of the town , and had seen the sign of the White Lion hanging across the road , and the fluttering market booths , and the old grey church , and the little crowd gazing after her but not attempting to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 12448 len. 7]: The second frightening incident was this .
Parsing [sent. 12449 len. 54]: She had been again as bad , and had been for some days better , and was travelling along by a part of the road where it touched the river , and in wet seasons was so often overflowed by it that there were tall white posts set up to mark the way .
Parsing [sent. 12450 len. 21]: A barge was being towed towards her , and she sat down on the bank to rest and watch it .
Parsing [sent. 12451 len. 87]: As the tow-rope was slackened by a turn of the stream and dipped into the water , such a confusion stole into her mind that she thought she saw the forms of her dead children and dead grandchildren peopling the barge , and waving their hands to her in solemn measure ; then , as the rope tightened and came up , dropping diamonds , it seemed to vibrate into two parallel ropes and strike her , with a twang , though it was far off .
Parsing [sent. 12452 len. 33]: When she looked again , there was no barge , no river , no daylight , and a man whom she had never before seen held a candle close to her face .
Parsing [sent. 12453 len. 23]: ` Now , Missis , ' said he ; ` where did you come from and where are you going to ? '
Parsing [sent. 12454 len. 12]: The poor soul confusedly asked the counter-question where she was ? '
Parsing [sent. 12455 len. 10]: I am the Lock , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 12456 len. 6]: ` The Lock ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12457 len. 15]: I am the Deputy Lock , on job , and this is the Lock-house .
Parsing [sent. 12458 len. 23]: -LRB- Lock or Deputy Lock , it 's all one , while the t ` other man 's in the hospital . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12459 len. 6]: What 's your Parish ? '
Parsing [sent. 12460 len. 4]: ` Parish ! '
Parsing [sent. 12461 len. 23]: She was up from the truckle-bed directly , wildly feeling about her for her basket , and gazing at him in affright .
Parsing [sent. 12462 len. 15]: ` You 'll be asked the question down town , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 12463 len. 13]: ` They wo n't let you be more than a Casual there .
Parsing [sent. 12464 len. 15]: They 'll pass you on to your settlement , Missis , with all speed .
Parsing [sent. 12465 len. 21]: You 're not in a state to be let come upon strange parishes ` ceptin as a Casual . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 12466 len. 6]: Twas the deadness again ! '
Parsing [sent. 12467 len. 11]: murmured Betty Higden , with her hand to her head .
Parsing [sent. 12468 len. 20]: ` It was the deadness , there 's not a doubt about it , ' returned the man . '
Parsing [sent. 12469 len. 26]: I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for it , if it had been named to me when we brought you in .
Parsing [sent. 12470 len. 9]: Have you got any friends , Missis ? '
Parsing [sent. 12471 len. 10]: ` The best of friends , Master . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12472 len. 24]: I should recommend your looking 'em up if you consider 'em game to do anything for you , ' said the Deputy Lock .
Parsing [sent. 12473 len. 8]: ` Have you got any money ? '
Parsing [sent. 12474 len. 10]: ` Just a morsel of money , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12475 len. 9]: ` Do you want to keep it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12476 len. 6]: ` Sure I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 12477 len. 58]: ` Well , you know , ' said the Deputy Lock , shrugging his shoulders with his hands in his pockets , and shaking his head in a sulkily ominous manner , ` the parish authorities down town will have it out of you , if you go on , you may take your Alfred David . '
Parsing [sent. 12478 len. 9]: ` Then I 'll not go on . '
Parsing [sent. 12479 len. 37]: ` They 'll make you pay , as fur as your money will go , ' pursued the Deputy , ` for your relief as a Casual and for your being passed to your Parish . '
Parsing [sent. 12480 len. 22]: ` Thank ye kindly , Master , for your warning , thank ye for your shelter , and good night . '
Parsing [sent. 12481 len. 18]: ` Stop a bit , ' said the Deputy , striking in between her and the door .
Parsing [sent. 12482 len. 18]: ` Why are you all of a shake , and what 's your hurry , Missis ? '
Parsing [sent. 12483 len. 38]: ` Oh , Master , Master , ' returned Betty Higden , I 've fought against the Parish and fled from it , all my life , and I want to die free of it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12484 len. 22]: I do n't know , ' said the Deputy , with deliberation , ` as I ought to let you go .
Parsing [sent. 12485 len. 27]: I 'm a honest man as gets my living by the sweat of my brow , and I may fall into trouble by letting you go .
Parsing [sent. 12486 len. 25]: I 've fell into trouble afore now , by George , and I know what it is , and it 's made me careful .
Parsing [sent. 12487 len. 55]: You might be took with your deadness again , half a mile off -- or half of half a quarter , for the matter of that -- and then it would be asked , Why did that there honest Deputy Lock , let her go , instead of putting her safe with the Parish ?
Parsing [sent. 12488 len. 47]: That 's what a man of his character ought to have done , it would be argueyfied , ' said the Deputy Lock , cunningly harping on the strong string of her terror ; ` he ought to have handed her over safe to the Parish .
Parsing [sent. 12489 len. 13]: That was to be expected of a man of his merits . '
Parsing [sent. 12490 len. 33]: As he stood in the doorway , the poor old careworn wayworn woman burst into tears , and clasped her hands , as if in a very agony she prayed to him .
Parsing [sent. 12491 len. 16]: ` As I 've told you , Master , I 've the best of friends .
Parsing [sent. 12492 len. 18]: This letter will show how true I spoke , and they will be thankful for me . '
Parsing [sent. 12493 len. 21]: The Deputy Lock opened the letter with a grave face , which underwent no change as he eyed its contents .
Parsing [sent. 12494 len. 13]: But it might have done , if he could have read them .
Parsing [sent. 12495 len. 33]: ` What amount of small change , Missis , ' he said , with an abstracted air , after a little meditation , ` might you call a morsel of money ? '
Parsing [sent. 12496 len. 26]: Hurriedly emptying her pocket , old Betty laid down on the table , a shilling , and two sixpenny pieces , and a few pence .
Parsing [sent. 12497 len. 46]: ` If I was to let you go instead of handing you over safe to the Parish , ' said the Deputy , counting the money with his eyes , ` might it be your own free wish to leave that there behind you ? '
Parsing [sent. 12498 len. 15]: ` Take it , Master , take it , and welcome and thankful ! '
Parsing [sent. 12499 len. 78]: ` I 'm a man , ' said the Deputy , giving her back the letter , and pocketing the coins , one by one , ` as earns his living by the sweat of his brow ; ' here he drew his sleeve across his forehead , as if this particular portion of his humble gains were the result of sheer hard labour and virtuous industry ; ` and I wo n't stand in your way .
Parsing [sent. 12500 len. 6]: Go where you like . '
Parsing [sent. 12501 len. 26]: She was gone out of the Lock-house as soon as he gave her this permission , and her tottering steps were on the road again .
Parsing [sent. 12502 len. 70]: But , afraid to go back and afraid to go forward ; seeing what she fled from , in the sky-glare of the lights of the little town before her , and leaving a confused horror of it everywhere behind her , as if she had escaped it in every stone of every market-place ; she struck off by side ways , among which she got bewildered and lost .
Parsing [sent. 12503 len. 63]: That night she took refuge from the Samaritan in his latest accredited form , under a farmer 's rick ; and if -- worth thinking of , perhaps , my fellow-Christians -- the Samaritan had in the lonely night , ` passed by on the other side ' , she would have most devoutly thanked High Heaven for her escape from him .
Parsing [sent. 12504 len. 28]: The morning found her afoot again , but fast declining as to the clearness of her thoughts , though not as to the steadiness of her purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12505 len. 39]: Comprehending that her strength was quitting her , and that the struggle of her life was almost ended , she could neither reason out the means of getting back to her protectors , nor even form the idea .
Parsing [sent. 12506 len. 28]: The overmastering dread , and the proud stubborn resolution it engendered in her to die undegraded , were the two distinct impressions left in her failing mind .
Parsing [sent. 12507 len. 20]: Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering in her life-long fight , she went on .
Parsing [sent. 12508 len. 20]: The time was come , now , when the wants of this little life were passing away from her .
Parsing [sent. 12509 len. 20]: She could not have swallowed food , though a table had been spread for her in the next field .
Parsing [sent. 12510 len. 13]: The day was cold and wet , but she scarcely knew it .
Parsing [sent. 12511 len. 35]: She crept on , poor soul , like a criminal afraid of being taken , and felt little beyond the terror of falling down while it was yet daylight , and being found alive .
Parsing [sent. 12512 len. 12]: She had no fear that she would live through another night .
Parsing [sent. 12513 len. 19]: Sewn in the breast of her gown , the money to pay for her burial was still intact .
Parsing [sent. 12514 len. 25]: If she could wear through the day , and then lie down to die under cover of the darkness , she would die independent .
Parsing [sent. 12515 len. 33]: If she were captured previously , the money would be taken from her as a pauper who had no right to it , and she would be carried to the accursed workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 12516 len. 73]: Gaining her end , the letter would be found in her breast , along with the money , and the gentlefolks would say when it was given back to them , ` She prized it , did old Betty Higden ; she was true to it ; and while she lived , she would never let it be disgraced by falling into the hands of those that she held in horror . '
Parsing [sent. 12517 len. 62]: Most illogical , inconsequential , and lightheaded , this ; but travellers in the valley of the shadow of death are apt to be light-headed ; and worn-out old people of low estate have a trick of reasoning as indifferently as they live , and doubtless would appreciate our Poor Law more philosophically on an income of ten thousand a year .
Parsing [sent. 12518 len. 27]: So , keeping to byways , and shunning human approach , this troublesome old woman hid herself , and fared on all through the dreary day .
Parsing [sent. 12519 len. 53]: Yet so unlike was she to vagrant hiders in general , that sometimes , as the day advanced , there was a bright fire in her eyes , and a quicker beating at her feeble heart , as though she said exultingly , ` The Lord will see me through it ! '
Parsing [sent. 12520 len. 84]: By what visionary hands she was led along upon that journey of escape from the Samaritan ; by what voices , hushed in the grave , she seemed to be addressed ; how she fancied the dead child in her arms again , and times innumerable adjusted her shawl to keep it warm ; what infinite variety of forms of tower and roof and steeple the trees took ; how many furious horsemen rode at her , crying , ` There she goes !
Parsing [sent. 12521 len. 2]: Stop !
Parsing [sent. 12522 len. 6]: Stop , Betty Higden ! '
Parsing [sent. 12523 len. 14]: and melted away as they came close ; be these things left untold .
Parsing [sent. 12524 len. 40]: Faring on and hiding , hiding and faring on , the poor harmless creature , as though she were a Murderess and the whole country were up after her , wore out the day , and gained the night .
Parsing [sent. 12525 len. 36]: ` Water-meadows , or such like , ' she had sometimes murmured , on the day 's pilgrimage , when she had raised her head and taken any note of the real objects about her .
Parsing [sent. 12526 len. 16]: There now arose in the darkness , a great building , full of lighted windows .
Parsing [sent. 12527 len. 25]: Smoke was issuing from a high chimney in the rear of it , and there was the sound of a water-wheel at the side .
Parsing [sent. 12528 len. 32]: Between her and the building , lay a piece of water , in which the lighted windows were reflected , and on its nearest margin was a plantation of trees . '
Parsing [sent. 12529 len. 32]: I humbly thank the Power and the Glory , ' said Betty Higden , holding up her withered hands , ` that I have come to my journey 's end ! '
Parsing [sent. 12530 len. 38]: She crept among the trees to the trunk of a tree whence she could see , beyond some intervening trees and branches , the lighted windows , both in their reality and their reflection in the water .
Parsing [sent. 12531 len. 22]: She placed her orderly little basket at her side , and sank upon the ground , supporting herself against the tree .
Parsing [sent. 12532 len. 22]: It brought to her mind the foot of the Cross , and she committed herself to Him who died upon it .
Parsing [sent. 12533 len. 29]: Her strength held out to enable her to arrange the letter in her breast , so as that it could be seen that she had a paper there .
Parsing [sent. 12534 len. 16]: It had held out for this , and it departed when this was done . '
Parsing [sent. 12535 len. 12]: I am safe here , ' was her last benumbed thought .
Parsing [sent. 12536 len. 35]: ` When I am found dead at the foot of the Cross , it will be by some of my own sort ; some of the working people who work among the lights yonder .
Parsing [sent. 12537 len. 14]: I can not see the lighted windows now , but they are there .
Parsing [sent. 12538 len. 7]: I am thankful for all ! '
Parsing [sent. 12539 len. 10]: The darkness gone , and a face bending down .
Parsing [sent. 12540 len. 11]: ` It can not be the boofer lady ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12541 len. 8]: I do n't understand what you say .
Parsing [sent. 12542 len. 10]: Let me wet your lips again with this brandy .
Parsing [sent. 12543 len. 8]: I have been away to fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 12544 len. 10]: Did you think that I was long gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 12545 len. 18]: It is as the face of a woman , shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair .
Parsing [sent. 12546 len. 14]: It is the earnest face of a woman who is young and handsome .
Parsing [sent. 12547 len. 16]: But all is over with me on earth , and this must be an Angel .
Parsing [sent. 12548 len. 9]: ` Have I been long dead ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12549 len. 8]: I do n't understand what you say .
Parsing [sent. 12550 len. 7]: Let me wet your lips again .
Parsing [sent. 12551 len. 25]: I hurried all I could , and brought no one back with me , lest you should die of the shock of strangers . '
Parsing [sent. 12552 len. 8]: ` Am I not dead ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12553 len. 8]: I can not understand what you say .
Parsing [sent. 12554 len. 14]: Your voice is so low and broken that I can not hear you .
Parsing [sent. 12555 len. 6]: Do you hear me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12556 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 12557 len. 7]: ` Do you mean Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 12558 len. 5]: ` Yes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12559 len. 37]: I was coming from my work just now , along the path outside -LRB- I was up with the night-hands last night -RRB- , and I heard a groan , and found you lying here . '
Parsing [sent. 12560 len. 7]: ` What work , deary ? '
Parsing [sent. 12561 len. 7]: ` Did you ask what work ?
Parsing [sent. 12562 len. 5]: At the paper-mill . '
Parsing [sent. 12563 len. 6]: ` Where is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12564 len. 17]: ` Your face is turned up to the sky , and you ca n't see it .
Parsing [sent. 12565 len. 5]: It is close by .
Parsing [sent. 12566 len. 15]: You can see my face , here , between you and the sky ? '
Parsing [sent. 12567 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 12568 len. 7]: ` Dare I lift you ? '
Parsing [sent. 12569 len. 5]: ` Not yet . '
Parsing [sent. 12570 len. 13]: ` Not even lift your head to get it on my arm ?
Parsing [sent. 12571 len. 9]: I will do it by very gentle degrees .
Parsing [sent. 12572 len. 7]: You shall hardly feel it . '
Parsing [sent. 12573 len. 4]: ` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 12574 len. 2]: Paper .
Parsing [sent. 12575 len. 3]: Letter . '
Parsing [sent. 12576 len. 8]: ` This paper in your breast ? '
Parsing [sent. 12577 len. 5]: ` Bless ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12578 len. 8]: ` Let me wet your lips again .
Parsing [sent. 12579 len. 6]: Am I to open it ?
Parsing [sent. 12580 len. 5]: To read it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12581 len. 5]: ` Bless ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12582 len. 26]: She reads it with surprise , and looks down with a new expression and an added interest on the motionless face she kneels beside . '
Parsing [sent. 12583 len. 5]: I know these names .
Parsing [sent. 12584 len. 7]: I have heard them often . '
Parsing [sent. 12585 len. 11]: ` Will you send it , my dear ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12586 len. 6]: I can not understand you .
Parsing [sent. 12587 len. 11]: Let me wet your lips again , and your forehead .
Parsing [sent. 12588 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 12589 len. 8]: O poor thing , poor thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 12590 len. 7]: These words through her fast-dropping tears .
Parsing [sent. 12591 len. 9]: ` What was it that you asked me ?
Parsing [sent. 12592 len. 10]: Wait till I bring my ear quite close . '
Parsing [sent. 12593 len. 10]: ` Will you send it , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 12594 len. 9]: ` Will I send it to the writers ?
Parsing [sent. 12595 len. 5]: Is that your wish ?
Parsing [sent. 12596 len. 5]: Yes , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 12597 len. 14]: ` You 'll not give it up to any one but them ? '
Parsing [sent. 12598 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 12599 len. 32]: ` As you must grow old in time , and come to your dying hour , my dear , you 'll not give it up to any one but them ? '
Parsing [sent. 12600 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 12601 len. 4]: Most solemnly . '
Parsing [sent. 12602 len. 7]: ` Never to the Parish ! '
Parsing [sent. 12603 len. 5]: with a convulsed struggle .
Parsing [sent. 12604 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 12605 len. 4]: Most solemnly . '
Parsing [sent. 12606 len. 18]: ` Nor let the Parish touch me , not yet so much as look at me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12607 len. 4]: with another struggle .
Parsing [sent. 12608 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 12609 len. 3]: Faithfully . '
Parsing [sent. 12610 len. 12]: A look of thankfulness and triumph lights the worn old face .
Parsing [sent. 12611 len. 50]: The eyes , which have been darkly fixed upon the sky , turn with meaning in them towards the compassionate face from which the tears are dropping , and a smile is on the aged lips as they ask : ` What is your name , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 12612 len. 9]: ` My name is Lizzie Hexam . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12613 len. 6]: I must be sore disfigured .
Parsing [sent. 12614 len. 8]: Are you afraid to kiss me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12615 len. 17]: The answer is , the ready pressure of her lips upon the cold but smiling mouth .
Parsing [sent. 12616 len. 4]: ` Bless ye !
Parsing [sent. 12617 len. 8]: NOW lift me , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 12618 len. 18]: Lizzie Hexam very softly raised the weather-stained grey head , and lifted her as high as Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 12619 len. 38]: Chapter 9 SOMEBODY BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF A PREDICTION ' `` We give thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleased thee to deliver this our sister out of the miseries of this sinful world . '' '
Parsing [sent. 12620 len. 59]: So read the Reverend Frank Milvey in a not untroubled voice , for his heart misgave him that all was not quite right between us and our sister -- or say our sister in Law -- Poor Law -- and that we sometimes read these words in an awful manner , over our Sister and our Brother too .
Parsing [sent. 12621 len. 47]: And Sloppy -- on whom the brave deceased had never turned her back until she ran away from him , knowing that otherwise he would not be separated from her -- Sloppy could not in his conscience as yet find the hearty thanks required of it .
Parsing [sent. 12622 len. 24]: Selfish in Sloppy , and yet excusable , it may be humbly hoped , because our sister had been more than his mother .
Parsing [sent. 12623 len. 43]: The words were read above the ashes of Betty Higden , in a corner of a churchyard near the river ; in a churchyard so obscure that there was nothing in it but grass-mounds , not so much as one single tombstone .
Parsing [sent. 12624 len. 71]: It might not be to do an unreasonably great deal for the diggers and hewers , in a registering age , if we ticketed their graves at the common charge ; so that a new generation might know which was which : so that the soldier , sailor , emigrant , coming home , should be able to identify the resting-place of father , mother , playmate , or betrothed .
Parsing [sent. 12625 len. 35]: For , we turn up our eyes and say that we are all alike in death , and we might turn them down and work the saying out in this world , so far .
Parsing [sent. 12626 len. 7]: It would be sentimental , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 12627 len. 32]: But how say ye , my lords and gentleman and honourable boards , shall we not find good standing-room left for a little sentiment , if we look into our crowds ?
Parsing [sent. 12628 len. 24]: Near unto the Reverend Frank Milvey as he read , stood his little wife , John Rokesmith the Secretary , and Bella Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 12629 len. 15]: These , over and above Sloppy , were the mourners at the lowly grave .
Parsing [sent. 12630 len. 26]: Not a penny had been added to the money sewn in her dress : what her honest spirit had so long projected , was fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 12631 len. 59]: ` I 've took it in my head , ' said Sloppy , laying it , inconsolable , against the church door , when all was done : I 've took it in my wretched head that I might have sometimes turned a little harder for her , and it cuts me deep to think so now . '
Parsing [sent. 12632 len. 52]: The Reverend Frank Milvey , comforting Sloppy , expounded to him how the best of us were more or less remiss in our turnings at our respective Mangles -- some of us very much so -- and how we were all a halting , failing , feeble , and inconstant crew .
Parsing [sent. 12633 len. 25]: ` SHE war n't , sir , ' said Sloppy , taking this ghostly counsel rather ill , in behalf of his late benefactress .
Parsing [sent. 12634 len. 9]: ` Let us speak for ourselves , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12635 len. 11]: She went through with whatever duty she had to do .
Parsing [sent. 12636 len. 25]: She went through with me , she went through with the Minders , she went through with herself , she went through with everythink .
Parsing [sent. 12637 len. 23]: O Mrs Higden , Mrs Higden , you was a woman and a mother and a mangler in a million million ! '
Parsing [sent. 12638 len. 36]: With those heartfelt words , Sloppy removed his dejected head from the church door , and took it back to the grave in the comer , and laid it down there , and wept alone .
Parsing [sent. 12639 len. 31]: ` Not a very poor grave , ' said the Reverend Frank Milvey , brushing his hand across his eyes , ` when it has that homely figure on it .
Parsing [sent. 12640 len. 20]: Richer , I think , than it could be made by most of the sculpture in Westminster Abbey ! '
Parsing [sent. 12641 len. 12]: They left him undisturbed , and passed out at the wicket-gate .
Parsing [sent. 12642 len. 22]: The water-wheel of the paper-mill was audible there , and seemed to have a softening influence on the bright wintry scene .
Parsing [sent. 12643 len. 39]: They had arrived but a little while before , and Lizzie Hexam now told them the little she could add to the letter in which she had enclosed Mr Rokesmith 's letter and had asked for their instructions .
Parsing [sent. 12644 len. 61]: This was merely how she had heard the groan , and what had afterwards passed , and how she had obtained leave for the remains to be placed in that sweet , fresh , empty store-room of the mill from which they had just accompanied them to the churchyard , and how the last requests had been religiously observed . '
Parsing [sent. 12645 len. 20]: I could not have done it all , or nearly all , of myself , ' said Lizzie . '
Parsing [sent. 12646 len. 23]: I should not have wanted the will ; but I should not have had the power , without our managing partner . '
Parsing [sent. 12647 len. 10]: ` Surely not the Jew who received us ? '
Parsing [sent. 12648 len. 4]: said Mrs Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 12649 len. 18]: -LRB- ` My dear , ' observed her husband in parenthesis , ` why not ? ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12650 len. 36]: ` The gentleman certainly is a Jew , ' said Lizzie , ` and the lady , his wife , is a Jewess , and I was first brought to their notice by a Jew .
Parsing [sent. 12651 len. 14]: But I think there can not be kinder people in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 12652 len. 10]: ` But suppose they try to convert you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12653 len. 17]: suggested Mrs Milvey , bristling in her good little way , as a clergyman 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 12654 len. 8]: ` To do what , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 12655 len. 8]: asked Lizzie , with a modest smile .
Parsing [sent. 12656 len. 13]: ` To make you change your religion , ' said Mrs Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 12657 len. 8]: Lizzie shook her head , still smiling .
Parsing [sent. 12658 len. 11]: ` They have never asked me what my religion is .
Parsing [sent. 12659 len. 13]: They asked me what my story was , and I told them .
Parsing [sent. 12660 len. 16]: They asked me to be industrious and faithful , and I promised to be so .
Parsing [sent. 12661 len. 26]: They most willingly and cheerfully do their duty to all of us who are employed here , and we try to do ours to them .
Parsing [sent. 12662 len. 22]: Indeed they do much more than their duty to us , for they are wonderfully mindful of us in many ways .
Parsing [sent. 12663 len. 24]: ` It is easy to see you 're a favourite , my dear , ' said little Mrs Milvey , not quite pleased .
Parsing [sent. 12664 len. 32]: ` It would be very ungrateful in me to say I am not , ' returned Lizzie , ` for I have been already raised to a place of confidence here .
Parsing [sent. 12665 len. 19]: But that makes no difference in their following their own religion and leaving all of us to ours .
Parsing [sent. 12666 len. 17]: They never talk of theirs to us , and they never talk of ours to us .
Parsing [sent. 12667 len. 16]: If I was the last in the mill , it would be just the same .
Parsing [sent. 12668 len. 13]: They never asked me what religion that poor thing had followed . '
Parsing [sent. 12669 len. 25]: ` My dear , ' said Mrs Milvey , aside to the Reverend Frank , ' I wish you would talk to her . '
Parsing [sent. 12670 len. 27]: ` My dear , ' said the Reverend Frank aside to his good little wife , ' I think I will leave it to somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 12671 len. 6]: The circumstances are hardly favourable .
Parsing [sent. 12672 len. 19]: There are plenty of talkers going about , my love , and she will soon find one . '
Parsing [sent. 12673 len. 18]: While this discourse was interchanging , both Bella and the Secretary observed Lizzie Hexam with great attention .
Parsing [sent. 12674 len. 38]: Brought face to face for the first time with the daughter of his supposed murderer , it was natural that John Harmon should have his own secret reasons for a careful scrutiny of her countenance and manner .
Parsing [sent. 12675 len. 48]: Bella knew that Lizzie 's father had been falsely accused of the crime which had had so great an influence on her own life and fortunes ; and her interest , though it had no secret springs , like that of the Secretary , was equally natural .
Parsing [sent. 12676 len. 30]: Both had expected to see something very different from the real Lizzie Hexam , and thus it fell out that she became the unconscious means of bringing them together .
Parsing [sent. 12677 len. 58]: For , when they had walked on with her to the little house in the clean village by the paper-mill , where Lizzie had a lodging with an elderly couple employed in the establishment , and when Mrs Milvey and Bella had been up to see her room and had come down , the mill bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 12678 len. 74]: This called Lizzie away for the time , and left the Secretary and Bella standing rather awkwardly in the small street ; Mrs Milvey being engaged in pursuing the village children , and her investigations whether they were in danger of becoming children of Israel ; and the Reverend Frank being engaged -- to say the truth -- in evading that branch of his spiritual functions , and getting out of sight surreptitiously .
Parsing [sent. 12679 len. 22]: Bella at length said : ` Had n't we better talk about the commission we have undertaken , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 12680 len. 11]: ` By all means , ' said the Secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 12681 len. 24]: I suppose , ' faltered Bella , ` that we ARE both commissioned , or we should n't both be here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12682 len. 11]: I suppose so , ' was the Secretary 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 12683 len. 75]: ` When I proposed to come with Mr and Mrs Milvey , ' said Bella , ` Mrs Boffin urged me to do so , in order that I might give her my small report -- it 's not worth anything , Mr Rokesmith , except for it 's being a woman 's -- which indeed with you may be a fresh reason for it 's being worth nothing -- of Lizzie Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 12684 len. 20]: ` Mr Boffin , ' said the Secretary , ` directed me to come for the same purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 12685 len. 19]: As they spoke they were leaving the little street and emerging on the wooded landscape by the river .
Parsing [sent. 12686 len. 11]: ` You think well of her , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 12687 len. 11]: pursued Bella , conscious of making all the advances . '
Parsing [sent. 12688 len. 8]: I think highly of her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12689 len. 7]: I am so glad of that !
Parsing [sent. 12690 len. 12]: Something quite refined in her beauty , is there not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12691 len. 8]: ` Her appearance is very striking . '
Parsing [sent. 12692 len. 14]: ` There is a shade of sadness upon her that is quite touching .
Parsing [sent. 12693 len. 42]: At least I -- I am not setting up my own poor opinion , you know , Mr Rokesmith , ' said Bella , excusing and explaining herself in a pretty shy way ; ' I am consulting you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12694 len. 5]: I noticed that sadness .
Parsing [sent. 12695 len. 29]: I hope it may not , ' said the Secretary in a lower voice , ` be the result of the false accusation which has been retracted . '
Parsing [sent. 12696 len. 49]: When they had passed on a little further without speaking , Bella , after stealing a glance or two at the Secretary , suddenly said : ` Oh , Mr Rokesmith , do n't be hard with me , do n't be stern with me ; be magnanimous !
Parsing [sent. 12697 len. 11]: I want to talk with you on equal terms . '
Parsing [sent. 12698 len. 21]: The Secretary as suddenly brightened , and returned : ` Upon my honour I had no thought but for you .
Parsing [sent. 12699 len. 16]: I forced myself to be constrained , lest you might misinterpret my being more natural .
Parsing [sent. 12700 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 12701 len. 5]: It 's gone . '
Parsing [sent. 12702 len. 14]: ` Thank you , ' said Bella , holding out her little hand .
Parsing [sent. 12703 len. 5]: ` Forgive me . '
Parsing [sent. 12704 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 12705 len. 6]: cried the Secretary , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 12706 len. 5]: ` Forgive ME ! '
Parsing [sent. 12707 len. 35]: For there were tears in her eyes , and they were prettier in his sight -LRB- though they smote him on the heart rather reproachfully too -RRB- than any other glitter in the world .
Parsing [sent. 12708 len. 41]: When they had walked a little further : ` You were going to speak to me , ' said the Secretary , with the shadow so long on him quite thrown off and cast away , ` about Lizzie Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 12709 len. 16]: So was I going to speak to you , if I could have begun . '
Parsing [sent. 12710 len. 40]: ` Now that you CAN begin , sir , ' returned Bella , with a look as if she italicized the word by putting one of her dimples under it , ` what were you going to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 12711 len. 49]: ` You remember , of course , that in her short letter to Mrs Boffin -- short , but containing everything to the purpose -- she stipulated that either her name , or else her place of residence , must be kept strictly a secret among us . '
Parsing [sent. 12712 len. 4]: Bella nodded Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12713 len. 14]: ` It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation .
Parsing [sent. 12714 len. 32]: I have it in charge from Mr Boffin to discover , and I am very desirous for myself to discover , whether that retracted accusation still leaves any stain upon her .
Parsing [sent. 12715 len. 18]: I mean whether it places her at any disadvantage towards any one , even towards herself . '
Parsing [sent. 12716 len. 14]: ` Yes , ' said Bella , nodding thoughtfully ; ' I understand .
Parsing [sent. 12717 len. 8]: That seems wise , and considerate . '
Parsing [sent. 12718 len. 27]: ` You may not have noticed , Miss Wilfer , that she has the same kind of interest in you , that you have in her .
Parsing [sent. 12719 len. 23]: Just as you are attracted by her beaut -- by her appearance and manner , she is attracted by yours . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12720 len. 64]: I certainly have NOT noticed it , ' returned Bella , again italicizing with the dimple , ` and I should have given her credit for -- ' The Secretary with a smile held up his hand , so plainly interposing ` not for better taste ' , that Bella 's colour deepened over the little piece of coquetry she was checked in .
Parsing [sent. 12721 len. 39]: ` And so , ' resumed the Secretary , ` if you would speak with her alone before we go away from here , I feel quite sure that a natural and easy confidence would arise between you .
Parsing [sent. 12722 len. 22]: Of course you would not be asked to betray it ; and of course you would not , if you were .
Parsing [sent. 12723 len. 41]: But if you do not object to put this question to her -- to ascertain for us her own feeling in this one matter -- you can do so at a far greater advantage than I or any else could .
Parsing [sent. 12724 len. 8]: Mr Boffin is anxious on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 12725 len. 23]: And I am , ' added the Secretary after a moment , ` for a special reason , very anxious . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12726 len. 41]: I shall be happy , Mr Rokesmith , ' returned Bella , ` to be of the least use ; for I feel , after the serious scene of to-day , that I am useless enough in this world . '
Parsing [sent. 12727 len. 11]: ` Do n't say that , ' urged the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 12728 len. 16]: ` Oh , but I mean that , ' said Bella , raising her eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 12729 len. 27]: ` No one is useless in this world , ' retorted the Secretary , ` who lightens the burden of it for any one else . '
Parsing [sent. 12730 len. 16]: ` But I assure you I DO N'T , Mr Rokesmith , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 12731 len. 2]: half-crying .
Parsing [sent. 12732 len. 7]: ` Not for your father ? '
Parsing [sent. 12733 len. 10]: ` Dear , loving , self-forgetting , easily-satisfied Pa !
Parsing [sent. 12734 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 12735 len. 5]: He thinks so . '
Parsing [sent. 12736 len. 15]: ` It is enough if he only thinks so , ' said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 12737 len. 16]: ` Excuse the interruption : I do n't like to hear you depreciate yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 12738 len. 33]: ` But YOU once depreciated ME , sir , ' thought Bella , pouting , ` and I hope you may be satisfied with the consequences you brought upon your head ! '
Parsing [sent. 12739 len. 18]: However , she said nothing to that purpose ; she even said something to a different purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12740 len. 23]: ` Mr Rokesmith , it seems so long since we spoke together naturally , that I am embarrassed in approaching another subject .
Parsing [sent. 12741 len. 3]: Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 12742 len. 13]: You know I am very grateful to him ; do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 12743 len. 30]: You know I feel a true respect for him , and am bound to him by the strong ties of his own generosity ; now do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 12744 len. 3]: ` Unquestionably .
Parsing [sent. 12745 len. 10]: And also that you are his favourite companion . '
Parsing [sent. 12746 len. 18]: ` That makes it , ' said Bella , ` so very difficult to speak of him .
Parsing [sent. 12747 len. 3]: But -- .
Parsing [sent. 12748 len. 7]: Does he treat you well ? '
Parsing [sent. 12749 len. 21]: ` You see how he treats me , ' the Secretary answered , with a patient and yet proud air .
Parsing [sent. 12750 len. 17]: ` Yes , and I see it with pain , ' said Bella , very energetically .
Parsing [sent. 12751 len. 32]: The Secretary gave her such a radiant look , that if he had thanked her a hundred times , he could not have said as much as the look said . '
Parsing [sent. 12752 len. 18]: I see it with pain , ' repeated Bella , ` and it often makes me miserable .
Parsing [sent. 12753 len. 23]: Miserable , because I can not bear to be supposed to approve of it , or have any indirect share in it .
Parsing [sent. 12754 len. 22]: Miserable , because I can not bear to be forced to admit to myself that Fortune is spoiling Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 12755 len. 51]: ` Miss Wilfer , ' said the Secretary , with a beaming face , ` if you could know with what delight I make the discovery that Fortune is n't spoiling YOU , you would know that it more than compensates me for any slight at any other hands . '
Parsing [sent. 12756 len. 23]: ` Oh , do n't speak of ME , ' said Bella , giving herself an impatient little slap with her glove .
Parsing [sent. 12757 len. 18]: ` You do n't know me as well as -- ' ` As you know yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 12758 len. 9]: suggested the Secretary , finding that she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 12759 len. 8]: ` DO you know yourself ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12760 len. 36]: I know quite enough of myself , ' said Bella , with a charming air of being inclined to give herself up as a bad job , ` and I do n't improve upon acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 12761 len. 5]: But Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 12762 len. 32]: ` That Mr Boffin 's manner to me , or consideration for me , is not what it used to be , ' observed the Secretary , ` must be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 12763 len. 9]: It is too plain to be denied . '
Parsing [sent. 12764 len. 12]: ` Are you disposed to deny it , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 12765 len. 9]: asked Bella , with a look of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 12766 len. 25]: ` Ought I not to be glad to do so , if I could : though it were only for my own sake ? '
Parsing [sent. 12767 len. 40]: ` Truly , ' returned Bella , ` it must try you very much , and -- you must please promise me that you wo n't take ill what I am going to add , Mr Rokesmith ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12768 len. 10]: I promise it with all my heart . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12769 len. 27]: -- And it must sometimes , I should think , ' said Bella , hesitating , ' a little lower you in your own estimation ? '
Parsing [sent. 12770 len. 47]: Assenting with a movement of his head , though not at all looking as if it did , the Secretary replied : ' I have very strong reasons , Miss Wilfer , for bearing with the drawbacks of my position in the house we both inhabit .
Parsing [sent. 12771 len. 27]: Believe that they are not all mercenary , although I have , through a series of strange fatalities , faded out of my place in life .
Parsing [sent. 12772 len. 36]: If what you see with such a gracious and good sympathy is calculated to rouse my pride , there are other considerations -LRB- and those you do not see -RRB- urging me to quiet endurance .
Parsing [sent. 12773 len. 10]: The latter are by far the stronger . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12774 len. 43]: I think I have noticed , Mr Rokesmith , ' said Bella , looking at him with curiosity , as not quite making him out , ` that you repress yourself , and force yourself , to act a passive part . '
Parsing [sent. 12775 len. 5]: ` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 12776 len. 11]: I repress myself and force myself to act a part .
Parsing [sent. 12777 len. 11]: It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit .
Parsing [sent. 12778 len. 7]: I have a settled purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 12779 len. 13]: ` And a good one , I hope , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 12780 len. 18]: ` And a good one , I hope , ' he answered , looking steadily at her .
Parsing [sent. 12781 len. 34]: ` Sometimes I have fancied , sir , ' said Bella , turning away her eyes , ` that your great regard for Mrs Boffin is a very powerful motive with you . '
Parsing [sent. 12782 len. 9]: ` You are right again ; it is .
Parsing [sent. 12783 len. 12]: I would do anything for her , bear anything for her .
Parsing [sent. 12784 len. 16]: There are no words to express how I esteem that good , good woman . '
Parsing [sent. 12785 len. 6]: ` As I do too !
Parsing [sent. 12786 len. 12]: May I ask you one thing more , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 12787 len. 5]: ` Anything more . '
Parsing [sent. 12788 len. 21]: ` Of course you see that she really suffers , when Mr Boffin shows how he is changing ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12789 len. 21]: I see it , every day , as you see it , and am grieved to give her pain . '
Parsing [sent. 12790 len. 7]: ` To give her pain ? '
Parsing [sent. 12791 len. 14]: said Bella , repeating the phrase quickly , with her eyebrows raised . '
Parsing [sent. 12792 len. 10]: I am generally the unfortunate cause of it . '
Parsing [sent. 12793 len. 29]: ` Perhaps she says to you , as she often says to me , that he is the best of men , in spite of all . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12794 len. 45]: I often overhear her , in her honest and beautiful devotion to him , saying so to you , ' returned the Secretary , with the same steady look , ` but I can not assert that she ever says so to me . '
Parsing [sent. 12795 len. 73]: Bella met the steady look for a moment with a wistful , musing little look of her own , and then , nodding her pretty head several times , like a dimpled philosopher -LRB- of the very best school -RRB- who was moralizing on Life , heaved a little sigh , and gave up things in general for a bad job , as she had previously been inclined to give up herself .
Parsing [sent. 12796 len. 13]: But , for all that , they had a very pleasant walk .
Parsing [sent. 12797 len. 46]: The trees were bare of leaves , and the river was bare of water-lilies ; but the sky was not bare of its beautiful blue , and the water reflected it , and a delicious wind ran with the stream , touching the surface crisply .
Parsing [sent. 12798 len. 42]: Perhaps the old mirror was never yet made by human hands , which , if all the images it has in its time reflected could pass across its surface again , would fail to reveal some scene of horror or distress .
Parsing [sent. 12799 len. 41]: But the great serene mirror of the river seemed as if it might have reproduced all it had ever reflected between those placid banks , and brought nothing to the light save what was peaceful , pastoral , and blooming .
Parsing [sent. 12800 len. 21]: So , they walked , speaking of the newly filled-up grave , and of Johnny , and of many things .
Parsing [sent. 12801 len. 52]: So , on their return , they met brisk Mrs Milvey coming to seek them , with the agreeable intelligence that there was no fear for the village children , there being a Christian school in the village , and no worse Judaical interference with it than to plant its garden .
Parsing [sent. 12802 len. 31]: So , they got back to the village as Lizzie Hexam was coming from the paper-mill , and Bella detached herself to speak with her in her own home . '
Parsing [sent. 12803 len. 32]: I am afraid it is a poor room for you , ' said Lizzie , with a smile of welcome , as she offered the post of honour by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 12804 len. 22]: ` Not so poor as you think , my dear , ' returned Bella , ` if you knew all . '
Parsing [sent. 12805 len. 75]: Indeed , though attained by some wonderful winding narrow stairs , which seemed to have been erected in a pure white chimney , and though very low in the ceiling , and very rugged in the floor , and rather blinking as to the proportions of its lattice window , it was a pleasanter room than that despised chamber once at home , in which Bella had first bemoaned the miseries of taking lodgers .
Parsing [sent. 12806 len. 16]: The day was closing as the two girls looked at one another by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 12807 len. 9]: The dusky room was lighted by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 12808 len. 23]: The grate might have been the old brazier , and the glow might have been the old hollow down by the flare .
Parsing [sent. 12809 len. 33]: ` It 's quite new to me , ' said Lizzie , ` to be visited by a lady so nearly of my own age , and so pretty , as you .
Parsing [sent. 12810 len. 13]: It 's a pleasure to me to look at you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12811 len. 35]: I have nothing left to begin with , ' returned Bella , blushing , ` because I was going to say that it was a pleasure to me to look at you , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 12812 len. 13]: But we can begin without a beginning , ca n't we ? '
Parsing [sent. 12813 len. 17]: Lizzie took the pretty little hand that was held out in as pretty a little frankness .
Parsing [sent. 12814 len. 60]: ` Now , dear , ' said Bella , drawing her chair a little nearer , and taking Lizzie 's arm as if they were going out for a walk , ' I am commissioned with something to say , and I dare say I shall say it wrong , but I wo n't if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 12815 len. 20]: It is in reference to your letter to Mr and Mrs Boffin , and this is what it is .
Parsing [sent. 12816 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 12817 len. 3]: Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 12818 len. 7]: This is what it is . '
Parsing [sent. 12819 len. 49]: With this exordium , Bella set forth that request of Lizzie 's touching secrecy , and delicately spoke of that false accusation and its retraction , and asked might she beg to be informed whether it had any bearing , near or remote , on such request . '
Parsing [sent. 12820 len. 86]: I feel , my dear , ' said Bella , quite amazing herself by the business-like manner in which she was getting on , ` that the subject must be a painful one to you , but I am mixed up in it also ; for -- I do n't know whether you may know it or suspect it -- I am the willed-away girl who was to have been married to the unfortunate gentleman , if he had been pleased to approve of me .
Parsing [sent. 12821 len. 33]: So I was dragged into the subject without my consent , and you were dragged into it without your consent , and there is very little to choose between us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12822 len. 22]: I had no doubt , ' said Lizzie , ` that you were the Miss Wilfer I have often heard named .
Parsing [sent. 12823 len. 11]: Can you tell me who my unknown friend is ? '
Parsing [sent. 12824 len. 8]: ` Unknown friend , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 12825 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 12826 len. 20]: ` Who caused the charge against poor father to be contradicted , and sent me the written paper . '
Parsing [sent. 12827 len. 7]: Bella had never heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 12828 len. 8]: Had no notion who he was . '
Parsing [sent. 12829 len. 13]: I should have been glad to thank him , ' returned Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 12830 len. 10]: ` He has done a great deal for me .
Parsing [sent. 12831 len. 13]: I must hope that he will let me thank him some day .
Parsing [sent. 12832 len. 22]: You asked me has it anything to do -- ' ` It or the accusation itself , ' Bella put in .
Parsing [sent. 12833 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12834 len. 16]: Has either anything to do with my wishing to live quite secret and retired here ?
Parsing [sent. 12835 len. 3]: No . '
Parsing [sent. 12836 len. 36]: As Lizzie Hexam shook her head in giving this reply and as her glance sought the fire , there was a quiet resolution in her folded hands , not lost on Bella 's bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12837 len. 8]: ` Have you lived much alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 12838 len. 3]: asked Bella .
Parsing [sent. 12839 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12840 len. 7]: It 's nothing new to me .
Parsing [sent. 12841 len. 25]: I used to be always alone many hours together , in the day and in the night , when poor father was alive . '
Parsing [sent. 12842 len. 13]: ` You have a brother , I have been told ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12843 len. 13]: I have a brother , but he is not friendly with me .
Parsing [sent. 12844 len. 16]: He is a very good boy though , and has raised himself by his industry .
Parsing [sent. 12845 len. 8]: I do n't complain of him . '
Parsing [sent. 12846 len. 23]: As she said it , with her eyes upon the fire-glow , there was an instantaneous escape of distress into her face .
Parsing [sent. 12847 len. 9]: Bella seized the moment to touch her hand .
Parsing [sent. 12848 len. 23]: ` Lizzie , I wish you would tell me whether you have any friend of your own sex and age . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12849 len. 21]: I have lived that lonely kind of life , that I have never had one , ' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 12850 len. 9]: ` Nor I neither , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 12851 len. 51]: ` Not that my life has been lonely , for I could have sometimes wished it lonelier , instead of having Ma going on like the Tragic Muse with a face-ache in majestic corners , and Lavvy being spiteful -- though of course I am very fond of them both .
Parsing [sent. 12852 len. 12]: I wish you could make a friend of me , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 12853 len. 6]: Do you think you could ?
Parsing [sent. 12854 len. 25]: I have no more of what they call character , my dear , than a canary-bird , but I know I am trustworthy . '
Parsing [sent. 12855 len. 36]: The wayward , playful , affectionate nature , giddy for want of the weight of some sustaining purpose , and capricious because it was always fluttering among little things , was yet a captivating one .
Parsing [sent. 12856 len. 24]: To Lizzie it was so new , so pretty , at once so womanly and so childish , that it won her completely .
Parsing [sent. 12857 len. 16]: And when Bella said again , ` Do you think you could , Lizzie ? '
Parsing [sent. 12858 len. 34]: with her eyebrows raised , her head inquiringly on one side , and an odd doubt about it in her own bosom , Lizzie showed beyond all question that she thought she could .
Parsing [sent. 12859 len. 25]: ` Tell me , my dear , ' said Bella , ` what is the matter , and why you live like this . '
Parsing [sent. 12860 len. 28]: Lizzie presently began , by way of prelude , ` You must have many lovers -- ' when Bella checked her with a little scream of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 12861 len. 10]: ` My dear , I have n't one ! '
Parsing [sent. 12862 len. 5]: ` Not one ? '
Parsing [sent. 12863 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 12864 len. 8]: Perhaps one , ' said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 12865 len. 8]: I am sure I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 12866 len. 20]: I HAD one , but what he may think about it at the present time I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 12867 len. 20]: Perhaps I have half a one -LRB- of course I do n't count that Idiot , George Sampson -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 12868 len. 6]: However , never mind me .
Parsing [sent. 12869 len. 8]: I want to hear about you . '
Parsing [sent. 12870 len. 33]: ` There is a certain man , ' said Lizzie , ' a passionate and angry man , who says he loves me , and who I must believe does love me .
Parsing [sent. 12871 len. 8]: He is the friend of my brother .
Parsing [sent. 12872 len. 32]: I shrank from him within myself when my brother first brought him to me ; but the last time I saw him he terrified me more than I can say . '
Parsing [sent. 12873 len. 4]: There she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 12874 len. 14]: ` Did you come here to escape from him , Lizzie ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12875 len. 11]: I came here immediately after he so alarmed me . '
Parsing [sent. 12876 len. 10]: ` Are you afraid of him here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12877 len. 14]: I am not timid generally , but I am always afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 12878 len. 30]: I am afraid to see a newspaper , or to hear a word spoken of what is done in London , lest he should have done some violence . '
Parsing [sent. 12879 len. 14]: ` Then you are not afraid of him for yourself , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 12880 len. 10]: said Bella , after pondering on the words . '
Parsing [sent. 12881 len. 13]: I should be even that , if I met him about here .
Parsing [sent. 12882 len. 17]: I look round for him always , as I pass to and fro at night . '
Parsing [sent. 12883 len. 18]: ` Are you afraid of anything he may do to himself in London , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 12884 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 12885 len. 22]: He might be fierce enough even to do some violence to himself , but I do n't think of that . '
Parsing [sent. 12886 len. 24]: ` Then it would almost seem , dear , ' said Bella quaintly , ` as if there must be somebody else ? '
Parsing [sent. 12887 len. 41]: Lizzie put her hands before her face for a moment before replying : ` The words are always in my ears , and the blow he struck upon a stone wall as he said them is always before my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12888 len. 21]: I have tried hard to think it not worth remembering , but I can not make so little of it .
Parsing [sent. 12889 len. 25]: His hand was trickling down with blood as he said to me , `` Then I hope that I may never kill him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12890 len. 39]: Rather startled , Bella made and clasped a girdle of her arms round Lizzie 's waist , and then asked quietly , in a soft voice , as they both looked at the fire : ` Kill him !
Parsing [sent. 12891 len. 9]: Is this man so jealous , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 12892 len. 10]: ` Of a gentleman , ' said Lizzie . '
Parsing [sent. 12893 len. 39]: -- I hardly know how to tell you -- of a gentleman far above me and my way of life , who broke father 's death to me , and has shown an interest in me since . '
Parsing [sent. 12894 len. 7]: ` Does he love you ? '
Parsing [sent. 12895 len. 5]: Lizzie shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 12896 len. 7]: ` Does he admire you ? '
Parsing [sent. 12897 len. 16]: Lizzie ceased to shake her head , and pressed her hand upon her living girdle .
Parsing [sent. 12898 len. 13]: ` Is it through his influence that you came here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12899 len. 3]: O no !
Parsing [sent. 12900 len. 27]: And of all the world I would n't have him know that I am here , or get the least clue where to find me . '
Parsing [sent. 12901 len. 5]: ` Lizzie , dear !
Parsing [sent. 12902 len. 3]: Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 12903 len. 9]: asked Bella , in amazement at this burst .
Parsing [sent. 12904 len. 13]: But then quickly added , reading Lizzie 's face : ` No .
Parsing [sent. 12905 len. 5]: Do n't say why .
Parsing [sent. 12906 len. 8]: That was a foolish question of mine .
Parsing [sent. 12907 len. 7]: I see , I see . '
Parsing [sent. 12908 len. 6]: There was silence between them .
Parsing [sent. 12909 len. 45]: Lizzie , with a drooping head , glanced down at the glow in the fire where her first fancies had been nursed , and her first escape made from the grim life out of which she had plucked her brother , foreseeing her reward .
Parsing [sent. 12910 len. 17]: ` You know all now , ' she said , raising her eyes to Bella 's .
Parsing [sent. 12911 len. 7]: ` There is nothing left out .
Parsing [sent. 12912 len. 23]: This is my reason for living secret here , with the aid of a good old man who is my true friend .
Parsing [sent. 12913 len. 35]: For a short part of my life at home with father , I knew of things -- do n't ask me what -- that I set my face against , and tried to better .
Parsing [sent. 12914 len. 29]: I do n't think I could have done more , then , without letting my hold on father go ; but they sometimes lie heavy on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 12915 len. 16]: By doing all for the best , I hope I may wear them out . '
Parsing [sent. 12916 len. 29]: ` And wear out too , ' said Bella soothingly , ` this weakness , Lizzie , in favour of one who is not worthy of it . '
Parsing [sent. 12917 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 12918 len. 36]: I do n't want to wear that out , ' was the flushed reply , ` nor do I want to believe , nor do I believe , that he is not worthy of it .
Parsing [sent. 12919 len. 15]: What should I gain by that , and how much should I lose ! '
Parsing [sent. 12920 len. 44]: Bella 's expressive little eyebrows remonstrated with the fire for some short time before she rejoined : ` Do n't think that I press you , Lizzie ; but would n't you gain in peace , and hope , and even in freedom ?
Parsing [sent. 12921 len. 27]: Would n't it be better not to live a secret life in hiding , and not to be shut out from your natural and wholesome prospects ?
Parsing [sent. 12922 len. 12]: Forgive my asking you , would that be no gain ? '
Parsing [sent. 12923 len. 31]: ` Does a woman 's heart that -- that has that weakness in it which you have spoken of , ' returned Lizzie , ` seek to gain anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 12924 len. 34]: The question was so directly at variance with Bella 's views in life , as set forth to her father , that she said internally , ` There , you little mercenary wretch !
Parsing [sent. 12925 len. 5]: Do you hear that ?
Parsing [sent. 12926 len. 9]: Ai n't you ashamed of your self ? '
Parsing [sent. 12927 len. 19]: and unclasped the girdle of her arms , expressly to give herself a penitential poke in the side .
Parsing [sent. 12928 len. 30]: ` But you said , Lizzie , ' observed Bella , returning to her subject when she had administered this chastisement , ` that you would lose , besides .
Parsing [sent. 12929 len. 14]: Would you mind telling me what you would lose , Lizzie ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12930 len. 24]: I should lose some of the best recollections , best encouragements , and best objects , that I carry through my daily life .
Parsing [sent. 12931 len. 41]: I should lose my belief that if I had been his equal , and he had loved me , I should have tried with all my might to make him better and happier , as he would have made me .
Parsing [sent. 12932 len. 43]: I should lose almost all the value that I put upon the little learning I have , which is all owing to him , and which I conquered the difficulties of , that he might not think it thrown away upon me .
Parsing [sent. 12933 len. 55]: I should lose a kind of picture of him -- or of what he might have been , if I had been a lady , and he had loved me -- which is always with me , and which I somehow feel that I could not do a mean or a wrong thing before .
Parsing [sent. 12934 len. 81]: I should leave off prizing the remembrance that he has done me nothing but good since I have known him , and that he has made a change within me , like -- like the change in the grain of these hands , which were coarse , and cracked , and hard , and brown when I rowed on the river with father , and are softened and made supple by this new work as you see them now . '
Parsing [sent. 12935 len. 13]: They trembled , but with no weakness , as she showed them .
Parsing [sent. 12936 len. 13]: ` Understand me , my dear ; ' thus she went on .
Parsing [sent. 12937 len. 41]: I have never dreamed of the possibility of his being anything to me on this earth but the kind picture that I know I could not make you understand , if the understanding was not in your own breast already .
Parsing [sent. 12938 len. 28]: I have no more dreamed of the possibility of MY being his wife , than he ever has -- and words could not be stronger than that .
Parsing [sent. 12939 len. 6]: And yet I love him .
Parsing [sent. 12940 len. 34]: I love him so much , and so dearly , that when I sometimes think my life may be but a weary one , I am proud of it and glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 12941 len. 34]: I am proud and glad to suffer something for him , even though it is of no service to him , and he will never know of it or care for it . '
Parsing [sent. 12942 len. 33]: Bella sat enchained by the deep , unselfish passion of this girl or woman of her own age , courageously revealing itself in the confidence of her sympathetic perception of its truth .
Parsing [sent. 12943 len. 20]: And yet she had never experienced anything like it , or thought of the existence of anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 12944 len. 32]: ` It was late upon a wretched night , ' said Lizzie , ` when his eyes first looked at me in my old river-side home , very different from this .
Parsing [sent. 12945 len. 9]: His eyes may never look at me again .
Parsing [sent. 12946 len. 15]: I would rather that they never did ; I hope that they never may .
Parsing [sent. 12947 len. 23]: But I would not have the light of them taken out of my life , for anything my life can give me .
Parsing [sent. 12948 len. 10]: I have told you everything now , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 12949 len. 19]: If it comes a little strange to me to have parted with it , I am not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 12950 len. 32]: I had no thought of ever parting with a single word of it , a moment before you came in ; but you came in , and my mind changed . '
Parsing [sent. 12951 len. 16]: Bella kissed her on the cheek , and thanked her warmly for her confidence . '
Parsing [sent. 12952 len. 17]: I only wish , ' said Bella , ' I was more deserving of it . '
Parsing [sent. 12953 len. 7]: ` More deserving of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12954 len. 9]: repeated Lizzie , with an incredulous smile . '
Parsing [sent. 12955 len. 49]: I do n't mean in respect of keeping it , ' said Bella , ` because any one should tear me to bits before getting at a syllable of it -- though there 's no merit in that , for I am naturally as obstinate as a Pig .
Parsing [sent. 12956 len. 23]: What I mean is , Lizzie , that I am a mere impertinent piece of conceit , and you shame me . '
Parsing [sent. 12957 len. 35]: Lizzie put up the pretty brown hair that came tumbling down , owing to the energy with which Bella shook her head ; and she remonstrated while thus engaged , ` My dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 12958 len. 42]: ` Oh , it 's all very well to call me your dear , ' said Bella , with a pettish whimper , ` and I am glad to be called so , though I have slight enough claim to be .
Parsing [sent. 12959 len. 10]: But I AM such a nasty little thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 12960 len. 5]: ` My dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 12961 len. 4]: urged Lizzie again .
Parsing [sent. 12962 len. 14]: ` Such a shallow , cold , worldly , Limited little brute ! '
Parsing [sent. 12963 len. 12]: said Bella , bringing out her last adjective with culminating force .
Parsing [sent. 12964 len. 28]: ` Do you think , ' inquired Lizzie with her quiet smile , the hair being now secured , ` that I do n't know better ? '
Parsing [sent. 12965 len. 8]: ` DO you know better though ? '
Parsing [sent. 12966 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 12967 len. 9]: ` Do you really believe you know better ?
Parsing [sent. 12968 len. 27]: Oh , I should be so glad if you did know better , but I am so very much afraid that I must know best ! '
Parsing [sent. 12969 len. 21]: Lizzie asked her , laughing outright , whether she ever saw her own face or heard her own voice ? '
Parsing [sent. 12970 len. 26]: I suppose so , ' returned Bella ; ' I look in the glass often enough , and I chatter like a Magpie . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12971 len. 49]: I have seen your face , and heard your voice , at any rate , ' said Lizzie , ` and they have tempted me to say to you -- with a certainty of not going wrong -- what I thought I should never say to any one .
Parsing [sent. 12972 len. 6]: Does that look ill ? '
Parsing [sent. 12973 len. 27]: ` No , I hope it does n't , ' pouted Bella , stopping herself in something between a humoured laugh and a humoured sob . '
Parsing [sent. 12974 len. 21]: I used once to see pictures in the fire , ' said Lizzie playfully , ` to please my brother .
Parsing [sent. 12975 len. 16]: Shall I tell you what I see down there where the fire is glowing ? '
Parsing [sent. 12976 len. 30]: They had risen , and were standing on the hearth , the time being come for separating ; each had drawn an arm around the other to take leave .
Parsing [sent. 12977 len. 18]: ` Shall I tell you , ' asked Lizzie , ` what I see down there ? '
Parsing [sent. 12978 len. 6]: ` Limited little b ? '
Parsing [sent. 12979 len. 8]: suggested Bella with her eyebrows raised . '
Parsing [sent. 12980 len. 10]: A heart well worth winning , and well won .
Parsing [sent. 12981 len. 26]: A heart that , once won , goes through fire and water for the winner , and never changes , and is never daunted . '
Parsing [sent. 12982 len. 6]: ` Girl 's heart ? '
Parsing [sent. 12983 len. 7]: asked Bella , with accompanying eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 12984 len. 3]: Lizzie nodded .
Parsing [sent. 12985 len. 17]: ` And the figure to which it belongs -- ' Is yours , ' suggested Bella .
Parsing [sent. 12986 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 12987 len. 7]: Most clearly and distinctly yours . '
Parsing [sent. 12988 len. 41]: So the interview terminated with pleasant words on both sides , and with many reminders on the part of Bella that they were friends , and pledges that she would soon come down into that part of the country again .
Parsing [sent. 12989 len. 21]: There with Lizzie returned to her occupation , and Bella ran over to the little inn to rejoin her company .
Parsing [sent. 12990 len. 18]: ` You look rather serious , Miss Wilfer , ' was the Secretary 's first remark . '
Parsing [sent. 12991 len. 10]: I feel rather serious , ' returned Miss Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 12992 len. 26]: She had nothing else to tell him but that Lizzie Hexam 's secret had no reference whatever to the cruel charge , or its withdrawal .
Parsing [sent. 12993 len. 4]: Oh yes though !
Parsing [sent. 12994 len. 29]: said Bella ; she might as well mention one other thing ; Lizzie was very desirous to thank her unknown friend who had sent her the written retractation .
Parsing [sent. 12995 len. 5]: Was she , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 12996 len. 4]: observed the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 12997 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 12998 len. 15]: Bella asked him , had he any notion who that unknown friend might be ?
Parsing [sent. 12999 len. 6]: He had no notion whatever .
Parsing [sent. 13000 len. 17]: They were on the borders of Oxfordshire , so far had poor old Betty Higden strayed .
Parsing [sent. 13001 len. 40]: They were to return by the train presently , and , the station being near at hand , the Reverend Frank and Mrs Frank , and Sloppy and Bella and the Secretary , set out to walk to it .
Parsing [sent. 13002 len. 17]: Few rustic paths are wide enough for five , and Bella and the Secretary dropped behind .
Parsing [sent. 13003 len. 32]: ` Can you believe , Mr Rokesmith , ' said Bella , ` that I feel as if whole years had passed since I went into Lizzie Hexam 's cottage ? '
Parsing [sent. 13004 len. 25]: ` We have crowded a good deal into the day , ' he returned , ` and you were much affected in the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 13005 len. 5]: You are over-tired . '
Parsing [sent. 13006 len. 10]: ` No , I am not at all tired .
Parsing [sent. 13007 len. 9]: I have not quite expressed what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 13008 len. 35]: I do n't mean that I feel as if a great space of time had gone by , but that I feel as if much had happened -- to myself , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 13009 len. 9]: ` For good , I hope ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13010 len. 8]: I hope so , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 13011 len. 10]: ` You are cold ; I felt you tremble .
Parsing [sent. 13012 len. 11]: Pray let me put this wrapper of mine about you .
Parsing [sent. 13013 len. 12]: May I fold it over this shoulder without injuring your dress ?
Parsing [sent. 13014 len. 11]: Now , it will be too heavy and too long .
Parsing [sent. 13015 len. 19]: Let me carry this end over my arm , as you have no arm to give me . '
Parsing [sent. 13016 len. 5]: Yes she had though .
Parsing [sent. 13017 len. 34]: How she got it out , in her muffled state , Heaven knows ; but she got it out somehow -- there it was -- and slipped it through the Secretary 's . '
Parsing [sent. 13018 len. 23]: I have had a long and interesting talk with Lizzie , Mr Rokesmith , and she gave me her full confidence . '
Parsing [sent. 13019 len. 13]: ` She could not withhold it , ' said the Secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 13020 len. 32]: I wonder how you come , ' said Bella , stopping short as she glanced at him , ` to say to me just what she said about it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13021 len. 17]: I infer that it must be because I feel just as she felt about it . '
Parsing [sent. 13022 len. 15]: ` And how was that , do you mean to say , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 13023 len. 6]: asked Bella , moving again .
Parsing [sent. 13024 len. 23]: ` That if you were inclined to win her confidence -- anybody 's confidence -- you were sure to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 13025 len. 25]: The railway , at this point , knowingly shutting a green eye and opening a red one , they had to run for it .
Parsing [sent. 13026 len. 17]: As Bella could not run easily so wrapped up , the Secretary had to help her .
Parsing [sent. 13027 len. 38]: When she took her opposite place in the carriage corner , the brightness in her face was so charming to behold , that on her exclaiming , ` What beautiful stars and what a glorious night ! '
Parsing [sent. 13028 len. 33]: the Secretary said ` Yes , ' but seemed to prefer to see the night and the stars in the light of her lovely little countenance , to looking out of window .
Parsing [sent. 13029 len. 8]: O boofer lady , fascinating boofer lady !
Parsing [sent. 13030 len. 11]: If I were but legally executor of Johnny 's will !
Parsing [sent. 13031 len. 16]: If I had but the right to pay your legacy and to take your receipt !
Parsing [sent. 13032 len. 41]: -- Something to this purpose surely mingled with the blast of the train as it cleared the stations , all knowingly shutting up their green eyes and opening their red ones when they prepared to let the boofer lady pass .
Parsing [sent. 13033 len. 30]: Chapter 10 SCOUTS OUT ` And so , Miss Wren , ' said Mr Eugene Wrayburn , ' I can not persuade you to dress me a doll ? '
Parsing [sent. 13034 len. 24]: ` No , ' replied Miss Wren snappishly ; ` if you want one , go and buy one at the shop . '
Parsing [sent. 13035 len. 35]: ` And my charming young goddaughter , ' said Mr Wrayburn plaintively , ` down in Hertfordshire -- ' -LRB- ` Humbugshire you mean , I think , ' interposed Miss Wren . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 13036 len. 30]: -- is to be put upon the cold footing of the general public , and is to derive no advantage from my private acquaintance with the Court Dressmaker ? '
Parsing [sent. 13037 len. 22]: ` If it 's any advantage to your charming godchild -- and oh , a precious godfather she has got ! '
Parsing [sent. 13038 len. 43]: -- replied Miss Wren , pricking at him in the air with her needle , ` to be informed that the Court Dressmaker knows your tricks and your manners , you may tell her so by post , with my compliments . '
Parsing [sent. 13039 len. 33]: Miss Wren was busy at her work by candle-light , and Mr Wrayburn , half amused and half vexed , and all idle and shiftless , stood by her bench looking on .
Parsing [sent. 13040 len. 26]: Miss Wren 's troublesome child was in the corner in deep disgrace , and exhibiting great wretchedness in the shivering stage of prostration from drink .
Parsing [sent. 13041 len. 8]: ` Ugh , you disgraceful boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 13042 len. 31]: exclaimed Miss Wren , attracted by the sound of his chattering teeth , ' I wish they 'd all drop down your throat and play at dice in your stomach !
Parsing [sent. 13043 len. 5]: Boh , wicked child !
Parsing [sent. 13044 len. 6]: Beebaa , black sheep ! '
Parsing [sent. 13045 len. 23]: On her accompanying each of these reproaches with a threatening stamp of the foot , the wretched creature protested with a whine .
Parsing [sent. 13046 len. 9]: ` Pay five shillings for you indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 13047 len. 23]: Miss Wren proceeded ; ` how many hours do you suppose it costs me to earn five shillings , you imfamous boy ?
Parsing [sent. 13048 len. 16]: -- Do n't cry like that , or I 'll throw a doll at you .
Parsing [sent. 13049 len. 8]: Pay five shillings fine for you indeed .
Parsing [sent. 13050 len. 10]: Fine in more ways than one , I think !
Parsing [sent. 13051 len. 18]: I 'd give the dustman five shillings , to carry you off in the dust cart . '
Parsing [sent. 13052 len. 11]: ` No , no , ' pleaded the absurd creature .
Parsing [sent. 13053 len. 4]: ` Please ! '
Parsing [sent. 13054 len. 26]: ` He 's enough to break his mother 's heart , is this boy , ' said Miss Wren , half appealing to Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 13055 len. 9]: I wish I had never brought him up .
Parsing [sent. 13056 len. 20]: He 'd be sharper than a serpent 's tooth , if he was n't as dull as ditch water .
Parsing [sent. 13057 len. 4]: Look at him .
Parsing [sent. 13058 len. 12]: There 's a pretty object for a parent 's eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 13059 len. 36]: Assuredly , in his worse than swinish state -LRB- for swine at least fatten on their guzzling , and make themselves good to eat -RRB- , he was a pretty object for any eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 13060 len. 71]: A muddling and a swipey old child , ' said Miss Wren , rating him with great severity , ` fit for nothing but to be preserved in the liquor that destroys him , and put in a great glass bottle as a sight for other swipey children of his own pattern , -- if he has no consideration for his liver , has he none for his mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 13061 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 13062 len. 7]: Deration , oh do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 13063 len. 8]: cried the subject of these angry remarks .
Parsing [sent. 13064 len. 14]: ` Oh do n't and oh do n't , ' pursued Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 13065 len. 9]: ` It 's oh do and oh do .
Parsing [sent. 13066 len. 6]: And why do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13067 len. 8]: ` Wo n't do so any more .
Parsing [sent. 13068 len. 4]: Wo n't indeed .
Parsing [sent. 13069 len. 3]: Pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 13070 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 13071 len. 12]: said Miss Wren , covering her eyes with her hand . '
Parsing [sent. 13072 len. 9]: I ca n't bear to look at you .
Parsing [sent. 13073 len. 11]: Go up stairs and get me my bonnet and shawl .
Parsing [sent. 13074 len. 27]: Make yourself useful in some way , bad boy , and let me have your room instead of your company , for one half minute . '
Parsing [sent. 13075 len. 30]: Obeying her , he shambled out , and Eugene Wrayburn saw the tears exude from between the little creature 's fingers as she kept her hand before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13076 len. 19]: He was sorry , but his sympathy did not move his carelessness to do anything but feel sorry .
Parsing [sent. 13077 len. 50]: ` I 'm going to the Italian Opera to try on , ' said Miss Wren , taking away her hand after a little while , and laughing satirically to hide that she had been crying ; ' I must see your back before I go , Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 13078 len. 22]: Let me first tell you , once for all , that it 's of no use your paying visits to me .
Parsing [sent. 13079 len. 26]: You would n't get what you want , of me , no , not if you brought pincers with you to tear it out . '
Parsing [sent. 13080 len. 18]: ` Are you so obstinate on the subject of a doll 's dress for my godchild ? '
Parsing [sent. 13081 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 13082 len. 16]: returned Miss Wren with a hitch of her chin , ' I am so obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 13083 len. 21]: And of course it 's on the subject of a doll 's dress -- or ADdress -- whichever you like .
Parsing [sent. 13084 len. 8]: Get along and give it up ! '
Parsing [sent. 13085 len. 18]: Her degraded charge had come back , and was standing behind her with the bonnet and shawl .
Parsing [sent. 13086 len. 18]: ` Give 'em to me and get back into your corner , you naughty old thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 13087 len. 11]: said Miss Wren , as she turned and espied him .
Parsing [sent. 13088 len. 12]: ` No , no , I wo n't have your help .
Parsing [sent. 13089 len. 9]: Go into your corner , this minute ! '
Parsing [sent. 13090 len. 72]: The miserable man , feebly rubbing the back of his faltering hands downward from the wrists , shuffled on to his post of disgrace ; but not without a curious glance at Eugene in passing him , accompanied with what seemed as if it might have been an action of his elbow , if any action of any limb or joint he had , would have answered truly to his will .
Parsing [sent. 13091 len. 38]: Taking no more particular notice of him than instinctively falling away from the disagreeable contact , Eugene , with a lazy compliment or so to Miss Wren , begged leave to light his cigar , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 13092 len. 32]: ` Now you prodigal old son , ' said Jenny , shaking her head and her emphatic little forefinger at her burden , ` you sit there till I come back .
Parsing [sent. 13093 len. 26]: You dare to move out of your corner for a single instant while I 'm gone , and I 'll know the reason why . '
Parsing [sent. 13094 len. 39]: With this admonition , she blew her work candles out , leaving him to the light of the fire , and , taking her big door-key in her pocket and her crutch-stick in her hand , marched off .
Parsing [sent. 13095 len. 33]: Eugene lounged slowly towards the Temple , smoking his cigar , but saw no more of the dolls ' dressmaker , through the accident of their taking opposite sides of the street .
Parsing [sent. 13096 len. 43]: He lounged along moodily , and stopped at Charing Cross to look about him , with as little interest in the crowd as any man might take , and was lounging on again , when a most unexpected object caught his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13097 len. 21]: No less an object than Jenny Wren 's bad boy trying to make up his mind to cross the road .
Parsing [sent. 13098 len. 46]: A more ridiculous and feeble spectacle than this tottering wretch making unsteady sallies into the roadway , and as often staggering back again , oppressed by terrors of vehicles that were a long way off or were nowhere , the streets could not have shown .
Parsing [sent. 13099 len. 43]: Over and over again , when the course was perfectly clear , he set out , got half way , described a loop , turned , and went back again ; when he might have crossed and re-crossed half a dozen times .
Parsing [sent. 13100 len. 35]: Then , he would stand shivering on the edge of the pavement , looking up the street and looking down , while scores of people jostled him , and crossed , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 13101 len. 47]: Stimulated in course of time by the sight of so many successes , he would make another sally , make another loop , would all but have his foot on the opposite pavement , would see or imagine something coming , and would stagger back again .
Parsing [sent. 13102 len. 63]: There , he would stand making spasmodic preparations as if for a great leap , and at last would decide on a start at precisely the wrong moment , and would be roared at by drivers , and would shrink back once more , and stand in the old spot shivering , with the whole of the proceedings to go through again .
Parsing [sent. 13103 len. 37]: ` It strikes me , ' remarked Eugene coolly , after watching him for some minutes , ` that my friend is likely to be rather behind time if he has any appointment on hand . '
Parsing [sent. 13104 len. 15]: With which remark he strolled on , and took no further thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 13105 len. 17]: Lightwood was at home when he got to the Chambers , and had dined alone there .
Parsing [sent. 13106 len. 34]: Eugene drew a chair to the fire by which he was having his wine and reading the evening paper , and brought a glass , and filled it for good fellowship 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 13107 len. 28]: ` My dear Mortimer , you are the express picture of contented industry , reposing -LRB- on credit -RRB- after the virtuous labours of the day . '
Parsing [sent. 13108 len. 18]: ` My dear Eugene , you are the express picture of discontented idleness not reposing at all .
Parsing [sent. 13109 len. 7]: Where have you been ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13110 len. 13]: I have been , ' replied Wrayburn , ' -- about town .
Parsing [sent. 13111 len. 28]: I have turned up at the present juncture , with the intention of consulting my highly intelligent and respected solicitor on the position of my affairs . '
Parsing [sent. 13112 len. 22]: ` Your highly intelligent and respect solicitor is of opinion that your affairs are in a bad way , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 13113 len. 46]: ` Though whether , ' said Eugene thoughtfully , ` that can be intelligently said , now , of the affairs of a client who has nothing to lose and who can not possibly be made to pay , may be open to question . '
Parsing [sent. 13114 len. 14]: ` You have fallen into the hands of the Jews , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 13115 len. 39]: ` My dear boy , ' returned the debtor , very composedly taking up his glass , ` having previously fallen into the hands of some of the Christians , I can bear it with philosophy . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13116 len. 21]: I have had an interview to-day , Eugene , with a Jew , who seems determined to press us hard .
Parsing [sent. 13117 len. 9]: Quite a Shylock , and quite a Patriarch .
Parsing [sent. 13118 len. 15]: A picturesque grey-headed and grey-bearded old Jew , in a shovel-hat and gaberdine . '
Parsing [sent. 13119 len. 24]: ` Not , ' said Eugene , pausing in setting down his glass , ` surely not my worthy friend Mr Aaron ? '
Parsing [sent. 13120 len. 8]: ` He calls himself Mr Riah . '
Parsing [sent. 13121 len. 40]: ` By-the-by , ' said Eugene , ` it comes into my mind that -- no doubt with an instinctive desire to receive him into the bosom of our Church -- I gave him the name of Aaron ! '
Parsing [sent. 13122 len. 17]: ` Eugene , Eugene , ' returned Lightwood , ` you are more ridiculous than usual .
Parsing [sent. 13123 len. 6]: Say what you mean . '
Parsing [sent. 13124 len. 49]: ` Merely , my dear fellow , that I have the honour and pleasure of a speaking acquaintance with such a Patriarch as you describe , and that I address him as Mr Aaron , because it appears to me Hebraic , expressive , appropriate , and complimentary .
Parsing [sent. 13125 len. 19]: Notwithstanding which strong reasons for its being his name , it may not be his name . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13126 len. 20]: I believe you are the absurdest man on the face of the earth , ' said Lightwood , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 13127 len. 9]: ` Not at all , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 13128 len. 9]: Did he mention that he knew me ? '
Parsing [sent. 13129 len. 5]: ` He did not .
Parsing [sent. 13130 len. 15]: He only said of you that he expected to be paid by you . '
Parsing [sent. 13131 len. 17]: ` Which looks , ' remarked Eugene with much gravity , ` like NOT knowing me .
Parsing [sent. 13132 len. 32]: I hope it may not be my worthy friend Mr Aaron , for , to tell you the truth , Mortimer , I doubt he may have a prepossession against me .
Parsing [sent. 13133 len. 15]: I strongly suspect him of having had a hand in spiriting away Lizzie . '
Parsing [sent. 13134 len. 22]: ` Everything , ' returned Lightwood impatiently , ` seems , by a fatality , to bring us round to Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 13135 len. 14]: `` About town '' meant about Lizzie , just now , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 13136 len. 27]: ` My solicitor , do you know , ' observed Eugene , turning round to the furniture , ` is a man of infinite discernment ! '
Parsing [sent. 13137 len. 8]: ` Did it not , Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 13138 len. 8]: ` Yes it did , Mortimer . '
Parsing [sent. 13139 len. 17]: ` And yet , Eugene , you know you do not really care for her . '
Parsing [sent. 13140 len. 31]: Eugene Wrayburn rose , and put his hands in his pockets , and stood with a foot on the fender , indolently rocking his body and looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 13141 len. 15]: After a prolonged pause , he replied : ' I do n't know that .
Parsing [sent. 13142 len. 18]: I must ask you not to say that , as if we took it for granted . '
Parsing [sent. 13143 len. 21]: ` But if you do care for her , so much the more should you leave her to herself . '
Parsing [sent. 13144 len. 18]: Having again paused as before , Eugene said : ' I do n't know that , either .
Parsing [sent. 13145 len. 4]: But tell me .
Parsing [sent. 13146 len. 19]: Did you ever see me take so much trouble about anything , as about this disappearance of hers ?
Parsing [sent. 13147 len. 7]: I ask , for information . '
Parsing [sent. 13148 len. 12]: ` My dear Eugene , I wish I ever had ! '
Parsing [sent. 13149 len. 6]: ` Then you have not ?
Parsing [sent. 13150 len. 3]: Just so .
Parsing [sent. 13151 len. 6]: You confirm my own impression .
Parsing [sent. 13152 len. 10]: Does that look as if I cared for her ?
Parsing [sent. 13153 len. 8]: I ask , for information . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13154 len. 13]: I asked YOU for information , Eugene , ' said Mortimer reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 13155 len. 15]: ` Dear boy , I know it , but I ca n't give it .
Parsing [sent. 13156 len. 5]: I thirst for information .
Parsing [sent. 13157 len. 5]: What do I mean ?
Parsing [sent. 13158 len. 23]: If my taking so much trouble to recover her does not mean that I care for her , what does it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 13159 len. 21]: `` If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper , where 's the peck , '' & c. ? '
Parsing [sent. 13160 len. 29]: Though he said this gaily , he said it with a perplexed and inquisitive face , as if he actually did not know what to make of himself .
Parsing [sent. 13161 len. 24]: ` Look on to the end -- ' Lightwood was beginning to remonstrate , when he caught at the words : ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 13162 len. 3]: See now !
Parsing [sent. 13163 len. 10]: That 's exactly what I am incapable of doing .
Parsing [sent. 13164 len. 14]: How very acute you are , Mortimer , in finding my weak place !
Parsing [sent. 13165 len. 43]: When we were at school together , I got up my lessons at the last moment , day by day and bit by bit ; now we are out in life together , I get up my lessons in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 13166 len. 39]: In the present task I have not got beyond this : -- I am bent on finding Lizzie , and I mean to find her , and I will take any means of finding her that offer themselves .
Parsing [sent. 13167 len. 12]: Fair means or foul means , are all alike to me .
Parsing [sent. 13168 len. 12]: I ask you -- for information -- what does that mean ?
Parsing [sent. 13169 len. 20]: When I have found her I may ask you -- also for information -- what do I mean now ?
Parsing [sent. 13170 len. 20]: But it would be premature in this stage , and it 's not the character of my mind . '
Parsing [sent. 13171 len. 62]: Lightwood was shaking his head over the air with which his friend held forth thus -- an air so whimsically open and argumentative as almost to deprive what he said of the appearance of evasion -- when a shuffling was heard at the outer door , and then an undecided knock , as though some hand were groping for the knocker .
Parsing [sent. 13172 len. 40]: ` The frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood , ' said Eugene , ` whom I should be delighted to pitch from this elevation into the churchyard below , without any intermediate ceremonies , have probably turned the lamp out .
Parsing [sent. 13173 len. 14]: I am on duty to-night , and will see to the door . '
Parsing [sent. 13174 len. 67]: His friend had barely had time to recall the unprecedented gleam of determination with which he had spoken of finding this girl , and which had faded out of him with the breath of the spoken words , when Eugene came back , ushering in a most disgraceful shadow of a man , shaking from head to foot , and clothed in shabby grease and smear .
Parsing [sent. 13175 len. 33]: ` This interesting gentleman , ' said Eugene , ` is the son -- the occasionally rather trying son , for he has his failings -- of a lady of my acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 13176 len. 8]: My dear Mortimer -- Mr Dolls . '
Parsing [sent. 13177 len. 34]: Eugene had no idea what his name was , knowing the little dressmaker 's to be assumed , but presented him with easy confidence under the first appellation that his associations suggested . '
Parsing [sent. 13178 len. 42]: I gather , my dear Mortimer , ' pursued Eugene , as Lightwood stared at the obscene visitor , ` from the manner of Mr Dolls -- which is occasionally complicated -- that he desires to make some communication to me .
Parsing [sent. 13179 len. 28]: I have mentioned to Mr Dolls that you and I are on terms of confidence , and have requested Mr Dolls to develop his views here . '
Parsing [sent. 13180 len. 30]: The wretched object being much embarrassed by holding what remained of his hat , Eugene airily tossed it to the door , and put him down in a chair .
Parsing [sent. 13181 len. 33]: ` It will be necessary , I think , ' he observed , ` to wind up Mr Dolls , before anything to any mortal purpose can be got out of him .
Parsing [sent. 13182 len. 9]: Brandy , Mr Dolls , or -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 13183 len. 11]: ` Threepenn ` orth Rum , ' said Mr Dolls .
Parsing [sent. 13184 len. 35]: A judiciously small quantity of the spirit was given him in a wineglass , and he began to convey it to his mouth , with all kinds of falterings and gyrations on the road .
Parsing [sent. 13185 len. 18]: ` The nerves of Mr Dolls , ' remarked Eugene to Lightwood , ` are considerably unstrung .
Parsing [sent. 13186 len. 14]: And I deem it on the whole expedient to fumigate Mr Dolls . '
Parsing [sent. 13187 len. 58]: He took the shovel from the grate , sprinkled a few live ashes on it , and from a box on the chimney-piece took a few pastiles , which he set upon them ; then , with great composure began placidly waving the shovel in front of Mr Dolls , to cut him off from his company .
Parsing [sent. 13188 len. 9]: ` Lord bless my soul , Eugene ! '
Parsing [sent. 13189 len. 14]: cried Lightwood , laughing again , ` what a mad fellow you are !
Parsing [sent. 13190 len. 10]: Why does this creature come to see you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13191 len. 16]: ` We shall hear , ' said Wrayburn , very observant of his face withal .
Parsing [sent. 13192 len. 4]: ` Now then .
Parsing [sent. 13193 len. 3]: Speak out .
Parsing [sent. 13194 len. 5]: Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 13195 len. 7]: State your business , Dolls . '
Parsing [sent. 13196 len. 5]: ` Mist Wrayburn ! '
Parsing [sent. 13197 len. 9]: said the visitor , thickly and huskily . '
Parsing [sent. 13198 len. 10]: -- 'T IS Mist Wrayburn , ai n't ? '
Parsing [sent. 13199 len. 5]: With a stupid stare .
Parsing [sent. 13200 len. 6]: ` Of course it is .
Parsing [sent. 13201 len. 4]: Look at me .
Parsing [sent. 13202 len. 6]: What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 13203 len. 17]: Mr Dolls collapsed in his chair , and faintly said ` Threepenn ` orth Rum . '
Parsing [sent. 13204 len. 20]: ` Will you do me the favour , my dear Mortimer , to wind up Mr Dolls again ? '
Parsing [sent. 13205 len. 4]: said Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 13206 len. 8]: I am occupied with the fumigation . '
Parsing [sent. 13207 len. 21]: A similar quantity was poured into his glass , and he got it to his lips by similar circuitous ways .
Parsing [sent. 13208 len. 24]: Having drunk it , Mr Dolls , with an evident fear of running down again unless he made haste , proceeded to business .
Parsing [sent. 13209 len. 4]: ` Mist Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 13210 len. 10]: Tried to nudge you , but you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 13211 len. 5]: You want that drection .
Parsing [sent. 13212 len. 9]: You want t ` know where she lives .
Parsing [sent. 13213 len. 6]: DO you Mist Wrayburn ? '
Parsing [sent. 13214 len. 20]: With a glance at his friend , Eugene replied to the question sternly , ' I do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13215 len. 36]: I am er man , ' said Mr Dolls , trying to smite himself on the breast , but bringing his hand to bear upon the vicinity of his eye , ` er do it .
Parsing [sent. 13216 len. 9]: I am er man er do it . '
Parsing [sent. 13217 len. 10]: ` What are you the man to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 13218 len. 6]: demanded Eugene , still sternly .
Parsing [sent. 13219 len. 8]: ` Er give up that drection . '
Parsing [sent. 13220 len. 7]: ` Have you got it ? '
Parsing [sent. 13221 len. 47]: With a most laborious attempt at pride and dignity , Mr Dolls rolled his head for some time , awakening the highest expectations , and then answered , as if it were the happiest point that could possibly be expected of him : ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 13222 len. 8]: ` What do you mean then ? '
Parsing [sent. 13223 len. 23]: Mr Dolls , collapsing in the drowsiest manner after his late intellectual triumph , replied : ` Threepenn ` orth Rum . '
Parsing [sent. 13224 len. 21]: ` Wind him up again , my dear Mortimer , ' said Wrayburn ; ` wind him up again . '
Parsing [sent. 13225 len. 33]: ` Eugene , Eugene , ' urged Lightwood in a low voice , as he complied , ` can you stoop to the use of such an instrument as this ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13226 len. 31]: I said , ' was the reply , made with that former gleam of determination , ` that I would find her out by any means , fair or foul .
Parsing [sent. 13227 len. 27]: These are foul , and I 'll take them -- if I am not first tempted to break the head of Mr Dolls with the fumigator .
Parsing [sent. 13228 len. 6]: Can you get the direction ?
Parsing [sent. 13229 len. 5]: Do you mean that ?
Parsing [sent. 13230 len. 2]: Speak !
Parsing [sent. 13231 len. 16]: If that 's what you have come for , say how much you want . '
Parsing [sent. 13232 len. 14]: ` Ten shillings -- Threepenn ` orths Rum , ' said Mr Dolls .
Parsing [sent. 13233 len. 7]: ` You shall have it . '
Parsing [sent. 13234 len. 21]: ` Fifteen shillings -- Threepenn ` orths Rum , ' said Mr Dolls , making an attempt to stiffen himself .
Parsing [sent. 13235 len. 6]: ` You shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 13236 len. 4]: Stop at that .
Parsing [sent. 13237 len. 12]: How will you get the direction you talk of ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13238 len. 21]: I am er man , ' said Mr Dolls , with majesty , ` er get it , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 13239 len. 13]: ` How will you get it , I ask you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13240 len. 10]: I am ill-used vidual , ' said Mr Dolls .
Parsing [sent. 13241 len. 8]: ` Blown up morning t ` night .
Parsing [sent. 13242 len. 3]: Called names .
Parsing [sent. 13243 len. 16]: She makes Mint money , sir , and never stands Threepenn ` orth Rum . '
Parsing [sent. 13244 len. 23]: ` Get on , ' rejoined Eugene , tapping his palsied head with the fireshovel , as it sank on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 13245 len. 6]: ` What comes next ? '
Parsing [sent. 13246 len. 60]: Making a dignified attempt to gather himself together , but , as it were , dropping half a dozen pieces of himself while he tried in vain to pick up one , Mr Dolls , swaying his head from side to side , regarded his questioner with what he supposed to be a haughty smile and a scornful glance .
Parsing [sent. 13247 len. 11]: ` She looks upon me as mere child , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13248 len. 8]: I am NOT mere child , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13249 len. 2]: Man .
Parsing [sent. 13250 len. 3]: Man talent .
Parsing [sent. 13251 len. 5]: Lerrers pass betwixt 'em .
Parsing [sent. 13252 len. 3]: Postman lerrers .
Parsing [sent. 13253 len. 15]: Easy for man talent er get drection , as get his own drection . '
Parsing [sent. 13254 len. 21]: ` Get it then , ' said Eugene ; adding very heartily under his breath , ' -- You Brute !
Parsing [sent. 13255 len. 43]: Get it , and bring it here to me , and earn the money for sixty threepenn ` orths of rum , and drink them all , one a top of another , and drink yourself dead with all possible expedition . '
Parsing [sent. 13256 len. 31]: The latter clauses of these special instructions he addressed to the fire , as he gave it back the ashes he had taken from it , and replaced the shovel .
Parsing [sent. 13257 len. 51]: Mr Dolls now struck out the highly unexpected discovery that he had been insulted by Lightwood , and stated his desire to ` have it out with him ' on the spot , and defied him to come on , upon the liberal terms of a sovereign to a halfpenny .
Parsing [sent. 13258 len. 16]: Mr Dolls then fell a crying , and then exhibited a tendency to fall asleep .
Parsing [sent. 13259 len. 26]: This last manifestation as by far the most alarming , by reason of its threatening his prolonged stay on the premises , necessitated vigorous measures .
Parsing [sent. 13260 len. 44]: Eugene picked up his worn-out hat with the tongs , clapped it on his head , and , taking him by the collar -- all this at arm 's length -- conducted him down stairs and out of the precincts into Fleet Street .
Parsing [sent. 13261 len. 12]: There , he turned his face westward , and left him .
Parsing [sent. 13262 len. 19]: When he got back , Lightwood was standing over the fire , brooding in a sufficiently low-spirited manner .
Parsing [sent. 13263 len. 27]: ` I 'll wash my hands of Mr Dolls physically -- ' said Eugene , ` and be with you again directly , Mortimer . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13264 len. 23]: I would much prefer , ' retorted Mortimer , ` your washing your hands of Mr Dolls , morally , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 13265 len. 25]: ` So would I , ' said Eugene ; ` but you see , dear boy , I ca n't do without him . '
Parsing [sent. 13266 len. 33]: In a minute or two he resumed his chair , as perfectly unconcerned as usual , and rallied his friend on having so narrowly escaped the prowess of their muscular visitor . '
Parsing [sent. 13267 len. 15]: I ca n't be amused on this theme , ' said Mortimer , restlessly .
Parsing [sent. 13268 len. 18]: ` You can make almost any theme amusing to me , Eugene , but not this . '
Parsing [sent. 13269 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 13270 len. 22]: cried Eugene , ' I am a little ashamed of it myself , and therefore let us change the subject . '
Parsing [sent. 13271 len. 11]: ` It is so deplorably underhanded , ' said Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 13272 len. 18]: ` It is so unworthy of you , this setting on of such a shameful scout . '
Parsing [sent. 13273 len. 8]: ` We have changed the subject ! '
Parsing [sent. 13274 len. 5]: exclaimed Eugene , airily .
Parsing [sent. 13275 len. 13]: ` We have found a new one in that word , scout .
Parsing [sent. 13276 len. 29]: Do n't be like Patience on a mantelpiece frowning at Dolls , but sit down , and I 'll tell you something that you really will find amusing .
Parsing [sent. 13277 len. 4]: Take a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 13278 len. 6]: Look at this of mine .
Parsing [sent. 13279 len. 21]: I light it -- draw one puff -- breathe the smoke out -- there it goes -- it 's Dolls !
Parsing [sent. 13280 len. 15]: -- it 's gone -- and being gone you are a man again . '
Parsing [sent. 13281 len. 29]: ` Your subject , ' said Mortimer , after lighting a cigar , and comforting himself with a whiff or two , ` was scouts , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 13282 len. 3]: ` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 13283 len. 29]: Is n't it droll that I never go out after dark , but I find myself attended , always by one scout , and often by two ? '
Parsing [sent. 13284 len. 35]: Lightwood took his cigar from his lips in surprise , and looked at his friend , as if with a latent suspicion that there must be a jest or hidden meaning in his words .
Parsing [sent. 13285 len. 35]: ` On my honour , no , ' said Wrayburn , answering the look and smiling carelessly ; ' I do n't wonder at your supposing so , but on my honour , no .
Parsing [sent. 13286 len. 6]: I say what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 13287 len. 35]: I never go out after dark , but I find myself in the ludicrous situation of being followed and observed at a distance , always by one scout , and often by two . '
Parsing [sent. 13288 len. 8]: ` Are you sure , Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 13289 len. 3]: ` Sure ?
Parsing [sent. 13290 len. 11]: My dear boy , they are always the same . '
Parsing [sent. 13291 len. 10]: ` But there 's no process out against you .
Parsing [sent. 13292 len. 5]: The Jews only threaten .
Parsing [sent. 13293 len. 5]: They have done nothing .
Parsing [sent. 13294 len. 14]: Besides , they know where to find you , and I represent you .
Parsing [sent. 13295 len. 6]: Why take the trouble ? '
Parsing [sent. 13296 len. 7]: ` Observe the legal mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 13297 len. 17]: remarked Eugene , turning round to the furniture again , with an air of indolent rapture .
Parsing [sent. 13298 len. 30]: ` Observe the dyer 's hand , assimilating itself to what it works in , -- or would work in , if anybody would give it anything to do .
Parsing [sent. 13299 len. 8]: Respected solicitor , it 's not that .
Parsing [sent. 13300 len. 6]: The schoolmaster 's abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 13301 len. 5]: ` The schoolmaster ? '
Parsing [sent. 13302 len. 3]: ` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 13303 len. 10]: Sometimes the schoolmaster and the pupil are both abroad .
Parsing [sent. 13304 len. 10]: Why , how soon you rust in my absence !
Parsing [sent. 13305 len. 6]: You do n't understand yet ?
Parsing [sent. 13306 len. 8]: Those fellows who were here one night .
Parsing [sent. 13307 len. 20]: They are the scouts I speak of , as doing me the honour to attend me after dark . '
Parsing [sent. 13308 len. 10]: ` How long has this been going on ? '
Parsing [sent. 13309 len. 15]: asked Lightwood , opposing a serious face to the laugh of his friend . '
Parsing [sent. 13310 len. 16]: I apprehend it has been going on , ever since a certain person went off .
Parsing [sent. 13311 len. 25]: Probably , it had been going on some little time before I noticed it : which would bring it to about that time . '
Parsing [sent. 13312 len. 14]: ` Do you think they suppose you to have inveigled her away ? '
Parsing [sent. 13313 len. 27]: ` My dear Mortimer , you know the absorbing nature of my professional occupations ; I really have not had leisure to think about it . '
Parsing [sent. 13314 len. 9]: ` Have you asked them what they want ?
Parsing [sent. 13315 len. 5]: Have you objected ? '
Parsing [sent. 13316 len. 21]: ` Why should I ask them what they want , dear fellow , when I am indifferent what they want ?
Parsing [sent. 13317 len. 13]: Why should I express objection , when I do n't object ? '
Parsing [sent. 13318 len. 9]: ` You are in your most reckless mood .
Parsing [sent. 13319 len. 30]: But you called the situation just now , a ludicrous one ; and most men object to that , even those who are utterly indifferent to everything else . '
Parsing [sent. 13320 len. 14]: ` You charm me , Mortimer , with your reading of my weaknesses .
Parsing [sent. 13321 len. 18]: -LRB- By-the-by , that very word , Reading , in its critical use , always charms me .
Parsing [sent. 13322 len. 50]: An actress 's Reading of a chambermaid , a dancer 's Reading of a hornpipe , a singer 's Reading of a song , a marine painter 's Reading of the sea , the kettle-drum 's Reading of an instrumental passage , are phrases ever youthful and delightful . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 13323 len. 9]: I was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses .
Parsing [sent. 13324 len. 25]: I own to the weakness of objecting to occupy a ludicrous position , and therefore I transfer the position to the scouts . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13325 len. 33]: I wish , Eugene , you would speak a little more soberly and plainly , if it were only out of consideration for my feeling less at ease than you do . '
Parsing [sent. 13326 len. 15]: ` Then soberly and plainly , Mortimer , I goad the schoolmaster to madness .
Parsing [sent. 13327 len. 31]: I make the schoolmaster so ridiculous , and so aware of being made ridiculous , that I see him chafe and fret at every pore when we cross one another .
Parsing [sent. 13328 len. 22]: The amiable occupation has been the solace of my life , since I was baulked in the manner unnecessary to recall .
Parsing [sent. 13329 len. 8]: I have derived inexpressible comfort from it .
Parsing [sent. 13330 len. 29]: I do it thus : I stroll out after dark , stroll a little way , look in at a window and furtively look out for the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 13331 len. 23]: Sooner or later , I perceive the schoolmaster on the watch ; sometimes accompanied by his hopeful pupil ; oftener , pupil-less .
Parsing [sent. 13332 len. 17]: Having made sure of his watching me , I tempt him on , all over London .
Parsing [sent. 13333 len. 21]: One night I go east , another night north , in a few nights I go all round the compass .
Parsing [sent. 13334 len. 24]: Sometimes , I walk ; sometimes , I proceed in cabs , draining the pocket of the schoolmaster who then follows in cabs .
Parsing [sent. 13335 len. 15]: I study and get up abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the day .
Parsing [sent. 13336 len. 37]: With Venetian mystery I seek those No Thoroughfares at night , glide into them by means of dark courts , tempt the schoolmaster to follow , turn suddenly , and catch him before he can retreat .
Parsing [sent. 13337 len. 22]: Then we face one another , and I pass him as unaware of his existence , and he undergoes grinding torments .
Parsing [sent. 13338 len. 31]: Similarly , I walk at a great pace down a short street , rapidly turn the corner , and , getting out of his view , as rapidly turn back .
Parsing [sent. 13339 len. 23]: I catch him coming on post , again pass him as unaware of his existence , and again he undergoes grinding torments .
Parsing [sent. 13340 len. 24]: Night after night his disappointment is acute , but hope springs eternal in the scholastic breast , and he follows me again to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 13341 len. 18]: Thus I enjoy the pleasures of the chase , and derive great benefit from the healthful exercise .
Parsing [sent. 13342 len. 25]: When I do not enjoy the pleasures of the chase , for anything I know he watches at the Temple Gate all night . '
Parsing [sent. 13343 len. 21]: ` This is an extraordinary story , ' observed Lightwood , who had heard it out with serious attention . '
Parsing [sent. 13344 len. 7]: I do n't like it . '
Parsing [sent. 13345 len. 21]: ` You are a little hipped , dear fellow , ' said Eugene ; ` you have been too sedentary .
Parsing [sent. 13346 len. 10]: Come and enjoy the pleasures of the chase . '
Parsing [sent. 13347 len. 14]: ` Do you mean that you believe he is watching now ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13348 len. 10]: I have not the slightest doubt he is . '
Parsing [sent. 13349 len. 9]: ` Have you seen him to-night ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13350 len. 29]: I forgot to look for him when I was last out , ' returned Eugene with the calmest indifference ; ` but I dare say he was there .
Parsing [sent. 13351 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 13352 len. 12]: Be a British sportsman and enjoy the pleasures of the chase .
Parsing [sent. 13353 len. 7]: It will do you good . '
Parsing [sent. 13354 len. 12]: Lightwood hesitated ; but , yielding to his curiosity , rose .
Parsing [sent. 13355 len. 4]: ` Bravo ! '
Parsing [sent. 13356 len. 6]: cried Eugene , rising too .
Parsing [sent. 13357 len. 17]: ` Or , if Yoicks would be in better keeping , consider that I said Yoicks .
Parsing [sent. 13358 len. 14]: Look to your feet , Mortimer , for we shall try your boots .
Parsing [sent. 13359 len. 30]: When you are ready , I am -- need I say with a Hey Ho Chivey , and likewise with a Hark Forward , Hark Forward , Tantivy ? '
Parsing [sent. 13360 len. 8]: ` Will nothing make you serious ? '
Parsing [sent. 13361 len. 9]: said Mortimer , laughing through his gravity . '
Parsing [sent. 13362 len. 30]: I am always serious , but just now I am a little excited by the glorious fact that a southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim a hunting evening .
Parsing [sent. 13363 len. 2]: Ready ?
Parsing [sent. 13364 len. 2]: So .
Parsing [sent. 13365 len. 16]: We turn out the lamp and shut the door , and take the field . '
Parsing [sent. 13366 len. 34]: As the two friends passed out of the Temple into the public street , Eugene demanded with a show of courteous patronage in which direction Mortimer would you like the run to be ?
Parsing [sent. 13367 len. 26]: ` There is a rather difficult country about Bethnal Green , ' said Eugene , ` and we have not taken in that direction lately .
Parsing [sent. 13368 len. 9]: What is your opinion of Bethnal Green ? '
Parsing [sent. 13369 len. 11]: Mortimer assented to Bethnal Green , and they turned eastward .
Parsing [sent. 13370 len. 31]: ` Now , when we come to St Paul 's churchyard , ' pursued Eugene , ` we 'll loiter artfully , and I 'll show you the schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 13371 len. 33]: But , they both saw him , before they got there ; alone , and stealing after them in the shadow of the houses , on the opposite side of the way .
Parsing [sent. 13372 len. 16]: ` Get your wind , ' said Eugene , ` for I am off directly .
Parsing [sent. 13373 len. 25]: Does it occur to you that the boys of Merry England will begin to deteriorate in an educational light , if this lasts long ?
Parsing [sent. 13374 len. 12]: The schoolmaster ca n't attend to me and the boys too .
Parsing [sent. 13375 len. 4]: Got your wind ?
Parsing [sent. 13376 len. 5]: I am off ! '
Parsing [sent. 13377 len. 99]: At what a rate he went , to breathe the schoolmaster ; and how he then lounged and loitered , to put his patience to another kind of wear ; what preposterous ways he took , with no other object on earth than to disappoint and punish him ; and how he wore him out by every piece of ingenuity that his eccentric humour could devise ; all this Lightwood noted , with a feeling of astonishment that so careless a man could be so wary , and that so idle a man could take so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 13378 len. 61]: At last , far on in the third hour of the pleasures of the chase , when he had brought the poor dogging wretch round again into the City , he twisted Mortimer up a few dark entries , twisted him into a little square court , twisted him sharp round again , and they almost ran against Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 13379 len. 47]: ` And you see , as I was saying , Mortimer , ' remarked Eugene aloud with the utmost coolness , as though there were no one within hearing by themselves : ` and you see , as I was saying -- undergoing grinding torments . '
Parsing [sent. 13380 len. 11]: It was not too strong a phrase for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 13381 len. 86]: Looking like the hunted and not the hunter , baffled , worn , with the exhaustion of deferred hope and consuming hate and anger in his face , whitelipped , wild-eyed , draggle-haired , seamed with jealousy and anger , and torturing himself with the conviction that he showed it all and they exulted in it , he went by them in the dark , like a haggard head suspended in the air : so completely did the force of his expression cancel his figure .
Parsing [sent. 13382 len. 15]: Mortimer Lightwood was not an extraordinarily impressible man , but this face impressed him .
Parsing [sent. 13383 len. 24]: He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of the way home , and more than once when they got home .
Parsing [sent. 13384 len. 37]: They had been abed in their respective rooms two or three hours , when Eugene was partly awakened by hearing a footstep going about , and was fully awakened by seeing Lightwood standing at his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 13385 len. 7]: ` Nothing wrong , Mortimer ? '
Parsing [sent. 13386 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 13387 len. 17]: ` What fancy takes you , then , for walking about in the night ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13388 len. 6]: I am horribly wakeful . '
Parsing [sent. 13389 len. 10]: ` How comes that about , I wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 13390 len. 15]: ` Eugene , I can not lose sight of that fellow 's face . '
Parsing [sent. 13391 len. 4]: ` Odd ! '
Parsing [sent. 13392 len. 12]: said Eugene with a light laugh , ' I can . '
Parsing [sent. 13393 len. 9]: And turned over , and fell asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 13394 len. 34]: Chapter 11 IN THE DARK There was no sleep for Bradley Headstone on that night when Eugene Wrayburn turned so easily in his bed ; there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher .
Parsing [sent. 13395 len. 51]: Bradley consumed the lonely hours , and consumed himself in haunting the spot where his careless rival lay a dreaming ; little Miss Peecher wore them away in listening for the return home of the master of her heart , and in sorrowfully presaging that much was amiss with him .
Parsing [sent. 13396 len. 28]: Yet more was amiss with him than Miss Peecher 's simply arranged little work-box of thoughts , fitted with no gloomy and dark recesses , could hold .
Parsing [sent. 13397 len. 10]: For , the state of the man was murderous .
Parsing [sent. 13398 len. 13]: The state of the man was murderous , and he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 13399 len. 29]: More ; he irritated it , with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body .
Parsing [sent. 13400 len. 39]: Tied up all day with his disciplined show upon him , subdued to the performance of his routine of educational tricks , encircled by a gabbling crowd , he broke loose at night like an ill-tamed wild animal .
Parsing [sent. 13401 len. 33]: Under his daily restraint , it was his compensation , not his trouble , to give a glance towards his state at night , and to the freedom of its being indulged .
Parsing [sent. 13402 len. 29]: If great criminals told the truth -- which , being great criminals , they do not -- they would very rarely tell of their struggles against the crime .
Parsing [sent. 13403 len. 6]: Their struggles are towards it .
Parsing [sent. 13404 len. 18]: They buffet with opposing waves , to gain the bloody shore , not to recede from it .
Parsing [sent. 13405 len. 40]: This man perfectly comprehended that he hated his rival with his strongest and worst forces , and that if he tracked him to Lizzie Hexam , his so doing would never serve himself with her , or serve her .
Parsing [sent. 13406 len. 33]: All his pains were taken , to the end that he might incense himself with the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour , in her place of concealment .
Parsing [sent. 13407 len. 25]: And he knew as well what act of his would follow if he did , as he knew that his mother had borne him .
Parsing [sent. 13408 len. 28]: Granted , that he may not have held it necessary to make express mention to himself of the one familiar truth any more than of the other .
Parsing [sent. 13409 len. 33]: He knew equally well that he fed his wrath and hatred , and that he accumulated provocation and self-justification , by being made the nightly sport of the reckless and insolent Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 13410 len. 28]: Knowing all this , -- and still always going on with infinite endurance , pains , and perseverance , could his dark soul doubt whither he went ?
Parsing [sent. 13411 len. 37]: Baffled , exasperated , and weary , he lingered opposite the Temple gate when it closed on Wrayburn and Lightwood , debating with himself should he go home for that time or should he watch longer .
Parsing [sent. 13412 len. 73]: Possessed in his jealousy by the fixed idea that Wrayburn was in the secret , if it were not altogether of his contriving , Bradley was as confident of getting the better of him at last by sullenly sticking to him , as he would have been -- and often had been -- of mastering any piece of study in the way of his vocation , by the like slow persistent process .
Parsing [sent. 13413 len. 20]: A man of rapid passions and sluggish intelligence , it had served him often and should serve him again .
Parsing [sent. 13414 len. 30]: The suspicion crossed him as he rested in a doorway with his eyes upon the Temple gate , that perhaps she was even concealed in that set of Chambers .
Parsing [sent. 13415 len. 16]: It would furnish another reason for Wrayburn 's purposeless walks , and it might be .
Parsing [sent. 13416 len. 29]: He thought of it and thought of it , until he resolved to steal up the stairs , if the gatekeeper would let him through , and listen .
Parsing [sent. 13417 len. 36]: So , the haggard head suspended in the air flitted across the road , like the spectre of one of the many heads erst hoisted upon neighbouring Temple Bar , and stopped before the watchman .
Parsing [sent. 13418 len. 14]: The watchman looked at it , and asked : ` Who for ? '
Parsing [sent. 13419 len. 5]: ` Mr Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 13420 len. 7]: ` It 's very late . '
Parsing [sent. 13421 len. 17]: ` He came back with Mr Lightwood , I know , near upon two hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 13422 len. 17]: But if he has gone to bed , I 'll put a paper in his letter-box .
Parsing [sent. 13423 len. 5]: I am expected . '
Parsing [sent. 13424 len. 15]: The watchman said no more , but opened the gate , though rather doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 13425 len. 20]: Seeing , however , that the visitor went straight and fast in the right direction , he seemed satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 13426 len. 24]: The haggard head floated up the dark staircase , and softly descended nearer to the floor outside the outer door of the chambers .
Parsing [sent. 13427 len. 13]: The doors of the rooms within , appeared to be standing open .
Parsing [sent. 13428 len. 21]: There were rays of candlelight from one of them , and there was the sound of a footstep going about .
Parsing [sent. 13429 len. 5]: There were two voices .
Parsing [sent. 13430 len. 17]: The words they uttered were not distinguishable , but they were both the voices of men .
Parsing [sent. 13431 len. 24]: In a few moments the voices were silent , and there was no sound of footstep , and the inner light went out .
Parsing [sent. 13432 len. 43]: If Lightwood could have seen the face which kept him awake , staring and listening in the darkness outside the door as he spoke of it , he might have been less disposed to sleep , through the remainder of the night .
Parsing [sent. 13433 len. 16]: ` Not there , ' said Bradley ; ` but she might have been . '
Parsing [sent. 13434 len. 24]: The head arose to its former height from the ground , floated down the staircase again , and passed on to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 13435 len. 12]: A man was standing there , in parley with the watchman .
Parsing [sent. 13436 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 13437 len. 4]: said the watchman .
Parsing [sent. 13438 len. 6]: ` Here he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 13439 len. 16]: Perceiving himself to be the antecedent , Bradley looked from the watchman to the man .
Parsing [sent. 13440 len. 40]: ` This man is leaving a letter for Mr Lightwood , ' the watchman explained , showing it in his hand ; ` and I was mentioning that a person had just gone up to Mr Lightwood 's chambers .
Parsing [sent. 13441 len. 9]: It might be the same business perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 13442 len. 19]: ` No , ' said Bradley , glancing at the man , who was a stranger to him .
Parsing [sent. 13443 len. 44]: ` No , ' the man assented in a surly way ; ` my letter -- it 's wrote by my daughter , but it 's mine -- is about my business , and my business ai n't nobody else 's business . '
Parsing [sent. 13444 len. 31]: As Bradley passed out at the gate with an undecided foot , he heard it shut behind him , and heard the footstep of the man coming after him . ''
Parsing [sent. 13445 len. 40]: Scuse me , ' said the man , who appeared to have been drinking and rather stumbled at him than touched him , to attract his attention : ` but might you be acquainted with the T'other Governor ? '
Parsing [sent. 13446 len. 5]: ` With whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 13447 len. 3]: asked Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 13448 len. 26]: ` With , ' returned the man , pointing backward over his right shoulder with his right thumb , ` the T'other Governor ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13449 len. 9]: I do n't know what you mean . '
Parsing [sent. 13450 len. 20]: ` Why look here , ' hooking his proposition on his left-hand fingers with the forefinger of his right .
Parsing [sent. 13451 len. 10]: ` There 's two Governors , ai n't there ?
Parsing [sent. 13452 len. 21]: One and one , two -- Lawyer Lightwood , my first finger , he 's one , ai n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 13453 len. 16]: Well ; might you be acquainted with my middle finger , the T'other ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13454 len. 30]: I know quite as much of him , ' said Bradley , with a frown and a distant look before him , ` as I want to know . '
Parsing [sent. 13455 len. 4]: ` Hooroar ! '
Parsing [sent. 13456 len. 4]: cried the man .
Parsing [sent. 13457 len. 8]: ` Hooroar T'other t ` other Governor .
Parsing [sent. 13458 len. 4]: Hooroar T'otherest Governor !
Parsing [sent. 13459 len. 10]: I am of your way of thinkin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 13460 len. 15]: ` Do n't make such a noise at this dead hour of the night .
Parsing [sent. 13461 len. 7]: What are you talking about ? '
Parsing [sent. 13462 len. 16]: ` Look here , T'otherest Governor , ' replied the man , becoming hoarsely confidential .
Parsing [sent. 13463 len. 36]: ` The T'other Governor he 's always joked his jokes agin me , owing , as I believe , to my being a honest man as gets my living by the sweat of my brow .
Parsing [sent. 13464 len. 11]: Which he ai n't , and he do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 13465 len. 8]: ` What is that to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 13466 len. 32]: ` T'otherest Governor , ' returned the man in a tone of injured innocence , ` if you do n't care to hear no more , do n't hear no more .
Parsing [sent. 13467 len. 4]: You begun it .
Parsing [sent. 13468 len. 20]: You said , and likeways showed pretty plain , as you war n't by no means friendly to him .
Parsing [sent. 13469 len. 17]: But I do n't seek to force my company nor yet my opinions on no man .
Parsing [sent. 13470 len. 12]: I am a honest man , that 's what I am .
Parsing [sent. 13471 len. 28]: Put me in the dock anywhere -- I do n't care where -- and I says , `` My Lord , I am a honest man . ''
Parsing [sent. 13472 len. 28]: Put me in the witnessbox anywhere -- I do n't care where -- and I says the same to his lordship , and I kisses the book .
Parsing [sent. 13473 len. 13]: I do n't kiss my coat-cuff ; I kisses the book . '
Parsing [sent. 13474 len. 46]: It was not so much in deference to these strong testimonials to character , as in his restless casting about for any way or help towards the discovery on which he was concentrated , that Bradley Headstone replied : ` You need n't take offence .
Parsing [sent. 13475 len. 8]: I did n't mean to stop you .
Parsing [sent. 13476 len. 16]: You were too -- loud in the open street ; that was all . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 13477 len. 32]: Totherest Governor , ' replied Mr Riderhood , mollified and mysterious , ' I know wot it is to be loud , and I know wot it is to be soft .
Parsing [sent. 13478 len. 6]: Nat ` rally I do .
Parsing [sent. 13479 len. 63]: It would be a wonder if I did not , being by the Chris ` en name of Roger , which took it arter my own father , which took it from his own father , though which of our fam ` ly fust took it nat ` ral I will not in any ways mislead you by undertakin ' to say .
Parsing [sent. 13480 len. 30]: And wishing that your elth may be better than your looks , which your inside must be bad indeed if it 's on the footing of your out . '
Parsing [sent. 13481 len. 23]: Startled by the implication that his face revealed too much of his mind , Bradley made an effort to clear his brow .
Parsing [sent. 13482 len. 27]: It might be worth knowing what this strange man 's business was with Lightwood , or Wrayburn , or both , at such an unseasonable hour .
Parsing [sent. 13483 len. 20]: He set himself to find out , for the man might prove to be a messenger between those two .
Parsing [sent. 13484 len. 19]: ` You call at the Temple late , ' he remarked , with a lumbering show of ease .
Parsing [sent. 13485 len. 36]: ` Wish I may die , ' cried Mr Riderhood , with a hoarse laugh , ` if I war n't a goin ' to say the self-same words to you , T'otherest Governor ! '
Parsing [sent. 13486 len. 16]: ` It chanced so with me , ' said Bradley , looking disconcertedly about him .
Parsing [sent. 13487 len. 12]: ` And it chanced so with me , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 13488 len. 10]: ` But I do n't mind telling you how .
Parsing [sent. 13489 len. 7]: Why should I mind telling you ?
Parsing [sent. 13490 len. 26]: I 'm a Deputy Lock-keeper up the river , and I was off duty yes ` day , and I shall be on to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 13491 len. 4]: ` Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 13492 len. 15]: ` Yes , and I come to London to look arter my private affairs .
Parsing [sent. 13493 len. 36]: My private affairs is to get appinted to the Lock as reg ` lar keeper at fust hand , and to have the law of a busted B'low - Bridge steamer which drownded of me .
Parsing [sent. 13494 len. 16]: I ai n't a goin ' to be drownded and not paid for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 13495 len. 15]: Bradley looked at him , as though he were claiming to be a Ghost .
Parsing [sent. 13496 len. 20]: ` The steamer , ' said Mr Riderhood , obstinately , ` run me down and drownded of me .
Parsing [sent. 13497 len. 31]: Interference on the part of other parties brought me round ; but I never asked 'em to bring me round , nor yet the steamer never asked 'em to it .
Parsing [sent. 13498 len. 14]: I mean to be paid for the life as the steamer took . '
Parsing [sent. 13499 len. 18]: ` Was that your business at Mr Lightwood 's chambers in the middle of the night ? '
Parsing [sent. 13500 len. 8]: asked Bradley , eyeing him with distrust .
Parsing [sent. 13501 len. 13]: ` That and to get a writing to be fust-hand Lock Keeper .
Parsing [sent. 13502 len. 17]: A recommendation in writing being looked for , who else ought to give it to me ?
Parsing [sent. 13503 len. 57]: As I says in the letter in my daughter 's hand , with my mark put to it to make it good in law , Who but you , Lawyer Lightwood , ought to hand over this here stifficate , and who but you ought to go in for damages on my account agin the Steamer ?
Parsing [sent. 13504 len. 21]: For -LRB- as I says under my mark -RRB- I have had trouble enough along of you and your friend .
Parsing [sent. 13505 len. 75]: If you , Lawyer Lightwood , had backed me good and true , and if the T'other Governor had took me down correct -LRB- I says under my mark -RRB- , I should have been worth money at the present time , instead of having a barge-load of bad names chucked at me , and being forced to eat my words , which is a unsatisfying sort of food wotever a man 's appetite !
Parsing [sent. 13506 len. 65]: And when you mention the middle of the night , T'otherest Governor , ' growled Mr Riderhood , winding up his monotonous summary of his wrongs , ` throw your eye on this here bundle under my arm , and bear in mind that I 'm a walking back to my Lock , and that the Temple laid upon my line of road . '
Parsing [sent. 13507 len. 23]: Bradley Headstone 's face had changed during this latter recital , and he had observed the speaker with a more sustained attention .
Parsing [sent. 13508 len. 38]: ` Do you know , ' said he , after a pause , during which they walked on side by side , ` that I believe I could tell you your name , if I tried ? '
Parsing [sent. 13509 len. 18]: ` Prove your opinion , ' was the answer , accompanied with a stop and a stare .
Parsing [sent. 13510 len. 4]: ` Try . '
Parsing [sent. 13511 len. 7]: ` Your name is Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 13512 len. 14]: ` I 'm blest if it ai n't , ' returned that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 13513 len. 22]: ` But I do n't know your ` n. ' ` That 's quite another thing , ' said Bradley . '
Parsing [sent. 13514 len. 7]: I never supposed you did . '
Parsing [sent. 13515 len. 15]: As Bradley walked on meditating , the Rogue walked on at his side muttering .
Parsing [sent. 13516 len. 15]: The purport of the muttering was : ` that Rogue Riderhood , by George !
Parsing [sent. 13517 len. 32]: seemed to be made public property on , now , and that every man seemed to think himself free to handle his name as if it was a Street Pump . '
Parsing [sent. 13518 len. 13]: The purport of the meditating was : ` Here is an instrument .
Parsing [sent. 13519 len. 6]: Can I use it ? '
Parsing [sent. 13520 len. 40]: They had walked along the Strand , and into Pall Mall , and had turned up-hill towards Hyde Park Corner ; Bradley Headstone waiting on the pace and lead of Riderhood , and leaving him to indicate the course .
Parsing [sent. 13521 len. 75]: So slow were the schoolmaster 's thoughts , and so indistinct his purposes when they were but tributary to the one absorbing purpose or rather when , like dark trees under a stormy sky , they only lined the long vista at the end of which he saw those two figures of Wrayburn and Lizzie on which his eyes were fixed -- that at least a good half-mile was traversed before he spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 13522 len. 16]: Even then , it was only to ask : ` Where is your Lock ? '
Parsing [sent. 13523 len. 26]: ` Twenty mile and odd -- call it five-and-twenty mile and odd , if you like -- up stream , ' was the sullen reply .
Parsing [sent. 13524 len. 7]: ` How is it called ? '
Parsing [sent. 13525 len. 7]: ` Plashwater Weir Mill Lock . '
Parsing [sent. 13526 len. 14]: ` Suppose I was to offer you five shillings ; what then ? '
Parsing [sent. 13527 len. 15]: ` Why , then , I 'd take it , ' said Mr Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 13528 len. 39]: The schoolmaster put his hand in his pocket , and produced two half-crowns , and placed them in Mr Riderhood 's palm : who stopped at a convenient doorstep to ring them both , before acknowledging their receipt .
Parsing [sent. 13529 len. 27]: ` There 's one thing about you , T'otherest Governor , ' said Riderhood , faring on again , ` as looks well and goes fur .
Parsing [sent. 13530 len. 7]: You 're a ready money man .
Parsing [sent. 13531 len. 30]: Now ; ' when he had carefully pocketed the coins on that side of himself which was furthest from his new friend ; ` what 's this for ? '
Parsing [sent. 13532 len. 5]: ` For you . '
Parsing [sent. 13533 len. 21]: ` Why , o ' course I know THAT , ' said Riderhood , as arguing something that was self-evident .
Parsing [sent. 13534 len. 33]: ` O ' course I know very well as no man in his right senses would suppose as anythink would make me give it up agin when I 'd once got it .
Parsing [sent. 13535 len. 10]: But what do you want for it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13536 len. 11]: I do n't know that I want anything for it .
Parsing [sent. 13537 len. 18]: Or if I do want anything for it , I do n't know what it is . '
Parsing [sent. 13538 len. 21]: Bradley gave this answer in a stolid , vacant , and self-communing manner , which Mr Riderhood found very extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 13539 len. 32]: ` You have no goodwill towards this Wrayburn , ' said Bradley , coming to the name in a reluctant and forced way , as if he were dragged to it .
Parsing [sent. 13540 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 13541 len. 18]: ` Neither have I. ' Riderhood nodded , and asked : ` Is it for that ? '
Parsing [sent. 13542 len. 11]: ` It 's as much for that as anything else .
Parsing [sent. 13543 len. 21]: It 's something to be agreed with , on a subject that occupies so much of one 's thoughts . '
Parsing [sent. 13544 len. 15]: ` It do n't agree with YOU , ' returned Mr Riderhood , bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 13545 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 13546 len. 26]: It do n't , T'otherest Governor , and it 's no use a lookin ' as if you wanted to make out that it did .
Parsing [sent. 13547 len. 8]: I tell you it rankles in you .
Parsing [sent. 13548 len. 14]: It rankles in you , rusts in you , and pisons you . '
Parsing [sent. 13549 len. 23]: ` Say that it does so , ' returned Bradley with quivering lips ; ` is there no cause for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 13550 len. 10]: 'Cause enough , I 'll bet a pound ! '
Parsing [sent. 13551 len. 4]: cried Mr Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 13552 len. 26]: ` Have n't you yourself declared that the fellow has heaped provocations , insults , and affronts on you , or something to that effect ?
Parsing [sent. 13553 len. 8]: He has done the same by me .
Parsing [sent. 13554 len. 22]: He is made of venomous insults and affronts , from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot .
Parsing [sent. 13555 len. 33]: Are you so hopeful or so stupid , as not to know that he and the other will treat your application with contempt , and light their cigars with it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13556 len. 12]: I should n't wonder if they did , by George ! '
Parsing [sent. 13557 len. 6]: said Riderhood , turning angry .
Parsing [sent. 13558 len. 5]: ` If they did !
Parsing [sent. 13559 len. 3]: They will .
Parsing [sent. 13560 len. 7]: Let me ask you a question .
Parsing [sent. 13561 len. 17]: I know something more than your name about you ; I knew something about Gaffer Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 13562 len. 11]: When did you last set eyes upon his daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 13563 len. 15]: ` When did I last set eyes upon his daughter , T'otherest Governor ? '
Parsing [sent. 13564 len. 17]: repeated Mr Riderhood , growing intentionally slower of comprehension as the other quickened in his speech .
Parsing [sent. 13565 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 13566 len. 6]: Not to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 13567 len. 7]: To see her -- anywhere ? '
Parsing [sent. 13568 len. 18]: The Rogue had got the clue he wanted , though he held it with a clumsy hand .
Parsing [sent. 13569 len. 47]: Looking perplexedly at the passionate face , as if he were trying to work out a sum in his mind , he slowly answered : ' I ai n't set eyes upon her -- never once -- not since the day of Gaffer 's death . '
Parsing [sent. 13570 len. 11]: ` You know her well , by sight ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13571 len. 6]: I should think I did !
Parsing [sent. 13572 len. 5]: No one better . '
Parsing [sent. 13573 len. 9]: ` And you know him as well ? '
Parsing [sent. 13574 len. 6]: ` Who 's him ? '
Parsing [sent. 13575 len. 22]: asked Riderhood , taking off his hat and rubbing his forehead , as he directed a dull look at his questioner .
Parsing [sent. 13576 len. 5]: ` Curse the name !
Parsing [sent. 13577 len. 15]: Is it so agreeable to you that you want to hear it again ? '
Parsing [sent. 13578 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13579 len. 3]: HIM ! '
Parsing [sent. 13580 len. 27]: said Riderhood , who had craftily worked the schoolmaster into this corner , that he might again take note of his face under its evil possession .
Parsing [sent. 13581 len. 10]: ` I 'd know HIM among a thousand . '
Parsing [sent. 13582 len. 39]: ` Did you -- ' Bradley tried to ask it quietly ; but , do what he might with his voice , he could not subdue his face ; -- ` did you ever see them together ? '
Parsing [sent. 13583 len. 14]: -LRB- The Rogue had got the clue in both hands now . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 13584 len. 19]: I see 'em together , T'otherest Governor , on the very day when Gaffer was towed ashore . '
Parsing [sent. 13585 len. 39]: Bradley could have hidden a reserved piece of information from the sharp eyes of a whole inquisitive class , but he could not veil from the eyes of the ignorant Riderhood the withheld question next in his breast .
Parsing [sent. 13586 len. 28]: ` You shall put it plain if you want it answered , ' thought the Rogue , doggedly ; ' I ai n't a-going a wolunteering . '
Parsing [sent. 13587 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 13588 len. 8]: was he insolent to her too ? '
Parsing [sent. 13589 len. 6]: asked Bradley after a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 13590 len. 14]: ` Or did he make a show of being kind to her ? '
Parsing [sent. 13591 len. 17]: ` He made a show of being most uncommon kind to her , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 13592 len. 4]: ` By George !
Parsing [sent. 13593 len. 14]: now I -- ' His flying off at a tangent was indisputably natural .
Parsing [sent. 13594 len. 8]: Bradley looked at him for the reason .
Parsing [sent. 13595 len. 66]: ` Now I think of it , ' said Mr Riderhood , evasively , for he was substituting those words for ` Now I see you so jealous , ' which was the phrase really in his mind ; ` P ` r ` aps he went and took me down wrong , a purpose , on account o ' being sweet upon her ! '
Parsing [sent. 13596 len. 36]: The baseness of confirming him in this suspicion or pretence of one -LRB- for he could not have really entertained it -RRB- , was a line 's breadth beyond the mark the schoolmaster had reached .
Parsing [sent. 13597 len. 27]: The baseness of communing and intriguing with the fellow who would have set that stain upon her , and upon her brother too , was attained .
Parsing [sent. 13598 len. 9]: The line 's breadth further , lay beyond .
Parsing [sent. 13599 len. 13]: He made no reply , but walked on with a lowering face .
Parsing [sent. 13600 len. 20]: What he might gain by this acquaintance , he could not work out in his slow and cumbrous thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 13601 len. 44]: The man had an injury against the object of his hatred , and that was something ; though it was less than he supposed , for there dwelt in the man no such deadly rage and resentment as burned in his own breast .
Parsing [sent. 13602 len. 34]: The man knew her , and might by a fortunate chance see her , or hear of her ; that was something , as enlisting one pair of eyes and ears the more .
Parsing [sent. 13603 len. 16]: The man was a bad man , and willing enough to be in his pay .
Parsing [sent. 13604 len. 41]: That was something , for his own state and purpose were as bad as bad could be , and he seemed to derive a vague support from the possession of a congenial instrument , though it might never be used .
Parsing [sent. 13605 len. 16]: Suddenly he stood still , and asked Riderhood point-blank if he knew where she was ?
Parsing [sent. 13606 len. 7]: Clearly , he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 13607 len. 42]: He asked Riderhood if he would be willing , in case any intelligence of her , or of Wrayburn as seeking her or associating with her , should fall in his way , to communicate it if it were paid for ?
Parsing [sent. 13608 len. 7]: He would be very willing indeed .
Parsing [sent. 13609 len. 18]: He was ` agin 'em both , ' he said with an oath , and for why ?
Parsing [sent. 13610 len. 19]: 'Cause they had both stood betwixt him and his getting his living by the sweat of his brow .
Parsing [sent. 13611 len. 29]: ` It will not be long then , ' said Bradley Headstone , after some more discourse to this effect , ` before we see one another again .
Parsing [sent. 13612 len. 12]: Here is the country road , and here is the day .
Parsing [sent. 13613 len. 9]: Both have come upon me by surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 13614 len. 22]: ` But , T'otherest Governor , ' urged Mr Riderhood , ' I do n't know where to find you . '
Parsing [sent. 13615 len. 7]: ` It is of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 13616 len. 16]: I know where to find you , and I 'll come to your Lock . '
Parsing [sent. 13617 len. 23]: ` But , T'otherest Governor , ' urged Mr Riderhood again , ` no luck never come yet of a dry acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 13618 len. 104]: Let 's wet it , in a mouth-fill of rum and milk , T'otherest Governon ' Bradley assenting , went with him into an early public-house , haunted by unsavoury smells of musty hay and stale straw , where returning carts , farmers ' men , gaunt dogs , fowls of a beery breed , and certain human nightbirds fluttering home to roost , were solacing themselves after their several manners ; and where not one of the nightbirds hovering about the sloppy bar failed to discern at a glance in the passion-wasted nightbird with respectable feathers , the worst nightbird of all .
Parsing [sent. 13619 len. 43]: An inspiration of affection for a half-drunken carter going his way led to Mr Riderhood 's being elevated on a high heap of baskets on a waggon , and pursuing his journey recumbent on his back with his head on his bundle .
Parsing [sent. 13620 len. 25]: Bradley then turned to retrace his steps , and by-and-by struck off through little-traversed ways , and by - andby reached school and home .
Parsing [sent. 13621 len. 64]: Up came the sun to find him washed and brushed , methodically dressed in decent black coat and waistcoat , decent formal black tie , and pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his decent silver watch in its pocket , and its decent hair-guard round his neck : a scholastic huntsman clad for the field , with his fresh pack yelping and barking around him .
Parsing [sent. 13622 len. 47]: Yet more really bewitched than the miserable creatures of the much-lamented times , who accused themselves of impossibilities under a contagion of horror and the strongly suggestive influences of Torture , he had been ridden hard by Evil Spirits in the night that was newly gone .
Parsing [sent. 13623 len. 10]: He had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated .
Parsing [sent. 13624 len. 37]: If a record of the sport had usurped the places of the peaceful texts from Scripture on the wall , the most advanced of the scholars might have taken fright and run away from the master .
Parsing [sent. 13625 len. 38]: Chapter 12 MEANING MISCHIEF Up came the sun , steaming all over London , and in its glorious impartiality even condescending to make prismatic sparkles in the whiskers of Mr Alfred Lammle as he sat at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 13626 len. 29]: In need of some brightening from without , was Mr Alfred Lammle , for he had the air of being dull enough within , and looked grievously discontented .
Parsing [sent. 13627 len. 7]: Mrs Alfred Lammle faced her lord .
Parsing [sent. 13628 len. 26]: The happy pair of swindlers , with the comfortable tie between them that each had swindled the other , sat moodily observant of the tablecloth .
Parsing [sent. 13629 len. 42]: Things looked so gloomy in the breakfast-room , albeit on the sunny side of Sackville Street , that any of the family tradespeople glancing through the blinds might have taken the hint to send in his account and press for it .
Parsing [sent. 13630 len. 18]: But this , indeed , most of the family tradespeople had already done , without the hint .
Parsing [sent. 13631 len. 29]: ` It seems to me , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` that you have had no money at all , ever since we have been married . '
Parsing [sent. 13632 len. 25]: ` What seems to you , ' said Mr Lammle , ` to have been the case , may possibly have been the case .
Parsing [sent. 13633 len. 6]: It does n't matter . '
Parsing [sent. 13634 len. 20]: Was it the speciality of Mr and Mrs Lammle , or does it ever obtain with other loving couples ?
Parsing [sent. 13635 len. 26]: In these matrimonial dialogues they never addressed each other , but always some invisible presence that appeared to take a station about midway between them .
Parsing [sent. 13636 len. 19]: Perhaps the skeleton in the cupboard comes out to be talked to , on such domestic occasions ? '
Parsing [sent. 13637 len. 24]: I have never seen any money in the house , ' said Mrs Lammle to the skeleton , ` except my own annuity .
Parsing [sent. 13638 len. 5]: That I swear . '
Parsing [sent. 13639 len. 27]: ` You need n't take the trouble of swearing , ' said Mr Lammle to the skeleton ; ` once more , it does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 13640 len. 12]: You never turned your annuity to so good an account . '
Parsing [sent. 13641 len. 5]: ` Good an account !
Parsing [sent. 13642 len. 5]: In what way ? '
Parsing [sent. 13643 len. 4]: asked Mrs Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 13644 len. 17]: ` In the way of getting credit , and living well , ' said Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 13645 len. 25]: Perhaps the skeleton laughed scornfully on being intrusted with this question and this answer ; certainly Mrs Lammle did , and Mr Lammle did .
Parsing [sent. 13646 len. 9]: ` And what is to happen next ? '
Parsing [sent. 13647 len. 7]: asked Mrs Lammle of the skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 13648 len. 16]: ` Smash is to happen next , ' said Mr Lammle to the same authority .
Parsing [sent. 13649 len. 26]: After this , Mrs Lammle looked disdainfully at the skeleton -- but without carrying the look on to Mr Lammle -- and drooped her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13650 len. 16]: After that , Mr Lammle did exactly the same thing , and drooped HIS eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13651 len. 19]: A servant then entering with toast , the skeleton retired into the closet , and shut itself up .
Parsing [sent. 13652 len. 14]: ` Sophronia , ' said Mr Lammle , when the servant had withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 13653 len. 11]: And then , very much louder : ` Sophronia ! '
Parsing [sent. 13654 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 13655 len. 10]: ` Attend to me , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 13656 len. 15]: He eyed her sternly until she did attend , and then went on . '
Parsing [sent. 13657 len. 8]: I want to take counsel with you .
Parsing [sent. 13658 len. 8]: Come , come ; no more trifling .
Parsing [sent. 13659 len. 7]: You know our league and covenant .
Parsing [sent. 13660 len. 21]: We are to work together for our joint interest , and you are as knowing a hand as I am .
Parsing [sent. 13661 len. 11]: We should n't be together , if you were not .
Parsing [sent. 13662 len. 6]: What 's to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 13663 len. 7]: We are hemmed into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 13664 len. 6]: What shall we do ? '
Parsing [sent. 13665 len. 14]: ` Have you no scheme on foot that will bring in anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 13666 len. 44]: Mr Lammle plunged into his whiskers for reflection , and came out hopeless : ` No ; as adventurers we are obliged to play rash games for chances of high winnings , and there has been a run of luck against us . '
Parsing [sent. 13667 len. 15]: She was resuming , ` Have you nothing -- ' when he stopped her .
Parsing [sent. 13668 len. 5]: ` We , Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 13669 len. 7]: We , we , we . '
Parsing [sent. 13670 len. 8]: ` Have we nothing to sell ? '
Parsing [sent. 13671 len. 5]: ` Deuce a bit .
Parsing [sent. 13672 len. 24]: I have given a Jew a bill of sale on this furniture , and he could take it to-morrow , to-day , now .
Parsing [sent. 13673 len. 16]: He would have taken it before now , I believe , but for Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 13674 len. 10]: ` What has Fledgeby to do with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 13675 len. 4]: ` Knew him .
Parsing [sent. 13676 len. 11]: Cautioned me against him before I got into his claws .
Parsing [sent. 13677 len. 13]: Could n't persuade him then , in behalf of somebody else . '
Parsing [sent. 13678 len. 15]: ` Do you mean that Fledgeby has at all softened him towards you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13679 len. 5]: ` Us , Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 13680 len. 7]: Us , us , us . '
Parsing [sent. 13681 len. 6]: ` Towards us ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13682 len. 31]: I mean that the Jew has not yet done what he might have done , and that Fledgeby takes the credit of having got him to hold his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 13683 len. 7]: ` Do you believe Fledgeby ? '
Parsing [sent. 13684 len. 8]: ` Sophronia , I never believe anybody .
Parsing [sent. 13685 len. 12]: I never have , my dear , since I believed you .
Parsing [sent. 13686 len. 7]: But it looks like it . '
Parsing [sent. 13687 len. 52]: Having given her this back-handed reminder of her mutinous observations to the skeleton , Mr Lammle rose from table -- perhaps , the better to conceal a smile , and a white dint or two about his nose -- and took a turn on the carpet and came to the hearthrug .
Parsing [sent. 13688 len. 22]: ` If we could have packed the brute off with Georgiana ; -- but however ; that 's spilled milk . '
Parsing [sent. 13689 len. 37]: As Lammle , standing gathering up the skirts of his dressing-gown with his back to the fire , said this , looking down at his wife , she turned pale and looked down at the ground .
Parsing [sent. 13690 len. 53]: With a sense of disloyalty upon her , and perhaps with a sense of personal danger -- for she was afraid of him -- even afraid of his hand and afraid of his foot , though he had never done her violence -- she hastened to put herself right in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13691 len. 21]: ` If we could borrow money , Alfred -- ' ` Beg money , borrow money , or steal money .
Parsing [sent. 13692 len. 17]: It would be all one to us , Sophronia , ' her husband struck in . '
Parsing [sent. 13693 len. 9]: -- Then , we could weather this ? '
Parsing [sent. 13694 len. 4]: ` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 13695 len. 17]: To offer another original and undeniable remark , Sophronia , two and two make four . '
Parsing [sent. 13696 len. 48]: But , seeing that she was turning something in her mind , he gathered up the skirts of his dressing-gown again , and , tucking them under one arm , and collecting his ample whiskers in his other hand , kept his eye upon her , silently .
Parsing [sent. 13697 len. 39]: ` It is natural , Alfred , ' she said , looking up with some timidity into his face , ` to think in such an emergency of the richest people we know , and the simplest . '
Parsing [sent. 13698 len. 7]: ` Just so , Sophronia . '
Parsing [sent. 13699 len. 5]: ` The Boffins . '
Parsing [sent. 13700 len. 7]: ` Just so , Sophronia . '
Parsing [sent. 13701 len. 11]: ` Is there nothing to be done with them ? '
Parsing [sent. 13702 len. 13]: ` What is there to be done with them , Sophronia ? '
Parsing [sent. 13703 len. 18]: She cast about in her thoughts again , and he kept his eye upon her as before .
Parsing [sent. 13704 len. 32]: ` Of course I have repeatedly thought of the Boffins , Sophronia , ' he resumed , after a fruitless silence ; ` but I have seen my way to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 13705 len. 5]: They are well guarded .
Parsing [sent. 13706 len. 13]: That infernal Secretary stands between them and -- people of merit . '
Parsing [sent. 13707 len. 10]: ` If he could be got rid of ? '
Parsing [sent. 13708 len. 12]: said she , brightening a little , after more casting about .
Parsing [sent. 13709 len. 17]: ` Take time , Sophronia , ' observed her watchful husband , in a patronizing manner .
Parsing [sent. 13710 len. 22]: ` If working him out of the way could be presented in the light of a service to Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 13711 len. 7]: ` Take time , Sophronia . '
Parsing [sent. 13712 len. 20]: ` We have remarked lately , Alfred , that the old man is turning very suspicious and distrustful . '
Parsing [sent. 13713 len. 16]: ` Miserly too , my dear ; which is far the most unpromising for us .
Parsing [sent. 13714 len. 11]: Nevertheless , take time , Sophronia , take time . '
Parsing [sent. 13715 len. 27]: She took time and then said : ` Suppose we should address ourselves to that tendency in him of which we have made ourselves quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 13716 len. 18]: Suppose my conscience -- ' ` And we know what a conscience it is , my soul .
Parsing [sent. 13717 len. 3]: Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 13718 len. 31]: ` Suppose my conscience should not allow me to keep to myself any longer what that upstart girl told me of the Secretary 's having made a declaration to her .
Parsing [sent. 13719 len. 15]: Suppose my conscience should oblige me to repeat it to Mr Boffin . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13720 len. 9]: I rather like that , ' said Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 13721 len. 30]: ` Suppose I so repeated it to Mr Boffin , as to insinuate that my sensitive delicacy and honour -- ' ` Very good words , Sophronia . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13722 len. 57]: -- As to insinuate that OUR sensitive delicacy and honour , ' she resumed , with a bitter stress upon the phrase , ` would not allow us to be silent parties to so mercenary and designing a speculation on the Secretary 's part , and so gross a breach of faith towards his confiding employer .
Parsing [sent. 13723 len. 35]: Suppose I had imparted my virtuous uneasiness to my excellent husband , and he had said , in his integrity , `` Sophronia , you must immediately disclose this to Mr Boffin . '' '
Parsing [sent. 13724 len. 25]: ` Once more , Sophronia , ' observed Lammle , changing the leg on which he stood , ' I rather like that . '
Parsing [sent. 13725 len. 14]: ` You remark that he is well guarded , ' she pursued . '
Parsing [sent. 13726 len. 5]: I think so too .
Parsing [sent. 13727 len. 20]: But if this should lead to his discharging his Secretary , there would be a weak place made . '
Parsing [sent. 13728 len. 7]: ` Go on expounding , Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 13729 len. 9]: I begin to like this very much . '
Parsing [sent. 13730 len. 39]: ` Having , in our unimpeachable rectitude , done him the service of opening his eyes to the treachery of the person he trusted , we shall have established a claim upon him and a confidence with him .
Parsing [sent. 13731 len. 26]: Whether it can be made much of , or little of , we must wait -- because we ca n't help it -- to see .
Parsing [sent. 13732 len. 15]: Probably we shall make the most of it that is to be made . '
Parsing [sent. 13733 len. 7]: ` Probably , ' said LammIe .
Parsing [sent. 13734 len. 27]: ` Do you think it impossible , ' she asked , in the same cold plotting way , ` that you might replace the Secretary ? '
Parsing [sent. 13735 len. 6]: ` Not impossible , Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 13736 len. 6]: It might be brought about .
Parsing [sent. 13737 len. 12]: At any rate it might be skilfully led up to . '
Parsing [sent. 13738 len. 15]: She nodded her understanding of the hint , as she looked at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 13739 len. 31]: ` Mr Lammle , ' she said , musingly : not without a slight ironical touch : ` Mr Lammle would be so delighted to do anything in his power .
Parsing [sent. 13740 len. 14]: Mr Lammle , himself a man of business as well as a capitalist .
Parsing [sent. 13741 len. 13]: Mr Lammle , accustomed to be intrusted with the most delicate affairs .
Parsing [sent. 13742 len. 43]: Mr Lammle , who has managed my own little fortune so admirably , but who , to be sure , began to make his reputation with the advantage of being a man of property , above temptation , and beyond suspicion . '
Parsing [sent. 13743 len. 12]: Mr Lammle smiled , and even patted her on the head .
Parsing [sent. 13744 len. 42]: In his sinister relish of the scheme , as he stood above her , making it the subject of his cogitations , he seemed to have twice as much nose on his face as he had ever had in his life .
Parsing [sent. 13745 len. 19]: He stood pondering , and she sat looking at the dusty fire without moving , for some time .
Parsing [sent. 13746 len. 46]: But , the moment he began to speak again she looked up with a wince and attended to him , as if that doubledealing of hers had been in her mind , and the fear were revived in her of his hand or his foot .
Parsing [sent. 13747 len. 18]: ` It appears to me , Sophronia , that you have omitted one branch of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 13748 len. 8]: Perhaps not , for women understand women .
Parsing [sent. 13749 len. 8]: We might oust the girl herself ? '
Parsing [sent. 13750 len. 6]: Mrs Lammle shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 13751 len. 13]: ` She has an immensely strong hold upon them both , Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 13752 len. 11]: Not to be compared with that of a paid secretary .
Parsing [sent. 13753 len. 27]: ` But the dear child , ' said Lammle , with a crooked smile , ` ought to have been open with her benefactor and benefactress .
Parsing [sent. 13754 len. 16]: The darling love ought to have reposed unbounded confidence in her benefactor and benefactress . '
Parsing [sent. 13755 len. 6]: Sophronia shook her head again .
Parsing [sent. 13756 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 13757 len. 13]: Women understand women , ' said her husband , rather disappointed . '
Parsing [sent. 13758 len. 6]: I do n't press it .
Parsing [sent. 13759 len. 17]: It might be the making of our fortune to make a clean sweep of them both .
Parsing [sent. 13760 len. 18]: With me to manage the property , and my wife to manage the people -- Whew ! '
Parsing [sent. 13761 len. 17]: Again shaking her head , she returned : ` They will never quarrel with the girl .
Parsing [sent. 13762 len. 7]: They will never punish the girl .
Parsing [sent. 13763 len. 11]: We must accept the girl , rely upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 13764 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 13765 len. 23]: cried Lammle , shrugging his shoulders , ` so be it : only always remember that we do n't want her . '
Parsing [sent. 13766 len. 21]: ` Now , the sole remaining question is , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` when shall I begin ? '
Parsing [sent. 13767 len. 10]: ` You can not begin too soon , Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 13768 len. 25]: As I have told you , the condition of our affairs is desperate , and may be blown upon at any moment . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13769 len. 9]: I must secure Mr Boffin alone , Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 13770 len. 14]: If his wife was present , she would throw oil upon the waters .
Parsing [sent. 13771 len. 19]: I know I should fail to move him to an angry outburst , if his wife was there .
Parsing [sent. 13772 len. 25]: And as to the girl herself -- as I am going to betray her confidence , she is equally out of the question . '
Parsing [sent. 13773 len. 12]: ` It would n't do to write for an appointment ? '
Parsing [sent. 13774 len. 3]: said Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 13775 len. 6]: ` No , certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 13776 len. 19]: They would wonder among themselves why I wrote , and I want to have him wholly unprepared . '
Parsing [sent. 13777 len. 11]: ` Call , and ask to see him alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 13778 len. 4]: suggested Lammle . '
Parsing [sent. 13779 len. 8]: I would rather not do that either .
Parsing [sent. 13780 len. 5]: Leave it to me .
Parsing [sent. 13781 len. 30]: Spare me the little carriage for to-day , and for to-morrow -LRB- if I do n't succeed today -RRB- , and I 'll lie in wait for him . '
Parsing [sent. 13782 len. 21]: It was barely settled when a manly form was seen to pass the windows and heard to knock and ring .
Parsing [sent. 13783 len. 9]: ` Here 's Fledgeby , ' said Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 13784 len. 13]: ` He admires you , and has a high opinion of you .
Parsing [sent. 13785 len. 5]: I 'll be out .
Parsing [sent. 13786 len. 10]: Coax him to use his influence with the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 13787 len. 55]: His name is Riah , of the House of Pubsey and Co. ' Adding these words under his breath , lest he should be audible in the erect ears of Mr Fledgeby , through two keyholes and the hall , Lammle , making signals of discretion to his servant , went softly up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 13788 len. 23]: ` Mr Fledgeby , ' said Mrs Lammle , giving him a very gracious reception , ` so glad to see you !
Parsing [sent. 13789 len. 20]: My poor dear Alfred , who is greatly worried just now about his affairs , went out rather early .
Parsing [sent. 13790 len. 9]: Dear Mr Fledgeby , do sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 13791 len. 44]: Dear Mr Fledgeby did sit down , and satisfied himself -LRB- or , judging from the expression of his countenance , DISsatisfied himself -RRB- that nothing new had occurred in the way of whisker-sprout since he came round the corner from the Albany .
Parsing [sent. 13792 len. 54]: ` Dear Mr Fledgeby , it was needless to mention to you that my poor dear Alfred is much worried about his affairs at present , for he has told me what a comfort you are to him in his temporary difficulties , and what a great service you have rendered him . '
Parsing [sent. 13793 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 13794 len. 4]: said Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13795 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' said Mrs Lammle . '
Parsing [sent. 13796 len. 30]: I did n't know , ' remarked Mr Fledgeby , trying a new part of his chair , ` but that Lammle might be reserved about his affairs . '
Parsing [sent. 13797 len. 14]: ` Not to me , ' said Mrs Lammle , with deep feeling .
Parsing [sent. 13798 len. 6]: ` Oh , indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 13799 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13800 len. 9]: ` Not to me , dear Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13801 len. 6]: I am his wife . '
Parsing [sent. 13802 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 13803 len. 12]: I -- I always understood so , ' said Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13804 len. 55]: ` And as the wife of Alfred , may I , dear Mr Fledgeby , wholly without his authority or knowledge , as I am sure your discernment will perceive , entreat you to continue that great service , and once more use your well-earned influence with Mr Riah for a little more indulgence ?
Parsing [sent. 13805 len. 21]: The name I have heard Alfred mention , tossing in his dreams , IS Riah ; is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 13806 len. 23]: ` The name of the Creditor is Riah , ' said Mr Fledgehy , with a rather uncompromising accent on his noun-substantive .
Parsing [sent. 13807 len. 5]: ` Saint Mary Axe .
Parsing [sent. 13808 len. 9]: Pubsey and Co. ' ` Oh yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 13809 len. 13]: exclaimed Mrs Lammle , clasping her hands with a certain gushing wildness .
Parsing [sent. 13810 len. 6]: ` Pubsey and Co. ! '
Parsing [sent. 13811 len. 36]: ` The pleading of the feminine -- ' Mr Fledgeby began , and there stuck so long for a word to get on with , that Mrs Lammle offered him sweetly , ` Heart ? '
Parsing [sent. 13812 len. 30]: ` No , ' said Mr Fledgeby , ` Gender -- is ever what a man is bound to listen to , and I wish it rested with myself .
Parsing [sent. 13813 len. 16]: But this Riah is a nasty one , Mrs Lammle ; he really is . '
Parsing [sent. 13814 len. 13]: ` Not if YOU speak to him , dear Mr Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 13815 len. 10]: ` Upon my soul and body he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 13816 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13817 len. 3]: ` Try .
Parsing [sent. 13818 len. 8]: Try once more , dearest Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13819 len. 13]: What is there you can not do , if you will ! '
Parsing [sent. 13820 len. 17]: ` Thank you , ' said Fledgeby , ` you 're very complimentary to say so .
Parsing [sent. 13821 len. 12]: I do n't mind trying him again , at your request .
Parsing [sent. 13822 len. 11]: But of course I ca n't answer for the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 13823 len. 22]: Riah is a tough subject , and when he says he 'll do a thing , he 'll do it . '
Parsing [sent. 13824 len. 25]: ` Exactly so , ' cried Mrs Lammle , ` and when he says to you he 'll wait , he 'll wait . '
Parsing [sent. 13825 len. 14]: -LRB- ` She is a devilish clever woman , ' thought Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 13826 len. 25]: I did n't see that opening , but she spies it out and cuts into it as soon as it 's made . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 13827 len. 50]: ` In point of fact , dear Mr Fledgeby , ' Mrs Lammle went on in a very interesting manner , ` not to affect concealment of Alfred 's hopes , to you who are so much his friend , there is a distant break in his horizon . '
Parsing [sent. 13828 len. 25]: This figure of speech seemed rather mysterious to Fascination Fledgeby , who said , ` There 's a what in his -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 13829 len. 35]: ` Alfred , dear Mr Fledgeby , discussed with me this very morning before he went out , some prospects he has , which might entirely change the aspect of his present troubles . '
Parsing [sent. 13830 len. 4]: ` Really ? '
Parsing [sent. 13831 len. 4]: said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 13832 len. 4]: O yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 13833 len. 9]: Here Mrs Lammle brought her handkerchief into play .
Parsing [sent. 13834 len. 50]: ` And you know , dear Mr Fledgeby -- you who study the human heart , and study the world -- what an affliction it would be to lose position and to lose credit , when ability to tide over a very short time might save all appearances . '
Parsing [sent. 13835 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 13836 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13837 len. 20]: ` Then you think , Mrs Lammle , that if Lammle got time , he would n't burst up ?
Parsing [sent. 13838 len. 22]: -- To use an expression , ' Mr Fledgeby apologetically explained , ` which is adopted in the Money Market . '
Parsing [sent. 13839 len. 4]: ` Indeed yes .
Parsing [sent. 13840 len. 7]: Truly , truly , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 13841 len. 11]: ` That makes all the difference , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13842 len. 13]: ` I 'll make a point of seeing Riah at once . '
Parsing [sent. 13843 len. 10]: ` Blessings on you , dearest Mr Fledgeby ! '
Parsing [sent. 13844 len. 9]: ` Not at all , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13845 len. 6]: She gave him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 13846 len. 29]: ` The hand , ' said Mr Fledgeby , ` of a lovely and superior-minded female is ever the repayment of a -- ' ` Noble action ! '
Parsing [sent. 13847 len. 12]: said Mrs Lammle , extremely anxious to get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 13848 len. 35]: ` It was n't what I was going to say , ' returned Fledgeby , who never would , under any circumstances , accept a suggested expression , ` but you 're very complimentary .
Parsing [sent. 13849 len. 11]: May I imprint a -- a one -- upon it ?
Parsing [sent. 13850 len. 5]: Good morning ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13851 len. 12]: I may depend upon your promptitude , dearest Mr Fledgeby ? '
Parsing [sent. 13852 len. 22]: Said Fledgeby , looking back at the door and respectfully kissing his hand , ` You may depend upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 13853 len. 37]: In fact , Mr Fledgeby sped on his errand of mercy through the streets , at so brisk a rate that his feet might have been winged by all the good spirits that wait on Generosity .
Parsing [sent. 13854 len. 20]: They might have taken up their station in his breast , too , for he was blithe and merry .
Parsing [sent. 13855 len. 52]: There was quite a fresh trill in his voice , when , arriving at the counting-house in St Mary Axe , and finding it for the moment empty , he trolled forth at the foot of the staircase : ` Now , Judah , what are you up to there ? '
Parsing [sent. 13856 len. 10]: The old man appeared , with his accustomed deference .
Parsing [sent. 13857 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 13858 len. 10]: said Fledgeby , falling back , with a wink .
Parsing [sent. 13859 len. 8]: ` You mean mischief , Jerusalem ! '
Parsing [sent. 13860 len. 8]: The old man raised his eyes inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 13861 len. 9]: ` Yes you do , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13862 len. 6]: ` Oh , you sinner !
Parsing [sent. 13863 len. 5]: Oh , you dodger !
Parsing [sent. 13864 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 13865 len. 17]: You 're going to act upon that bill of sale at Lammle 's , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 13866 len. 9]: Nothing will turn you , wo n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 13867 len. 16]: You wo n't be put off for another single minute , wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13868 len. 27]: Ordered to immediate action by the master 's tone and look , the old man took up his hat from the little counter where it lay .
Parsing [sent. 13869 len. 27]: ` You have been told that he might pull through it , if you did n't go in to win , Wide-Awake ; have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13870 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13871 len. 18]: ` And it 's not your game that he should pull through it ; ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 13872 len. 13]: You having got security , and there being enough to pay you ?
Parsing [sent. 13873 len. 6]: Oh , you Jew ! '
Parsing [sent. 13874 len. 23]: The old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment , as if there might be further instructions for him in reserve .
Parsing [sent. 13875 len. 8]: ` Do I go , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 13876 len. 9]: he at length asked in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 13877 len. 9]: ` Asks me if he is going ! '
Parsing [sent. 13878 len. 3]: exclaimed Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13879 len. 14]: ` Asks me , as if he did n't know his own purpose !
Parsing [sent. 13880 len. 14]: Asks me , as if he had n't got his hat on ready !
Parsing [sent. 13881 len. 29]: Asks me , as if his sharp old eye -- why , it cuts like a knife -- was n't looking at his walking-stick by the door ! '
Parsing [sent. 13882 len. 8]: ` Do I go , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 13883 len. 6]: ` Do you go ? '
Parsing [sent. 13884 len. 3]: sneered Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13885 len. 7]: ` Yes , you do go .
Parsing [sent. 13886 len. 5]: Toddle , Judah ! '
Parsing [sent. 13887 len. 56]: Chapter 13 GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME , AND HANG HIM Fascination Fledgeby , left alone in the counting-house , strolled about with his hat on one side , whistling , and investigating the drawers , and prying here and there for any small evidences of his being cheated , but could find none .
Parsing [sent. 13888 len. 28]: ` Not his merit that he do n't cheat me , ' was Mr Fledgeby 's commentary delivered with a wink , ` but my precaution . '
Parsing [sent. 13889 len. 62]: He then with a lazy grandeur asserted his rights as lord of Pubsey and Co. by poking his cane at the stools and boxes , and spitting in the fireplace , and so loitered royally to the window and looked out into the narrow street , with his small eyes just peering over the top of Pubsey and Co. 's blind .
Parsing [sent. 13890 len. 25]: As a blind in more senses than one , it reminded him that he was alone in the counting-house with the front door open .
Parsing [sent. 13891 len. 30]: He was moving away to shut it , lest he should be injudiciously identified with the establishment , when he was stopped by some one coming to the door .
Parsing [sent. 13892 len. 25]: This some one was the dolls ' dressmaker , with a little basket on her arm , and her crutch stick in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 13893 len. 52]: Her keen eyes had espied Mr Fledgeby before Mr Fledgeby had espied her , and he was paralysed in his purpose of shutting her out , not so much by her approaching the door , as by her favouring him with a shower of nods , the instant he saw her .
Parsing [sent. 13894 len. 37]: This advantage she improved by hobbling up the steps with such despatch that before Mr Fledgeby could take measures for her finding nobody at home , she was face to face with him in the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 13895 len. 14]: ` Hope I see you well , sir , ' said Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 13896 len. 6]: ` Mr Riah in ? '
Parsing [sent. 13897 len. 16]: Fledgeby had dropped into a chair , in the attitude of one waiting wearily . '
Parsing [sent. 13898 len. 29]: I suppose he will be back soon , ' he replied ; ` he has cut out and left me expecting him back , in an odd way .
Parsing [sent. 13899 len. 8]: Have n't I seen you before ? '
Parsing [sent. 13900 len. 22]: ` Once before -- if you had your eyesight , ' replied Miss Wren ; the conditional clause in an under-tone .
Parsing [sent. 13901 len. 16]: ` When you were carrying on some games up at the top of the house .
Parsing [sent. 13902 len. 3]: I remember .
Parsing [sent. 13903 len. 7]: How 's your friend ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13904 len. 17]: I have more friends than one , sir , I hope , ' replied Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 13905 len. 5]: ` Which friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 13906 len. 24]: ` Never mind , ' said Mr Fledgeby , shutting up one eye , ` any of your friends , all your friends .
Parsing [sent. 13907 len. 6]: Are they pretty tolerable ? '
Parsing [sent. 13908 len. 26]: Somewhat confounded , Miss Wren parried the pleasantry , and sat down in a corner behind the door , with her basket in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 13909 len. 41]: Byand-by , she said , breaking a long and patient silence : ' I beg your pardon , sir , but I am used to find Mr Riah at this time , and so I generally come at this time .
Parsing [sent. 13910 len. 15]: I only want to buy my poor little two shillings ' worth of waste .
Parsing [sent. 13911 len. 20]: Perhaps you 'll kindly let me have it , and I 'll trot off to my work . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13912 len. 7]: I let you have it ? '
Parsing [sent. 13913 len. 24]: said Fledgeby , turning his head towards her ; for he had been sitting blinking at the light , and feeling his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 13914 len. 26]: ` Why , you do n't really suppose that I have anything to do with the place , or the business ; do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13915 len. 4]: ` Suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 13916 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 13917 len. 13]: ` He said , that day , you were the master ! '
Parsing [sent. 13918 len. 8]: ` The old cock in black said ?
Parsing [sent. 13919 len. 3]: Riah said ?
Parsing [sent. 13920 len. 8]: Why , he 'd say anything . '
Parsing [sent. 13921 len. 14]: ` Well ; but you said so too , ' returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 13922 len. 18]: ` Or at least you took on like the master , and did n't contradict him . '
Parsing [sent. 13923 len. 18]: ` One of his dodges , ' said Mr Fledgeby , with a cool and contemptuous shrug .
Parsing [sent. 13924 len. 7]: ` He 's made of dodges .
Parsing [sent. 13925 len. 26]: He said to me , `` Come up to the top of the house , sir , and I 'll show you a handsome girl .
Parsing [sent. 13926 len. 9]: But I shall call you the master . ''
Parsing [sent. 13927 len. 34]: So I went up to the top of the house and he showed me the handsome girl -LRB- very well worth looking at she was -RRB- , and I was called the master .
Parsing [sent. 13928 len. 6]: I do n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 13929 len. 7]: I dare say he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 13930 len. 33]: He loves a dodge for its own sake ; being , ' added Mr Fledgeby , after casting about for an expressive phrase , ` the dodgerest of all the dodgers . '
Parsing [sent. 13931 len. 6]: ` Oh my head ! '
Parsing [sent. 13932 len. 19]: cried the dolls ' dressmaker , holding it with both her hands , as if it were cracking .
Parsing [sent. 13933 len. 11]: ` You ca n't mean what you say . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13934 len. 19]: I can , my little woman , retorted Fledgeby , ` and I do , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 13935 len. 51]: This repudiation was not only an act of deliberate policy on Fledgeby 's part , in case of his being surprised by any other caller , but was also a retort upon Miss Wren for her over-sharpness , and a pleasant instance of his humour as regarded the old Jew .
Parsing [sent. 13936 len. 35]: ` He has got a bad name as an old Jew , and he is paid for the use of it , and I 'll have my money 's worth out of him . '
Parsing [sent. 13937 len. 51]: This was Fledgeby 's habitual reflection in the way of business , and it was sharpened just now by the old man 's presuming to have a secret from him : though of the secret itself , as annoying somebody else whom he disliked , he by no means disapproved .
Parsing [sent. 13938 len. 65]: Miss Wren with a fallen countenance sat behind the door looking thoughtfully at the ground , and the long and patient silence had again set in for some time , when the expression of Mr Fledgeby 's face betokened that through the upper portion of the door , which was of glass , he saw some one faltering on the brink of the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 13939 len. 18]: Presently there was a rustle and a tap , and then some more rustling and another tap .
Parsing [sent. 13940 len. 26]: Fledgeby taking no notice , the door was at length softly opened , and the dried face of a mild little elderly gentleman looked in .
Parsing [sent. 13941 len. 5]: ` Mr Riah ? '
Parsing [sent. 13942 len. 8]: said this visitor , very politely . '
Parsing [sent. 13943 len. 13]: I am waiting for him , sir , ' returned Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13944 len. 9]: ` He went out and left me here .
Parsing [sent. 13945 len. 7]: I expect him back every minute .
Parsing [sent. 13946 len. 9]: Perhaps you had better take a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 13947 len. 25]: The gentleman took a chair , and put his hand to his forehead , as if he were in a melancholy frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 13948 len. 14]: Mr Fledgeby eyed him aside , and seemed to relish his attitude . '
Parsing [sent. 13949 len. 10]: A fine day , sir , ' remarked Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13950 len. 34]: The little dried gentleman was so occupied with his own depressed reflections that he did not notice the remark until the sound of Mr Fledgeby 's voice had died out of the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 13951 len. 15]: Then he started , and said : ' I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13952 len. 9]: I fear you spoke to me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13953 len. 22]: I said , ' remarked Fledgeby , a little louder than before , ` it was a fine day . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13954 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 13955 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 13956 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 13957 len. 23]: Again the little dried gentleman put his hand to his forehead , and again Mr Fledgeby seemed to enjoy his doing it .
Parsing [sent. 13958 len. 16]: When the gentleman changed his attitude with a sigh , Fledgeby spake with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 13959 len. 8]: ` Mr Twemlow , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 13960 len. 7]: The dried gentleman seemed much surprised .
Parsing [sent. 13961 len. 16]: ` Had the pleasure of dining with you at Lammle 's , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13962 len. 12]: ` Even have the honour of being a connexion of yours .
Parsing [sent. 13963 len. 30]: An unexpected sort of place this to meet in ; but one never knows , when one gets into the City , what people one may knock up against .
Parsing [sent. 13964 len. 13]: I hope you have your health , and are enjoying yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 13965 len. 32]: There might have been a touch of impertinence in the last words ; on the other hand , it might have been but the native grace of Mr Fledgeby 's manner .
Parsing [sent. 13966 len. 21]: Mr Fledgeby sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another stool , and his hat on .
Parsing [sent. 13967 len. 15]: Mr Twemlow had uncovered on looking in at the door , and remained so .
Parsing [sent. 13968 len. 23]: Now the conscientious Twemlow , knowing what he had done to thwart the gracious Fledgeby , was particularly disconcerted by this encounter .
Parsing [sent. 13969 len. 13]: He was as ill at ease as a gentleman well could be .
Parsing [sent. 13970 len. 19]: He felt himself bound to conduct himself stiffly towards Fledgeby , and he made him a distant bow .
Parsing [sent. 13971 len. 14]: Fledgeby made his small eyes smaller in taking special note of his manner .
Parsing [sent. 13972 len. 41]: The dolls ' dressmaker sat in her corner behind the door , with her eyes on the ground and her hands folded on her basket , holding her crutch-stick between them , and appearing to take no heed of anything .
Parsing [sent. 13973 len. 17]: ` He 's a long time , ' muttered Mr Fledgeby , looking at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 13974 len. 12]: ` What time may you make it , Mr Twemlow ? '
Parsing [sent. 13975 len. 11]: Mr Twemlow made it ten minutes past twelve , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13976 len. 12]: ` As near as a toucher , ' assented Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 13977 len. 20]: I hope , Mr Twemlow , your business here may be of a more agreeable character than mine . '
Parsing [sent. 13978 len. 11]: ` Thank you , sir , ' said Mr Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 13979 len. 28]: Fledgeby again made his small eyes smaller , as he glanced with great complacency at Twemlow , who was timorously tapping the table with a folded letter .
Parsing [sent. 13980 len. 36]: ` What I know of Mr Riah , ' said Fledgeby , with a very disparaging utterance of his name , ` leads me to believe that this is about the shop for disagreeable business .
Parsing [sent. 13981 len. 14]: I have always found him the bitingest and tightest screw in London . '
Parsing [sent. 13982 len. 11]: Mr Twemlow acknowledged the remark with a little distant bow .
Parsing [sent. 13983 len. 6]: It evidently made him nervous .
Parsing [sent. 13984 len. 32]: ` So much so , ' pursued Fledgeby , ` that if it was n't to be true to a friend , nobody should catch me waiting here a single minute .
Parsing [sent. 13985 len. 12]: But if you have friends in adversity , stand by them .
Parsing [sent. 13986 len. 11]: That 's what I say and act up to . '
Parsing [sent. 13987 len. 18]: The equitable Twemlow felt that this sentiment , irrespective of the utterer , demanded his cordial assent .
Parsing [sent. 13988 len. 14]: ` You are very right , sir , ' he rejoined with spirit .
Parsing [sent. 13989 len. 9]: ` You indicate the generous and manly course .
Parsing [sent. 13990 len. 11]: ` Glad to have your approbation , ' returned Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 13991 len. 41]: ` It 's a coincidence , Mr Twemlow ; ' here he descended from his perch , and sauntered towards him ; ` that the friends I am standing by to-day are the friends at whose house I met you !
Parsing [sent. 13992 len. 3]: The Lammles .
Parsing [sent. 13993 len. 10]: She 's a very taking and agreeable woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 13994 len. 7]: Conscience smote the gentle Twemlow pale .
Parsing [sent. 13995 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 13996 len. 5]: ` She is . '
Parsing [sent. 13997 len. 81]: ` And when she appealed to me this morning , to come and try what I could do to pacify their creditor , this Mr Riah -- that I certainly have gained some little influence with in transacting business for another friend , but nothing like so much as she supposes -- and when a woman like that spoke to me as her dearest Mr Fledgeby , and shed tears -- why what could I do , you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 13998 len. 8]: Twemlow gasped ` Nothing but come . '
Parsing [sent. 13999 len. 5]: ` Nothing but come .
Parsing [sent. 14000 len. 5]: And so I came .
Parsing [sent. 14001 len. 82]: But why , ' said Fledgeby , putting his hands in his pockets and counterfeiting deep meditation , ` why Riah should have started up , when I told him that the Lammles entreated him to hold over a Bill of Sale he has on all their effects ; and why he should have cut out , saying he would be back directly ; and why he should have left me here alone so long ; I can not understand . '
Parsing [sent. 14002 len. 20]: The chivalrous Twemlow , Knight of the Simple Heart , was not in a condition to offer any suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 14003 len. 8]: He was too penitent , too remorseful .
Parsing [sent. 14004 len. 20]: For the first time in his life he had done an underhanded action , and he had done wrong .
Parsing [sent. 14005 len. 27]: He had secretly interposed against this confiding young man , for no better real reason than because the young man 's ways were not his ways .
Parsing [sent. 14006 len. 18]: But , the confiding young man proceeded to heap coals of fire on his sensitive head . '
Parsing [sent. 14007 len. 24]: I beg your pardon , Mr Twemlow ; you see I am acquainted with the nature of the affairs that are transacted here .
Parsing [sent. 14008 len. 10]: Is there anything I can do for you here ?
Parsing [sent. 14009 len. 40]: You have always been brought up as a gentleman , and never as a man of business ; ' another touch of possible impertinence in this place ; ` and perhaps you are but a poor man of business .
Parsing [sent. 14010 len. 9]: What else is to be expected ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 14011 len. 33]: I am even a poorer man of business than I am a man , sir , ' returned Twemlow , ` and I could hardly express my deficiency in a stronger way .
Parsing [sent. 14012 len. 21]: I really do not so much as clearly understand my position in the matter on which I am brought here .
Parsing [sent. 14013 len. 14]: But there are reasons which make me very delicate of accepting your assistance .
Parsing [sent. 14014 len. 12]: I am greatly , greatly , disinclined to profit by it .
Parsing [sent. 14015 len. 7]: I do n't deserve it . '
Parsing [sent. 14016 len. 4]: Good childish creature !
Parsing [sent. 14017 len. 26]: Condemned to a passage through the world by such narrow little dimly-lighted ways , and picking up so few specks or spots on the road !
Parsing [sent. 14018 len. 30]: ` Perhaps , ' said Fledgeby , ` you may be a little proud of entering on the topic , -- having been brought up as a gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 14019 len. 18]: ` It 's not that , sir , ' returned Twemlow , ` it 's not that .
Parsing [sent. 14020 len. 13]: I hope I distinguish between true pride and false pride . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14021 len. 32]: I have no pride at all , myself , ' said Fledgeby , ` and perhaps I do n't cut things so fine as to know one from t ` other .
Parsing [sent. 14022 len. 38]: But I know this is a place where even a man of business needs his wits about him ; and if mine can be of any use to you here , you 're welcome to them . '
Parsing [sent. 14023 len. 12]: ` You are very good , ' said Twemlow , faltering .
Parsing [sent. 14024 len. 49]: ` But I am most unwilling -- ' ' I do n't , you know , ' proceeded Fledgeby with an ill-favoured glance , ` entertain the vanity of supposing that my wits could be of any use to you in society , but they might be here .
Parsing [sent. 14025 len. 15]: You cultivate society and society cultivates you , but Mr Riah 's not society .
Parsing [sent. 14026 len. 15]: In society , Mr Riah is kept dark ; eh , Mr Twemlow ? '
Parsing [sent. 14027 len. 21]: Twemlow , much disturbed , and with his hand fluttering about his forehead , replied : ` Quite true . '
Parsing [sent. 14028 len. 11]: The confiding young man besought him to state his case .
Parsing [sent. 14029 len. 115]: The innocent Twemlow , expecting Fledgeby to be astounded by what he should unfold , and not for an instant conceiving the possibility of its happening every day , but treating of it as a terrible phenomenon occurring in the course of ages , related how that he had had a deceased friend , a married civil officer with a family , who had wanted money for change of place on change of post , and how he , Twemlow , had ` given him his name , ' with the usual , but in the eyes of Twemlow almost incredible result that he had been left to repay what he had never had .
Parsing [sent. 14030 len. 69]: How , in the course of years , he had reduced the principal by trifling sums , ` having , ' said Twemlow , ` always to observe great economy , being in the enjoyment of a fixed income limited in extent , and that depending on the munificence of a certain nobleman , ' and had always pinched the full interest out of himself with punctual pinches .
Parsing [sent. 14031 len. 70]: How he had come , in course of time , to look upon this one only debt of his life as a regular quarterly drawback , and no worse , when ` his name ' had some way fallen into the possession of Mr Riah , who had sent him notice to redeem it by paying up in full , in one plump sum , or take tremendous consequences .
Parsing [sent. 14032 len. 83]: This , with hazy remembrances of how he had been carried to some office to ` confess judgment ' -LRB- as he recollected the phrase -RRB- , and how he had been carried to another office where his life was assured for somebody not wholly unconnected with the sherry trade whom he remembered by the remarkable circumstance that he had a Straduarius violin to dispose of , and also a Madonna , formed the sum and substance of Mr Twemlow 's narrative .
Parsing [sent. 14033 len. 29]: Through which stalked the shadow of the awful Snigsworth , eyed afar off by money-lenders as Security in the Mist , and menacing Twemlow with his baronial truncheon .
Parsing [sent. 14034 len. 34]: To all , Mr Fledgeby listened with the modest gravity becoming a confiding young man who knew it all beforehand , and , when it was finished , seriously shook his head . '
Parsing [sent. 14035 len. 24]: I do n't like , Mr Twemlow , ' said Fledgeby , ' I do n't like Riah 's calling in the principal .
Parsing [sent. 14036 len. 14]: If he 's determined to call it in , it must come . '
Parsing [sent. 14037 len. 20]: ` But supposing , sir , ' said Twemlow , downcast , ` that it ca n't come ? '
Parsing [sent. 14038 len. 16]: ` Then , ' retorted Fledgeby , ` you must go , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 14039 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 14040 len. 5]: asked Twemlow , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 14041 len. 8]: ` To prison , ' returned Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 14042 len. 21]: Whereat Mr Twemlow leaned his innocent head upon his hand , and moaned a little moan of distress and disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 14043 len. 28]: ` However , ' said Fledgeby , appearing to pluck up his spirits , ` we 'll hope it 's not so bad as that comes to .
Parsing [sent. 14044 len. 61]: If you 'll allow me , I 'll mention to Mr Riah when he comes in , who you are , and I 'll tell him you 're my friend , and I 'll say my say for you , instead of your saying it for yourself ; I may be able to do it in a more business-like way .
Parsing [sent. 14045 len. 10]: You wo n't consider it a liberty ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14046 len. 14]: I thank you again and again , sir , ' said Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 14047 len. 19]: I am strong , strongly , disinclined to avail myself of your generosity , though my helplessness yields .
Parsing [sent. 14048 len. 29]: For I can not but feel that I -- to put it in the mildest form of speech -- that I have done nothing to deserve it . '
Parsing [sent. 14049 len. 7]: ` Where CAN he be ? '
Parsing [sent. 14050 len. 9]: muttered Fledgeby , referring to his watch again .
Parsing [sent. 14051 len. 9]: ` What CAN he have gone out for ?
Parsing [sent. 14052 len. 10]: Did you ever see him , Mr Twemlow ? '
Parsing [sent. 14053 len. 4]: ` Never . '
Parsing [sent. 14054 len. 21]: ` He is a thorough Jew to look at , but he is a more thorough Jew to deal with .
Parsing [sent. 14055 len. 8]: He 's worst when he 's quiet .
Parsing [sent. 14056 len. 15]: If he 's quiet , I shall take it as a very bad sign .
Parsing [sent. 14057 len. 22]: Keep your eye upon him when he comes in , and , if he 's quiet , do n't be hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 14058 len. 4]: Here he is !
Parsing [sent. 14059 len. 6]: -- He looks quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 14060 len. 32]: With these words , which had the effect of causing the harmless Twemlow painful agitation , Mr Fledgeby withdrew to his former post , and the old man entered the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 14061 len. 18]: ` Why , Mr Riah , ' said Fledgeby , ' I thought you were lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 14062 len. 12]: The old man , glancing at the stranger , stood stock-still .
Parsing [sent. 14063 len. 24]: He perceived that his master was leading up to the orders he was to take , and he waited to understand them . '
Parsing [sent. 14064 len. 18]: I really thought , ' repeated Fledgeby slowly , ` that you were lost , Mr Riah .
Parsing [sent. 14065 len. 28]: Why , now I look at you -- but no , you ca n't have done it ; no , you ca n't have done it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14066 len. 29]: Hat in hand , the old man lifted his head , and looked distressfully at Fledgeby as seeking to know what new moral burden he was to bear .
Parsing [sent. 14067 len. 27]: ` You ca n't have rushed out to get the start of everybody else , and put in that bill of sale at Lammle 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 14068 len. 3]: said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 14069 len. 10]: ` Say you have n't , Mr Riah . '
Parsing [sent. 14070 len. 16]: ` Sir , I have , ' replied the old man in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 14071 len. 6]: ` Oh my eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 14072 len. 3]: cried Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 14073 len. 7]: ` Tut , tut , tut !
Parsing [sent. 14074 len. 6]: Dear , dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 14075 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 14076 len. 23]: I knew you were a hard customer , Mr Riah , but I never thought you were as hard as that . '
Parsing [sent. 14077 len. 21]: ` Sir , ' said the old man , with great uneasiness , ' I do as I am directed .
Parsing [sent. 14078 len. 7]: I am not the principal here .
Parsing [sent. 14079 len. 19]: I am but the agent of a superior , and I have no choice , no power . '
Parsing [sent. 14080 len. 37]: ` Do n't say so , ' retorted Fledgeby , secretly exultant as the old man stretched out his hands , with a shrinking action of defending himself against the sharp construction of the two observers .
Parsing [sent. 14081 len. 13]: ` Do n't play the tune of the trade , Mr Riah .
Parsing [sent. 14082 len. 31]: You 've a right to get in your debts , if you 're determined to do it , but do n't pretend what every one in your line regularly pretends .
Parsing [sent. 14083 len. 10]: At least , do n't do it to me .
Parsing [sent. 14084 len. 7]: Why should you , Mr Riah ?
Parsing [sent. 14085 len. 9]: You know I know all about you . '
Parsing [sent. 14086 len. 23]: The old man clasped the skirt of his long coat with his disengaged hand , and directed a wistful look at Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 14087 len. 38]: ` And do n't , ' said Fledgeby , ` do n't , I entreat you as a favour , Mr Riah , be so devilish meek , for I know what 'll follow if you are .
Parsing [sent. 14088 len. 6]: Look here , Mr Riah .
Parsing [sent. 14089 len. 7]: This gentleman is Mr Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 14090 len. 8]: The Jew turned to him and bowed .
Parsing [sent. 14091 len. 13]: That poor lamb bowed in return ; polite , and terrified . '
Parsing [sent. 14092 len. 46]: I have made such a failure , ' proceeded Fledgeby , ` in trying to do anything with you for my friend Lammle , that I 've hardly a hope of doing anything with you for my friend -LRB- and connexion indeed -RRB- Mr Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 14093 len. 40]: But I do think that if you would do a favour for anybody , you would for me , and I wo n't fail for want of trying , and I 've passed my promise to Mr Twemlow besides .
Parsing [sent. 14094 len. 10]: Now , Mr Riah , here is Mr Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 14095 len. 18]: Always good for his interest , always coming up to time , always paying his little way .
Parsing [sent. 14096 len. 9]: Now , why should you press Mr Twemlow ?
Parsing [sent. 14097 len. 10]: You ca n't have any spite against Mr Twemlow !
Parsing [sent. 14098 len. 9]: Why not be easy with Mr Twemlow ? '
Parsing [sent. 14099 len. 29]: The old man looked into Fledgeby 's little eyes for any sign of leave to be easy with Mr Twemlow ; but there was no sign in them .
Parsing [sent. 14100 len. 42]: ` Mr Twemlow is no connexion of yours , Mr Riah , ' said Fledgeby ; ` you ca n't want to be even with him for having through life gone in for a gentleman and hung on to his Family .
Parsing [sent. 14101 len. 17]: If Mr Twemlow has a contempt for business , what can it matter to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14102 len. 16]: ` But pardon me , ' interposed the gentle victim , ' I have not .
Parsing [sent. 14103 len. 7]: I should consider it presumption . '
Parsing [sent. 14104 len. 7]: ` There , Mr Riah ! '
Parsing [sent. 14105 len. 10]: said Fledgeby , ` is n't that handsomely said ?
Parsing [sent. 14106 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 14107 len. 9]: Make terms with me for Mr Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 14108 len. 17]: The old man looked again for any sign of permission to spare the poor little gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 14109 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 14110 len. 9]: Mr Fledgeby meant him to be racked . '
Parsing [sent. 14111 len. 13]: I am very sorry , Mr Twemlow , ' said Riah . '
Parsing [sent. 14112 len. 5]: I have my instructions .
Parsing [sent. 14113 len. 11]: I am invested with no authority for diverging from them .
Parsing [sent. 14114 len. 7]: The money must be paid . '
Parsing [sent. 14115 len. 15]: ` In full and slap down , do you mean , Mr Riah ? '
Parsing [sent. 14116 len. 9]: asked Fledgeby , to make things quite explicit .
Parsing [sent. 14117 len. 16]: ` In full , sir , and at once , ' was Riah 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 14118 len. 38]: Mr Fledgeby shook his head deploringly at Twemlow , and mutely expressed in reference to the venerable figure standing before him with eyes upon the ground : ` What a Monster of an Israelite this is ! '
Parsing [sent. 14119 len. 8]: ` Mr Riah , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 14120 len. 31]: The old man lifted up his eyes once more to the little eyes in Mr Fledgeby 's head , with some reviving hope that the sign might be coming yet .
Parsing [sent. 14121 len. 15]: ` Mr Riah , it 's of no use my holding back the fact .
Parsing [sent. 14122 len. 21]: There 's a certain great party in the background in Mr Twemlow 's case , and you know it . '
Parsing [sent. 14123 len. 10]: I know it , ' the old man admitted .
Parsing [sent. 14124 len. 17]: ` Now , I 'll put it as a plain point of business , Mr Riah .
Parsing [sent. 14125 len. 31]: Are you fully determined -LRB- as a plain point of business -RRB- either to have that said great party 's security , or that said great party 's money ? '
Parsing [sent. 14126 len. 21]: ` Fully determined , ' answered Riah , as he read his master 's face , and learnt the book .
Parsing [sent. 14127 len. 45]: ` Not at all caring for , and indeed as it seems to me rather enjoying , ' said Fledgeby , with peculiar unction , ` the precious kick-up and row that will come off between Mr Twemlow and the said great party ? '
Parsing [sent. 14128 len. 9]: This required no answer , and received none .
Parsing [sent. 14129 len. 30]: Poor Mr Twemlow , who had betrayed the keenest mental terrors since his noble kinsman loomed in the perspective , rose with a sigh to take his departure . '
Parsing [sent. 14130 len. 18]: I thank you very much , sir , ' he said , offering Fledgeby his feverish hand .
Parsing [sent. 14131 len. 9]: ` You have done me an unmerited service .
Parsing [sent. 14132 len. 7]: Thank you , thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14133 len. 10]: ` Do n't mention it , ' answered Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 14134 len. 23]: ` It 's a failure so far , but I 'll stay behind , and take another touch at Mr Riah . '
Parsing [sent. 14135 len. 22]: ` Do not deceive yourself Mr Twemlow , ' said the Jew , then addressing him directly for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 14136 len. 8]: ` There is no hope for you .
Parsing [sent. 14137 len. 7]: You must expect no leniency here .
Parsing [sent. 14138 len. 23]: You must pay in full , and you can not pay too promptly , or you will be put to heavy charges .
Parsing [sent. 14139 len. 7]: Trust nothing to me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14140 len. 7]: Money , money , money . '
Parsing [sent. 14141 len. 36]: When he had said these words in an emphatic manner , he acknowledged Mr Twemlow 's still polite motion of his head , and that amiable little worthy took his departure in the lowest spirits .
Parsing [sent. 14142 len. 54]: Fascination Fledgeby was in such a merry vein when the countinghouse was cleared of him , that he had nothing for it but to go to the window , and lean his arms on the frame of the blind , and have his silent laugh out , with his back to his subordinate .
Parsing [sent. 14143 len. 34]: When he turned round again with a composed countenance , his subordinate still stood in the same place , and the dolls ' dressmaker sat behind the door with a look of horror .
Parsing [sent. 14144 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 14145 len. 24]: cried Mr Fledgeby , ` you 're forgetting this young lady , Mr Riah , and she has been waiting long enough too .
Parsing [sent. 14146 len. 28]: Sell her her waste , please , and give her good measure if you can make up your mind to do the liberal thing for once . '
Parsing [sent. 14147 len. 53]: He looked on for a time , as the Jew filled her little basket with such scraps as she was used to buy ; but , his merry vein coming on again , he was obliged to turn round to the window once more , and lean his arms on the blind .
Parsing [sent. 14148 len. 29]: ` There , my Cinderella dear , ' said the old man in a whisper , and with a worn-out look , ` the basket 's full now .
Parsing [sent. 14149 len. 3]: Bless you !
Parsing [sent. 14150 len. 6]: And get you gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 14151 len. 15]: ` Do n't call me your Cinderella dear , ' returned Miss Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 14152 len. 6]: O you cruel godmother ! '
Parsing [sent. 14153 len. 32]: She shook that emphatic little forefinger of hers in his face at parting , as earnestly and reproachfully as she had ever shaken it at her grim old child at home .
Parsing [sent. 14154 len. 10]: ` You are not the godmother at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 14155 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 14156 len. 13]: ` You are the Wolf in the Forest , the wicked Wolf !
Parsing [sent. 14157 len. 21]: And if ever my dear Lizzie is sold and betrayed , I shall know who sold and betrayed her ! '
Parsing [sent. 14158 len. 37]: Chapter 14 MR WEGG PREPARES A GRINDSTONE FOR MR BOFFIN 'S NOSE Having assisted at a few more expositions of the lives of Misers , Mr Venus became almost indispensable to the evenings at the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 14159 len. 142]: The circumstance of having another listener to the wonders unfolded by Wegg , or , as it were , another calculator to cast up the guineas found in teapots , chimneys , racks and mangers , and other such banks of deposit , seemed greatly to heighten Mr Boffin 's enjoyment ; while Silas Wegg , for his part , though of a jealous temperament which might under ordinary circumstances have resented the anatomist 's getting into favour , was so very anxious to keep his eye on that gentleman -- lest , being too much left to himself , he should be tempted to play any tricks with the precious document in his keeping -- that he never lost an opportunity of commending him to Mr Boffin 's notice as a third party whose company was much to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 14160 len. 11]: Another friendly demonstration towards him Mr Wegg now regularly gratified .
Parsing [sent. 14161 len. 20]: After each sitting was over , and the patron had departed , Mr Wegg invariably saw Mr Venus home .
Parsing [sent. 14162 len. 92]: To be sure , he as invariably requested to be refreshed with a sight of the paper in which he was a joint proprietor ; but he never failed to remark that it was the great pleasure he derived from Mr Venus 's improving society which had insensibly lured him round to Clerkenwell again , and that , finding himself once more attracted to the spot by the social powers of Mr V. , he would beg leave to go through that little incidental procedure , as a matter of form .
Parsing [sent. 14163 len. 45]: ` For well I know , sir , ' Mr Wegg would add , ` that a man of your delicate mind would wish to be checked off whenever the opportunity arises , and it is not for me to baulk your feelings . '
Parsing [sent. 14164 len. 40]: A certain rustiness in Mr Venus , which never became so lubricated by the oil of Mr Wegg but that he turned under the screw in a creaking and stiff manner , was very noticeable at about this period .
Parsing [sent. 14165 len. 68]: While assisting at the literary evenings , he even went so far , on two or three occasions , as to correct Mr Wegg when he grossly mispronounced a word , or made nonsense of a passage ; insomuch that Mr Wegg took to surveying his course in the day , and to making arrangements for getting round rocks at night instead of running straight upon them .
Parsing [sent. 14166 len. 34]: Of the slightest anatomical reference he became particularly shy , and , if he saw a bone ahead , would go any distance out of his way rather than mention it by name .
Parsing [sent. 14167 len. 27]: The adverse destinies ordained that one evening Mr Wegg 's labouring bark became beset by polysyllables , and embarrassed among a perfect archipelago of hard words .
Parsing [sent. 14168 len. 27]: It being necessary to take soundings every minute , and to feel the way with the greatest caution , Mr Wegg 's attention was fully employed .
Parsing [sent. 14169 len. 31]: Advantage was taken of this dilemma by Mr Venus , to pass a scrap of paper into Mr Boffin 's hand , and lay his finger on his own lip .
Parsing [sent. 14170 len. 45]: When Mr Boffin got home at night he found that the paper contained Mr Venus 's card and these words : ` Should be glad to be honoured with a call respecting business of your own , about dusk on an early evening . '
Parsing [sent. 14171 len. 43]: The very next evening saw Mr Boffin peeping in at the preserved frogs in Mr Venus 's shop-window , and saw Mr Venus espying Mr Boffin with the readiness of one on the alert , and beckoning that gentleman into his interior .
Parsing [sent. 14172 len. 31]: Responding , Mr Boffin was invited to seat himself on the box of human miscellanies before the fire , and did so , looking round the place with admiring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14173 len. 30]: The fire being low and fitful , and the dusk gloomy , the whole stock seemed to be winking and blinking with both eyes , as Mr Venus did .
Parsing [sent. 14174 len. 46]: The French gentleman , though he had no eyes , was not at all behindhand , but appeared , as the flame rose and fell , to open and shut his no eyes , with the regularity of the glass-eyed dogs and ducks and birds .
Parsing [sent. 14175 len. 16]: The big-headed babies were equally obliging in lending their grotesque aid to the general effect .
Parsing [sent. 14176 len. 18]: ` You see , Mr Venus , I 've lost no time , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14177 len. 6]: ` Here I am . '
Parsing [sent. 14178 len. 13]: ` Here you are , sir , ' assented Mr Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 14179 len. 42]: I do n't like secrecy , ' pursued Mr Boffin -- ` at least , not in a general way I do n't -- but I dare say you 'll show me good reason for being secret so far . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14180 len. 11]: I think I shall , sir , ' returned Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14181 len. 8]: ` Good , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14182 len. 14]: ` You do n't expect Wegg , I take it for granted ? '
Parsing [sent. 14183 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14184 len. 10]: I expect no one but the present company . '
Parsing [sent. 14185 len. 34]: Mr Boffin glanced about him , as accepting under that inclusive denomination the French gentleman and the circle in which he did n't move , and repeated , ` The present company . '
Parsing [sent. 14186 len. 32]: ` Sir , ' said Mr Venus , ` before entering upon business , I shall have to ask you for your word and honour that we are in confidence . '
Parsing [sent. 14187 len. 18]: ` Let 's wait a bit and understand what the expression means , ' answered Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14188 len. 7]: ` In confidence for how long ?
Parsing [sent. 14189 len. 10]: In confidence for ever and a day ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14190 len. 41]: I take your hint , sir , ' said Venus ; ` you think you might consider the business , when you came to know it , to be of a nature incompatible with confidence on your part ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14191 len. 12]: I might , ' said Mr Boffin with a cautious look .
Parsing [sent. 14192 len. 5]: ` True , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14193 len. 28]: Well , sir , ' observed Venus , after clutching at his dusty hair , to brighten his ideas , ` let us put it another way .
Parsing [sent. 14194 len. 31]: I open the business with you , relying upon your honour not to do anything in it , and not to mention me in it , without my knowledge . '
Parsing [sent. 14195 len. 11]: ` That sounds fair , ' said Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14196 len. 7]: I agree to that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14197 len. 10]: I have your word and honour , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14198 len. 33]: ` My good fellow , ' retorted Mr Boffin , ` you have my word ; and how you can have that , without my honour too , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 14199 len. 24]: I 've sorted a lot of dust in my time , but I never knew the two things go into separate heaps . '
Parsing [sent. 14200 len. 9]: This remark seemed rather to abash Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14201 len. 31]: He hesitated , and said , ` Very true , sir ; ' and again , ` Very true , sir , ' before resuming the thread of his discourse .
Parsing [sent. 14202 len. 63]: ` Mr Boffin , if I confess to you that I fell into a proposal of which you were the subject , and of which you ought n't to have been the subject , you will allow me to mention , and will please take into favourable consideration , that I was in a crushed state of mind at the time . '
Parsing [sent. 14203 len. 47]: The Golden Dustman , with his hands folded on the top of his stout stick , with his chin resting upon them , and with something leering and whimsical in his eyes , gave a nod , and said , ` Quite so , Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 14204 len. 32]: ` That proposal , sir , was a conspiring breach of your confidence , to such an extent , that I ought at once to have made it known to you .
Parsing [sent. 14205 len. 15]: But I did n't , Mr Boffin , and I fell into it . '
Parsing [sent. 14206 len. 23]: Without moving eye or finger , Mr Boffin gave another nod , and placidly repeated , ` Quite so , Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 14207 len. 73]: ` Not that I was ever hearty in it , sir , ' the penitent anatomist went on , ` or that I ever viewed myself with anything but reproach for having turned out of the paths of science into the paths of -- ' he was going to say ` villany , ' but , unwilling to press too hard upon himself , substituted with great emphasis -- ` Weggery . '
Parsing [sent. 14208 len. 19]: Placid and whimsical of look as ever , Mr Boffin answered : ` Quite so , Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 14209 len. 26]: ` And now , sir , ' said Venus , ` having prepared your mind in the rough , I will articulate the details . '
Parsing [sent. 14210 len. 21]: With which brief professional exordium , he entered on the history of the friendly move , and truly recounted it .
Parsing [sent. 14211 len. 41]: One might have thought that it would have extracted some show of surprise or anger , or other emotion , from Mr Boffin , but it extracted nothing beyond his former comment : ` Quite so , Venus . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14212 len. 11]: I have astonished you , sir , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 14213 len. 7]: said Mr Venus , pausing dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 14214 len. 14]: Mr Boffin simply answered as aforesaid : ` Quite so , Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 14215 len. 12]: By this time the astonishment was all on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 14216 len. 9]: It did not , however , so continue .
Parsing [sent. 14217 len. 60]: For , when Venus passed to Wegg 's discovery , and from that to their having both seen Mr Boffin dig up the Dutch bottle , that gentleman changed colour , changed his attitude , became extremely restless , and ended -LRB- when Venus ended -RRB- by being in a state of manifest anxiety , trepidation , and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 14218 len. 35]: ` Now , sir , ' said Venus , finishing off ; ` you best know what was in that Dutch bottle , and why you dug it up , and took it away .
Parsing [sent. 14219 len. 14]: I do n't pretend to know anything more about it than I saw .
Parsing [sent. 14220 len. 48]: All I know is this : I am proud of my calling after all -LRB- though it has been attended by one dreadful drawback which has told upon my heart , and almost equally upon my skeleton -RRB- , and I mean to live by my calling .
Parsing [sent. 14221 len. 22]: Putting the same meaning into other words , I do not mean to turn a single dishonest penny by this affair .
Parsing [sent. 14222 len. 31]: As the best amends I can make you for having ever gone into it , I make known to you , as a warning , what Wegg has found out .
Parsing [sent. 14223 len. 36]: My opinion is , that Wegg is not to be silenced at a modest price , and I build that opinion on his beginning to dispose of your property the moment he knew his power .
Parsing [sent. 14224 len. 25]: Whether it 's worth your while to silence him at any price , you will decide for yourself , and take your measures accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 14225 len. 12]: As far as I am concerned , I have no price .
Parsing [sent. 14226 len. 30]: If I am ever called upon for the truth , I tell it , but I want to do no more than I have now done and ended . '
Parsing [sent. 14227 len. 8]: ` Thank ` ee , Venus ! '
Parsing [sent. 14228 len. 26]: said Mr Boffin , with a hearty grip of his hand ; ` thank ` ee , Venus , thank ` ee , Venus ! '
Parsing [sent. 14229 len. 13]: And then walked up and down the little shop in great agitation .
Parsing [sent. 14230 len. 40]: ` But look here , Venus , ' he byand-by resumed , nervously sitting down again ; ` if I have to buy Wegg up , I sha n't buy him any cheaper for your being out of it .
Parsing [sent. 14231 len. 18]: Instead of his having half the money -- it was to have been half , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 14232 len. 6]: Share and share alike ? '
Parsing [sent. 14233 len. 14]: ` It was to have been half , sir , ' answered Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14234 len. 11]: ` Instead of that , he 'll now have all .
Parsing [sent. 14235 len. 10]: I shall pay the same , if not more .
Parsing [sent. 14236 len. 15]: For you tell me he 's an unconscionable dog , a ravenous rascal . '
Parsing [sent. 14237 len. 8]: ` He is , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14238 len. 64]: ` Do n't you think , Venus , ' insinuated Mr Boffin , after looking at the fire for a while -- ` do n't you feel as if -- you might like to pretend to be in it till Wegg was bought up , and then ease your mind by handing over to me what you had made believe to pocket ? '
Parsing [sent. 14239 len. 15]: ` No I do n't , sir , ' returned Venus , very positively .
Parsing [sent. 14240 len. 7]: ` Not to make amends ? '
Parsing [sent. 14241 len. 4]: insinuated Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14242 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14243 len. 31]: It seems to me , after maturely thinking it over , that the best amends for having got out of the square is to get back into the square . '
Parsing [sent. 14244 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 14245 len. 4]: mused Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14246 len. 28]: ` When you say the square , you mean -- ' ' I mean , ' said Venus , stoutly and shortly , ` the right . '
Parsing [sent. 14247 len. 33]: ` It appears to me , ' said Mr Boffin , grumbling over the fire in an injured manner , ` that the right is with me , if it 's anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 14248 len. 18]: I have much more right to the old man 's money than the Crown can ever have .
Parsing [sent. 14249 len. 12]: What was the Crown to him except the King 's Taxes ?
Parsing [sent. 14250 len. 16]: Whereas , me and my wife , we was all in all to him . '
Parsing [sent. 14251 len. 53]: Mr Venus , with his head upon his hands , rendered melancholy by the contemplation of Mr Boffin 's avarice , only murmured to steep himself in the luxury of that frame of mind : ` She did not wish so to regard herself , nor yet to be so regarded . '
Parsing [sent. 14252 len. 34]: ` And how am I to live , ' asked Mr Boffin , piteously , ` if I 'm to be going buying fellows up out of the little that I 've got ?
Parsing [sent. 14253 len. 9]: And how am I to set about it ?
Parsing [sent. 14254 len. 9]: When am I to get my money ready ?
Parsing [sent. 14255 len. 8]: When am I to make a bid ?
Parsing [sent. 14256 len. 15]: You have n't told me when he threatens to drop down upon me . '
Parsing [sent. 14257 len. 28]: Venus explained under what conditions , and with what views , the dropping down upon Mr Boffin was held over until the Mounds should be cleared away .
Parsing [sent. 14258 len. 6]: Mr Boffin listened attentively . '
Parsing [sent. 14259 len. 29]: I suppose , ' said he , with a gleam of hope , ` there 's no doubt about the genuineness and date of this confounded will ? '
Parsing [sent. 14260 len. 9]: ` None whatever , ' said Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14261 len. 10]: ` Where might it be deposited at present ? '
Parsing [sent. 14262 len. 9]: asked Mr Boffin , in a wheedling tone .
Parsing [sent. 14263 len. 10]: ` It 's in my possession , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 14264 len. 5]: ` Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14265 len. 7]: he cried , with great eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 14266 len. 26]: ` Now , for any liberal sum of money that could be agreed upon , Venus , would you put it in the fire ? '
Parsing [sent. 14267 len. 14]: ` No , sir , I would n't , ' interrupted Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14268 len. 9]: ` Nor pass it over to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14269 len. 8]: ` That would be the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 14270 len. 9]: No , sir , ' said Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14271 len. 23]: The Golden Dustman seemed about to pursue these questions , when a stumping noise was heard outside , coming towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 14272 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 14273 len. 5]: here 's Wegg ! '
Parsing [sent. 14274 len. 3]: said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14275 len. 19]: ` Get behind the young alligator in the corner , Mr Boffin , and judge him for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 14276 len. 39]: I wo n't light a candle till he 's gone ; there 'll only be the glow of the fire ; Wegg 's well acquainted with the alligator , and he wo n't take particular notice of him .
Parsing [sent. 14277 len. 23]: Draw your legs in , Mr Boffin , at present I see a pair of shoes at the end of his tail .
Parsing [sent. 14278 len. 28]: Get your head well behind his smile , Mr Boffin , and you 'll lie comfortable there ; you 'll find plenty of room behind his smile .
Parsing [sent. 14279 len. 15]: He 's a little dusty , but he 's very like you in tone .
Parsing [sent. 14280 len. 7]: Are you right , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14281 len. 15]: Mr Boffin had but whispered an affirmative response , when Wegg came stumping in .
Parsing [sent. 14282 len. 18]: ` Partner , ' said that gentleman in a sprightly manner , ` how 's yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 14283 len. 8]: ` Tolerable , ' returned Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14284 len. 8]: ` Not much to boast of . '
Parsing [sent. 14285 len. 4]: ` In-deed ! '
Parsing [sent. 14286 len. 34]: said Wegg : ` sorry , partner , that you 're not picking up faster , but your soul 's too large for your body , sir ; that 's where it is .
Parsing [sent. 14287 len. 10]: And how 's our stock in trade , partner ?
Parsing [sent. 14288 len. 8]: Safe bind , safe find , partner ?
Parsing [sent. 14289 len. 6]: Is that about it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14290 len. 9]: ` Do you wish to see it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14291 len. 3]: asked Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14292 len. 16]: ` If you please , partner , ' said Wegg , rubbing his hands . '
Parsing [sent. 14293 len. 9]: I wish to see it jintly with yourself .
Parsing [sent. 14294 len. 36]: Or , in similar words to some that was set to music some time back : `` I wish you to see it with your eyes , And I will pledge with mine . '' '
Parsing [sent. 14295 len. 21]: Turning his back and turning a key , Mr Venus produced the document , holding on by his usual corner .
Parsing [sent. 14296 len. 27]: Mr Wegg , holding on by the opposite corner , sat down on the seat so lately vacated by Mr Boffin , and looked it over .
Parsing [sent. 14297 len. 26]: ` All right , sir , ' he slowly and unwillingly admitted , in his reluctance to loose his hold , ` all right ! '
Parsing [sent. 14298 len. 18]: And greedily watched his partner as he turned his back again , and turned his key again .
Parsing [sent. 14299 len. 10]: ` There 's nothing new , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 14300 len. 11]: said Venus , resuming his low chair behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 14301 len. 19]: ` Yes there is , sir , ' replied Wegg ; ` there was something new this morning .
Parsing [sent. 14302 len. 13]: That foxey old grasper and griper -- ' ` Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 14303 len. 16]: inquired Venus , with a glance towards the alligator 's yard or two of smile .
Parsing [sent. 14304 len. 6]: ` Mister be blowed ! '
Parsing [sent. 14305 len. 9]: cried Wegg , yielding to his honest indignation .
Parsing [sent. 14306 len. 3]: ` Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14307 len. 3]: Dusty Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14308 len. 38]: That foxey old grunter and grinder , sir , turns into the yard this morning , to meddle with our property , a menial tool of his own , a young man by the name of Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 14309 len. 18]: Ecod , when I say to him , `` What do you want here , young man ?
Parsing [sent. 14310 len. 26]: This is a private yard , '' he pulls out a paper from Boffin 's other blackguard , the one I was passed over for .
Parsing [sent. 14311 len. 17]: `` This is to authorize Sloppy to overlook the carting and to watch the work . ''
Parsing [sent. 14312 len. 12]: That 's pretty strong , I think , Mr Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 14313 len. 18]: ` Remember he does n't know yet of our claim on the property , ' suggested Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14314 len. 27]: ` Then he must have a hint of it , ' said Wegg , ` and a strong one that 'll jog his terrors a bit .
Parsing [sent. 14315 len. 12]: Give him an inch , and he 'll take an ell .
Parsing [sent. 14316 len. 16]: Let him alone this time , and what 'll he do with our property next ?
Parsing [sent. 14317 len. 28]: I tell you what , Mr Venus ; it comes to this ; I must be overbearing with Boffin , or I shall fly into several pieces .
Parsing [sent. 14318 len. 11]: I ca n't contain myself when I look at him .
Parsing [sent. 14319 len. 21]: Every time I see him putting his hand in his pocket , I see him putting it into my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 14320 len. 18]: Every time I hear him jingling his money , I hear him taking liberties with my money .
Parsing [sent. 14321 len. 8]: Flesh and blood ca n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 14322 len. 17]: No , ' said Mr Wegg , greatly exasperated , ` and I 'll go further .
Parsing [sent. 14323 len. 9]: A wooden leg ca n't bear it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14324 len. 32]: ` But , Mr Wegg , ' urged Venus , ` it was your own idea that he should not be exploded upon , till the Mounds were carted away . '
Parsing [sent. 14325 len. 49]: ` But it was likewise my idea , Mr Venus , ' retorted Wegg , ` that if he came sneaking and sniffing about the property , he should be threatened , given to understand that he has no right to it , and be made our slave .
Parsing [sent. 14326 len. 10]: Was n't that my idea , Mr Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 14327 len. 9]: ` It certainly was , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 14328 len. 25]: ` It certainly was , as you say , partner , ' assented Wegg , put into a better humour by the ready admission .
Parsing [sent. 14329 len. 4]: ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 14330 len. 20]: I consider his planting one of his menial tools in the yard , an act of sneaking and sniffing .
Parsing [sent. 14331 len. 13]: And his nose shall be put to the grindstone for it . '
Parsing [sent. 14332 len. 31]: ` It was not your fault , Mr Wegg , I must admit , ' said Venus , ` that he got off with the Dutch bottle that night . '
Parsing [sent. 14333 len. 9]: ` As you handsomely say again , partner !
Parsing [sent. 14334 len. 8]: No , it was not my fault .
Parsing [sent. 14335 len. 10]: I 'd have had that bottle out of him .
Parsing [sent. 14336 len. 60]: Was it to be borne that he should come , like a thief in the dark , digging among stuff that was far more ours than his -LRB- seeing that we could deprive him of every grain of it , if he did n't buy us at our own figure -RRB- , and carrying off treasure from its bowels ?
Parsing [sent. 14337 len. 9]: No , it was not to be borne .
Parsing [sent. 14338 len. 16]: And for that , too , his nose shall be put to the grindstone . '
Parsing [sent. 14339 len. 13]: ` How do you propose to do it , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 14340 len. 9]: ` To put his nose to the grindstone ?
Parsing [sent. 14341 len. 15]: I propose , ' returned that estimable man , ` to insult him openly .
Parsing [sent. 14342 len. 50]: And , if looking into this eye of mine , he dares to offer a word in answer , to retort upon him before he can take his breath , `` Add another word to that , you dusty old dog , and you 're a beggar . '' '
Parsing [sent. 14343 len. 10]: ` Suppose he says nothing , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 14344 len. 32]: ` Then , ' replied Wegg , ` we shall have come to an understanding with very little trouble , and I 'll break him and drive him , Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14345 len. 24]: I 'll put him in harness , and I 'll bear him up tight , and I 'll break him and drive him .
Parsing [sent. 14346 len. 16]: The harder the old Dust is driven , sir , the higher he 'll pay .
Parsing [sent. 14347 len. 16]: And I mean to be paid high , Mr Venus , I promise you . '
Parsing [sent. 14348 len. 10]: ` You speak quite revengefully , Mr Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 14349 len. 5]: ` Revengefully , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 14350 len. 15]: Is it for him that I have declined and falled , night after night ?
Parsing [sent. 14351 len. 49]: Is it for his pleasure that I 've waited at home of an evening , like a set of skittles , to be set up and knocked over , set up and knocked over , by whatever balls -- or books -- he chose to bring against me ?
Parsing [sent. 14352 len. 19]: Why , I 'm a hundred times the man he is , sir ; five hundred times ! '
Parsing [sent. 14353 len. 24]: Perhaps it was with the malicious intent of urging him on to his worst that Mr Venus looked as if he doubted that .
Parsing [sent. 14354 len. 3]: ` What ?
Parsing [sent. 14355 len. 71]: Was it outside the house at present ockypied , to its disgrace , by that minion of fortune and worm of the hour , ' said Wegg , falling back upon his strongest terms of reprobation , and slapping the counter , ` that I , Silas Wegg , five hundred times the man he ever was , sat in all weathers , waiting for a errand or a customer ?
Parsing [sent. 14356 len. 32]: Was it outside that very house as I first set eyes upon him , rolling in the lap of luxury , when I was selling halfpenny ballads there for a living ?
Parsing [sent. 14357 len. 14]: And am I to grovel in the dust for HIM to walk over ?
Parsing [sent. 14358 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 14359 len. 46]: There was a grin upon the ghastly countenance of the French gentleman under the influence of the firelight , as if he were computing how many thousand slanderers and traitors array themselves against the fortunate , on premises exactly answering to those of Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 14360 len. 34]: One might have fancied that the big-headed babies were toppling over with their hydrocephalic attempts to reckon up the children of men who transform their benefactors into their injurers by the same process .
Parsing [sent. 14361 len. 40]: The yard or two of smile on the part of the alligator might have been invested with the meaning , ` All about this was quite familiar knowledge down in the depths of the slime , ages ago . '
Parsing [sent. 14362 len. 35]: ` But , ' said Wegg , possibly with some slight perception to the foregoing effect , ` your speaking countenance remarks , Mr Venus , that I 'm duller and savager than usual .
Parsing [sent. 14363 len. 10]: Perhaps I HAVE allowed myself to brood too much .
Parsing [sent. 14364 len. 5]: Begone , dull Care !
Parsing [sent. 14365 len. 6]: 'T is gone , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14366 len. 13]: I 've looked in upon you , and empire resumes her sway .
Parsing [sent. 14367 len. 34]: For , as the song says -- subject to your correction , sir -- `` When the heart of a man is depressed with cares , The mist is dispelled if Venus appears .
Parsing [sent. 14368 len. 23]: Like the notes of a fiddle , you sweetly , sir , sweetly , Raises our spirits and charms our ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 14369 len. 6]: Good-night , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14370 len. 36]: I shall have a word or two to say to you , Mr Wegg , before long , ' remarked Venus , ` respecting my share in the project we 've been speaking of . '
Parsing [sent. 14371 len. 14]: ` My time , sir , ' returned Wegg , ` is yours .
Parsing [sent. 14372 len. 29]: In the meanwhile let it be fully understood that I shall not neglect bringing the grindstone to bear , nor yet bringing Dusty Boffin 's nose to it .
Parsing [sent. 14373 len. 28]: His nose once brought to it , shall be held to it by these hands , Mr Venus , till the sparks flies out in showers . '
Parsing [sent. 14374 len. 15]: With this agreeable promise Wegg stumped out , and shut the shop-door after him .
Parsing [sent. 14375 len. 25]: ` Wait till I light a candle , Mr Boffin , ' said Venus , ` and you 'll come out more comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 14376 len. 68]: So , he lighting a candle and holding it up at arm 's length , Mr Boffin disengaged himself from behind the alligator 's smile , with an expression of countenance so very downcast that it not only appeared as if the alligator had the whole of the joke to himself , but further as if it had been conceived and executed at Mr Boffin 's expense .
Parsing [sent. 14377 len. 30]: ` That 's a treacherous fellow , ' said Mr Boffin , dusting his arms and legs as he came forth , the alligator having been but musty company .
Parsing [sent. 14378 len. 8]: ` That 's a dreadful fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 14379 len. 7]: ` The alligator , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14380 len. 3]: said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14381 len. 7]: ` No , Venus , no .
Parsing [sent. 14382 len. 4]: The Serpent . '
Parsing [sent. 14383 len. 44]: ` You 'll have the goodness to notice , Mr Boffin , ' remarked Venus , ` that I said nothing to him about my going out of the affair altogether , because I did n't wish to take you anyways by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 14384 len. 36]: But I ca n't be too soon out of it for my satisfaction , Mr Boffin , and I now put it to you when it will suit your views for me to retire ? '
Parsing [sent. 14385 len. 36]: ` Thank ` ee , Venus , thank ` ee , Venus ; but I do n't know what to say , ' returned Mr Boflin , ' I do n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 14386 len. 9]: He 'll drop down on me any way .
Parsing [sent. 14387 len. 13]: He seems fully determined to drop down ; do n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 14388 len. 10]: Mr Venus opined that such was clearly his intention .
Parsing [sent. 14389 len. 38]: ` You might be a sort of protection for me , if you remained in it , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` you might stand betwixt him and me , and take the edge off him .
Parsing [sent. 14390 len. 28]: Do n't you feel as if you could make a show of remaining in it , Venus , till I had time to turn myself round ? '
Parsing [sent. 14391 len. 18]: Venus naturally inquired how long Mr Boffin thought it might take him to turn himself round ? '
Parsing [sent. 14392 len. 19]: I am sure I do n't know , ' was the answer , given quite at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 14393 len. 9]: ` Everything is so at sixes and sevens .
Parsing [sent. 14394 len. 15]: If I had never come into the property , I should n't have minded .
Parsing [sent. 14395 len. 28]: But being in it , it would be very trying to be turned out ; now , do n't you acknowledge that it would , Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 14396 len. 23]: Mr Venus preferred , he said , to leave Mr Boffin to arrive at his own conclusions on that delicate question . '
Parsing [sent. 14397 len. 16]: I am sure I do n't know what to do , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14398 len. 47]: ` If I ask advice of any one else , it 's only letting in another person to be bought out , and then I shall be ruined that way , and might as well have given up the property and gone slap to the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 14399 len. 21]: If I was to take advice of my young man , Rokesmith , I should have to buy HIM out .
Parsing [sent. 14400 len. 17]: Sooner or later , of course , he 'd drop down upon me , like Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 14401 len. 18]: I was brought into the world to be dropped down upon , it appears to me . '
Parsing [sent. 14402 len. 29]: Mr Venus listened to these lamentations in silence , while Mr Boffin jogged to and fro , holding his pockets as if he had a pain in them .
Parsing [sent. 14403 len. 17]: ` After all , you have n't said what you mean to do yourself , Venus .
Parsing [sent. 14404 len. 16]: When you do go out of it , how do you mean to go ? '
Parsing [sent. 14405 len. 59]: Venus replied that as Wegg had found the document and handed it to him , it was his intention to hand it back to Wegg , with the declaration that he himself would have nothing to say to it , or do with it , and that Wegg must act as he chose , and take the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 14406 len. 14]: ` And then he drops down with his whole weight upon ME ! '
Parsing [sent. 14407 len. 6]: cried Mr Boffin , ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 14408 len. 25]: ` I 'd sooner be dropped upon by you than by him , or even by you jintly , than by him alone ! '
Parsing [sent. 14409 len. 58]: Mr Venus could only repeat that it was his fixed intention to betake himself to the paths of science , and to walk in the same all the days of his life ; not dropping down upon his fellow-creatures until they were deceased , and then only to articulate them to the best of his humble ability .
Parsing [sent. 14410 len. 18]: ` How long could you be persuaded to keep up the appearance of remaining in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14411 len. 10]: asked Mr Boffin , retiring on his other idea .
Parsing [sent. 14412 len. 16]: ` Could you be got to do so , till the Mounds are gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 14413 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 14414 len. 14]: That would protract themental uneasiness of Mr Venus too long , he said .
Parsing [sent. 14415 len. 12]: ` Not if I was to show you reason now ? '
Parsing [sent. 14416 len. 18]: demanded Mr Boffin ; ` not if I was to show you good and sufficient reason ? '
Parsing [sent. 14417 len. 27]: If by good and sufficient reason Mr Boffin meant honest and unimpeachable reason , that might weigh with Mr Venus against his personal wishes and convenience .
Parsing [sent. 14418 len. 19]: But he must add that he saw no opening to the possibility of such reason being shown him .
Parsing [sent. 14419 len. 19]: ` Come and see me , Venus , ' said Mr Boffin , ` at my house . '
Parsing [sent. 14420 len. 9]: ` Is the reason there , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14421 len. 11]: asked Mr Venus , with an incredulous smile and blink .
Parsing [sent. 14422 len. 22]: ` It may be , or may not be , ' said Mr Boffin , ` just as you view it .
Parsing [sent. 14423 len. 12]: But in the meantime do n't go out of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 14424 len. 3]: Look here .
Parsing [sent. 14425 len. 3]: Do this .
Parsing [sent. 14426 len. 34]: Give me your word that you wo n't take any steps with Wegg , without my knowledge , just as I have given you my word that I wo n't without yours . '
Parsing [sent. 14427 len. 7]: ` Done , Mr Boffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 14428 len. 7]: said Venus , after brief consideration .
Parsing [sent. 14429 len. 13]: ` Thank ` ee , Venus , thank ` ee , Venus !
Parsing [sent. 14430 len. 3]: Done ! '
Parsing [sent. 14431 len. 13]: ` When shall I come to see you , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14432 len. 5]: ` When you like .
Parsing [sent. 14433 len. 5]: The sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 14434 len. 6]: I must be going now .
Parsing [sent. 14435 len. 5]: Good-night , Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 14436 len. 6]: ` Good-night , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 14437 len. 21]: ` And good-night to the rest of the present company , ' said Mr Boffin , glancing round the shop .
Parsing [sent. 14438 len. 22]: ` They make a queer show , Venus , and I should like to be better acquainted with them some day .
Parsing [sent. 14439 len. 6]: Good-night , Venus , good-night !
Parsing [sent. 14440 len. 9]: Thankee , Venus , thankee , Venus ! '
Parsing [sent. 14441 len. 16]: With that he jogged out into the street , and jogged upon his homeward way .
Parsing [sent. 14442 len. 36]: ` Now , I wonder , ' he meditated as he went along , nursing his stick , ` whether it can be , that Venus is setting himself to get the better of Wegg ?
Parsing [sent. 14443 len. 32]: Whether it can be , that he means , when I have bought Wegg out , to have me all to himself and to pick me clean to the bones ! '
Parsing [sent. 14444 len. 33]: It was a cunning and suspicious idea , quite in the way of his school of Misers , and he looked very cunning and suspicious as he went jogging through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 14445 len. 44]: More than once or twice , more than twice or thrice , say half a dozen times , he took his stick from the arm on which he nursed it , and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head .
Parsing [sent. 14446 len. 23]: Possibly the wooden countenance of Mr Silas Wegg was incorporeally before him at those moments , for he hit with intense satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 14447 len. 34]: He was within a few streets of his own house , when a little private carriage , coming in the contrary direction , passed him , turned round , and passed him again .
Parsing [sent. 14448 len. 29]: It was a little carriage of eccentric movement , for again he heard it stop behind him and turn round , and again he saw it pass him .
Parsing [sent. 14449 len. 13]: Then it stopped , and then went on , out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 14450 len. 26]: But , not far out of sight , for , when he came to the corner of his own street , there it stood again .
Parsing [sent. 14451 len. 34]: There was a lady 's face at the window as he came up with this carriage , and he was passing it when the lady softly called to him by his name . '
Parsing [sent. 14452 len. 8]: I beg your pardon , Ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 14453 len. 9]: said Mr Boffin , coming to a stop .
Parsing [sent. 14454 len. 11]: ` It is Mrs Lammle , ' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 14455 len. 15]: Mr Boffin went up to the window , and hoped Mrs Lammle was well .
Parsing [sent. 14456 len. 23]: ` Not very well , dear Mr Boffin ; I have fluttered myself by being -- perhaps foolishly -- uneasy and anxious .
Parsing [sent. 14457 len. 9]: I have been waiting for you some time .
Parsing [sent. 14458 len. 7]: Can I speak to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14459 len. 20]: Mr Boffin proposed that Mrs Lammle should drive on to his house , a few hundred yards further . '
Parsing [sent. 14460 len. 14]: I would rather not , Mr Boffin , unless you particularly wish it .
Parsing [sent. 14461 len. 24]: I feel the difficulty and delicacy of the matter so much that I would rather avoid speaking to you at your own home .
Parsing [sent. 14462 len. 8]: You must think this very strange ? '
Parsing [sent. 14463 len. 9]: Mr Boffin said no , but meant yes .
Parsing [sent. 14464 len. 47]: ` It is because I am so grateful for the good opinion of all my friends , and am so touched by it , that I can not bear to run the risk of forfeiting it in any case , even in the cause of duty .
Parsing [sent. 14465 len. 29]: I have asked my husband -LRB- my dear Alfred , Mr Boffin -RRB- whether it is the cause of duty , and he has most emphatically said Yes .
Parsing [sent. 14466 len. 8]: I wish I had asked him sooner .
Parsing [sent. 14467 len. 9]: It would have spared me much distress . '
Parsing [sent. 14468 len. 12]: -LRB- ` Can this be more dropping down upon me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14469 len. 8]: thought Mr Boffin , quite bewildered . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14470 len. 13]: ` It was Alfred who sent me to you , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14471 len. 23]: Alfred said , `` Do n't come back , Sophronia , until you have seen Mr Boffin , and told him all .
Parsing [sent. 14472 len. 15]: Whatever he may think of it , he ought certainly to know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 14473 len. 9]: Would you mind coming into the carriage ? '
Parsing [sent. 14474 len. 20]: Mr Boffin answered , ` Not at all , ' and took his seat at Mrs Lammle 's side .
Parsing [sent. 14475 len. 23]: ` Drive slowly anywhere , ' Mrs Lammle called to her coachman , ` and do n't let the carriage rattle . '
Parsing [sent. 14476 len. 18]: ` It MUST he more dropping down , I think , ' said Mr Boffin to himself .
Parsing [sent. 14477 len. 5]: ` What next ? '
Parsing [sent. 14478 len. 30]: Chapter 15 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN AT HIS WORST The breakfast table at Mr Boffin 's was usually a very pleasant one , and was always presided over by Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14479 len. 46]: As though he began each new day in his healthy natural character , and some waking hours were necessary to his relapse into the corrupting influences of his wealth , the face and the demeanour of the Golden Dustman were generally unclouded at that meal .
Parsing [sent. 14480 len. 17]: It would have been easy to believe then , that there was no change in him .
Parsing [sent. 14481 len. 21]: It was as the day went on that the clouds gathered , and the brightness of the mornmg became obscured .
Parsing [sent. 14482 len. 27]: One might have said that the shadows of avarice and distrust lengthened as his own shadow lengthened , and that the night closed around him gradually .
Parsing [sent. 14483 len. 23]: But , one morning long afterwards to be remembered , it was black midnight with the Golden Dustman when he first appeared .
Parsing [sent. 14484 len. 10]: His altered character had never been so grossly marked .
Parsing [sent. 14485 len. 28]: His bearing towards his Secretary was so charged with insolent distrust and arrogance , that the latter rose and left the table before breakfast was half done .
Parsing [sent. 14486 len. 46]: The look he directed at the Secretary 's retiring figure was so cunningly malignant , that Bella would have sat astounded and indignant , even though he had not gone the length of secretly threatening Rokesmith with his clenched fist as he closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 14487 len. 28]: This unlucky morning , of all mornings in the year , was the morning next after Mr Boffin 's interview with Mrs Lammle in her little carriage .
Parsing [sent. 14488 len. 27]: Bella looked to Mrs Boffin 's face for comment on , or explanation of , this stormy humour in her husband , but none was there .
Parsing [sent. 14489 len. 18]: An anxious and a distressed observation of her own face was all she could read in it .
Parsing [sent. 14490 len. 53]: When they were left alone together -- which was not until noon , for Mr Boffin sat long in his easy-chair , by turns jogging up and down the breakfast-room , clenching his fist and muttering -- Bella , in consternation , asked her what had happened , what was wrong ? '
Parsing [sent. 14491 len. 28]: I am forbidden to speak to you about it , Bella dear ; I must n't tell you , ' was all the answer she could get .
Parsing [sent. 14492 len. 35]: And still , whenever , in her wonder and dismay , she raised her eyes to Mrs Boffin 's face , she saw in it the same anxious and distressed observation of her own .
Parsing [sent. 14493 len. 37]: Oppressed by her sense that trouble was impending , and lost in speculations why Mrs Boffin should look at her as if she had any part in it , Bella found the day long and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 14494 len. 32]: It was far on in the afternoon when , she being in her own room , a servant brought her a message from Mr Boffin begging her to come to his .
Parsing [sent. 14495 len. 19]: Mrs Boffin was there , seated on a sofa , and Mr Boffin was jogging up and down .
Parsing [sent. 14496 len. 18]: On seeing Bella he stopped , beckoned her to him , and drew her arm through his .
Parsing [sent. 14497 len. 23]: ` Do n't be alarmed , my dear , ' he said , gently ; ' I am not angry with you .
Parsing [sent. 14498 len. 5]: Why you actually tremble !
Parsing [sent. 14499 len. 9]: Do n't be alarmed , Bella my dear .
Parsing [sent. 14500 len. 7]: I 'll see you righted . '
Parsing [sent. 14501 len. 6]: ` See me righted ? '
Parsing [sent. 14502 len. 3]: thought Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14503 len. 18]: And then repeated aloud in a tone of astonishment : ` see me righted , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14504 len. 6]: ` Ay , ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 14505 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14506 len. 5]: ` See you righted .
Parsing [sent. 14507 len. 9]: Send Mr Rokesmith here , you sir . '
Parsing [sent. 14508 len. 31]: Bella would have been lost in perplexity if there had been pause enough ; but the servant found Mr Rokesmith near at hand , and he almost immediately presented himself .
Parsing [sent. 14509 len. 8]: ` Shut the door , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 14510 len. 5]: said Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14511 len. 21]: I have got something to say to you which I fancy you 'll not be pleased to hear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14512 len. 36]: I am sorry to reply , Mr Boffin , ' returned the Secretary , as , having closed the door , he turned and faced him , ` that I think that very likely . '
Parsing [sent. 14513 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 14514 len. 5]: blustered Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14515 len. 23]: I mean that it has become no novelty to me to hear from your lips what I would rather not hear . '
Parsing [sent. 14516 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14517 len. 19]: Perhaps we shall change that , ' said Mr Boffin with a threatening roll of his head . '
Parsing [sent. 14518 len. 9]: I hope so , ' returned the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 14519 len. 25]: He was quiet and respectful ; but stood , as Bella thought -LRB- and was glad to think -RRB- , on his manhood too .
Parsing [sent. 14520 len. 20]: ` Now , sir , ' said Mr Boffin , ` look at this young lady on my arm .
Parsing [sent. 14521 len. 21]: Bella involuntarily raising her eyes , when this sudden reference was made to herself , met those of Mr Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 14522 len. 7]: He was pale and seemed agitated .
Parsing [sent. 14523 len. 17]: Then her eyes passed on to Mrs Boffin 's , and she met the look again .
Parsing [sent. 14524 len. 18]: In a flash it enlightened her , and she began to understand what she had done . '
Parsing [sent. 14525 len. 23]: I say to you , sir , ' Mr Boffin repeated , ` look at this young lady on my arm . '
Parsing [sent. 14526 len. 9]: I do so , ' returned the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 14527 len. 19]: As his glance rested again on Bella for a moment , she thought there was reproach in it .
Parsing [sent. 14528 len. 11]: But it is possible that the reproach was within herself .
Parsing [sent. 14529 len. 24]: ` How dare you , sir , ' said Mr Boffin , ` tamper , unknown to me , with this young lady ?
Parsing [sent. 14530 len. 28]: How dare you come out of your station , and your place in my house , to pester this young lady with your impudent addresses ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14531 len. 20]: I must decline to answer questions , ' said the Secretary , ` that are so offensively asked . '
Parsing [sent. 14532 len. 7]: ` You decline to answer ? '
Parsing [sent. 14533 len. 4]: retorted Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14534 len. 9]: ` You decline to answer , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 14535 len. 17]: Then I 'll tell you what it is , Rokesmith ; I 'll answer for you .
Parsing [sent. 14536 len. 15]: There are two sides to this matter , and I 'll take 'em separately .
Parsing [sent. 14537 len. 8]: The first side is , sheer Insolence .
Parsing [sent. 14538 len. 7]: That 's the first side . '
Parsing [sent. 14539 len. 22]: The Secretary smiled with some bitterness , as though he would have said , ` So I see and hear . '
Parsing [sent. 14540 len. 26]: ` It was sheer Insolence in you , I tell you , ' said Mr Boffin , ` even to think of this young lady .
Parsing [sent. 14541 len. 8]: This young lady was far above YOU .
Parsing [sent. 14542 len. 9]: This young lady was no match for YOU .
Parsing [sent. 14543 len. 25]: This young lady was lying in wait -LRB- as she was qualified to do -RRB- for money , and you had no money . '
Parsing [sent. 14544 len. 17]: Bella hung her head and seemed to shrink a little from Mr Boffin 's protecting arm .
Parsing [sent. 14545 len. 31]: ` What are you , I should like to know , ' pursued Mr Boffin , ` that you were to have the audacity to follow up this young lady ?
Parsing [sent. 14546 len. 38]: This young lady was looking about the market for a good bid ; she was n't in it to be snapped up by fellows that had no money to lay out ; nothing to buy with . '
Parsing [sent. 14547 len. 6]: ` Oh , Mr Boffin !
Parsing [sent. 14548 len. 10]: Mrs Boffin , pray say something for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14549 len. 15]: murmured Bella , disengaging her arm , and covering her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 14550 len. 19]: ` Old lady , ' said Mr Boflin , anticipating his wife , ` you hold your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 14551 len. 14]: Bella , my dear , do n't you let yourself be put out .
Parsing [sent. 14552 len. 6]: I 'll right you . '
Parsing [sent. 14553 len. 13]: ` But you do n't , you do n't right me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14554 len. 7]: exclaimed Bella , with great emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 14555 len. 9]: ` You wrong me , wrong me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14556 len. 17]: ` Do n't you be put out , my dear , ' complacently retorted Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14557 len. 10]: ` I 'll bring this young man to book .
Parsing [sent. 14558 len. 5]: Now , you Rokesmith !
Parsing [sent. 14559 len. 16]: You ca n't decline to hear , you know , as well as to answer .
Parsing [sent. 14560 len. 19]: You hear me tell you that the first side of your conduct was Insolence -- Insolence and Presumption .
Parsing [sent. 14561 len. 9]: Answer me one thing , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 14562 len. 11]: Did n't this young lady tell you so herself ? '
Parsing [sent. 14563 len. 8]: ` Did I , Mr Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 14564 len. 9]: asked Bella with her face still covered . '
Parsing [sent. 14565 len. 6]: O say , Mr Rokesmith !
Parsing [sent. 14566 len. 4]: Did I ? '
Parsing [sent. 14567 len. 16]: ` Do n't be distressed , Miss Wilfer ; it matters very little now . '
Parsing [sent. 14568 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14569 len. 9]: You ca n't deny it , though ! '
Parsing [sent. 14570 len. 12]: said Mr Boffin , with a knowing shake of his head .
Parsing [sent. 14571 len. 38]: ` But I have asked him to forgive me since , ' cried Bella ; ` and I would ask him to forgive me now again , upon my knees , if it would spare him ! '
Parsing [sent. 14572 len. 7]: Here Mrs Boffin broke out a-crying .
Parsing [sent. 14573 len. 14]: ` Old lady , ' said Mr Boffin , ` stop that noise !
Parsing [sent. 14574 len. 28]: Tender-hearted in you , Miss Bella ; but I mean to have it out right through with this young man , having got him into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 14575 len. 5]: Now , you Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 14576 len. 15]: I tell you that 's one side of your conduct -- Insolence and Presumption .
Parsing [sent. 14577 len. 14]: Now , I 'm a-coming to the other , which is much worse .
Parsing [sent. 14578 len. 9]: This was a speculation of yours . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14579 len. 6]: I indignantly deny it . '
Parsing [sent. 14580 len. 40]: ` It 's of no use your denying it ; it does n't signify a bit whether you deny it or not ; I 've got a head upon my shoulders , and it ai n't a baby 's .
Parsing [sent. 14581 len. 3]: What ! '
Parsing [sent. 14582 len. 26]: said Mr Boffin , gathering himself together in his most suspicious attitude , and wrinkling his face into a very map of curves and corners .
Parsing [sent. 14583 len. 15]: ` Do n't I know what grabs are made at a man with money ?
Parsing [sent. 14584 len. 29]: If I did n't keep my eyes open , and my pockets buttoned , should n't I be brought to the workhouse before I knew where I was ?
Parsing [sent. 14585 len. 29]: Was n't the experience of Dancer , and Elwes , and Hopkins , and Blewbury Jones , and ever so many more of 'em , similar to mine ?
Parsing [sent. 14586 len. 21]: Did n't everybody want to make grabs at what they 'd got , and bring 'em to poverty and ruin ?
Parsing [sent. 14587 len. 20]: Were n't they forced to hide everything belonging to 'em , for fear it should be snatched from 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 14588 len. 5]: Of course they was .
Parsing [sent. 14589 len. 14]: I shall be told next that they did n't know human natur ! '
Parsing [sent. 14590 len. 3]: ` They !
Parsing [sent. 14591 len. 8]: Poor creatures , ' murmured the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 14592 len. 7]: ` What do you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 14593 len. 8]: asked Mr Boffin , snapping at him .
Parsing [sent. 14594 len. 29]: ` However , you need n't be at the trouble of repeating it , for it ai n't worth hearing , and wo n't go down with ME .
Parsing [sent. 14595 len. 37]: I 'm a-going to unfold your plan , before this young lady ; I 'm a-going to show this young lady the second view of you ; and nothing you can say will stave it off .
Parsing [sent. 14596 len. 12]: -LRB- Now , attend here , Bella , my dear . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14597 len. 8]: Rokesmith , you 're a needy chap .
Parsing [sent. 14598 len. 12]: You 're a chap that I pick up in the street .
Parsing [sent. 14599 len. 9]: Are you , or ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14600 len. 14]: ` Go on , Mr Boflin ; do n't appeal to me . '
Parsing [sent. 14601 len. 18]: ` Not appeal to YOU , ' retorted Mr Boffin as if he had n't done so .
Parsing [sent. 14602 len. 8]: ` No , I should hope not !
Parsing [sent. 14603 len. 11]: Appealing to YOU , would be rather a rum course .
Parsing [sent. 14604 len. 18]: As I was saying , you 're a needy chap that I pick up in the street .
Parsing [sent. 14605 len. 20]: You come and ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary , and I take you .
Parsing [sent. 14606 len. 4]: Very good . '
Parsing [sent. 14607 len. 9]: ` Very bad , ' murmured the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 14608 len. 7]: ` What do you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 14609 len. 9]: asked Mr Boffin , snapping at him again .
Parsing [sent. 14610 len. 5]: He returned no answer .
Parsing [sent. 14611 len. 20]: Mr Boffin , after eyeing him with a comical look of discomfited curiosity , was fain to begin afresh .
Parsing [sent. 14612 len. 20]: ` This Rokesmith is a needy young man that I take for my Secretary out of the open street .
Parsing [sent. 14613 len. 26]: This Rokesmith gets acquainted with my affairs , and gets to know that I mean to settle a sum of money on this young lady .
Parsing [sent. 14614 len. 4]: `` Oho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14615 len. 52]: says this Rokesmith ; ' here Mr Boffin clapped a finger against his nose , and tapped it several times with a sneaking air , as embodying Rokesmith confidentially confabulating with his own nose ; ' `` This will be a good haul ; I 'll go in for this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14616 len. 20]: And so this Rokesmith , greedy and hungering , begins a-creeping on his hands and knees towards the money .
Parsing [sent. 14617 len. 45]: Not so bad a speculation either : for if this young lady had had less spirit , or had had less sense , through being at all in the romantic line , by George he might have worked it out and made it pay !
Parsing [sent. 14618 len. 20]: But fortunately she was too many for him , and a pretty figure he cuts now he is exposed .
Parsing [sent. 14619 len. 5]: There he stands ! '
Parsing [sent. 14620 len. 11]: said Mr Boffin , addressing Rokesmith himself with ridiculous inconsistency .
Parsing [sent. 14621 len. 6]: ` Look at him ! '
Parsing [sent. 14622 len. 13]: ` Your unfortunate suspicions , Mr Boffin -- ' began the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 14623 len. 17]: ` Precious unfortunate for you , I can tell you , ' said Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14624 len. 20]: -- are not to be combated by any one , and I address myself to no such hopeless task .
Parsing [sent. 14625 len. 11]: But I will say a word upon the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 14626 len. 3]: ` Yah !
Parsing [sent. 14627 len. 19]: Much you care about the truth , ' said Mr Boffin , with a snap of his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 14628 len. 3]: ` Noddy !
Parsing [sent. 14629 len. 5]: My dear love ! '
Parsing [sent. 14630 len. 4]: expostulated his wife .
Parsing [sent. 14631 len. 14]: ` Old lady , ' returned Mr Boffin , ` you keep still .
Parsing [sent. 14632 len. 14]: I say to this Rokesmith here , much he cares about the truth .
Parsing [sent. 14633 len. 13]: I tell him again , much he cares about the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 14634 len. 31]: ` Our connexion being at an end , Mr Boffin , ' said the Secretary , ` it can be of very little moment to me what you say . '
Parsing [sent. 14635 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14636 len. 30]: You are knowing enough , ' retorted Mr Boffin , with a sly look , ` to have found out that our connexion 's at an end , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 14637 len. 9]: But you ca n't get beforehand with me .
Parsing [sent. 14638 len. 7]: Look at this in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 14639 len. 9]: This is your pay , on your discharge .
Parsing [sent. 14640 len. 6]: You can only follow suit .
Parsing [sent. 14641 len. 9]: You ca n't deprive me of the lead .
Parsing [sent. 14642 len. 10]: Let 's have no pretending that you discharge yourself .
Parsing [sent. 14643 len. 5]: I discharge you . '
Parsing [sent. 14644 len. 28]: ` So that I go , ' remarked the Secretary , waving the point aside with his hand , ` it is all one to me . '
Parsing [sent. 14645 len. 5]: ` Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14646 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14647 len. 13]: ` But it 's two to me , let me tell you .
Parsing [sent. 14648 len. 36]: Allowing a fellow that 's found out , to discharge himself , is one thing ; discharging him for insolence and presumption , and likewise for designs upon his master 's money , is another .
Parsing [sent. 14649 len. 9]: One and one 's two ; not one .
Parsing [sent. 14650 len. 10]: -LRB- Old lady , do n't you cut in .
Parsing [sent. 14651 len. 6]: You keep still . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 14652 len. 13]: ` Have you said all you wish to say to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14653 len. 5]: demanded the Secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 14654 len. 15]: I do n't know whether I have or not , ' answered Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14655 len. 5]: ` It depends . '
Parsing [sent. 14656 len. 22]: ` Perhaps you will consider whether there are any other strong expressions that you would like to bestow upon me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14657 len. 23]: ` I 'll consider that , ' said Mr Boffin , obstinately , ` at my convenience , and not at yours .
Parsing [sent. 14658 len. 6]: You want the last word .
Parsing [sent. 14659 len. 12]: It may not be suitable to let you have it . '
Parsing [sent. 14660 len. 3]: ` Noddy !
Parsing [sent. 14661 len. 6]: My dear , dear Noddy !
Parsing [sent. 14662 len. 6]: You sound so hard ! '
Parsing [sent. 14663 len. 11]: cried poor Mrs Boffin , not to be quite repressed .
Parsing [sent. 14664 len. 37]: ` Old lady , ' said her husband , but without harshness , ` if you cut in when requested not , I 'll get a pillow and carry you out of the room upon it .
Parsing [sent. 14665 len. 11]: What do you want to say , you Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 14666 len. 9]: ` To you , Mr Boffin , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 14667 len. 15]: But to Miss Wilfer and to your good kind wife , a word . '
Parsing [sent. 14668 len. 27]: ` Out with it then , ' replied Mr Boffin , ` and cut it short , for we 've had enough of you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14669 len. 31]: I have borne , ' said the Secretary , in a low voice , ` with my false position here , that I might not be separated from Miss Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 14670 len. 39]: To be near her , has been a recompense to me from day to day , even for the undeserved treatment I have had here , and for the degraded aspect in which she has often seen me .
Parsing [sent. 14671 len. 29]: Since Miss Wilfer rejected me , I have never again urged my suit , to the best of my belief , with a spoken syllable or a look .
Parsing [sent. 14672 len. 34]: But I have never changed in my devotion to her , except -- if she will forgive my saying so -- that it is deeper than it was , and better founded . '
Parsing [sent. 14673 len. 17]: ` Now , mark this chap 's saying Miss Wilfer , when he means L.s.d. ! '
Parsing [sent. 14674 len. 9]: cried Mr Boffin , with a cunning wink .
Parsing [sent. 14675 len. 20]: ` Now , mark this chap 's making Miss Wilfer stand for Pounds , Shillings , and Pence ! '
Parsing [sent. 14676 len. 27]: ` My feeling for Miss Wilfer , ' pursued the Secretary , without deigning to notice him , ` is not one to be ashamed of .
Parsing [sent. 14677 len. 4]: I avow it .
Parsing [sent. 14678 len. 4]: I love her .
Parsing [sent. 14679 len. 25]: Let me go where I may when I presently leave this house , I shall go into a blank life , leaving her . '
Parsing [sent. 14680 len. 20]: ` Leaving L.s.d. behind me , ' said Mr Boffin , by way of commentary , with another wink .
Parsing [sent. 14681 len. 57]: ` That I am incapable , ' the Secretary went on , still without heeding him , ` of a mercenary project , or a mercenary thought , in connexion with Miss Wilfer , is nothing meritorious in me , because any prize that I could put before my fancy would sink into insignificance beside her .
Parsing [sent. 14682 len. 38]: If the greatest wealth or the highest rank were hers , it would only be important in my sight as removing her still farther from me , and making me more hopeless , if that could be .
Parsing [sent. 14683 len. 49]: Say , ' remarked the Secretary , looking full at his late master , ` say that with a word she could strip Mr Boffin of his fortune and take possession of it , she would be of no greater worth in my eyes than she is . '
Parsing [sent. 14684 len. 39]: ` What do you think by this time , old lady , ' asked Mr Boffin , turning to his wife in a bantering tone , ` about this Rokesmith here , and his caring for the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 14685 len. 30]: You need n't say what you think , my dear , because I do n't want you to cut in , but you can think it all the same .
Parsing [sent. 14686 len. 22]: As to taking possession of my property , I warrant you he would n't do that himself if he could . '
Parsing [sent. 14687 len. 13]: ` No , ' returned the Secretary , with another full look .
Parsing [sent. 14688 len. 8]: ` Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 14689 len. 4]: laughed Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14690 len. 17]: ` There 's nothing like a good ` un while you ARE about it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14691 len. 32]: I have been for a moment , ' said the Secretary , turning from him and falling into his former manner , ` diverted from the little I have to say .
Parsing [sent. 14692 len. 22]: My interest in Miss Wilfer began when I first saw her ; even began when I had only heard of her .
Parsing [sent. 14693 len. 23]: It was , in fact , the cause of my throwing myself in Mr Boffin 's way , and entering his service .
Parsing [sent. 14694 len. 9]: Miss Wilfer has never known this until now .
Parsing [sent. 14695 len. 31]: I mention it now , only as a corroboration -LRB- though I hope it may be needless -RRB- of my being free from the sordid design attributed to me . '
Parsing [sent. 14696 len. 20]: ` Now , this is a very artful dog , ' said Mr Boffin , with a deep look .
Parsing [sent. 14697 len. 11]: ` This is a longer-headed schemer than I thought him .
Parsing [sent. 14698 len. 10]: See how patiently and methodically he goes to work .
Parsing [sent. 14699 len. 80]: He gets to know about me and my property , and about this young lady , and her share in poor young John 's story , and he puts this and that together , and he says to himself , `` I 'll get in with Boffin , and I 'll get in with this young lady , and I 'll work 'em both at the same time , and I 'll bring my pigs to market somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 14700 len. 9]: I hear him say it , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 14701 len. 15]: I look at him , now , and I see him say it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14702 len. 22]: Mr Boffin pointed at the culprit , as it were in the act , and hugged himself in his great penetration .
Parsing [sent. 14703 len. 20]: ` But luckily he had n't to deal with the people he supposed , Bella , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14704 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14705 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 14706 len. 47]: Luckily he had to deal with you , and with me , and with Daniel and Miss Dancer , and with Elwes , and with Vulture Hopkins , and with Blewbury Jones and all the rest of us , one down t ` other come on .
Parsing [sent. 14707 len. 14]: And he 's beat ; that 's what he is ; regularly beat .
Parsing [sent. 14708 len. 22]: He thought to squeeze money out of us , and he has done for himself instead , Bella my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14709 len. 13]: Bella my dear made no response , gave no sign of acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 14710 len. 29]: When she had first covered her face she had sunk upon a chair with her hands resting on the back of it , and had never moved since .
Parsing [sent. 14711 len. 21]: There was a short silence at this point , and Mrs Boffin softly rose as if to go to her .
Parsing [sent. 14712 len. 22]: But , Mr Boffin stopped her with a gesture , and she obediently sat down again and stayed where she was .
Parsing [sent. 14713 len. 33]: ` There 's your pay , Mister Rokesmith , ' said the Golden Dustman , jerking the folded scrap of paper he had in his hand , towards his late Secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 14714 len. 21]: I dare say you can stoop to pick it up , after what you have stooped to here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14715 len. 38]: I have stooped to nothing but this , ' Rokesmith answered as he took it from the ground ; ` and this is mine , for I have earned it by the hardest of hard labour . '
Parsing [sent. 14716 len. 35]: ` You 're a pretty quick packer , I hope , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` because the sooner you are gone , bag and baggage , the better for all parties . '
Parsing [sent. 14717 len. 11]: ` You need have no fear of my lingering . '
Parsing [sent. 14718 len. 56]: ` There 's just one thing though , ' said Mr Boffin , ` that I should like to ask you before we come to a good riddance , if it was only to show this young lady how conceited you schemers are , in thinking that nobody finds out how you contradict yourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 14719 len. 23]: ` Ask me anything you wish to ask , ' returned Rokesmith , ` but use the expedition that you recommend . '
Parsing [sent. 14720 len. 14]: ` You pretend to have a mighty admiration for this young lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 14721 len. 19]: said Mr Boffin , laying his hand protectingly on Bella 's head without looking down at her . '
Parsing [sent. 14722 len. 6]: I do not pretend . '
Parsing [sent. 14723 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14724 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 14725 len. 17]: You HAVE a mighty admiration for this young lady -- since you are so particular ? '
Parsing [sent. 14726 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 14727 len. 48]: ` How do you reconcile that , with this young lady 's being a weakspirited , improvident idiot , not knowing what was due to herself , flinging up her money to the church-weathercocks , and racing off at a splitting pace for the workhouse ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14728 len. 7]: I do n't understand you . '
Parsing [sent. 14729 len. 5]: ` Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 14730 len. 5]: Or wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 14731 len. 24]: What else could you have made this young lady out to be , if she had listened to such addresses as yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 14732 len. 21]: ` What else , if I had been so happy as to win her affections and possess her heart ? '
Parsing [sent. 14733 len. 20]: ` Win her affections , ' retorted Mr Boffin , with ineffable contempt , ` and possess her heart !
Parsing [sent. 14734 len. 15]: Mew says the cat , Quack-quack says the duck , Bow-wow-wow says the dog !
Parsing [sent. 14735 len. 8]: Win her affections and possess her heart !
Parsing [sent. 14736 len. 7]: Mew , Quack-quack , Bow-wow ! '
Parsing [sent. 14737 len. 21]: John Rokesmith stared at him in his outburst , as if with some faint idea that he had gone mad .
Parsing [sent. 14738 len. 28]: ` What is due to this young lady , ' said Mr Boffin , ` is Money , and this young lady right well knows it . '
Parsing [sent. 14739 len. 8]: ` You slander the young lady . '
Parsing [sent. 14740 len. 21]: ` YOU slander the young lady ; you with your affections and hearts and trumpery , ' returned Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14741 len. 13]: ` It 's of a piece with the rest of your behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 14742 len. 29]: I heard of these doings of yours only last night , or you should have heard of 'em from me , sooner , take your oath of it .
Parsing [sent. 14743 len. 66]: I heard of 'em from a lady with as good a headpiece as the best , and she knows this young lady , and I know this young lady , and we all three know that it 's Money she makes a stand for -- money , money , money -- and that you and your affections and hearts are a Lie , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 14744 len. 28]: ` Mrs Boffin , ' said Rokesmith , quietly turning to her , ` for your delicate and unvarying kindness I thank you with the warmest gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 14745 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 14746 len. 6]: Miss Wilfer , good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 14747 len. 43]: ` And now , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin , laying his hand on Bella 's head again , ` you may begin to make yourself quite comfortable , and I hope you feel that you 've been righted . '
Parsing [sent. 14748 len. 60]: But , Bella was so far from appearing to feel it , that she shrank from his hand and from the chair , and , starting up in an incoherent passion of tears , and stretching out her arms , cried , ' O Mr Rokesmith , before you go , if you could but make me poor again !
Parsing [sent. 14749 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 14750 len. 22]: Make me poor again , Somebody , I beg and pray , or my heart will break if this goes on !
Parsing [sent. 14751 len. 13]: Pa , dear , make me poor again and take me home !
Parsing [sent. 14752 len. 15]: I was bad enough there , but I have been so much worse here .
Parsing [sent. 14753 len. 15]: Do n't give me money , Mr Boffin , I wo n't have money .
Parsing [sent. 14754 len. 31]: Keep it away from me , and only let me speak to good little Pa , and lay my head upon his shoulder , and tell him all my griefs .
Parsing [sent. 14755 len. 30]: Nobody else can understand me , nobody else can comfort me , nobody else knows how unworthy I am , and yet can love me like a little child .
Parsing [sent. 14756 len. 19]: I am better with Pa than any one -- more innocent , more sorry , more glad ! '
Parsing [sent. 14757 len. 26]: So , crying out in a wild way that she could not bear this , Bella drooped her head on Mrs Boffin 's ready breast .
Parsing [sent. 14758 len. 27]: John Rokesmith from his place in the room , and Mr Boffin from his , looked on at her in silence until she was silent herself .
Parsing [sent. 14759 len. 30]: Then Mr Boffin observed in a soothing and comfortable tone , ` There , my dear , there ; you are righted now , and it 's ALL right .
Parsing [sent. 14760 len. 48]: I do n't wonder , I 'm sure , at your being a little flurried by having a scene with this fellow , but it 's all over , my dear , and you 're righted , and it 's -- and it 's ALL right ! '
Parsing [sent. 14761 len. 15]: Which Mr Boffin repeated with a highly satisfied air of completeness and finality . '
Parsing [sent. 14762 len. 5]: I hate you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14763 len. 34]: cried Bella , turning suddenly upon him , with a stamp of her little foot -- ` at least , I ca n't hate you , but I do n't like you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14764 len. 6]: ` HUL -- LO ! '
Parsing [sent. 14765 len. 8]: exclaimed Mr Boffin in an amazed under-tone .
Parsing [sent. 14766 len. 17]: ` You 're a scolding , unjust , abusive , aggravating , bad old creature ! '
Parsing [sent. 14767 len. 4]: cried Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 14768 len. 25]: I am angry with my ungrateful self for calling you names ; but you are , you are ; you know you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 14769 len. 22]: Mr Boffin stared here , and stared there , as misdoubting that he must be in some sort of fit . '
Parsing [sent. 14770 len. 11]: I have heard you with shame , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14771 len. 12]: ` With shame for myself , and with shame for you .
Parsing [sent. 14772 len. 21]: You ought to be above the base talebearing of a time-serving woman ; but you are above nothing now . '
Parsing [sent. 14773 len. 21]: Mr Boffin , seeming to become convinced that this was a fit , rolled his eyes and loosened his neckcloth .
Parsing [sent. 14774 len. 23]: ` When I came here , I respected you and honoured you , and I soon loved you , ' cried Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14775 len. 12]: ` And now I ca n't bear the sight of you .
Parsing [sent. 14776 len. 28]: At least , I do n't know that I ought to go so far as that -- only you 're a -- you 're a Monster ! '
Parsing [sent. 14777 len. 19]: Having shot this bolt out with a great expenditure of force , Bella hysterically laughed and cried together .
Parsing [sent. 14778 len. 31]: ` The best wish I can wish you is , ' said Bella , returning to the charge , ` that you had not one single farthing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 14779 len. 30]: If any true friend and well-wisher could make you a bankrupt , you would be a Duck ; but as a man of property you are a Demon ! '
Parsing [sent. 14780 len. 20]: After despatching this second bolt with a still greater expenditure of force , Bella laughed and cried still more .
Parsing [sent. 14781 len. 9]: ` Mr Rokesmith , pray stay one moment .
Parsing [sent. 14782 len. 10]: Pray hear one word from me before you go !
Parsing [sent. 14783 len. 14]: I am deeply sorry for the reproaches you have borne on my account .
Parsing [sent. 14784 len. 16]: Out of the depths of my heart I earnestly and truly beg your pardon . '
Parsing [sent. 14785 len. 10]: As she stepped towards him , he met her .
Parsing [sent. 14786 len. 23]: As she gave him her hand , he put it to his lips , and said , ` God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14787 len. 17]: No laughing was mixed with Bella 's crying then ; her tears were pure and fervent .
Parsing [sent. 14788 len. 45]: ` There is not an ungenerous word that I have heard addressed to you -- heard with scorn and indignation , Mr Rokesmith -- but it has wounded me far more than you , for I have deserved it , and you never have .
Parsing [sent. 14789 len. 20]: Mr Rokesmith , it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed between us that night .
Parsing [sent. 14790 len. 17]: I parted with the secret , even while I was angry with myself for doing so .
Parsing [sent. 14791 len. 14]: It was very bad in me , but indeed it was not wicked .
Parsing [sent. 14792 len. 27]: I did it in a moment of conceit and folly -- one of my many such moments -- one of my many such hours -- years .
Parsing [sent. 14793 len. 15]: As I am punished for it severely , try to forgive it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 14794 len. 8]: I do with all my soul . '
Parsing [sent. 14795 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 14796 len. 4]: O thank you !
Parsing [sent. 14797 len. 18]: Do n't part from me till I have said one other word , to do you justice .
Parsing [sent. 14798 len. 78]: The only fault you can be truly charged with , in having spoken to me as you did that night -- with how much delicacy and how much forbearance no one but I can know or be grateful to you for -- is , that you laid yourself open to be slighted by a worldly shallow girl whose head was turned , and who was quite unable to rise to the worth of what you offered her .
Parsing [sent. 14799 len. 58]: Mr Rokesmith , that girl has often seen herself in a pitiful and poor light since , but never in so pitiful and poor a light as now , when the mean tone in which she answered you -- sordid and vain girl that she was -- has been echoed in her ears by Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14800 len. 6]: He kissed her hand again .
Parsing [sent. 14801 len. 29]: ` Mr Boffin 's speeches were detestable to me , shocking to me , ' said Bella , startling that gentleman with another stamp of her little foot .
Parsing [sent. 14802 len. 40]: ` It is quite true that there was a time , and very lately , when I deserved to be so `` righted , '' Mr Rokesmith ; but I hope that I shall never deserve it again ! '
Parsing [sent. 14803 len. 20]: He once more put her hand to his lips , and then relinquished it , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 14804 len. 33]: Bella was hurrying back to the chair in which she had hidden her face so long , when , catching sight of Mrs Boffin by the way , she stopped at her .
Parsing [sent. 14805 len. 27]: ` He is gone , ' sobbed Bella indignantly , despairingly , in fifty ways at once , with her arms round Mrs Boffin 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 14806 len. 26]: ` He has been most shamefully abused , and most unjustly and most basely driven away , and I am the cause of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14807 len. 25]: All this time , Mr Boffin had been rolling his eyes over his loosened neckerchief , as if his fit were still upon him .
Parsing [sent. 14808 len. 55]: Appearing now to think that he was coming to , he stared straight before him for a while , tied his neckerchief again , took several long inspirations , swallowed several times , and ultimately exclaimed with a deep sigh , as if he felt himself on the whole better : ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 14809 len. 30]: No word , good or bad , did Mrs Boffin say ; but she tenderly took care of Bella , and glanced at her husband as if for orders .
Parsing [sent. 14810 len. 64]: Mr Boffin , without imparting any , took his seat on a chair over against them , and there sat leaning forward , with a fixed countenance , his legs apart , a hand on each knee , and his elbows squared , until Bella should dry her eyes and raise her head , which in the fulness of time she did . '
Parsing [sent. 14811 len. 13]: I must go home , ' said Bella , rising hurriedly . '
Parsing [sent. 14812 len. 22]: I am very grateful to you for all you have done for me , but I ca n't stay here . '
Parsing [sent. 14813 len. 6]: ` My darling girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 14814 len. 4]: remonstrated Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14815 len. 19]: ` No , I ca n't stay here , ' said Bella ; ' I ca n't indeed .
Parsing [sent. 14816 len. 3]: -- Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 14817 len. 6]: you vicious old thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 14818 len. 7]: -LRB- This to Mr Boffin . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14819 len. 14]: ` Do n't be rash , my love , ' urged Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 14820 len. 9]: ` Think well of what you do . '
Parsing [sent. 14821 len. 15]: ` Yes , you had better think well , ' said Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14822 len. 36]: I shall never more think well of YOU , ' cried Bella , cutting him short , with intense defiance in her expressive little eyebrows , and championship of the late Secretary in every dimple .
Parsing [sent. 14823 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 14824 len. 3]: Never again !
Parsing [sent. 14825 len. 8]: Your money has changed you to marble .
Parsing [sent. 14826 len. 6]: You are a hardhearted Miser .
Parsing [sent. 14827 len. 22]: You are worse than Dancer , worse than Hopkins , worse than Blackberry Jones , worse than any of the wretches .
Parsing [sent. 14828 len. 4]: And more ! '
Parsing [sent. 14829 len. 21]: proceeded Bella , breaking into tears again , ` you were wholly undeserving of the Gentleman you have lost . '
Parsing [sent. 14830 len. 31]: ` Why , you do n't mean to say , Miss Bella , ' the Golden Dustman slowly remonstrated , ` that you set up Rokesmith against me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14831 len. 4]: I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 14832 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14833 len. 10]: ` He is worth a Million of you . '
Parsing [sent. 14834 len. 43]: Very pretty she looked , though very angry , as she made herself as tall as she possibly could -LRB- which was not extremely tall -RRB- , and utterly renounced her patron with a lofty toss of her rich brown head . '
Parsing [sent. 14835 len. 44]: I would rather he thought well of me , ' said Bella , ` though he swept the street for bread , than that you did , though you splashed the mud upon him from the wheels of a chariot of pure gold .
Parsing [sent. 14836 len. 4]: -- There ! '
Parsing [sent. 14837 len. 7]: ` Well I 'm sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 14838 len. 6]: cried Mr Boffin , staring .
Parsing [sent. 14839 len. 34]: ` And for a long time past , when you have thought you set yourself above him , I have only seen you under his feet , ' said Bella -- ` There !
Parsing [sent. 14840 len. 19]: And throughout I saw in him the master , and I saw in you the man -- There !
Parsing [sent. 14841 len. 17]: And when you used him shamefully , I took his part and loved him -- There !
Parsing [sent. 14842 len. 6]: I boast of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14843 len. 24]: After which strong avowal Bella underwent reaction , and cried to any extent , with her face on the back of her chair .
Parsing [sent. 14844 len. 27]: ` Now , look here , ' said Mr Boffin , as soon as he could find an opening for breaking the silence and striking in .
Parsing [sent. 14845 len. 8]: ` Give me your attention , Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14846 len. 7]: I am not angry . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14847 len. 4]: I AM ! '
Parsing [sent. 14848 len. 4]: said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 14849 len. 29]: I say , ' resumed the Golden Dustman , ' I am not angry , and I mean kindly to you , and I want to overlook this .
Parsing [sent. 14850 len. 20]: So you 'll stay where you are , and we 'll agree to say no more about it . '
Parsing [sent. 14851 len. 26]: ` No , I ca n't stay here , ' cried Bella , rising hurriedly again ; ' I ca n't think of staying here .
Parsing [sent. 14852 len. 8]: I must go home for good . '
Parsing [sent. 14853 len. 13]: ` Now , do n't be silly , ' Mr Boffin reasoned .
Parsing [sent. 14854 len. 24]: ` Do n't do what you ca n't undo ; do n't do what you 're sure to be sorry for . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14855 len. 39]: I shall never be sorry for it , ' said Bella ; ` and I should always be sorry , and should every minute of my life despise myself if I remained here after what has happened . '
Parsing [sent. 14856 len. 20]: ` At least , Bella , ' argued Mr Boffin , ` let there be no mistake about it .
Parsing [sent. 14857 len. 8]: Look before you leap , you know .
Parsing [sent. 14858 len. 19]: Stay where you are , and all 's well , and all 's as it was to be .
Parsing [sent. 14859 len. 12]: Go away , and you can never come back . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14860 len. 20]: I know that I can never come back , and that 's what I mean , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14861 len. 34]: ` You must n't expect , ' Mr Boffin pursued , ` that I 'm a-going to settle money on you , if you leave us like this , because I am not .
Parsing [sent. 14862 len. 4]: No , Bella !
Parsing [sent. 14863 len. 3]: Be careful !
Parsing [sent. 14864 len. 6]: Not one brass farthing . '
Parsing [sent. 14865 len. 4]: ` Expect ! '
Parsing [sent. 14866 len. 5]: said Bella , haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 14867 len. 22]: ` Do you think that any power on earth could make me take it , if you did , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14868 len. 26]: But there was Mrs Boffin to part from , and , in the full flush of her dignity , the impressible little soul collapsed again .
Parsing [sent. 14869 len. 33]: Down upon her knees before that good woman , she rocked herself upon her breast , and cried , and sobbed , and folded her in her arms with all her might .
Parsing [sent. 14870 len. 15]: ` You 're a dear , a dear , the best of dears ! '
Parsing [sent. 14871 len. 3]: cried Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14872 len. 9]: ` You 're the best of human creatures .
Parsing [sent. 14873 len. 16]: I can never be thankful enough to you , and I can never forget you .
Parsing [sent. 14874 len. 32]: If I should live to be blind and deaf I know I shall see and hear you , in my fancy , to the last of my dim old days ! '
Parsing [sent. 14875 len. 27]: Mrs Boffin wept most heartily , and embraced her with all fondness ; but said not one single word except that she was her dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 14876 len. 25]: She said that often enough , to be sure , for she said it over and over again ; but not one word else .
Parsing [sent. 14877 len. 33]: Bella broke from her at length , and was going weeping out of the room , when in her own little queer affectionate way , she half relented towards Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 14878 len. 24]: I am very glad , ' sobbed Bella , ` that I called you names , sir , because you richly deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 14879 len. 19]: But I am very sorry that I called you names , because you used to be so different .
Parsing [sent. 14880 len. 4]: Say good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 14881 len. 10]: ` Good-bye , ' said Mr Boffin , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 14882 len. 33]: ` If I knew which of your hands was the least spoilt , I would ask you to let me touch it , ' said Bella , ` for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 14883 len. 13]: But not because I repent of what I have said to you .
Parsing [sent. 14884 len. 5]: For I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 14885 len. 5]: It 's true ! '
Parsing [sent. 14886 len. 27]: ` Try the left hand , ' said Mr Boffin , holding it out in a stolid manner ; ` it 's the least used . '
Parsing [sent. 14887 len. 23]: ` You have been wonderfully good and kind to me , ' said Bella , ` and I kiss it for that .
Parsing [sent. 14888 len. 21]: You have been as bad as bad could be to Mr Rokesmith , and I throw it away for that .
Parsing [sent. 14889 len. 9]: Thank you for myself , and good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 14890 len. 10]: ` Good-bye , ' said Mr Boffin as before .
Parsing [sent. 14891 len. 16]: Bella caught him round the neck and kissed him , and ran out for ever .
Parsing [sent. 14892 len. 19]: She ran up-stairs , and sat down on the floor in her own room , and cried abundantly .
Parsing [sent. 14893 len. 13]: But the day was declining and she had no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 14894 len. 41]: She opened all the places where she kept her dresses ; selected only those she had brought with her , leaving all the rest ; and made a great misshapen bundle of them , to be sent for afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 14895 len. 29]: I wo n't take one of the others , ' said Bella , tying the knots of the bundle very tight , in the severity of her resolution .
Parsing [sent. 14896 len. 19]: ` I 'll leave all the presents behind , and begin again entirely on my own account . '
Parsing [sent. 14897 len. 30]: That the resolution might be thoroughly carried into practice , she even changed the dress she wore , for that in which she had come to the grand mansion .
Parsing [sent. 14898 len. 20]: Even the bonnet she put on , was the bonnet that had mounted into the Boffin chariot at Holloway .
Parsing [sent. 14899 len. 11]: ` Now , I am complete , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14900 len. 25]: ` It 's a little trying , but I have steeped my eyes in cold water , and I wo n't cry any more .
Parsing [sent. 14901 len. 12]: You have been a pleasant room to me , dear room .
Parsing [sent. 14902 len. 2]: Adieu !
Parsing [sent. 14903 len. 9]: We shall never see each other again . '
Parsing [sent. 14904 len. 42]: With a parting kiss of her fingers to it , she softly closed the door and went with a light foot down the great staircase , pausing and listening as she went , that she might meet none of the household .
Parsing [sent. 14905 len. 17]: No one chanced to be about , and she got down to the hall in quiet .
Parsing [sent. 14906 len. 11]: The door of the late Secretary 's room stood open .
Parsing [sent. 14907 len. 29]: She peeped in as she passed , and divined from the emptiness of his table , and the general appearance of things , that he was already gone .
Parsing [sent. 14908 len. 34]: Softly opening the great hall door , and softly closing it upon herself , she turned and kissed it on the outside -- insensible old combination of wood and iron that it was !
Parsing [sent. 14909 len. 13]: -- before she ran away from the house at a swift pace .
Parsing [sent. 14910 len. 7]: ` That was well done ! '
Parsing [sent. 14911 len. 15]: panted Bella , slackening in the next street , and subsiding into a walk .
Parsing [sent. 14912 len. 18]: ` If I had left myself any breath to cry with , I should have cried again .
Parsing [sent. 14913 len. 18]: Now poor dear darling little Pa , you are going to see your lovely woman unexpectedly . '
Parsing [sent. 14914 len. 24]: Chapter 16 THE FEAST OF THE THREE HOBGOBLINS The City looked unpromising enough , as Bella made her way along its gritty streets .
Parsing [sent. 14915 len. 17]: Most of its money-mills were slackening sail , or had left off grinding for the day .
Parsing [sent. 14916 len. 12]: The master-millers had already departed , and the journeymen were departing .
Parsing [sent. 14917 len. 31]: There was a jaded aspect on the business lanes and courts , and the very pavements had a weary appearance , confused by the tread of a million of feet .
Parsing [sent. 14918 len. 19]: There must be hours of night to temper down the day 's distraction of so feverish a place .
Parsing [sent. 14919 len. 46]: As yet the worry of the newly-stopped whirling and grinding on the part of the moneymills seemed to linger in the air , and the quiet was more like the prostration of a spent giant than the repose of one who was renewing his strength .
Parsing [sent. 14920 len. 44]: If Bella thought , as she glanced at the mighty Bank , how agreeable it would be to have an hour 's gardening there , with a bright copper shovel , among the money , still she was not in an avaricious vein .
Parsing [sent. 14921 len. 50]: Much improved in that respect , and with certain half-formed images which had little gold in their composition , dancing before her bright eyes , she arrived in the drug-flavoured region of Mincing Lane , with the sensation of having just opened a drawer in a chemist 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 14922 len. 68]: The counting-house of Chicksey , Veneering , and Stobbles was pointed out by an elderly female accustomed to the care of offices , who dropped upon Bella out of a public-house , wiping her mouth , and accounted for its humidity on natural principles well known to the physical sciences , by explaining that she had looked in at the door to see what o'clock it was .
Parsing [sent. 14923 len. 70]: The counting-house was a walleyed ground floor by a dark gateway , and Bella was considering , as she approached it , could there be any precedent in the City for her going in and asking for R. Wilfer , when whom should she see , sitting at one of the windows with the plate-glass sash raised , but R. Wilfer himself , preparing to take a slight refection .
Parsing [sent. 14924 len. 22]: On approaching nearer , Bella discerned that the refection had the appearance of a small cottage-loaf and a pennyworth of milk .
Parsing [sent. 14925 len. 28]: Simultaneously with this discovery on her part , her father discovered her , and invoked the echoes of Mincing Lane to exclaim ` My gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14926 len. 19]: He then came cherubically flying out without a hat , and embraced her , and handed her in .
Parsing [sent. 14927 len. 39]: ` For it 's after hours and I am all alone , my dear , ' he explained , ` and am having -- as I sometimes do when they are all gone -- a quiet tea . '
Parsing [sent. 14928 len. 30]: Looking round the office , as if her father were a captive and this his cell , Bella hugged him and choked him to her heart 's content . '
Parsing [sent. 14929 len. 10]: I never was so surprised , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14930 len. 5]: said her father . '
Parsing [sent. 14931 len. 7]: I could n't believe my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14932 len. 12]: Upon my life , I thought they had taken to lying !
Parsing [sent. 14933 len. 10]: The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself !
Parsing [sent. 14934 len. 16]: Why did n't you send the footman down the Lane , my dear ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14935 len. 14]: I have brought no footman with me , Pa. ' ` Oh indeed !
Parsing [sent. 14936 len. 12]: But you have brought the elegant turn-out , my love ? '
Parsing [sent. 14937 len. 16]: ` No , Pa. ' ` You never can have walked , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 14938 len. 31]: ` Yes , I have , Pa. ' He looked so very much astonished , that Bella could not make up her mind to break it to him just yet .
Parsing [sent. 14939 len. 27]: ` The consequence is , Pa , that your lovely woman feels a little faint , and would very much like to share your tea . '
Parsing [sent. 14940 len. 21]: The cottage loaf and the pennyworth of milk had been set forth on a sheet of paper on the window-seat .
Parsing [sent. 14941 len. 27]: The cherubic pocket-knife , with the first bit of the loaf still on its point , lay beside them where it had been hastily thrown down .
Parsing [sent. 14942 len. 13]: Bella took the bit off , and put it in her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 14943 len. 21]: ` My dear child , ' said her father , ` the idea of your partaking of such lowly fare !
Parsing [sent. 14944 len. 16]: But at least you must have your own loaf and your own penn ` orth .
Parsing [sent. 14945 len. 6]: One moment , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 14946 len. 13]: The Dairy is just over the way and round the corner . '
Parsing [sent. 14947 len. 17]: Regardless of Bella 's dissuasions he ran out , and quickly returned with the new supply .
Parsing [sent. 14948 len. 30]: ` My dear child , ' he said , as he spread it on another piece of paper before her , ` the idea of a splendid -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 14949 len. 11]: and then looked at her figure , and stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 14950 len. 10]: ` What 's the matter , Pa ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14951 len. 22]: -- of a splendid female , ' he resumed more slowly , ` putting up with such accommodation as the present !
Parsing [sent. 14952 len. 14]: -- Is that a new dress you have on , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 14953 len. 9]: ` No , Pa , an old one .
Parsing [sent. 14954 len. 7]: Do n't you remember it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14955 len. 13]: ` Why , I THOUGHT I remembered it , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14956 len. 23]: ` You should , for you bought it , Pa. ' ` Yes , I THOUGHT I bought it my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14957 len. 17]: said the cherub , giving himself a little shake , as if to rouse his faculties .
Parsing [sent. 14958 len. 20]: ` And have you grown so fickle that you do n't like your own taste , Pa dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 14959 len. 45]: ` Well , my love , ' he returned , swallowing a bit of the cottage loaf with considerable effort , for it seemed to stick by the way : ' I should have thought it was hardly sufficiently splendid for existing circumstances . '
Parsing [sent. 14960 len. 31]: ` And so , Pa , ' said Bella , moving coaxingly to his side instead of remaining opposite , ` you sometimes have a quiet tea here all alone ?
Parsing [sent. 14961 len. 23]: I am not in the tea 's way , if I draw my arm over your shoulder like this , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 14962 len. 12]: ` Yes , my dear , and no , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 14963 len. 13]: Yes to the first question , and Certainly Not to the second .
Parsing [sent. 14964 len. 47]: Respecting the quiet tea , my dear , why you see the occupations of the day are sometimes a little wearing ; and if there 's nothing interposed between the day and your mother , why SHE is sometimes a little wearing , too . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14965 len. 11]: I know , Pa. ' ` Yes , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 14966 len. 43]: So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here , with a little quiet contemplation of the Lane -LRB- which comes soothing -RRB- , between the day , and domestic -- ' ` Bliss , ' suggested Bella , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 14967 len. 17]: ` And domestic Bliss , ' said her father , quite contented to accept the phrase .
Parsing [sent. 14968 len. 4]: Bella kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 14969 len. 32]: ` And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity , poor dear , that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 14970 len. 21]: ` Not at home , or not on the road there , or on the road here , my love .
Parsing [sent. 14971 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 14972 len. 10]: You see that little desk in the corner ? '
Parsing [sent. 14973 len. 16]: ` In the dark corner , furthest both from the light and from the fireplace ?
Parsing [sent. 14974 len. 9]: The shabbiest desk of all the desks ? '
Parsing [sent. 14975 len. 18]: ` Now , does it really strike you in that point of view , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 14976 len. 19]: said her father , surveying it artistically with his head on one side : ` that 's mine .
Parsing [sent. 14977 len. 8]: That 's called Rumty 's Perch . '
Parsing [sent. 14978 len. 5]: ` Whose Perch ? '
Parsing [sent. 14979 len. 6]: asked Bella with great indignation .
Parsing [sent. 14980 len. 4]: ` Rumty 's .
Parsing [sent. 14981 len. 16]: You see , being rather high and up two steps they call it a Perch .
Parsing [sent. 14982 len. 7]: And they call ME Rumty . '
Parsing [sent. 14983 len. 6]: ` How dare they ! '
Parsing [sent. 14984 len. 3]: exclaimed Bella .
Parsing [sent. 14985 len. 13]: ` They 're playful , Bella my dear ; they 're playful .
Parsing [sent. 14986 len. 15]: They 're more or less younger than I am , and they 're playful .
Parsing [sent. 14987 len. 5]: What does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 14988 len. 22]: It might be Surly , or Sulky , or fifty disagreeable things that I really should n't like to be considered .
Parsing [sent. 14989 len. 3]: But Rumty !
Parsing [sent. 14990 len. 7]: Lor , why not Rumty ? '
Parsing [sent. 14991 len. 45]: To inflict a heavy disappointment on this sweet nature , which had been , through all her caprices , the object of her recognition , love , and admiration from infancy , Bella felt to be the hardest task of her hard day . '
Parsing [sent. 14992 len. 49]: I should have done better , ' she thought , ` to tell him at first ; I should have done better to tell him just now , when he had some slight misgiving ; he is quite happy again , and I shall make him wretched . '
Parsing [sent. 14993 len. 77]: He was falling back on his loaf and milk , with the pleasantest composure , and Bella stealing her arm a little closer about him , and at the same time sticking up his hair with an irresistible propensity to play with him founded on the habit of her whole life , had prepared herself to say : ` Pa dear , do n't be cast down , but I must tell you something disagreeable ! '
Parsing [sent. 14994 len. 9]: when he interrupted her in an unlooked-for manner .
Parsing [sent. 14995 len. 6]: ` My gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14996 len. 11]: he exclaimed , invoking the Mincing Lane echoes as before .
Parsing [sent. 14997 len. 7]: ` This is very extraordinary ! '
Parsing [sent. 14998 len. 7]: ` What is , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 14999 len. 9]: ` Why here 's Mr Rokesmith now ! '
Parsing [sent. 15000 len. 16]: ` No , no , Pa , no , ' cried Bella , greatly flurried .
Parsing [sent. 15001 len. 5]: ` Surely not . '
Parsing [sent. 15002 len. 5]: ` Yes there is !
Parsing [sent. 15003 len. 4]: Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 15004 len. 18]: Sooth to say , Mr Rokesmith not only passed the window , but came into the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 15005 len. 54]: And not only came into the countinghouse , but , finding himself alone there with Bella and her father , rushed at Bella and caught her in his arms , with the rapturous words ` My dear , dear girl ; my gallant , generous , disinterested , courageous , noble girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 15006 len. 53]: And not only that even , -LRB- which one might have thought astonishment enough for one dose -RRB- , but Bella , after hanging her head for a moment , lifted it up and laid it on his breast , as if that were her head 's chosen and lasting resting-place ! '
Parsing [sent. 15007 len. 17]: I knew you would come to him , and I followed you , ' said Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 15008 len. 7]: ` My love , my life !
Parsing [sent. 15009 len. 5]: You ARE mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 15010 len. 19]: To which Bella responded , ` Yes , I AM yours if you think me worth taking ! '
Parsing [sent. 15011 len. 43]: And after that , seemed to shrink to next to nothing in the clasp of his arms , partly because it was such a strong one on his part , and partly because there was such a yielding to it on hers .
Parsing [sent. 15012 len. 50]: The cherub , whose hair would have done for itself under the influence of this amazing spectacle , what Bella had just now done for it , staggered back into the window-seat from which he had risen , and surveyed the pair with his eyes dilated to their utmost .
Parsing [sent. 15013 len. 36]: ` But we must think of dear Pa , ' said Bella ; ' I have n't told dear Pa ; let us speak to Pa. ' Upon which they turned to do so . '
Parsing [sent. 15014 len. 39]: I wish first , my dear , ' remarked the cherub faintly , ` that you 'd have the kindness to sprinkle me with a little milk , for I feel as if I was -- Going . '
Parsing [sent. 15015 len. 26]: In fact , the good little fellow had become alarmingly limp , and his senses seemed to be rapidly escaping , from the knees upward .
Parsing [sent. 15016 len. 29]: Bella sprinkled him with kisses instead of milk , but gave him a little of that article to drink ; and he gradually revived under her caressing care .
Parsing [sent. 15017 len. 16]: ` We 'll break it to you gently , dearest Pa , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 15018 len. 46]: ` My dear , ' returned the cherub , looking at them both , ` you broke so much in the first -- Gush , if I may so express myself -- that I think I am equal to a good large breakage now . '
Parsing [sent. 15019 len. 41]: ` Mr Wilfer , ' said John Rokesmith , excitedly and joyfully , ` Bella takes me , though I have no fortune , even no present occupation ; nothing but what I can get in the life before us .
Parsing [sent. 15020 len. 5]: Bella takes me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15021 len. 36]: ` Yes , I should rather have inferred , my dear sir , ' returned the cherub feebly , ` that Bella took you , from what I have within these few minutes remarked . '
Parsing [sent. 15022 len. 21]: ` You do n't know , Pa , ' said Bella , ` how ill I have used him ! '
Parsing [sent. 15023 len. 20]: ` You do n't know , sir , ' said Rokesmith , ` what a heart she has ! '
Parsing [sent. 15024 len. 29]: ` You do n't know , Pa , ' said Bella , ` what a shocking creature I was growing , when he saved me from myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 15025 len. 23]: ` You do n't know , sir , ' said Rokesmith , ` what a sacrifice she has made for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15026 len. 41]: ` My dear Bella , ' replied the cherub , still pathetically scared , ` and my dear John Rokesmith , if you will allow me so to call you -- ' ` Yes do , Pa , do ! '
Parsing [sent. 15027 len. 4]: urged Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 15028 len. 11]: I allow you , and my will is his law .
Parsing [sent. 15029 len. 9]: Is n't it -- dear John Rokesmith ? '
Parsing [sent. 15030 len. 42]: There was an engaging shyness in Bella , coupled with an engaging tenderness of love and confidence and pride , in thus first calling him by name , which made it quite excusable in John Rokesmith to do what he did .
Parsing [sent. 15031 len. 18]: What he did was , once more to give her the appearance of vanishing as aforesaid . '
Parsing [sent. 15032 len. 49]: I think , my dears , ' observed the cherub , ` that if you could make it convenient to sit one on one side of me , and the other on the other , we should get on rather more consecutively , and make things rather plainer .
Parsing [sent. 15033 len. 16]: John Rokesmith mentioned , a while ago , that he had no present occupation . '
Parsing [sent. 15034 len. 7]: ` None , ' said Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 15035 len. 11]: ` No , Pa , none , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 15036 len. 20]: ` From which I argue , ' proceeded the cherub , ` that he has left Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 15037 len. 5]: ` Yes , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 15038 len. 12]: And so -- ' ` Stop a bit , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 15039 len. 10]: I wish to lead up to it by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 15040 len. 11]: And that Mr Boffin has not treated him well ? '
Parsing [sent. 15041 len. 11]: ` Has treated him most shamefully , dear Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 15042 len. 7]: cried Bella with a flashing face .
Parsing [sent. 15043 len. 30]: ` Of which , ' pursued the cherub , enjoining patience with his hand , ' a certain mercenary young person distantly related to myself , could not approve ?
Parsing [sent. 15044 len. 9]: Am I leading up to it right ? '
Parsing [sent. 15045 len. 21]: ` Could not approve , sweet Pa , ' said Bella , with a tearful laugh and a joyful kiss .
Parsing [sent. 15046 len. 83]: ` Upon which , ' pursued the cherub , ` the certain mercenary young person distantly related to myself , having previously observed and mentioned to myself that prosperity was spoiling Mr Boffin , felt that she must not sell her sense of what was right and what was wrong , and what was true and what was false , and what was just and what was unjust , for any price that could be paid to her by any one alive ?
Parsing [sent. 15047 len. 9]: Am I leading up to it right ? '
Parsing [sent. 15048 len. 10]: With another tearful laugh Bella joyfully kissed him again .
Parsing [sent. 15049 len. 84]: ` And therefore -- and therefore , ' the cherub went on in a glowing voice , as Bella 's hand stole gradually up his waistcoat to his neck , ` this mercenary young person distantly related to myself , refused the price , took off the splendid fashions that were part of it , put on the comparatively poor dress that I had last given her , and trusting to my supporting her in what was right , came straight to me .
Parsing [sent. 15050 len. 8]: Have I led up to it ? '
Parsing [sent. 15051 len. 18]: Bella 's hand was round his neck by this time , and her face was on it .
Parsing [sent. 15052 len. 20]: ` The mercenary young person distantly related to myself , ' said her good father , ` did well !
Parsing [sent. 15053 len. 17]: The mercenary young person distantly related to myself , did not trust to me in vain !
Parsing [sent. 15054 len. 33]: I admire this mercenary young person distantly related to myself , more in this dress than if she had come to me in China silks , Cashmere shawls , and Golconda diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 15055 len. 7]: I love this young person dearly .
Parsing [sent. 15056 len. 58]: I say to the man of this young person 's heart , out of my heart and with all of it , `` My blessing on this engagement betwixt you , and she brings you a good fortune when she brings you the poverty she has accepted for your sake and the honest truth 's ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 15057 len. 29]: The stanch little man 's voice failed him as he gave John Rokesmith his hand , and he was silent , bending his face low over his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 15058 len. 6]: But , not for long .
Parsing [sent. 15059 len. 63]: He soon looked up , saying in a sprightly tone : ` And now , my dear child , if you think you can entertain John Rokesmith for a minute and a half , I 'll run over to the Dairy , and fetch HIM a cottage loaf and a drink of milk , that we may all have tea together . '
Parsing [sent. 15060 len. 43]: It was , as Bella gaily said , like the supper provided for the three nursery hobgoblins at their house in the forest , without their thunderous low growlings of the alarming discovery , ` Somebody 's been drinking MY milk ! '
Parsing [sent. 15061 len. 26]: It was a delicious repast ; by far the most delicious that Bella , or John Rokesmith , or even R. Wilfer had ever made .
Parsing [sent. 15062 len. 43]: The uncongenial oddity of its surroundings , with the two brass knobs of the iron safe of Chicksey , Veneering , and Stobbles staring from a corner , like the eyes of some dull dragon , only made it the more delightful .
Parsing [sent. 15063 len. 34]: ` To think , ' said the cherub , looking round the office with unspeakable enjoyment , ` that anything of a tender nature should come off here , is what tickles me .
Parsing [sent. 15064 len. 25]: To think that ever I should have seen my Bella folded in the arms of her future husband , HERE , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 15065 len. 51]: It was not until the cottage loaves and the milk had for some time disappeared , and the foreshadowings of night were creeping over Mincing Lane , that the cherub by degrees became a little nervous , and said to Bella , as he cleared his throat : ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 15066 len. 14]: -- Have you thought at all about your mother , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 15067 len. 18]: ` Yes , Pa. ' ` And your sister Lavvy , for instance , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 15068 len. 5]: ` Yes , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 15069 len. 12]: I think we had better not enter into particulars at home .
Parsing [sent. 15070 len. 25]: I think it will be quite enough to say that I had a difference with Mr Boffin , and have left for good . '
Parsing [sent. 15071 len. 45]: ` John Rokesmith being acquainted with your Ma , my love , ' said her father , after some slight hesitation , ' I need have no delicacy in hinting before him that you may perhaps find your Ma a little wearing . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15072 len. 7]: A little , patient Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 15073 len. 17]: said Bella with a tuneful laugh : the tunefuller for being so loving in its tone .
Parsing [sent. 15074 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 15075 len. 24]: We 'll say , strictly in confidence among ourselves , wearing ; we wo n't qualify it , ' the cherub stoutly admitted .
Parsing [sent. 15076 len. 11]: ` And your sister 's temper is wearing . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15077 len. 56]: I do n't mind , Pa. ' ` And you must prepare yourself you know , my precious , ' said her father , with much gentleness , ` for our looking very poor and meagre at home , and being at the best but very uncomfortable , after Mr Boffin 's house . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15078 len. 7]: I do n't mind , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 15079 len. 11]: I could bear much harder trials -- for John . '
Parsing [sent. 15080 len. 33]: The closing words were not so softly and blushingly said but that John heard them , and showed that he heard them by again assisting Bella to another of those mysterious disappearances .
Parsing [sent. 15081 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 15082 len. 43]: said the cherub gaily , and not expressing disapproval , ` when you -- when you come back from retirement , my love , and reappear on the surface , I think it will be time to lock up and go . '
Parsing [sent. 15083 len. 38]: If the counting-house of Chicksey , Veneering , and Stobbles had ever been shut up by three happier people , glad as most people were to shut it up , they must have been superlatively happy indeed .
Parsing [sent. 15084 len. 26]: But first Bella mounted upon Rumty 's Perch , and said , ` Show me what you do here all day long , dear Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 15085 len. 7]: Do you write like this ? '
Parsing [sent. 15086 len. 27]: laying her round cheek upon her plump left arm , and losing sight of her pen in waves of hair , in a highly unbusiness-like manner .
Parsing [sent. 15087 len. 8]: Though John Rokesmith seemed to like it .
Parsing [sent. 15088 len. 55]: So , the three hobgoblins , having effaced all traces of their feast , and swept up the crumbs , came out of Mincing Lane to walk to Holloway ; and if two of the hobgoblins did n't wish the distance twice as long as it was , the third hobgoblin was much mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 15089 len. 54]: Indeed , that modest spirit deemed himself so much in the way of their deep enjoyment of the journey , that he apologetically remarked : ' I think , my dears , I 'll take the lead on the other side of the road , and seem not to belong to you . '
Parsing [sent. 15090 len. 17]: Which he did , cherubically strewing the path with smiles , in the absence of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 15091 len. 38]: It was almost ten o'clock when they stopped within view of Wilfer Castle ; and then , the spot being quiet and deserted , Bella began a series of disappearances which threatened to last all night . '
Parsing [sent. 15092 len. 35]: I think , John , ' the cherub hinted at last , ` that if you can spare me the young person distantly related to myself , I 'll take her in . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15093 len. 20]: I ca n't spare her , ' answered John , ` but I must lend her to you . '
Parsing [sent. 15094 len. 5]: -- My Darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 15095 len. 12]: A word of magic which caused Bella instantly to disappear again .
Parsing [sent. 15096 len. 40]: ` Now , dearest Pa , ' said Bella , when she became visible , ` put your hand in mine , and we 'll run home as fast as ever we can run , and get it over .
Parsing [sent. 15097 len. 4]: Now , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 15098 len. 2]: Once !
Parsing [sent. 15099 len. 61]: -- ' ` My dear , ' the cherub faltered , with something of a craven air , ' I was going to observe that if your mother -- ' ` You must n't hang back , sir , to gain time , ' cried Bella , putting out her right foot ; ` do you see that , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 15100 len. 13]: That 's the mark ; come up to the mark , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15101 len. 2]: Once !
Parsing [sent. 15102 len. 2]: Twice !
Parsing [sent. 15103 len. 8]: Three times and away , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 15104 len. 27]: Off she skimmed , bearing the cherub along , nor ever stopped , nor suffered him to stop , until she had pulled at the bell .
Parsing [sent. 15105 len. 39]: ` Now , dear Pa , ' said Bella , taking him by both ears as if he were a pitcher , and conveying his face to her rosy lips , ` we are in for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 15106 len. 25]: Miss Lavvy came out to open the gate , waited on by that attentive cavalier and friend of the family , Mr George Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 15107 len. 9]: ` Why , it 's never Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 15108 len. 9]: exclaimed Miss Lavvy starting back at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 15109 len. 7]: And then bawled , ` Ma !
Parsing [sent. 15110 len. 5]: Here 's Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 15111 len. 14]: This produced , before they could get into the house , Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 15112 len. 21]: Who , standing in the portal , received them with ghostly gloom , and all her other appliances of ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 15113 len. 34]: ` My child is welcome , though unlooked for , ' said she , at the time presenting her cheek as if it were a cool slate for visitors to enrol themselves upon .
Parsing [sent. 15114 len. 13]: ` You too , R. W. , are welcome , though late .
Parsing [sent. 15115 len. 12]: Does the male domestic of Mrs Boffin hear me there ? '
Parsing [sent. 15116 len. 18]: This deeptoned inquiry was cast forth into the night , for response from the menial in question .
Parsing [sent. 15117 len. 15]: ` There is no one waiting , Ma , dear , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 15118 len. 8]: ` There is no one waiting ? '
Parsing [sent. 15119 len. 6]: repeated MrsWilfer in majestic accents .
Parsing [sent. 15120 len. 8]: ` No , Ma , dear . '
Parsing [sent. 15121 len. 21]: A dignified shiver pervaded Mrs Wilfer 's shoulders and gloves , as who should say , ` An Enigma ! '
Parsing [sent. 15122 len. 63]: and then she marched at the head of the procession to the family keeping-room , where she observed : ` Unless , R. W. ' : who started on being solemnly turned upon : ` you have taken the precaution of making some addition to our frugal supper on your way home , it will prove but a distasteful one to Bella .
Parsing [sent. 15123 len. 20]: Cold neck of mutton and a lettuce can ill compete with the luxuries of Mr Boffin 's board . '
Parsing [sent. 15124 len. 26]: ` Pray do n't talk like that , Ma dear , ' said Bella ; ` Mr Boffin 's board is nothing to me . '
Parsing [sent. 15125 len. 24]: But , here Miss Lavinia , who had been intently eyeing Bella 's bonnet , struck in with ` Why , Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 15126 len. 9]: ` Yes , Lavvy , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 15127 len. 26]: The Irrepressible lowered her eyes to Bella 's dress , and stooped to look at it , exclaiming again : ` Why , Bella ! '
Parsing [sent. 15128 len. 13]: ` Yes , Lavvy , I know what I have got on .
Parsing [sent. 15129 len. 10]: I was going to tell Ma when you interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 15130 len. 20]: I have left Mr Boffin 's house for good , Ma , and I have come home again . '
Parsing [sent. 15131 len. 46]: Mrs Wilfer spake no word , but , having glared at her offspring for a minute or two in an awful silence , retired into her corner of state backward , and sat down : like a frozen article on sale in a Russian market .
Parsing [sent. 15132 len. 62]: ` In short , dear Ma , ' said Bella , taking off the depreciated bonnet and shaking out her hair , ' I have had a very serious difference with Mr Boffin on the subject of his treatment of a member of his household , and it 's a final difference , and there 's an end of all . '
Parsing [sent. 15133 len. 37]: ` And I am bound to tell you , my dear , ' added R. W. , submissively , ` that Bella has acted in a truly brave spirit , and with a truly right feeling .
Parsing [sent. 15134 len. 19]: And therefore I hope , my dear , you 'll not allow yourself to be greatly disappointed . '
Parsing [sent. 15135 len. 4]: ` George ! '
Parsing [sent. 15136 len. 23]: said Miss Lavvy , in a sepulchral , warning voice , founded on her mother 's ; ` George Sampson , speak !
Parsing [sent. 15137 len. 10]: What did I tell you about those Boffins ? '
Parsing [sent. 15138 len. 41]: Mr Sampson perceiving his frail bark to be labouring among shoals and breakers , thought it safest not to refer back to any particular thing that he had been told , lest he should refer back to the wrong thing .
Parsing [sent. 15139 len. 17]: With admirable seamanship he got his bark into deep water by murmuring ` Yes indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 15140 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 15141 len. 36]: I told George Sampson , as George Sampson tells you , said Miss Lavvy , ` that those hateful Boffins would pick a quarrel with Bella , as soon as her novelty had worn off .
Parsing [sent. 15142 len. 10]: Have they done it , or have they not ?
Parsing [sent. 15143 len. 9]: Was I right , or was I wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 15144 len. 16]: And what do you say to us , Bella , of your Boffins now ? '
Parsing [sent. 15145 len. 36]: ` Lavvy and Ma , ' said Bella , ' I say of Mr and Mrs Boffin what I always have said ; and I always shall say of them what I always have said .
Parsing [sent. 15146 len. 12]: But nothing will induce me to quarrel with any one tonight .
Parsing [sent. 15147 len. 57]: I hope you are not sorry to see me , Ma dear , ' kissing her ; ` and I hope you are not sorry to see me , Lavvy , ' kissing her too ; ` and as I notice the lettuce Ma mentioned , on the table , I 'll make the salad . '
Parsing [sent. 15148 len. 62]: Bella playfully setting herself about the task , Mrs Wilfer 's impressive countenance followed her with glaring eyes , presenting a combination of the once popular sign of the Saracen 's Head , with a piece of Dutch clock-work , and suggesting to an imaginative mind that from the composition of the salad , her daughter might prudently omit the vinegar .
Parsing [sent. 15149 len. 11]: But no word issued from the majestic matron 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 15150 len. 28]: And this was more terrific to her husband -LRB- as perhaps she knew -RRB- than any flow of eloquence with which she could have edified the company .
Parsing [sent. 15151 len. 26]: ` Now , Ma dear , ' said Bella in due course , ` the salad 's ready , and it 's past supper-time . '
Parsing [sent. 15152 len. 8]: Mrs Wilfer rose , but remained speechless .
Parsing [sent. 15153 len. 4]: ` George ! '
Parsing [sent. 15154 len. 15]: said Miss Lavinia in her voice of warning , ` Ma 's chair ! '
Parsing [sent. 15155 len. 26]: Mr Sampson flew to the excellent lady 's back , and followed her up close chair in hand , as she stalked to the banquet .
Parsing [sent. 15156 len. 35]: Arrived at the table , she took her rigid seat , after favouring Mr Sampson with a glare for himself , which caused the young gentleman to retire to his place in much confusion .
Parsing [sent. 15157 len. 59]: The cherub not presuming to address so tremendous an object , transacted her supper through the agency of a third person , as ` Mutton to your Ma , Bella , my dear ' ; and ` Lavvy , I dare say your Ma would take some lettuce if you were to put it on her plate . '
Parsing [sent. 15158 len. 51]: Mrs Wilfer 's manner of receiving those viands was marked by petrified absence of mind ; in which state , likewise , she partook of them , occasionally laying down her knife and fork , as saying within her own spirit , ` What is this I am doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 15159 len. 18]: and glaring at one or other of the party , as if in indignant search of information .
Parsing [sent. 15160 len. 60]: A magnetic result of such glaring was , that the person glared at could not by any means successfully pretend to he ignorant of the fact : so that a bystander , without beholding Mrs Wilfer at all , must have known at whom she was glaring , by seeing her refracted from the countenance of the beglared one .
Parsing [sent. 15161 len. 23]: Miss Lavinia was extremely affable to Mr Sampson on this special occasion , and took the opportunity of informing her sister why .
Parsing [sent. 15162 len. 63]: ` It was not worth troubling you about , Bella , when you were in a sphere so far removed from your family as to make it a matter in which you could be expected to take very little interest , ' said Lavinia with a toss of her chin ; ` but George Sampson is paying his addresses to me . '
Parsing [sent. 15163 len. 7]: Bella was glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 15164 len. 52]: Mr Sampson became thoughtfully red , and felt called upon to encircle Miss Lavinia 's waist with his arm ; but , encountering a large pin in the young lady 's belt , scarified a finger , uttered a sharp exclamation , and attracted the lightning of Mrs Wilfer 's glare .
Parsing [sent. 15165 len. 37]: ` George is getting on very well , ' said Miss Lavinia which might not have been supposed at the moment -- ` and I dare say we shall be married , one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 15166 len. 51]: I did n't care to mention it when you were with your Bof -- ' here Miss Lavinia checked herself in a bounce , and added more placidly , ` when you were with Mr and Mrs Boffin ; but now I think it sisterly to name the circumstance . '
Parsing [sent. 15167 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Lavvy dear .
Parsing [sent. 15168 len. 5]: I congratulate you . '
Parsing [sent. 15169 len. 6]: ` Thank you , Bella .
Parsing [sent. 15170 len. 60]: The truth is , George and I did discuss whether I should tell you ; but I said to George that you would n't be much interested in so paltry an affair , and that it was far more likely you would rather detach yourself from us altogether , than have him added to the rest of us . '
Parsing [sent. 15171 len. 13]: ` That was a mistake , dear Lavvy , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 15172 len. 24]: ` It turns out to be , ' replied Miss Lavinia ; ` but circumstances have changed , you know , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 15173 len. 15]: George is in a new situation , and his prospects are very good indeed .
Parsing [sent. 15174 len. 35]: I should n't have had the courage to tell you so yesterday , when you would have thought his prospects poor , and not worth notice ; but I feel quite bold tonight . '
Parsing [sent. 15175 len. 11]: ` When did you begin to feel timid , Lavvy ?
Parsing [sent. 15176 len. 8]: inquired Bella , with a smile . '
Parsing [sent. 15177 len. 17]: I did n't say that I ever felt timid , Bella , ' replied the Irrepressible .
Parsing [sent. 15178 len. 58]: ` But perhaps I might have said , if I had not been restrained by delicacy towards a sister 's feelings , that I have for some time felt independent ; too independent , my dear , to subject myself to have my intended match -LRB- you 'll prick yourself again , George -RRB- looked down upon .
Parsing [sent. 15179 len. 38]: It is not that I could have blamed you for looking down upon it , when you were looking up to a rich and great match , Bella ; it is only that I was independent . '
Parsing [sent. 15180 len. 75]: Whether the Irrepressible felt slighted by Bella 's declaration that she would not quarrel , or whether her spitefulness was evoked by Bella 's return to the sphere of Mr George Sampson 's courtship , or whether it was a necessary fillip to her spirits that she should come into collision with somebody on the present occasion , -- anyhow she made a dash at her stately parent now , with the greatest impetuosity .
Parsing [sent. 15181 len. 16]: ` Ma , pray do n't sit staring at me in that intensely aggravating manner !
Parsing [sent. 15182 len. 23]: If you see a black on my nose , tell me so ; if you do n't , leave me alone . '
Parsing [sent. 15183 len. 10]: ` Do you address Me in those words ? '
Parsing [sent. 15184 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 15185 len. 6]: ` Do you presume ? '
Parsing [sent. 15186 len. 14]: ` Do n't talk about presuming , Ma , for goodness ' sake .
Parsing [sent. 15187 len. 28]: A girl who is old enough to be engaged , is quite old enough to object to be stared at as if she was a Clock . '
Parsing [sent. 15188 len. 5]: ` Audacious one ! '
Parsing [sent. 15189 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 15190 len. 29]: ` Your grandmamma , if so addressed by one of her daughters , at any age , would have insisted on her retiring to a dark apartment . '
Parsing [sent. 15191 len. 33]: ` My grandmamma , ' returned Lavvy , folding her arms and leaning back in her chair , ` would n't have sat staring people out of countenance , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 15192 len. 5]: ` She would ! '
Parsing [sent. 15193 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 15194 len. 16]: ` Then it 's a pity she did n't know better , ' said Lavvy .
Parsing [sent. 15195 len. 29]: ` And if my grandmamma was n't in her dotage when she took to insisting on people 's retiring to dark apartments , she ought to have been .
Parsing [sent. 15196 len. 11]: A pretty exhibition my grandmamma must have made of herself !
Parsing [sent. 15197 len. 30]: I wonder whether she ever insisted on people 's retiring into the ball of St Paul 's ; and if she did , how she got them there ! '
Parsing [sent. 15198 len. 4]: ` Silence ! '
Parsing [sent. 15199 len. 5]: proclaimed Mrs Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 15200 len. 6]: I command silence ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15201 len. 23]: I have not the slightest intention of being silent , Ma , ' returned Lavinia coolly , ` but quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 15202 len. 22]: I am not going to be eyed as if I had come from the Boffins , and sit silent under it .
Parsing [sent. 15203 len. 24]: I am not going to have George Sampson eyed as if HE had come from the Boffins , and sit silent under it .
Parsing [sent. 15204 len. 21]: If Pa thinks proper to be eyed as if HE had come from the Boffins also , well and good .
Parsing [sent. 15205 len. 6]: I do n't choose to .
Parsing [sent. 15206 len. 6]: And I wo n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 15207 len. 17]: Lavinia 's engineering having made this crooked opening at Bella , Mrs Wilfer strode into it .
Parsing [sent. 15208 len. 5]: ` You rebellious spirit !
Parsing [sent. 15209 len. 4]: You mutinous child !
Parsing [sent. 15210 len. 6]: Tell me this , Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 15211 len. 46]: If in violation of your mother 's sentiments , you had condescended to allow yourself to be patronized by the Boffins , and if you had come from those halls of slavery -- ' ` That 's mere nonsense , Ma , ' said Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 15212 len. 4]: ` How ! '
Parsing [sent. 15213 len. 8]: exclaimed Mrs Wilfer , with sublime severity .
Parsing [sent. 15214 len. 20]: ` Halls of slavery , Ma , is mere stuff and nonsense , ' returned the unmoved Irrepressible . '
Parsing [sent. 15215 len. 49]: I say , presumptuous child , if you had come from the neighbourhood of Portland Place , bending under the yoke of patronage and attended by its domestics in glittering garb to visit me , do you think my deep-seated feelings could have been expressed in looks ? '
Parsing [sent. 15216 len. 26]: ` All I think about it , is , ' returned Lavinia , ` that I should wish them expressed to the right person . '
Parsing [sent. 15217 len. 79]: ` And if , ' pursued her mother , ` if making light of my warnings that the face of Mrs Boffin alone was a face teeming with evil , you had clung to Mrs Boffin instead of to me , and had after all come home rejected by Mrs Boffin , trampled under foot by Mrs Boffin , and cast out by Mrs Boffin , do you think my feelings could have been expressed in looks ? '
Parsing [sent. 15218 len. 34]: Lavinia was about replying to her honoured parent that she might as well have dispensed with her looks altogether then , when Bella rose and said , ` Good night , dear Ma .
Parsing [sent. 15219 len. 15]: I have had a tiring day , and I 'll go to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 15220 len. 7]: This broke up the agreeable party .
Parsing [sent. 15221 len. 72]: Mr George Sampson shortly afterwards took his leave , accompanied by Miss Lavinia with a candle as far as the hall , and without a candle as far as the garden gate ; Mrs Wilfer , washing her hands of the Boffins , went to bed after the manner of Lady Macbeth ; and R. W. was left alone among the dilapidations of the supper table , in a melancholy attitude .
Parsing [sent. 15222 len. 17]: But , a light footstep roused him from his meditations , and it was Bella 's .
Parsing [sent. 15223 len. 29]: Her pretty hair was hanging all about her , and she had tripped down softly , brush in hand , and barefoot , to say good-night to him .
Parsing [sent. 15224 len. 25]: ` My dear , you most unquestionably ARE a lovely woman , ' said the cherub , taking up a tress in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 15225 len. 36]: ` Look here , sir , ' said Bella ; ` when your lovely woman marries , you shall have that piece if you like , and she 'll make you a chain of it .
Parsing [sent. 15226 len. 11]: Would you prize that remembrance of the dear creature ? '
Parsing [sent. 15227 len. 7]: ` Yes , my precious . '
Parsing [sent. 15228 len. 13]: ` Then you shall have it if you 're good , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15229 len. 19]: I am very , very sorry , dearest Pa , to have brought home all this trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 15230 len. 24]: ` My pet , ' returned her father , in the simplest good faith , ` do n't make yourself uneasy about that .
Parsing [sent. 15231 len. 22]: It really is not worth mentioning , because things at home would have taken pretty much the same turn any way .
Parsing [sent. 15232 len. 23]: If your mother and sister do n't find one subject to get at times a little wearing on , they find another .
Parsing [sent. 15233 len. 16]: We 're never out of a wearing subject , my dear , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 15234 len. 17]: I am afraid you find your old room with Lavvy , dreadfully inconvenient , Bella ? '
Parsing [sent. 15235 len. 13]: ` No I do n't , Pa ; I do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 15236 len. 13]: Why do n't I mind , do you think , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 15237 len. 25]: ` Well , my child , you used to complain of it when it was n't such a contrast as it must be now .
Parsing [sent. 15238 len. 17]: Upon my word , I can only answer , because you are so much improved . '
Parsing [sent. 15239 len. 5]: ` No , Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 15240 len. 10]: Because I am so thankful and so happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 15241 len. 35]: Here she choked him until her long hair made him sneeze , and then she laughed until she made him laugh , and then she choked him again that they might not be overheard .
Parsing [sent. 15242 len. 9]: ` Listen , sir , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 15243 len. 15]: ` Your lovely woman was told her fortune to night on her way home .
Parsing [sent. 15244 len. 38]: It wo n't be a large fortune , because if the lovely woman 's Intended gets a certain appointment that he hopes to get soon , she will marry on a hundred and fifty pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 15245 len. 24]: But that 's at first , and even if it should never be more , the lovely woman will make it quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 15246 len. 8]: But that 's not all , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15247 len. 57]: In the fortune there 's a certain fair man -- a little man , the fortune-teller said -- who , it seems , will always find himself near the lovely woman , and will always have kept , expressly for him , such a peaceful corner in the lovely woman 's little house as never was .
Parsing [sent. 15248 len. 11]: Tell me the name of that man , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 15249 len. 12]: ` Is he a Knave in the pack of cards ? '
Parsing [sent. 15250 len. 11]: inquired the cherub , with a twinkle in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 15251 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 15252 len. 11]: cried Bella , in high glee , choking him again .
Parsing [sent. 15253 len. 8]: ` He 's the Knave of Wilfers !
Parsing [sent. 15254 len. 42]: Dear Pa , the lovely woman means to look forward to this fortune that has been told for her , so delightfully , and to cause it to make her a much better lovely woman than she ever has been yet .
Parsing [sent. 15255 len. 42]: What the little fair man is expected to do , sir , is to look forward to it also , by saying to himself when he is in danger of being over-worried , `` I see land at last ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 15256 len. 7]: I see land at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 15257 len. 4]: repeated her father .
Parsing [sent. 15258 len. 10]: ` There 's a dear Knave of Wilfers ! '
Parsing [sent. 15259 len. 20]: exclaimed Bella ; then putting out her small white bare foot , ` That 's the mark , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15260 len. 5]: Come to the mark .
Parsing [sent. 15261 len. 6]: Put your boot against it .
Parsing [sent. 15262 len. 8]: We keep to it together , mind !
Parsing [sent. 15263 len. 21]: Now , sir , you may kiss the lovely woman before she runs away , so thankful and so happy .
Parsing [sent. 15264 len. 14]: O yes , fair little man , so thankful and so happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 15265 len. 63]: Chapter 17 A SOCIAL CHORUS Amazement sits enthroned upon the countenances of Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle 's circle of acquaintance , when the disposal of their first-class furniture and effects -LRB- including a Billiard Table in capital letters -RRB- , ` by auction , under a bill of sale , ' is publicly announced on a waving hearthrug in Sackville Street .
Parsing [sent. 15266 len. 53]: But , nobody is half so much amazed as Hamilton Veneering , Esquire , M.P. for Pocket-Breaches , who instantly begins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on his soul 's register , who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world .
Parsing [sent. 15267 len. 20]: Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. for Pocket-Breaches , like a faithful wife shares her husband 's discovery and inexpressible astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 15268 len. 49]: Perhaps the Veneerings twain may deem the last unutterable feeling particularly due to their reputation , by reason that once upon a time some of the longer heads in the City are whispered to have shaken themselves , when Veneering 's extensive dealings and great wealth were mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 15269 len. 41]: But , it is certain that neither Mr nor Mrs Veneering can find words to wonder in , and it becomes necessary that they give to the oldest and dearest friends they have in the world , a wondering dinner .
Parsing [sent. 15270 len. 22]: For , it is by this time noticeable that , whatever befals , the Veneerings must give a dinner upon it .
Parsing [sent. 15271 len. 27]: Lady Tippins lives in a chronic state of invitation to dine with the Veneerings , and in a chronic state of inflammation arising from the dinners .
Parsing [sent. 15272 len. 28]: Boots and Brewer go about in cabs , with no other intelligible business on earth than to beat up people to come and dine with the Veneerings .
Parsing [sent. 15273 len. 14]: Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies , intent upon entrapping his fellow-legislators to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 15274 len. 68]: Mrs Veneering dined with fiveand-twenty bran-new faces over night ; calls upon them all to day ; sends them every one a dinner-card to-morrow , for the week after next ; before that dinner is digested , calls upon their brothers and sisters , their sons and daughters , their nephews and nieces , their aunts and uncles and cousins , and invites them all to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 15275 len. 62]: And still , as at first , howsoever , the dining circle widens , it is to be observed that all the diners are consistent in appearing to go to the Veneerings , not to dine with Mr and Mrs Veneering -LRB- which would seem to be the last thing in their minds -RRB- , but to dine with one another .
Parsing [sent. 15276 len. 9]: Perhaps , after all , -- who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 15277 len. 20]: -- Veneering may find this dining , though expensive , remunerative , in the sense that it makes champions .
Parsing [sent. 15278 len. 53]: Mr Podsnap , as a representative man , is not alone in caring very particularly for his own dignity , if not for that of his acquaintances , and therefore in angrily supporting the acquaintances who have taken out his Permit , lest , in their being lessened , he should be .
Parsing [sent. 15279 len. 72]: The gold and silver camels , and the icepails , and the rest of the Veneering table decorations , make a brilliant show , and when I , Podsnap , casually remark elsewhere that I dined last Monday with a gorgeous caravan of camels , I find it personally offensive to have it hinted to me that they are brokenkneed camels , or camels labouring under suspicion of any sort . '
Parsing [sent. 15280 len. 51]: I do n't display camels myself , I am above them : I am a more solid man ; but these camels have basked in the light of my countenance , and how dare you , sir , insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable camels ? '
Parsing [sent. 15281 len. 108]: The camels are polishing up in the Analytical 's pantry for the dinner of wonderment on the occasion of the Lammles going to pieces , and Mr Twemlow feels a little queer on the sofa at his lodgings over the stable yard in Duke Street , Saint James 's , in consequence of having taken two advertised pills at about mid-day , on the faith of the printed representation accompanying the box -LRB- price one and a penny halfpenny , government stamp included -RRB- , that the same ` will be found highly salutary as a precautionary measure in connection with the pleasures of the table . '
Parsing [sent. 15282 len. 53]: To whom , while sickly with the fancy of an insoluble pill sticking in his gullet , and also with the sensation of a deposit of warm gum languidly wandering within him a little lower down , a servant enters with the announcement that a lady wishes to speak with him . '
Parsing [sent. 15283 len. 4]: A lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 15284 len. 8]: says Twemlow , pluming his ruffled feathers .
Parsing [sent. 15285 len. 11]: ` Ask the favour of the lady 's name . '
Parsing [sent. 15286 len. 7]: The lady 's name is Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 15287 len. 14]: The lady will not detain Mr Twemlow longer than a very few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 15288 len. 27]: The lady is sure that Mr Twemlow will do her the kindness to see her , on being told that she particularly desires a short interview .
Parsing [sent. 15289 len. 17]: The lady has no doubt whatever of Mr Twemlow 's compliance when he hears her name .
Parsing [sent. 15290 len. 13]: Has begged the servant to be particular not to mistake her name .
Parsing [sent. 15291 len. 11]: Would have sent in a card , but has none .
Parsing [sent. 15292 len. 7]: ` Show the lady in . '
Parsing [sent. 15293 len. 7]: Lady shown in , comes in .
Parsing [sent. 15294 len. 95]: Mr Twemlow 's little rooms are modestly furnished , in an oldfashioned manner -LRB- rather like the housekeeper 's room at Snigsworthy Park -RRB- , and would be bare of mere ornament , were it not for a full-length engraving of the sublime Snigsworth over the chimneypiece , snorting at a Corinthian column , with an enormous roll of paper at his feet , and a heavy curtain going to tumble down on his head ; those accessories being understood to represent the noble lord as somehow in the act of saving his country .
Parsing [sent. 15295 len. 10]: ` Pray take a seat , Mrs Lammle . '
Parsing [sent. 15296 len. 11]: Mrs Lammle takes a seat and opens the conversation . '
Parsing [sent. 15297 len. 21]: I have no doubt , Mr Twemlow , that you have heard of a reverse of fortune having befallen us .
Parsing [sent. 15298 len. 24]: Of course you have heard of it , for no kind of news travels so fast -- among one 's friends especially . '
Parsing [sent. 15299 len. 17]: Mindful of the wondering dinner , Twemlow , with a little twinge , admits the imputation .
Parsing [sent. 15300 len. 50]: ` Probably it will not , ' says Mrs Lammle , with a certain hardened manner upon her , that makes Twemlow shrink , ` have surprised you so much as some others , after what passed between us at the house which is now turned out at windows .
Parsing [sent. 15301 len. 27]: I have taken the liberty of calling upon you , Mr Twemlow , to add a sort of postscript to what I said that day . '
Parsing [sent. 15302 len. 20]: Mr Twemlow 's dry and hollow cheeks become more dry and hollow at the prospect of some new complication .
Parsing [sent. 15303 len. 33]: ` Really , ' says the uneasy little gentleman , ` really , Mrs Lammle , I should take it as a favour if you could excuse me from any further confidence .
Parsing [sent. 15304 len. 36]: It has ever been one of the objects of my life -- which , unfortunately , has not had many objects -- to be inoffensive , and to keep out of cabals and interferences . '
Parsing [sent. 15305 len. 31]: Mrs Lammle , by far the more observant of the two , scarcely finds it necessary to look at Twemlow while he speaks , so easily does she read him .
Parsing [sent. 15306 len. 42]: ` My postscript -- to retain the term I have used ' -- says Mrs Lammle , fixing her eyes on his face , to enforce what she says herself -- ` coincides exactly with what you say , Mr Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 15307 len. 22]: So far from troubling you with any new confidence , I merely wish to remind you what the old one was .
Parsing [sent. 15308 len. 18]: So far from asking you for interference , I merely wish to claim your strict neutrality . '
Parsing [sent. 15309 len. 29]: Twemlow going on to reply , she rests her eyes again , knowing her ears to be quite enough for the contents of so weak a vessel . '
Parsing [sent. 15310 len. 36]: I can , I suppose , ' says Twemlow , nervously , ` offer no reasonable objection to hearing anything that you do me the honour to wish to say to me under those heads .
Parsing [sent. 15311 len. 29]: But if I may , with all possible delicacy and politeness , entreat you not to range beyond them , I -- I beg to do so . '
Parsing [sent. 15312 len. 52]: ` Sir , ' says Mrs Lammle , raising her eyes to his face again , and quite daunting him with her hardened manner , ' I imparted to you a certain piece of knowledge , to be imparted again , as you thought best , to a certain person . '
Parsing [sent. 15313 len. 9]: ` Which I did , ' says Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 15314 len. 37]: ` And for doing which , I thank you ; though , indeed , I scarcely know why I turned traitress to my husband in the matter , for the girl is a poor little fool .
Parsing [sent. 15315 len. 17]: I was a poor little fool once myself ; I can find no better reason . '
Parsing [sent. 15316 len. 25]: Seeing the effect she produces on him by her indifferent laugh and cold look , she keeps her eyes upon him as she proceeds .
Parsing [sent. 15317 len. 72]: ` Mr Twemlow , if you should chance to see my husband , or to see me , or to see both of us , in the favour or confidence of any one else -- whether of our common acquaintance or not , is of no consequence -- you have no right to use against us the knowledge I intrusted you with , for one special purpose which has been accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 15318 len. 8]: This is what I came to say .
Parsing [sent. 15319 len. 16]: It is not a stipulation ; to a gentleman it is simply a reminder . '
Parsing [sent. 15320 len. 12]: Twemlow sits murmuring to himself with his hand to his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 15321 len. 41]: ` It is so plain a case , ' Mrs Lammle goes on , ` as between me -LRB- from the first relying on your honour -RRB- and you , that I will not waste another word upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 15322 len. 54]: She looks steadily at Mr Twemlow , until , with a shrug , he makes her a little one-sided bow , as though saying ` Yes , I think you have a right to rely upon me , ' and then she moistens her lips , and shows a sense of relief . '
Parsing [sent. 15323 len. 23]: I trust I have kept the promise I made through your servant , that I would detain you a very few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 15324 len. 11]: I need trouble you no longer , Mr Twemlow . '
Parsing [sent. 15325 len. 4]: ` Stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 15326 len. 8]: says Twemlow , rising as she rises .
Parsing [sent. 15327 len. 6]: ` Pardon me a moment .
Parsing [sent. 15328 len. 38]: I should never have sought you out , madam , to say what I am going to say , but since you have sought me out and are here , I will throw it off my mind .
Parsing [sent. 15329 len. 39]: Was it quite consistent , in candour , with our taking that resolution against Mr Fledgeby , that you should afterwards address Mr Fledgeby as your dear and confidential friend , and entreat a favour of Mr Fledgeby ?
Parsing [sent. 15330 len. 28]: Always supposing that you did ; I assert no knowledge of my own on the subject ; it has been represented to me that you did . '
Parsing [sent. 15331 len. 7]: ` Then he told you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15332 len. 22]: retorts Mrs Lammle , who again has saved her eyes while listening , and uses them with strong effect while speaking .
Parsing [sent. 15333 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 15334 len. 21]: ` It is strange that he should have told you the truth , ' says Mrs Lammle , seriously pondering .
Parsing [sent. 15335 len. 12]: ` Pray where did a circumstance so very extraordinary happen ? '
Parsing [sent. 15336 len. 3]: Twemlow hesitates .
Parsing [sent. 15337 len. 45]: He is shorter than the lady as well as weaker , and , as she stands above him with her hardened manner and her well-used eyes , he finds himself at such a disadvantage that he would like to be of the opposite sex .
Parsing [sent. 15338 len. 11]: ` May I ask where it happened , Mr Twemlow ?
Parsing [sent. 15339 len. 6]: In strict confidence ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15340 len. 30]: I must confess , ' says the mild little gentleman , coming to his answer by degrees , ` that I felt some compunctions when Mr Fledgeby mentioned it .
Parsing [sent. 15341 len. 14]: I must admit that I could not regard myself in an agreeable light .
Parsing [sent. 15342 len. 37]: More particularly , as Mr Fledgeby did , with great civility , which I could not feel that I deserved from him , render me the same service that you had entreated him to render you .
Parsing [sent. 15343 len. 20]: It is a part of the true nobility of the poor gentleman 's soul to say this last sentence .
Parsing [sent. 15344 len. 29]: ` Otherwise , ' he has reffected , ' I shall assume the superior position of having no difficulties of my own , while I know of hers .
Parsing [sent. 15345 len. 8]: Which would be mean , very mean .
Parsing [sent. 15346 len. 16]: ` Was Mr Fledgeby 's advocacy as effectual in your case as in ours ? '
Parsing [sent. 15347 len. 4]: Mrs Lammle demands .
Parsing [sent. 15348 len. 5]: ` As ineffectual . '
Parsing [sent. 15349 len. 21]: ` Can you make up your mind to tell me where you saw Mr Fledgeby , Mr Twemlow ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15350 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 15351 len. 8]: I fully intended to have done so .
Parsing [sent. 15352 len. 6]: The reservation was not intentional .
Parsing [sent. 15353 len. 13]: I encountered Mr Fledgeby , quite by accident , on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 15354 len. 21]: -- By the expression , on the spot , I mean at Mr Riah 's in Saint Mary Axe . '
Parsing [sent. 15355 len. 15]: ` Have you the misfortune to be in Mr Riah 's hands then ? '
Parsing [sent. 15356 len. 53]: ` Unfortunately , madam , ' returns Twemlow , ` the one money obligation to which I stand committed , the one debt of my life -LRB- but it is a just debt ; pray observe that I do n't dispute it -RRB- , has fallen into Mr Riah 's hands . '
Parsing [sent. 15357 len. 40]: ` Mr Twemlow , ' says Mrs Lammle , fixing his eyes with hers : which he would prevent her doing if he could , but he ca n't ; ` it has fallen into Mr Fledgeby 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 15358 len. 6]: Mr Riah is his mask .
Parsing [sent. 15359 len. 9]: It has fallen into Mr Fledgeby 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 15360 len. 10]: Let me tell you that , for your guidance .
Parsing [sent. 15361 len. 32]: The information may be of use to you , if only to prevent your credulity , in judging another man 's truthfulness by your own , from being imposed upon . '
Parsing [sent. 15362 len. 4]: ` Impossible ! '
Parsing [sent. 15363 len. 6]: cries Twemlow , standing aghast .
Parsing [sent. 15364 len. 9]: ` How do you know it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15365 len. 8]: I scarcely know how I know it .
Parsing [sent. 15366 len. 19]: The whole train of circumstances seemed to take fire at once , and show it to me . '
Parsing [sent. 15367 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15368 len. 7]: Then you have no proof . '
Parsing [sent. 15369 len. 42]: ` It is very strange , ' says Mrs Lammle , coldly and boldly , and with some disdain , ` how like men are to one another in some things , though their characters are as different as can be !
Parsing [sent. 15370 len. 21]: No two men can have less affinity between them , one would say , than Mr Twemlow and my husband .
Parsing [sent. 15371 len. 26]: Yet my husband replies to me `` You have no proof , '' and Mr Twemlow replies to me with the very same words ! '
Parsing [sent. 15372 len. 7]: ` But why , madam ? '
Parsing [sent. 15373 len. 6]: Twemlow ventures gently to argue .
Parsing [sent. 15374 len. 8]: ` Consider why the very same words ?
Parsing [sent. 15375 len. 6]: Because they state the fact .
Parsing [sent. 15376 len. 7]: Because you HAVE no proof . '
Parsing [sent. 15377 len. 37]: ` Men are very wise in their way , ' quoth Mrs Lammle , glancing haughtily at the Snigsworth portrait , and shaking out her dress before departing ; ` but they have wisdom to learn .
Parsing [sent. 15378 len. 30]: My husband , who is not over-confiding , ingenuous , or inexperienced , sees this plain thing no more than Mr Twemlow does -- because there is no proof !
Parsing [sent. 15379 len. 22]: Yet I believe five women out of six , in my place , would see it as clearly as I do .
Parsing [sent. 15380 len. 27]: However , I will never rest -LRB- if only in remembrance of Mr Fledgeby 's having kissed my hand -RRB- until my husband does see it .
Parsing [sent. 15381 len. 27]: And you will do well for yourself to see it from this time forth , Mr Twemlow , though I CAN give you no proof . '
Parsing [sent. 15382 len. 31]: As she moves towards the door , Mr Twemlow , attending on her , expresses his soothing hope that the condition of Mr Lammle 's affairs is not irretrievable . '
Parsing [sent. 15383 len. 34]: I do n't know , ' Mrs Lammle answers , stopping , and sketching out the pattern of the paper on the wall with the point of her parasol ; ` it depends .
Parsing [sent. 15384 len. 16]: There may be an opening for him dawning now , or there may be none .
Parsing [sent. 15385 len. 6]: We shall soon find out .
Parsing [sent. 15386 len. 17]: If none , we are bankrupt here , and must go abroad , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 15387 len. 22]: Mr Twemlow , in his good-natured desire to make the best of it , remarks that there are pleasant lives abroad .
Parsing [sent. 15388 len. 45]: ` Yes , ' returns Mrs Lammle , still sketching on the wall ; ` but I doubt whether billiard-playing , card-playing , and so forth , for the means to live under suspicion at a dirty table-d'hote , is one of them . '
Parsing [sent. 15389 len. 48]: It is much for Mr Lammle , Twemlow politely intimates -LRB- though greatly shocked -RRB- , to have one always beside him who is attached to him in all his fortunes , and whose restraining influence will prevent him from courses that would be discreditable and ruinous .
Parsing [sent. 15390 len. 16]: As he says it , Mrs Lammle leaves off sketching , and looks at him .
Parsing [sent. 15391 len. 7]: ` Restraining influence , Mr Twemlow ?
Parsing [sent. 15392 len. 17]: We must eat and drink , and dress , and have a roof over our heads .
Parsing [sent. 15393 len. 10]: Always beside him and attached in all his fortunes ?
Parsing [sent. 15394 len. 17]: Not much to boast of in that ; what can a woman at my age do ?
Parsing [sent. 15395 len. 51]: My husband and I deceived one another when we married ; we must bear the consequences of the deception -- that is to say , bear one another , and bear the burden of scheming together for to-day 's dinner and to-morrow 's breakfast -- till death divorces us . '
Parsing [sent. 15396 len. 15]: With those words , she walks out into Duke Street , Saint James 's .
Parsing [sent. 15397 len. 55]: Mr Twemlow returning to his sofa , lays down his aching head on its slippery little horsehair bolster , with a strong internal conviction that a painful interview is not the kind of thing to be taken after the dinner pills which are so highly salutary in connexion with the pleasures of the table .
Parsing [sent. 15398 len. 36]: But , six o'clock in the evening finds the worthy little gentleman getting better , and also getting himself into his obsolete little silk stockings and pumps , for the wondering dinner at the Veneerings .
Parsing [sent. 15399 len. 26]: And seven o'clock in the evening finds him trotting out into Duke Street , to trot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach-hire .
Parsing [sent. 15400 len. 37]: Tippins the divine has dined herself into such a condition by this time , that a morbid mind might desire her , for a blessed change , to sup at last , and turn into bed .
Parsing [sent. 15401 len. 34]: Such a mind has Mr Eugene Wrayburn , whom Twemlow finds contemplating Tippins with the moodiest of visages , while that playful creature rallies him on being so long overdue at the woolsack .
Parsing [sent. 15402 len. 37]: Skittish is Tippins with Mortimer Lightwood too , and has raps to give him with her fan for having been best man at the nuptials of these deceiving what ' stheir-names who have gone to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 15403 len. 36]: Though , indeed , the fan is generally lively , and taps away at the men in all directions , with something of a grisly sound suggestive of the clattering of Lady Tippins 's bones .
Parsing [sent. 15404 len. 30]: A new race of intimate friends has sprung up at Veneering 's since he went into Parliament for the public good , to whom Mrs Veneering is very attentive .
Parsing [sent. 15405 len. 19]: These friends , like astronomical distances , are only to be spoken of in the very largest figures .
Parsing [sent. 15406 len. 29]: Boots says that one of them is a Contractor who -LRB- it has been calculated -RRB- gives employment , directly and indirectly , to five hundred thousand men .
Parsing [sent. 15407 len. 36]: Brewer says that another of them is a Chairman , in such request at so many Boards , so far apart , that he never travels less by railway than three thousand miles a week .
Parsing [sent. 15408 len. 71]: Buffer says that another of them had n't a sixpence eighteen months ago , and , through the brilliancy of his genius in getting those shares issued at eighty-five , and buying them all up with no money and selling them at par for cash , has now three hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds -- Buffer particularly insisting on the odd seventy-five , and declining to take a farthing less .
Parsing [sent. 15409 len. 50]: With Buffer , Boots , and Brewer , Lady Tippins is eminently facetious on the subject of these Fathers of the Scrip-Church : surveying them through her eyeglass , and inquiring whether Boots and Brewer and Buffer think they will make her fortune if she makes love to them ?
Parsing [sent. 15410 len. 7]: with other pleasantries of that nature .
Parsing [sent. 15411 len. 90]: Veneering , in his different way , is much occupied with the Fathers too , piously retiring with them into the conservatory , from which retreat the word ` Committee ' is occasionally heard , and where the Fathers instruct Veneering how he must leave the valley of the piano on his left , take the level of the mantelpiece , cross by an open cutting at the candelabra , seize the carrying-traffic at the console , and cut up the opposition root and branch at the window curtains .
Parsing [sent. 15412 len. 20]: Mr and Mrs Podsnap are of the company , and the Fathers descry in Mrs Podsnap a fine woman .
Parsing [sent. 15413 len. 80]: She is consigned to a Father -- Boots 's Father , who employs five hundred thousand men -- and is brought to anchor on Veneering 's left ; thus affording opportunity to the sportive Tippins on his right -LRB- he , as usual , being mere vacant space -RRB- , to entreat to be told something about those loves of Navvies , and whether they really do live on raw beefsteaks , and drink porter out of their barrows .
Parsing [sent. 15414 len. 29]: But , in spite of such little skirmishes it is felt that this was to be a wondering dinner , and that the wondering must not be neglected .
Parsing [sent. 15415 len. 24]: Accordingly , Brewer , as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain , becomes the interpreter of the general instinct . '
Parsing [sent. 15416 len. 26]: I took , ' says Brewer in a favourable pause , ' a cab this morning , and I rattled off to that Sale . '
Parsing [sent. 15417 len. 34]: Boots -LRB- devoured by envy -RRB- says , ` So did I. ' Buffer says , ` So did I ' ; but can find nobody to care whether he did or not .
Parsing [sent. 15418 len. 8]: ` And what was it like ? '
Parsing [sent. 15419 len. 4]: inquires Veneering . '
Parsing [sent. 15420 len. 39]: I assure you , ' replies Brewer , looking about for anybody else to address his answer to , and giving the preference to Lightwood ; ' I assure you , the things were going for a song .
Parsing [sent. 15421 len. 9]: Handsome things enough , but fetching nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 15422 len. 11]: ` So I heard this afternoon , ' says Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 15423 len. 40]: Brewer begs to know now , would it be fair to ask a professional man how -- on -- earth -- these -- people -- ever -- did -- come -- TO -- such -- A -- total smash ?
Parsing [sent. 15424 len. 9]: -LRB- Brewer 's divisions being for emphasis . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 15425 len. 39]: Lightwood replies that he was consulted certainly , but could give no opinion which would pay off the Bill of Sale , and therefore violates no confidence in supposing that it came of their living beyond their means .
Parsing [sent. 15426 len. 15]: ` But how , ' says Veneering , ` CAN people do that ! '
Parsing [sent. 15427 len. 2]: Hah !
Parsing [sent. 15428 len. 16]: That is felt on all hands to be a shot in the bull 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 15429 len. 6]: How CAN people do that !
Parsing [sent. 15430 len. 32]: The Analytical Chemist going round with champagne , looks very much as if HE could give them a pretty good idea how people did that , if he had a mind .
Parsing [sent. 15431 len. 65]: ` How , ' says Mrs Veneering , laying down her fork to press her aquiline hands together at the tips of the fingers , and addressing the Father who travels the three thousand miles per week : ` how a mother can look at her baby , and know that she lives beyond her husband 's means , I can not imagine . '
Parsing [sent. 15432 len. 18]: Eugene suggests that Mrs Lammle , not being a mother , had no baby to look at .
Parsing [sent. 15433 len. 17]: ` True , ' says Mrs Veneering , ` but the principle is the same . '
Parsing [sent. 15434 len. 10]: Boots is clear that the principle is the same .
Parsing [sent. 15435 len. 4]: So is Buffer .
Parsing [sent. 15436 len. 15]: It is the unfortunate destiny of Buffer to damage a cause by espousing it .
Parsing [sent. 15437 len. 38]: The rest of the company have meekly yielded to the proposition that the principle is the same , until Buffer says it is ; when instantly a general murmur arises that the principle is not the same .
Parsing [sent. 15438 len. 42]: ` But I do n't understand , ' says the Father of the three hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds , ' -- if these people spoken of , occupied the position of being in society -- they were in society ? '
Parsing [sent. 15439 len. 17]: Veneering is bound to confess that they dined here , and were even married from here .
Parsing [sent. 15440 len. 32]: ` Then I do n't understand , ' pursues the Father , ` how even their living beyond their means could bring them to what has been termed a total smash .
Parsing [sent. 15441 len. 26]: Because , there is always such a thing as an adjustment of affairs , in the case of people of any standing at all . '
Parsing [sent. 15442 len. 29]: Eugene -LRB- who would seem to be in a gloomy state of suggestiveness -RRB- , suggests , ` Suppose you have no means and live beyond them ? '
Parsing [sent. 15443 len. 14]: This is too insolvent a state of things for the Father to entertain .
Parsing [sent. 15444 len. 22]: It is too insolvent a state of things for any one with any self-respect to entertain , and is universally scouted .
Parsing [sent. 15445 len. 27]: But , it is so amazing how any people can have come to a total smash , that everybody feels bound to account for it specially .
Parsing [sent. 15446 len. 11]: One of the Fathers says , ` Gaming table . '
Parsing [sent. 15447 len. 17]: Another of the Fathers says , ` Speculated without knowing that speculation is a science . '
Parsing [sent. 15448 len. 6]: Boots says ` Horses . '
Parsing [sent. 15449 len. 12]: Lady Tippins says to her fan , ` Two establishments . '
Parsing [sent. 15450 len. 31]: Mr Podsnap , saying nothing , is referred to for his opinion ; which he delivers as follows ; much flushed and extremely angry : ` Do n't ask me .
Parsing [sent. 15451 len. 15]: I desire to take no part in the discussion of these people 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 15452 len. 5]: I abhor the subject .
Parsing [sent. 15453 len. 63]: It is an odious subject , an offensive subject , a subject that makes me sick , and I -- ' And with his favourite right-arm flourish which sweeps away everything and settles it for ever , Mr Podsnap sweeps these inconveniently unexplainable wretches who have lived beyond their means and gone to total smash , off the face of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 15454 len. 75]: Eugene , leaning back in his chair , is observing Mr Podsnap with an irreverent face , and may be about to offer a new suggestion , when the Analytical is beheld in collision with the Coachman ; the Coachman manifesting a purpose of coming at the company with a silver salver , as though intent upon making a collection for his wife and family ; the Analytical cutting him off at the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 15455 len. 37]: The superior stateliness , if not the superior generalship , of the Analytical prevails over a man who is as nothing off the box ; and the Coachman , yielding up his salver , retires defeated .
Parsing [sent. 15456 len. 45]: Then , the Analytical , perusing a scrap of paper lying on the salver , with the air of a literary Censor , adjusts it , takes his time about going to the table with it , and presents it to Mr Eugene Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 15457 len. 15]: Whereupon the pleasant Tippins says aloud , ` The Lord Chancellor has resigned ! '
Parsing [sent. 15458 len. 50]: With distracting coolness and slowness -- for he knows the curiosity of the Charmer to be always devouring -- Eugene makes a pretence of getting out an eyeglass , polishing it , and reading the paper with difficulty , long after he has seen what is written on it .
Parsing [sent. 15459 len. 16]: What is written on it in wet ink , is : ` Young Blight . '
Parsing [sent. 15460 len. 4]: ` Waiting ? '
Parsing [sent. 15461 len. 13]: says Eugene over his shoulder , in confidence , with the Analytical .
Parsing [sent. 15462 len. 11]: ` Waiting , ' returns the Analytical in responsive confidence .
Parsing [sent. 15463 len. 27]: Eugene looks ` Excuse me , ' towards Mrs Veneering , goes out , and finds Young Blight , Mortimer 's clerk , at the hall-door .
Parsing [sent. 15464 len. 48]: ` You told me to bring him , sir , to wherever you was , if he come while you was out and I was in , ' says that discreet young gentleman , standing on tiptoe to whisper ; ` and I 've brought him . '
Parsing [sent. 15465 len. 4]: ` Sharp boy .
Parsing [sent. 15466 len. 5]: Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 15467 len. 3]: asks Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 15468 len. 13]: ` He 's in a cab , sir , at the door .
Parsing [sent. 15469 len. 46]: I thought it best not to show him , you see , if it could be helped ; for he 's a-shaking all over , like -- Blight 's simile is perhaps inspired by the surrounding dishes of sweets -- ` like Glue Monge . '
Parsing [sent. 15470 len. 9]: ` Sharp boy again , ' returns Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 15471 len. 8]: ` I 'll go to him . '
Parsing [sent. 15472 len. 55]: Goes out straightway , and , leisurely leaning his arms on the open window of a cab in waiting , looks in at Mr Dolls : who has brought his own atmosphere with him , and would seem from its odour to have brought it , for convenience of carriage , in a rum-cask .
Parsing [sent. 15473 len. 8]: ` Now Dolls , wake up ! '
Parsing [sent. 15474 len. 4]: ` Mist Wrayburn ?
Parsing [sent. 15475 len. 2]: Drection !
Parsing [sent. 15476 len. 4]: Fifteen shillings ! '
Parsing [sent. 15477 len. 60]: After carefully reading the dingy scrap of paper handed to him , and as carefully tucking it into his waistcoat pocket , Eugene tells out the money ; beginning incautiously by telling the first shilling into Mr Dolls 's hand , which instantly jerks it out of window ; and ending by telling the fifteen shillings on the seat .
Parsing [sent. 15478 len. 21]: ` Give him a ride back to Charing Cross , sharp boy , and there get rid of him . '
Parsing [sent. 15479 len. 46]: Returning to the dining-room , and pausing for an instant behind the screen at the door , Eugene overhears , above the hum and clatter , the fair Tippins saying : ' I am dying to ask him what he was called out for ! '
Parsing [sent. 15480 len. 5]: ` Are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15481 len. 17]: mutters Eugene , ` then perhaps if you ca n't ask him , you 'll die .
Parsing [sent. 15482 len. 12]: So I 'll be a benefactor to society , and go .
Parsing [sent. 15483 len. 13]: A stroll and a cigar , and I can think this over .
Parsing [sent. 15484 len. 5]: Think this over . '
Parsing [sent. 15485 len. 24]: Thus , with a thoughtful face , he finds his hat and cloak , unseen of the Analytical , and goes his way .
Parsing [sent. 15486 len. 25]: BOOK THE FOURTH A TURNING Chapter 1 SETTING TRAPS Plashwater Weir Mill Lock looked tranquil and pretty on an evening in the summer time .
Parsing [sent. 15487 len. 32]: A soft air stirred the leaves of the fresh green trees , and passed like a smooth shadow over the river , and like a smoother shadow over the yielding grass .
Parsing [sent. 15488 len. 50]: The voice of the falling water , like the voices of the sea and the wind , were as an outer memory to a contemplative listener ; but not particularly so to Mr Riderhood , who sat on one of the blunt wooden levers of his lock-gates , dozing .
Parsing [sent. 15489 len. 39]: Wine must be got into a butt by some agency before it can be drawn out ; and the wine of sentiment never having been got into Mr Riderhood by any agency , nothing in nature tapped him .
Parsing [sent. 15490 len. 44]: As the Rogue sat , ever and again nodding himself off his balance , his recovery was always attended by an angry stare and growl , as if , in the absence of any one else , he had aggressive inclinations towards himself .
Parsing [sent. 15491 len. 13]: In one of these starts the cry of ` Lock , ho !
Parsing [sent. 15492 len. 3]: Lock ! '
Parsing [sent. 15493 len. 7]: prevented his relapse into a doze .
Parsing [sent. 15494 len. 34]: Shaking himself as he got up like the surly brute he was , he gave his growl a responsive twist at the end , and turned his face down-stream to see who hailed .
Parsing [sent. 15495 len. 62]: It was an amateur-sculler , well up to his work though taking it easily , in so light a boat that the Rogue remarked : ' A little less on you , and you 'd a ` most ha ' been a Wagerbut ' ; then went to work at his windlass handles and sluices , to let the sculler in .
Parsing [sent. 15496 len. 56]: As the latter stood in his boat , holding on by the boat-hook to the woodwork at the lock side , waiting for the gates to open , Rogue Riderhood recognized his ` T'other governor , ' Mr Eugene Wrayburn ; who was , however , too indifferent or too much engaged to recognize him .
Parsing [sent. 15497 len. 59]: The creaking lock-gates opened slowly , and the light boat passed in as soon as there was room enough , and the creaking lock-gates closed upon it , and it floated low down in the dock between the two sets of gates , until the water should rise and the second gates should open and let it out .
Parsing [sent. 15498 len. 51]: When Riderhood had run to his second windlass and turned it , and while he leaned against the lever of that gate to help it to swing open presently , he noticed , lying to rest under the green hedge by the towing-path astern of the Lock , a Bargeman .
Parsing [sent. 15499 len. 48]: The water rose and rose as the sluice poured in , dispersing the scum which had formed behind the lumbering gates , and sending the boat up , so that the sculler gradually rose like an apparition against the light from the bargeman 's point of view .
Parsing [sent. 15500 len. 25]: Riderhood observed that the bargeman rose too , leaning on his arm , and seemed to have his eyes fastened on the rising figure .
Parsing [sent. 15501 len. 19]: But , there was the toll to be taken , as the gates were now complaining and opening .
Parsing [sent. 15502 len. 24]: The T'other governor tossed it ashore , twisted in a piece of paper , and as he did so , knew his man .
Parsing [sent. 15503 len. 5]: ` Ay , ay ?
Parsing [sent. 15504 len. 11]: It 's you , is it , honest friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 15505 len. 11]: said Eugene , seating himself preparatory to resuming his sculls .
Parsing [sent. 15506 len. 10]: ` You got the place , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15507 len. 25]: I got the place , and no thanks to you for it , nor yet none to Lawyer Lightwood , ' gruffly answered Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15508 len. 32]: ` We saved our recommendation , honest fellow , ' said Eugene , ` for the next candidate -- the one who will offer himself when you are transported or hanged .
Parsing [sent. 15509 len. 14]: Do n't be long about it ; will you be so good ? '
Parsing [sent. 15510 len. 77]: So imperturbable was the air with which he gravely bent to his work that Riderhood remained staring at him , without having found a retort , until he had rowed past a line of wooden objects by the weir , which showed like huge teetotums standing at rest in the water , and was almost hidden by the drooping boughs on the left bank , as he rowed away , keeping out of the opposing current .
Parsing [sent. 15511 len. 33]: It being then too late to retort with any effect -- if that could ever have been done -- the honest man confined himself to cursing and growling in a grim under-tone .
Parsing [sent. 15512 len. 22]: Having then got his gates shut , he crossed back by his plank lock-bridge to the towing-path side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 15513 len. 20]: If , in so doing , he took another glance at the bargeman , he did it by stealth .
Parsing [sent. 15514 len. 36]: He cast himself on the grass by the Lock side , in an indolent way , with his back in that direction , and , having gathered a few blades , fell to chewing them .
Parsing [sent. 15515 len. 36]: The dip of Eugene Wrayburn 's sculls had become hardly audible in his ears when the bargeman passed him , putting the utmost width that he could between them , and keeping under the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 15516 len. 25]: Then , Riderhood sat up and took a long look at his figure , and then cried : ` Hi -- I -- i !
Parsing [sent. 15517 len. 4]: Lock , ho !
Parsing [sent. 15518 len. 2]: Lock !
Parsing [sent. 15519 len. 6]: Plashwater Weir Mill Lock ! '
Parsing [sent. 15520 len. 8]: The bargeman stopped , and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 15521 len. 20]: ` Plashwater Weir Mill Lock , T'otherest gov -- er -- nor -- or -- or -- or ! '
Parsing [sent. 15522 len. 11]: cried Mr Riderhood , with his hands to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 15523 len. 5]: The bargeman turned back .
Parsing [sent. 15524 len. 17]: Approaching nearer and nearer , the bargeman became Bradley Headstone , in rough water-side secondhand clothing .
Parsing [sent. 15525 len. 40]: ` Wish I may die , ' said Riderhood , smiting his right leg , and laughing , as he sat on the grass , ` if you ai n't ha ' been a imitating me , T'otherest governor !
Parsing [sent. 15526 len. 8]: Never thought myself so good-looking afore ! '
Parsing [sent. 15527 len. 25]: Truly , Bradley Headstone had taken careful note of the honest man 's dress in the course of that night-walk they had had together .
Parsing [sent. 15528 len. 15]: He must have committed it to memory , and slowly got it by heart .
Parsing [sent. 15529 len. 11]: It was exactly reproduced in the dress he now wore .
Parsing [sent. 15530 len. 44]: And whereas , in his own schoolmaster clothes , he usually looked as if they were the clothes of some other man , he now looked , in the clothes of some other man or men , as if they were his own .
Parsing [sent. 15531 len. 6]: ` THIS your Lock ? '
Parsing [sent. 15532 len. 29]: said Bradley , whose surprise had a genuine air ; ` they told me , where I last inquired , it was the third I should come to .
Parsing [sent. 15533 len. 7]: This is only the second . '
Parsing [sent. 15534 len. 31]: ` It 's my belief , governor , ' returned Riderhood , with a wink and shake of his head , ` that you 've dropped one in your counting .
Parsing [sent. 15535 len. 13]: It ai n't Locks as YOU 'VE been giving your mind to .
Parsing [sent. 15536 len. 5]: No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 15537 len. 33]: As he expressively jerked his pointing finger in the direction the boat had taken , a flush of impatience mounted into Bradley 's face , and he looked anxiously up the river .
Parsing [sent. 15538 len. 26]: ` It ai n't Locks as YOU 'VE been a reckoning up , ' said Riderhood , when the schoolmaster 's eyes came back again .
Parsing [sent. 15539 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 15540 len. 13]: ` What other calculations do you suppose I have been occupied with ?
Parsing [sent. 15541 len. 4]: Mathematics ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15542 len. 7]: I never heerd it called that .
Parsing [sent. 15543 len. 8]: It 's a long word for it .
Parsing [sent. 15544 len. 21]: Hows ` ever , p ` raps you call it so , ' said Riderhood , stubbornly chewing his grass .
Parsing [sent. 15545 len. 3]: ` It .
Parsing [sent. 15546 len. 3]: What ? '
Parsing [sent. 15547 len. 21]: ` I 'll say them , instead of it , if you like , ' was the coolly growled reply .
Parsing [sent. 15548 len. 8]: ` It 's safer talk too . '
Parsing [sent. 15549 len. 13]: ` What do you mean that I should understand by them ? '
Parsing [sent. 15550 len. 21]: ` Spites , affronts , offences giv ' and took , deadly aggrawations , such like , ' answered Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15551 len. 36]: Do what Bradley Headstone would , he could not keep that former flush of impatience out of his face , or so master his eyes as to prevent their again looking anxiously up the river .
Parsing [sent. 15552 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 15553 len. 11]: Do n't be afeerd , T'otherest , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15554 len. 18]: ` The T'other 's got to make way agin the stream , and he takes it easy .
Parsing [sent. 15555 len. 8]: You can soon come up with him .
Parsing [sent. 15556 len. 11]: But wot 's the good of saying that to you !
Parsing [sent. 15557 len. 33]: YOU know how fur you could have outwalked him betwixt anywheres about where he lost the tide -- say Richmond -- and this , if you had a mind to it . '
Parsing [sent. 15558 len. 10]: ` You think I have been following him ? '
Parsing [sent. 15559 len. 4]: said Bradley . '
Parsing [sent. 15560 len. 9]: I KNOW you have , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15561 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 15562 len. 10]: I have , I have , ' Bradley admitted .
Parsing [sent. 15563 len. 18]: ` But , ' with another anxious look up the river , ` he may land . '
Parsing [sent. 15564 len. 4]: ` Easy you !
Parsing [sent. 15565 len. 14]: He wo n't be lost if he does land , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15566 len. 9]: ` He must leave his boat behind him .
Parsing [sent. 15567 len. 23]: He ca n't make a bundle or a parcel on it , and carry it ashore with him under his arm . '
Parsing [sent. 15568 len. 24]: ` He was speaking to you just now , ' said Bradley , kneeling on one knee on the grass beside the Lock-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 15569 len. 7]: ` What did he say ? '
Parsing [sent. 15570 len. 7]: ` Cheek , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15571 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 15572 len. 19]: ` Cheek , ' repeated Riderhood , with an angry oath ; ` cheek is what he said .
Parsing [sent. 15573 len. 8]: He ca n't say nothing but cheek .
Parsing [sent. 15574 len. 26]: I 'd ha ' liked to plump down aboard of him , neck and crop , with a heavy jump , and sunk him . '
Parsing [sent. 15575 len. 27]: Bradley turned away his haggard face for a few moments , and then said , tearing up a tuft of grass : ` Damn him ! '
Parsing [sent. 15576 len. 4]: ` Hooroar ! '
Parsing [sent. 15577 len. 3]: cried Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15578 len. 5]: ` Does you credit !
Parsing [sent. 15579 len. 2]: Hooroar !
Parsing [sent. 15580 len. 8]: I cry chorus to the T'otherest . '
Parsing [sent. 15581 len. 29]: ` What turn , ' said Bradley , with an effort at self-repression that forced him to wipe his face , ` did his insolence take to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 15582 len. 27]: ` It took the turn , ' answered Riderhood , with sullen ferocity , ` of hoping as I was getting ready to be hanged . '
Parsing [sent. 15583 len. 11]: ` Let him look to that , ' cried Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 15584 len. 7]: ` Let him look to that !
Parsing [sent. 15585 len. 25]: It will be bad for him when men he has injured , and at whom he has jeered , are thinking of getting hanged .
Parsing [sent. 15586 len. 13]: Let HIM get ready for HIS fate , when that comes about .
Parsing [sent. 15587 len. 25]: There was more meaning in what he said than he knew of , or he would n't have had brains enough to say it .
Parsing [sent. 15588 len. 12]: Let him look to it ; let him look to it !
Parsing [sent. 15589 len. 28]: When men he has wronged , and on whom he has bestowed his insolence , are getting ready to be hanged , there is a death-bell ringing .
Parsing [sent. 15590 len. 6]: And not for them . '
Parsing [sent. 15591 len. 28]: Riderhood , looking fixedly at him , gradually arose from his recumbent posture while the schoolmaster said these words with the utmost concentration of rage and hatred .
Parsing [sent. 15592 len. 28]: So , when the words were all spoken , he too kneeled on one knee on the grass , and the two men looked at one another .
Parsing [sent. 15593 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 15594 len. 14]: said Riderhood , very deliberately spitting out the grass he had been chewing .
Parsing [sent. 15595 len. 17]: ` Then , I make out , T'otherest , as he is a-going to her ? '
Parsing [sent. 15596 len. 12]: ` He left London , ' answered Bradley , ` yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 15597 len. 19]: I have hardly a doubt , this time , that at last he is going to her . '
Parsing [sent. 15598 len. 10]: ` You ai n't sure , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15599 len. 40]: I am as sure here , ' said Bradley , with a clutch at the breast of his coarse shirt , ` as if it was written there ; ' with a blow or a stab at the sky .
Parsing [sent. 15600 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 15601 len. 40]: But judging from the looks on you , ' retorted Riderhood , completely ridding himself of his grass , and drawing his sleeve across his mouth , ` you 've made ekally sure afore , and have got disapinted .
Parsing [sent. 15602 len. 7]: It has told upon you . '
Parsing [sent. 15603 len. 24]: ` Listen , ' said Bradley , in a low voice , bending forward to lay his hand upon the Lock-keeper 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 15604 len. 7]: ` These are my holidays . '
Parsing [sent. 15605 len. 8]: ` Are they , by George ! '
Parsing [sent. 15606 len. 11]: muttered Riderhood , with his eyes on the passion-wasted face .
Parsing [sent. 15607 len. 17]: ` Your working days must be stiff ` uns , if these is your holidays . '
Parsing [sent. 15608 len. 26]: ` And I have never left him , ' pursued Bradley , waving the interruption aside with an impatient hand , ` since they began .
Parsing [sent. 15609 len. 17]: And I never will leave him now , till I have seen him with her . '
Parsing [sent. 15610 len. 11]: ` And when you have seen him with her ? '
Parsing [sent. 15611 len. 4]: said Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 15612 len. 9]: -- I 'll come back to you . '
Parsing [sent. 15613 len. 22]: Riderhood stiffened the knee on which he had been resting , got up , and looked gloomily at his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 15614 len. 74]: After a few moments they walked side by side in the direction the boat had taken , as if by tacit consent ; Bradley pressing forward , and Riderhood holding back ; Bradley getting out his neat prim purse into his hand -LRB- a present made him by penny subscription among his pupils -RRB- ; and Riderhood , unfolding his arms to smear his coat-cuff across his mouth with a thoughtful air . '
Parsing [sent. 15615 len. 11]: I have a pound for you , ' said Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 15616 len. 9]: ` You 've two , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15617 len. 8]: Bradley held a sovereign between his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 15618 len. 27]: Slouching at his side with his eyes upon the towing-path , Riderhood held his left hand open , with a certain slight drawing action towards himself .
Parsing [sent. 15619 len. 33]: Bradley dipped in his purse for another sovereign , and two chinked in Riderhood 's hand , the drawing action of which , promptly strengthening , drew them home to his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 15620 len. 13]: ` Now , I must follow him , ' said Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 15621 len. 9]: ` He takes this river-road -- the fool !
Parsing [sent. 15622 len. 16]: -- to confuse observation , or divert attention , if not solely to baffle me .
Parsing [sent. 15623 len. 18]: But he must have the power of making himself invisible before he can shake Me off . '
Parsing [sent. 15624 len. 3]: Riderhood stopped .
Parsing [sent. 15625 len. 26]: ` If you do n't get disapinted agin , T'otherest , maybe you 'll put up at the Lock-house when you come back ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15626 len. 4]: I will . '
Parsing [sent. 15627 len. 31]: Riderhood nodded , and the figure of the bargeman went its way along the soft turf by the side of the towing-path , keeping near the hedge and moving quickly .
Parsing [sent. 15628 len. 15]: They had turned a point from which a long stretch of river was visible .
Parsing [sent. 15629 len. 34]: A stranger to the scene might have been certain that here and there along the line of hedge a figure stood , watching the bargeman , and waiting for him to come up .
Parsing [sent. 15630 len. 33]: So he himself had often believed at first , until his eyes became used to the posts , bearing the dagger that slew Wat Tyler , in the City of London shield .
Parsing [sent. 15631 len. 11]: Within Mr Riderhood 's knowledge all daggers were as one .
Parsing [sent. 15632 len. 54]: Even to Bradley Headstone , who could have told to the letter without book all about Wat Tyler , Lord Mayor Walworth , and the King , that it is dutiful for youth to know , there was but one subject living in the world for every sharp destructive instrument that summer evening .
Parsing [sent. 15633 len. 38]: So , Riderhood looking after him as he went , and he with his furtive hand laid upon the dagger as he passed it , and his eyes upon the boat , were much upon a par .
Parsing [sent. 15634 len. 19]: The boat went on , under the arching trees , and over their tranquil shadows in the water .
Parsing [sent. 15635 len. 16]: The bargeman skulking on the opposite bank of the stream , went on after it .
Parsing [sent. 15636 len. 34]: Sparkles of light showed Riderhood when and where the rower dipped his blades , until , even as he stood idly watching , the sun went down and the landscape was dyed red .
Parsing [sent. 15637 len. 29]: And then the red had the appearance of fading out of it and mounting up to Heaven , as we say that blood , guiltily shed , does .
Parsing [sent. 15638 len. 36]: Turning back towards his Lock -LRB- he had not gone out of view of it -RRB- , the Rogue pondered as deeply as it was within the contracted power of such a fellow to do .
Parsing [sent. 15639 len. 8]: ` Why did he copy my clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 15640 len. 16]: He could have looked like what he wanted to look like , without that . '
Parsing [sent. 15641 len. 42]: This was the subject-matter in his thoughts ; in which , too , there came lumbering up , by times , like any half floating and half sinking rubbish in the river , the question , Was it done by accident ?
Parsing [sent. 15642 len. 33]: The setting of a trap for finding out whether it was accidentally done , soon superseded , as a practical piece of cunning , the abstruser inquiry why otherwise it was done .
Parsing [sent. 15643 len. 6]: And he devised a means .
Parsing [sent. 15644 len. 23]: Rogue Riderhood went into his Lock-house , and brought forth , into the now sober grey light , his chest of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 15645 len. 37]: Sitting on the grass beside it , he turned out , one by one , the articles it contained , until he came to a conspicuous bright red neckerchief stained black here and there by wear .
Parsing [sent. 15646 len. 39]: It arrested his attention , and he sat pausing over it , until he took off the rusty colourless wisp that he wore round his throat , and substituted the red neckerchief , leaving the long ends flowing .
Parsing [sent. 15647 len. 35]: ` Now , ' said the Rogue , ` if arter he sees me in this neckhankecher , I see him in a sim ` lar neckhankecher , it wo n't be accident ! '
Parsing [sent. 15648 len. 16]: Elated by his device , he carried his chest in again and went to supper .
Parsing [sent. 15649 len. 4]: ` Lock ho !
Parsing [sent. 15650 len. 3]: Lock ! '
Parsing [sent. 15651 len. 19]: It was a light night , and a barge coming down summoned him out of a long doze .
Parsing [sent. 15652 len. 37]: In due course he had let the barge through and was alone again , looking to the closing of his gates , when Bradley Headstone appeared before him , standing on the brink of the Lock .
Parsing [sent. 15653 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 15654 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15655 len. 9]: ` Back a ' ready , T'otherest ? '
Parsing [sent. 15656 len. 23]: ` He has put up for the night , at an Angler 's Inn , ' was the fatigued and hoarse reply .
Parsing [sent. 15657 len. 15]: ` He goes on , up the river , at six in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 15658 len. 13]: I have come back for a couple of hours ' rest . '
Parsing [sent. 15659 len. 19]: ` You want 'em , ' said Riderhood , making towards the schoolmaster by his plank bridge . '
Parsing [sent. 15660 len. 31]: I do n't want them , ' returned Bradley , irritably , ` because I would rather not have them , but would much prefer to follow him all night .
Parsing [sent. 15661 len. 13]: However , if he wo n't lead , I ca n't follow .
Parsing [sent. 15662 len. 37]: I have been waiting about , until I could discover , for a certainty , at what time he starts ; if I could n't have made sure of it , I should have stayed there .
Parsing [sent. 15663 len. 19]: -- This would be a bad pit for a man to be flung into with his hands tied .
Parsing [sent. 15664 len. 10]: These slippery smooth walls would give him no chance .
Parsing [sent. 15665 len. 11]: And I suppose those gates would suck him down ? '
Parsing [sent. 15666 len. 20]: ` Suck him down , or swaller him up , he would n't get out , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15667 len. 15]: ` Not even , if his hands war n't tied , he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 15668 len. 28]: Shut him in at both ends , and I 'd give him a pint o ' old ale ever to come up to me standing here . '
Parsing [sent. 15669 len. 8]: Bradley looked down with a ghastly relish .
Parsing [sent. 15670 len. 31]: ` You run about the brink , and run across it , in this uncertain light , on a few inches width of rotten wood , ' said he . '
Parsing [sent. 15671 len. 12]: I wonder you have no thought of being drowned . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15672 len. 6]: I ca n't be ! '
Parsing [sent. 15673 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15674 len. 8]: ` You ca n't be drowned ? '
Parsing [sent. 15675 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 15676 len. 19]: said Riderhood , shaking his head with an air of thorough conviction , ` it 's well known .
Parsing [sent. 15677 len. 16]: I 've been brought out o ' drowning , and I ca n't be drowned .
Parsing [sent. 15678 len. 28]: I would n't have that there busted B'lowbridger aware on it , or her people might make it tell agin ' the damages I mean to get .
Parsing [sent. 15679 len. 27]: But it 's well known to water-side characters like myself , that him as has been brought out o drowning , can never be drowned . '
Parsing [sent. 15680 len. 36]: Bradley smiled sourly at the ignorance he would have corrected in one of his pupils , and continued to look down into the water , as if the place had a gloomy fascination for him .
Parsing [sent. 15681 len. 11]: ` You seem to like it , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15682 len. 19]: He took no notice , but stood looking down , as if he had not heard the words .
Parsing [sent. 15683 len. 21]: There was a very dark expression on his face ; an expression that the Rogue found it hard to understand .
Parsing [sent. 15684 len. 23]: It was fierce , and full of purpose ; but the purpose might have been as much against himself as against another .
Parsing [sent. 15685 len. 29]: If he had stepped back for a spring , taken a leap , and thrown himself in , it would have been no surprising sequel to the look .
Parsing [sent. 15686 len. 21]: Perhaps his troubled soul , set upon some violence , did hover for the moment between that violence and another .
Parsing [sent. 15687 len. 37]: ` Did n't you say , ' asked Riderhood , after watching him for a while with a sidelong glance , ` as you had come back for a couple o ' hours ' rest ? '
Parsing [sent. 15688 len. 16]: But , even then he had to jog him with his elbow before he answered .
Parsing [sent. 15689 len. 3]: ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 15690 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 15691 len. 18]: ` Had n't you better come in and take your couple o ' hours ' rest ? '
Parsing [sent. 15692 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 15693 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 15694 len. 44]: With the look of one just awakened , he followed Riderhood into the Lock-house , where the latter produced from a cupboard some cold salt beef and half a loaf , some gin in a bottle , and some water in a jug .
Parsing [sent. 15695 len. 14]: The last he brought in , cool and dripping , from the river .
Parsing [sent. 15696 len. 19]: ` There , T'otherest , ' said Riderhood , stooping over him to put it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 15697 len. 18]: ` You 'd better take a bite and a sup , afore you takes your snooze . '
Parsing [sent. 15698 len. 13]: The draggling ends of the red neckerchief caught the schoolmaster 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 15699 len. 7]: Riderhood saw him look at it .
Parsing [sent. 15700 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 15701 len. 4]: thought that worthy .
Parsing [sent. 15702 len. 9]: ` You 're a-taking notice , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 15703 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 15704 len. 11]: You shall have a good squint at it then . '
Parsing [sent. 15705 len. 31]: With which reflection he sat down on the other side of the table , threw open his vest , and made a pretence of re-tying the neckerchief with much deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 15706 len. 5]: Bradley ate and drank .
Parsing [sent. 15707 len. 39]: As he sat at his platter and mug , Riderhood saw him , again and yet again , steal a look at the neckerchief , as if he were correcting his slow observation and prompting his sluggish memory .
Parsing [sent. 15708 len. 27]: ` When you 're ready for your snooze , ' said that honest creature , ` chuck yourself on my bed in the corner , T'otherest .
Parsing [sent. 15709 len. 8]: It 'll be broad day afore three .
Parsing [sent. 15710 len. 8]: I 'll call you early . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15711 len. 10]: I shall require no calling , ' answered Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 15712 len. 17]: And soon afterwards , divesting himself only of his shoes and coat , laid himself down .
Parsing [sent. 15713 len. 47]: Riderhood , leaning back in his wooden arm-chair with his arms folded on his breast , looked at him lying with his right hand clenched in his sleep and his teeth set , until a film came over his own sight , and he slept too .
Parsing [sent. 15714 len. 66]: He awoke to find that it was daylight , and that his visitor was already astir , and going out to the riverside to cool his head : -- ` Though I 'm blest , ' muttered Riderhood at the Lock-house door , looking after him , ` if I think there 's water enough in all the Thames to do THAT for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15715 len. 23]: Within five minutes he had taken his departure , and was passing on into the calm distance as he had passed yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 15716 len. 14]: Riderhood knew when a fish leaped , by his starting and glancing round .
Parsing [sent. 15717 len. 4]: ` Lock ho !
Parsing [sent. 15718 len. 3]: Lock ! '
Parsing [sent. 15719 len. 10]: at intervals all day , and ` Lock ho !
Parsing [sent. 15720 len. 3]: Lock ! '
Parsing [sent. 15721 len. 12]: thrice in the ensuing night , but no return of Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 15722 len. 8]: The second day was sultry and oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 15723 len. 33]: In the afternoon , a thunderstorm came up , and had but newly broken into a furious sweep of rain when he rushed in at the door , like the storm itself .
Parsing [sent. 15724 len. 9]: ` You 've seen him with her ! '
Parsing [sent. 15725 len. 7]: exclaimed Riderhood , starting up . '
Parsing [sent. 15726 len. 4]: I have . '
Parsing [sent. 15727 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 15728 len. 7]: ` At his journey 's end .
Parsing [sent. 15729 len. 9]: His boat 's hauled up for three days .
Parsing [sent. 15730 len. 7]: I heard him give the order .
Parsing [sent. 15731 len. 12]: Then , I saw him wait for her and meet her .
Parsing [sent. 15732 len. 30]: I saw them ' -- he stopped as though he were suffocating , and began again -- ' I saw them walking side by side , last night . '
Parsing [sent. 15733 len. 7]: ` What did you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 15734 len. 4]: ` Nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 15735 len. 9]: ` What are you going to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 15736 len. 9]: He dropped into a chair , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 15737 len. 13]: Immediately afterwards , a great spirt of blood burst from his nose .
Parsing [sent. 15738 len. 7]: ` How does that happen ? '
Parsing [sent. 15739 len. 4]: asked Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 15740 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 15741 len. 7]: I ca n't keep it back .
Parsing [sent. 15742 len. 23]: It has happened twice -- three times -- four times -- I do n't know how many times -- since last night .
Parsing [sent. 15743 len. 23]: I taste it , smell it , see it , it chokes me , and then it breaks out like this . '
Parsing [sent. 15744 len. 35]: He went into the pelting rain again with his head bare , and , bending low over the river , and scooping up the water with his two hands , washed the blood away .
Parsing [sent. 15745 len. 27]: All beyond his figure , as Riderhood looked from the door , was a vast dark curtain in solemn movement towards one quarter of the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 15746 len. 34]: He raised his head and came back , wet from head to foot , but with the lower parts of his sleeves , where he had dipped into the river , streaming water .
Parsing [sent. 15747 len. 13]: ` Your face is like a ghost 's , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 15748 len. 9]: ` Did you ever see a ghost ? '
Parsing [sent. 15749 len. 6]: was the sullen retort . '
Parsing [sent. 15750 len. 12]: I mean to say , you 're quite wore out . '
Parsing [sent. 15751 len. 6]: ` That may well be .
Parsing [sent. 15752 len. 10]: I have had no rest since I left here .
Parsing [sent. 15753 len. 18]: I do n't remember that I have so much as sat down since I left here . '
Parsing [sent. 15754 len. 12]: ` Lie down now , then , ' said Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 15755 len. 16]: I will , if you 'll give me something to quench my thirst first . '
Parsing [sent. 15756 len. 25]: The bottle and jug were again produced , and he mixed a weak draught , and another , and drank both in quick succession .
Parsing [sent. 15757 len. 11]: ` You asked me something , ' he said then .
Parsing [sent. 15758 len. 12]: ` No , I did n't , ' replied Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 15759 len. 36]: I tell you , ' retorted Bradley , turning upon him in a wild and desperate manner , ` you asked me something , before I went out to wash my face in the river .
Parsing [sent. 15760 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15761 len. 3]: Then ? '
Parsing [sent. 15762 len. 8]: said Riderhood , backing a little . '
Parsing [sent. 15763 len. 11]: I asked you wot you wos a-going to do . '
Parsing [sent. 15764 len. 11]: ` How can a man in this state know ? '
Parsing [sent. 15765 len. 35]: he answered , protesting with both his tremulous hands , with an action so vigorously angry that he shook the water from his sleeves upon the floor , as if he had wrung them .
Parsing [sent. 15766 len. 14]: ` How can I plan anything , if I have n't sleep ? '
Parsing [sent. 15767 len. 17]: ` Why , that 's what I as good as said , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 15768 len. 9]: ` Did n't I say lie down ? '
Parsing [sent. 15769 len. 8]: ` Well , perhaps you did . '
Parsing [sent. 15770 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 15771 len. 6]: Anyways I says it again .
Parsing [sent. 15772 len. 27]: Sleep where you slept last ; the sounder and longer you can sleep , the better you 'll know arterwards what you 're up to . '
Parsing [sent. 15773 len. 23]: His pointing to the truckle bed in the corner , seemed gradually to bring that poor couch to Bradley 's wandering remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 15774 len. 23]: He slipped off his worn down-trodden shoes , and cast himself heavily , all wet as he was , upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 15775 len. 23]: Riderhood sat down in his wooden arm-chair , and looked through the window at the lightning , and listened to the thunder .
Parsing [sent. 15776 len. 34]: But , his thoughts were far from being absorbed by the thunder and the lightning , for again and again and again he looked very curiously at the exhausted man upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 15777 len. 29]: The man had turned up the collar of the rough coat he wore , to shelter himself from the storm , and had buttoned it about his neck .
Parsing [sent. 15778 len. 52]: Unconscious of that , and of most things , he had left the coat so , both when he had laved his face in the river , and when he had cast himself upon the bed ; though it would have been much easier to him if he had unloosened it .
Parsing [sent. 15779 len. 35]: The thunder rolled heavily , and the forked lightning seemed to make jagged rents in every part of the vast curtain without , as Riderhood sat by the window , glancing at the bed .
Parsing [sent. 15780 len. 49]: Sometimes , he saw the man upon the bed , by a red light ; sometimes , by a blue ; sometimes , he scarcely saw him in the darkness of the storm ; sometimes he saw nothing of him in the blinding glare of palpitating white fire .
Parsing [sent. 15781 len. 58]: Anon , the rain would come again with a tremendous rush , and the river would seem to rise to meet it , and a blast of wind , bursting upon the door , would flutter the hair and dress of the man , as if invisible messengers were come around the bed to carry him away .
Parsing [sent. 15782 len. 34]: From all these phases of the storm , Riderhood would turn , as if they were interruptions -- rather striking interruptions possibly , but interruptions still -- of his scrutiny of the sleeper .
Parsing [sent. 15783 len. 50]: ` He sleeps sound , ' he said within himself ; ` yet he 's that up to me and that noticing of me that my getting out of my chair may wake him , when a rattling peal wo n't ; let alone my touching of him . '
Parsing [sent. 15784 len. 8]: He very cautiously rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 15785 len. 21]: ` T'otherest , ' he said , in a low , calm voice , ` are you a lying easy ?
Parsing [sent. 15786 len. 10]: There 's a chill in the air , governor .
Parsing [sent. 15787 len. 9]: Shall I put a coat over you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15788 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 15789 len. 37]: ` That 's about what it is a ` ready , you see , ' muttered Riderhood in a lower and a different voice ; ' a coat over you , a coat over you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15790 len. 24]: The sleeper moving an arm , he sat down again in his chair , and feigned to watch the storm from the window .
Parsing [sent. 15791 len. 33]: It was a grand spectacle , but not so grand as to keep his eyes , for half a minute together , from stealing a look at the man upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 15792 len. 34]: It was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that Riderhood so often looked so curiously , until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor of the dead-tired in mind and body .
Parsing [sent. 15793 len. 15]: Then , Riderhood came from the window cautiously , and stood by the bed .
Parsing [sent. 15794 len. 5]: ` Poor man ! '
Parsing [sent. 15795 len. 41]: he murmured in a low tone , with a crafty face , and a very watchful eye and ready foot , lest he should start up ; ` this here coat of his must make him uneasy in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 15796 len. 13]: Shall I loosen it for him , and make him more comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 15797 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 15798 len. 11]: I think I ought to do it , poor man .
Parsing [sent. 15799 len. 6]: I think I will . '
Parsing [sent. 15800 len. 16]: He touched the first button with a very cautious hand , and a step backward .
Parsing [sent. 15801 len. 29]: But , the sleeper remaining in profound unconsciousness , he touched the other buttons with a more assured hand , and perhaps the more lightly on that account .
Parsing [sent. 15802 len. 13]: Softly and slowly , he opened the coat and drew it back .
Parsing [sent. 15803 len. 40]: The draggling ends of a bright-red neckerchief were then disclosed , and he had even been at the pains of dipping parts of it in some liquid , to give it the appearance of having become stained by wear .
Parsing [sent. 15804 len. 49]: With a much-perplexed face , Riderhood looked from it to the sleeper , and from the sleeper to it , and finally crept back to his chair , and there , with his hand to his chin , sat long in a brown study , looking at both .
Parsing [sent. 15805 len. 22]: Chapter 2 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN RISES A LITTLE Mr and Mrs Lammle had come to breakfast with Mr and Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15806 len. 37]: They were not absolutely uninvited , but had pressed themselves with so much urgency on the golden couple , that evasion of the honour and pleasure of their company would have been difficult , if desired .
Parsing [sent. 15807 len. 29]: They were in a charming state of mind , were Mr and Mrs Lammle , and almost as fond of Mr and Mrs Boffin as of one another .
Parsing [sent. 15808 len. 30]: ` My dear Mrs Boffin , ' said Mrs Lammle , ` it imparts new life to me , to see my Alfred in confidential communication with Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15809 len. 8]: The two were formed to become intimate .
Parsing [sent. 15810 len. 30]: So much simplicity combined with so much force of character , such natural sagacity united to such amiability and gentleness -- these are the distinguishing characteristics of both . '
Parsing [sent. 15811 len. 34]: This being said aloud , gave Mr Lammle an opportunity , as he came with Mr Boffin from the window to the breakfast table , of taking up his dear and honoured wife .
Parsing [sent. 15812 len. 24]: ` My Sophronia , ' said that gentleman , ` your too partial estimate of your husband 's character -- ' ` No !
Parsing [sent. 15813 len. 20]: Not too partial , Alfred , ' urged the lady , tenderly moved ; ` never say that . '
Parsing [sent. 15814 len. 25]: ` My child , your favourable opinion , then , of your husband -- you do n't object to that phrase , darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 15815 len. 8]: ` How can I , Alfred ? '
Parsing [sent. 15816 len. 25]: ` Your favourable opinion then , my Precious , does less than justice to Mr Boffin , and more than justice to me . '
Parsing [sent. 15817 len. 12]: ` To the first charge , Alfred , I plead guilty .
Parsing [sent. 15818 len. 11]: But to the second , oh no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 15819 len. 55]: ` Less than justice to Mr Boffin , Sophronia , ' said Mr Lammle , soaring into a tone of moral grandeur , ` because it represents Mr Boffin as on my lower level ; more than justice to me , Sophronia , because it represents me as on Mr Boffin 's higher level .
Parsing [sent. 15820 len. 12]: Mr Boffin bears and forbears far more than I could . '
Parsing [sent. 15821 len. 12]: ` Far more than you could for yourself , Alfred ? '
Parsing [sent. 15822 len. 11]: ` My love , that is not the question . '
Parsing [sent. 15823 len. 8]: ` Not the question , Lawyer ? '
Parsing [sent. 15824 len. 6]: said Mrs Lammle , archly .
Parsing [sent. 15825 len. 6]: ` No , dear Sophronia .
Parsing [sent. 15826 len. 36]: From my lower level , I regard Mr Boffin as too generous , as possessed of too much clemency , as being too good to persons who are unworthy of him and ungrateful to him .
Parsing [sent. 15827 len. 10]: To those noble qualities I can lay no claim .
Parsing [sent. 15828 len. 16]: On the contrary , they rouse my indignation when I see them in action . '
Parsing [sent. 15829 len. 4]: ` Alfred ! '
Parsing [sent. 15830 len. 30]: ` They rouse my indignation , my dear , against the unworthy persons , and give me a combative desire to stand between Mr Boffin and all such persons .
Parsing [sent. 15831 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 15832 len. 14]: Because , in my lower nature I am more worldly and less delicate .
Parsing [sent. 15833 len. 28]: Not being so magnanimous as Mr Boffin , I feel his injuries more than he does himself , and feel more capable of opposing his injurers . '
Parsing [sent. 15834 len. 21]: It struck Mrs Lammle that it appeared rather difficult this morning to bring Mr and Mrs Boffin into agreeable conversation .
Parsing [sent. 15835 len. 17]: Here had been several lures thrown out , and neither of them had uttered a word .
Parsing [sent. 15836 len. 21]: Here were she , Mrs Lammle , and her husband discoursing at once affectingly and effectively , but discoursing alone .
Parsing [sent. 15837 len. 42]: Assuming that the dear old creatures were impressed by what they heard , still one would like to be sure of it , the more so , as at least one of the dear old creatures was somewhat pointedly referred to .
Parsing [sent. 15838 len. 44]: If the dear old creatures were too bashful or too dull to assume their required places in the discussion , why then it would seem desirable that the dear old creatures should be taken by their heads and shoulders and brought into it .
Parsing [sent. 15839 len. 50]: ` But is not my husband saying in effect , ' asked Mrs Lammie , therefore , with an innocent air , of Mr and Mrs Boffin , ` that he becomes unmindful of his own temporary misfortunes in his admiration of another whom he is burning to serve ?
Parsing [sent. 15840 len. 15]: And is not that making an admission that his nature is a generous one ?
Parsing [sent. 15841 len. 19]: I am wretched in argument , but surely this is so , dear Mr and Mrs Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 15842 len. 11]: Still , neither Mr and Mrs Boffin said a word .
Parsing [sent. 15843 len. 24]: He sat with his eyes on his plate , eating his muffins and ham , and she sat shyly looking at the teapot .
Parsing [sent. 15844 len. 21]: Mrs Lammle 's innocent appeal was merely thrown into the air , to mingle with the steam of the urn .
Parsing [sent. 15845 len. 30]: Glancing towards Mr and Mrs Boffin , she very slightly raised her eyebrows , as though inquiring of her husband : ` Do I notice anything wrong here ? '
Parsing [sent. 15846 len. 60]: Mr Lammle , who had found his chest effective on a variety of occasions , manoeuvred his capacious shirt front into the largest demonstration possible , and then smiling retorted on his wife , thus : ` Sophronia , darling , Mr and Mrs Boffin will remind you of the old adage , that self-praise is no recommendation . '
Parsing [sent. 15847 len. 5]: ` Self-praise , Alfred ?
Parsing [sent. 15848 len. 12]: Do you mean because we are one and the same ? '
Parsing [sent. 15849 len. 7]: ` No , my dear child .
Parsing [sent. 15850 len. 53]: I mean that you can not fail to remember , if you reflect for a single moment , that what you are pleased to compliment me upon feeling in the case of Mr Boffin , you have yourself confided to me as your own feeling in the case of Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 15851 len. 20]: -LRB- ' I shall be beaten by this Lawyer , ' Mrs Lammle gaily whispered to Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 15852 len. 21]: I am afraid I must admit it , if he presses me , for it 's damagingly true . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 15853 len. 45]: Several white dints began to come and go about Mr Lammle 's nose , as he observed that Mrs Boffin merely looked up from the teapot for a moment with an embarrassed smile , which was no smile , and then looked down again .
Parsing [sent. 15854 len. 10]: ` Do you admit the charge , Sophronia ? '
Parsing [sent. 15855 len. 8]: inquired Alfred , in a rallying tone .
Parsing [sent. 15856 len. 26]: ` Really , I think , ' said Mrs Lammle , still gaily , ' I must throw myself on the protection of the Court .
Parsing [sent. 15857 len. 12]: Am I bound to answer that question , my Lord ? '
Parsing [sent. 15858 len. 4]: To Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15859 len. 18]: ` You need n't , if you do n't like , ma'am , ' was his answer .
Parsing [sent. 15860 len. 10]: ` It 's not of the least consequence . '
Parsing [sent. 15861 len. 11]: Both husband and wife glanced at him , very doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 15862 len. 25]: His manner was grave , but not coarse , and derived some dignity from a certain repressed dislike of the tone of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 15863 len. 12]: Again Mrs Lammle raised her eyebrows for instruction from her husband .
Parsing [sent. 15864 len. 13]: He replied in a slight nod , ` Try 'em again . '
Parsing [sent. 15865 len. 34]: ` To protect myself against the suspicion of covert self-laudation , my dear Mrs Boffin , ' said the airy Mrs Lammle therefore , ' I must tell you how it was . '
Parsing [sent. 15866 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 15867 len. 9]: Pray do n't , ' Mr Boffin interposed .
Parsing [sent. 15868 len. 7]: Mrs Lammie turned to him laughingly .
Parsing [sent. 15869 len. 6]: ` The Court objects ? '
Parsing [sent. 15870 len. 21]: ` Ma'am , ' said Mr Boffin , ` the Court -LRB- if I am the Court -RRB- does object .
Parsing [sent. 15871 len. 7]: The Court objects for two reasons .
Parsing [sent. 15872 len. 11]: First , because the Court do n't think it fair .
Parsing [sent. 15873 len. 22]: Secondly , because the dear old lady , Mrs Court -LRB- if I am Mr -RRB- gets distressed by it . '
Parsing [sent. 15874 len. 45]: A very remarkable wavering between two bearings -- between her propitiatory bearing there , and her defiant bearing at Mr Twemlow 's -- was observable on the part of Mrs Lammle as she said : ` What does the Court not consider fair ? '
Parsing [sent. 15875 len. 41]: ` Letting you go on , ' replied Mr Boffin , nodding his head soothingly , as who should say , We wo n't be harder on you than we can help ; we 'll make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 15876 len. 11]: ` It 's not above-board and it 's not fair .
Parsing [sent. 15877 len. 17]: When the old lady is uncomfortable , there 's sure to be good reason for it .
Parsing [sent. 15878 len. 17]: I see she is uncomfortable , and I plainly see this is the good reason wherefore .
Parsing [sent. 15879 len. 7]: HAVE you breakfasted , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 15880 len. 28]: Mrs Lammle , settling into her defiant manner , pushed her plate away , looked at her husband , and laughed ; but by no means gaily .
Parsing [sent. 15881 len. 8]: ` Have YOU breakfasted , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 15882 len. 4]: inquired Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15883 len. 13]: ` Thank you , ' replied Alfred , showing all his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 15884 len. 17]: ` If Mrs Boffin will oblige me , I 'll take another cup of tea . '
Parsing [sent. 15885 len. 63]: He spilled a little of it over the chest which ought to have been so effective , and which had done so little ; but on the whole drank it with something of an air , though the coming and going dints got almost as large , the while , as if they had been made by pressure of the teaspoon . '
Parsing [sent. 15886 len. 10]: A thousand thanks , ' he then observed . '
Parsing [sent. 15887 len. 5]: I have breakfasted . '
Parsing [sent. 15888 len. 25]: ` Now , which , ' said Mr Boffin softly , taking out a pocket-book , ` which of you two is Cashier ? '
Parsing [sent. 15889 len. 51]: ` Sophronia , my dear , ' remarked her husband , as he leaned back in his chair , waving his right hand towards her , while he hung his left hand by the thumb in the arm-hole of his waistcoat : ` it shall be your department . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15890 len. 27]: I would rather , ' said Mr Boffin , ` that it was your husband 's , ma'am , because -- but never mind , because .
Parsing [sent. 15891 len. 9]: I would rather have to do with him .
Parsing [sent. 15892 len. 32]: However , what I have to say , I will say with as little offence as possible ; if I can say it without any , I shall be heartily glad .
Parsing [sent. 15893 len. 43]: You two have done me a service , a very great service , in doing what you did -LRB- my old lady knows what it was -RRB- , and I have put into this envelope a bank note for a hundred pound .
Parsing [sent. 15894 len. 20]: I consider the service well worth a hundred pound , and I am well pleased to pay the money .
Parsing [sent. 15895 len. 18]: Would you do me the favour to take it , and likewise to accept my thanks ? '
Parsing [sent. 15896 len. 29]: With a haughty action , and without looking towards him , Mrs Lammle held out her left hand , and into it Mr Boffin put the little packet .
Parsing [sent. 15897 len. 55]: When she had conveyed it to her bosom , Mr Lammle had the appearance of feeling relieved , and breathing more freely , as not having been quite certain that the hundred pounds were his , until the note had been safely transferred out of Mr Boffin 's keeping into his own Sophronia 's .
Parsing [sent. 15898 len. 35]: ` It is not impossible , ' said Mr Boffin , addressing Alfred , ` that you have had some general idea , sir , of replacing Rokesmith , in course of time ? '
Parsing [sent. 15899 len. 25]: ` It is not , ' assented Alfred , with a glittering smile and a great deal of nose , ` not impossible . '
Parsing [sent. 15900 len. 58]: ` And perhaps , ma'am , ' pursued Mr Boffin , addressing Sophronia , ` you have been so kind as to take up my old lady in your own mind , and to do her the honour of turning the question over whether you might n't one of these days have her in charge , like ?
Parsing [sent. 15901 len. 20]: Whether you might n't be a sort of Miss Bella Wilfer to her , and something more ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15902 len. 50]: I should hope , ' returned Mrs Lammle , with a scornful look and in a loud voice , ` that if I were anything to your wife , sir , I could hardly fail to be something more than Miss Bella Wilfer , as you call her . '
Parsing [sent. 15903 len. 10]: ` What do YOU call her , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 15904 len. 4]: asked Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15905 len. 16]: Mrs Lammle disdained to reply , and sat defiantly beating one foot on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 15906 len. 13]: ` Again I think I may say , that 's not impossible .
Parsing [sent. 15907 len. 6]: Is it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 15908 len. 8]: asked Mr Boffin , turning to Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 15909 len. 19]: ` It is not , ' said Alfred , smiling assent as before , ` not impossible . '
Parsing [sent. 15910 len. 16]: ` Now , ' said Mr Boffin , gently , ` it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 15911 len. 24]: I do n't wish to say a single word that might be afrerwards remembered as unpleasant ; but it wo n't do . '
Parsing [sent. 15912 len. 19]: ` Sophronia , my love , ' her husband repeated in a bantering manner , ` you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 15913 len. 6]: It wo n't do . '
Parsing [sent. 15914 len. 20]: ` No , ' said Mr Boffin , with his voice still dropped , ` it really wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 15915 len. 6]: You positively must excuse us .
Parsing [sent. 15916 len. 27]: If you 'll go your way , we 'll go ours , and so I hope this affair ends to the satisfaction of all parties . '
Parsing [sent. 15917 len. 21]: Mrs Lammle gave him the look of a decidedly dissatisfied party demanding exemption from the category ; but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 15918 len. 36]: ` The best thing we can make of the affair , ' said Mr Boffin , ` is a matter of business , and as a matter of business it 's brought to a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 15919 len. 20]: You have done me a great service , a very great service , and I have paid for it .
Parsing [sent. 15920 len. 9]: Is there any objection to the price ? '
Parsing [sent. 15921 len. 20]: Mr and Mrs Lammle looked at one another across the table , but neither could say that there was .
Parsing [sent. 15922 len. 12]: Mr Lammle shrugged his shoulders , and Mrs Lammle sat rigid .
Parsing [sent. 15923 len. 9]: ` Very good , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15924 len. 31]: ` We hope -LRB- my old lady and me -RRB- that you 'll give us credit for taking the plainest and honestest short-cut that could be taken under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 15925 len. 51]: We have talked it over with a deal of care -LRB- my old lady and me -RRB- , and we have felt that at all to lead you on , or even at all to let you go on of your own selves , would n't be the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 15926 len. 47]: So , I have openly given you to understand that -- ' Mr Boffin sought for a new turn of speech , but could find none so expressive as his former one , repeated in a confidential tone , ' -- that it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 15927 len. 32]: If I could have put the case more pleasantly I would ; but I hope I have n't put it very unpleasantly ; at all events I have n't meant to .
Parsing [sent. 15928 len. 36]: So , ' said Mr Boffin , by way of peroration , ` wishing you well in the way you go , we now conclude with the observation that perhaps you 'll go it . '
Parsing [sent. 15929 len. 25]: Mr Lammle rose with an impudent laugh on his side of the table , and Mrs Lammle rose with a disdainful frown on hers .
Parsing [sent. 15930 len. 25]: At this moment a hasty foot was heard on the staircase , and Georgiana Podsnap broke into the room , unannounced and in tears .
Parsing [sent. 15931 len. 33]: ` Oh , my dear Sophronia , ' cried Georgiana , wringing her hands as she ran up to embrace her , ` to think that you and Alfred should be ruined !
Parsing [sent. 15932 len. 26]: Oh , my poor dear Sophronia , to think that you should have had a Sale at your house after all your kindness to me !
Parsing [sent. 15933 len. 58]: Oh , Mr and Mrs Boffin , pray forgive me for this intrusion , but you do n't know how fond I was of Sophronia when Pa would n't let me go there any more , or what I have felt for Sophronia since I heard from Ma of her having been brought low in the world .
Parsing [sent. 15934 len. 35]: You do n't , you ca n't , you never can , think , how I have lain awake at night and cried for my good Sophronia , my first and only friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 15935 len. 35]: Mrs Lammle 's manner changed under the poor silly girl 's embraces , and she turned extremely pale : directing one appealing look , first to Mrs Boffin , and then to Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15936 len. 35]: Both understood her instantly , with a more delicate subtlety than much better educated people , whose perception came less directly from the heart , could have brought to bear upon the case . '
Parsing [sent. 15937 len. 16]: I have n't a minute , ' said poor little Georgiana , ` to stay .
Parsing [sent. 15938 len. 124]: I am out shopping early with Ma , and I said I had a headache and got Ma to leave me outside in the phaeton , in Piccadilly , and ran round to Sackville Street , and heard that Sophronia was here , and then Ma came to see , oh such a dreadful old stony woman from the country in a turban in Portland Place , and I said I would n't go up with Ma but would drive round and leave cards for the Boffins , which is taking a liberty with the name ; but oh my goodness I am distracted , and the phaeton 's at the door , and what would Pa say if he knew it ! '
Parsing [sent. 15939 len. 15]: ` Do n't ye be timid , my dear , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 15940 len. 9]: ` You came in to see us . '
Parsing [sent. 15941 len. 13]: ` Oh , no , I did n't , ' cried Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 15942 len. 22]: ` It 's very impolite , I know , but I came to see my poor Sophronia , my only friend .
Parsing [sent. 15943 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15944 len. 31]: how I felt the separation , my dear Sophronia , before I knew you were brought low in the world , and how much more I feel it now ! '
Parsing [sent. 15945 len. 24]: There were actually tears in the bold woman 's eyes , as the softheaded and soft-hearted girl twined her arms about her neck .
Parsing [sent. 15946 len. 46]: ` But I 've come on business , ' said Georgiana , sobbing and drying her face , and then searching in a little reticule , ` and if I do n't despatch it I shall have come for nothing , and oh good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 15947 len. 71]: what would Pa say if he knew of Sackville Street , and what would Ma say if she was kept waiting on the doorsteps of that dreadful turban , and there never were such pawing horses as ours unsettling my mind every moment more and more when I want more mind than I have got , by pawing up Mr Boffin 's street where they have no business to be .
Parsing [sent. 15948 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15949 len. 7]: where is , where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 15950 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15951 len. 7]: I ca n't find it ! '
Parsing [sent. 15952 len. 12]: All this time sobbing , and searching in the little reticule .
Parsing [sent. 15953 len. 10]: ` What do you miss , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 15954 len. 7]: asked Mr Boffin , stepping forward .
Parsing [sent. 15955 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15956 len. 32]: it 's little enough , ' replied Georgiana , ` because Ma always treats me as if I was in the nursery -LRB- I am sure I wish I was ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 15957 len. 36]: , but I hardly ever spend it and it has mounted up to fifteen pounds , Sophronia , and I hope three five-pound notes are better than nothing , though so little , so little !
Parsing [sent. 15958 len. 12]: And now I have found that -- oh , my goodness !
Parsing [sent. 15959 len. 7]: there 's the other gone next !
Parsing [sent. 15960 len. 12]: Oh no , it is n't , here it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 15961 len. 16]: With that , always sobbing and searching in the reticule , Georgiana produced a necklace .
Parsing [sent. 15962 len. 71]: ` Ma says chits and jewels have no business together , ' pursued Georgiana , ` and that 's the reason why I have no trinkets except this , but I suppose my aunt Hawkinson was of a different opinion , because she left me this , though I used to think she might just as well have buried it , for it 's always kept in jewellers ' cotton .
Parsing [sent. 15963 len. 34]: However , here it is , I am thankful to say , and of use at last , and you 'll sell it , dear Sophronia , and buy things with it . '
Parsing [sent. 15964 len. 15]: ` Give it to me , ' said Mr Boffin , gently taking it .
Parsing [sent. 15965 len. 12]: ` I 'll see that it 's properly disposed of . '
Parsing [sent. 15966 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15967 len. 13]: are you such a friend of Sophronia 's , Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 15968 len. 3]: cried Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 15969 len. 8]: ` Oh , how good of you !
Parsing [sent. 15970 len. 5]: Oh , my gracious !
Parsing [sent. 15971 len. 14]: there was something else , and it 's gone out of my head !
Parsing [sent. 15972 len. 13]: Oh no , it is n't , I remember what it was .
Parsing [sent. 15973 len. 73]: My grandmamma 's property , that 'll come to me when I am of age , Mr Boffin , will be all my own , and neither Pa nor Ma nor anybody else will have any control over it , and what I wish to do it so make some of it over somehow to Sophronia and Alfred , by signing something somewhere that 'll prevail on somebody to advance them something .
Parsing [sent. 15974 len. 16]: I want them to have something handsome to bring them up in the world again .
Parsing [sent. 15975 len. 6]: Oh , my goodness me !
Parsing [sent. 15976 len. 20]: Being such a friend of my dear Sophronia 's , you wo n't refuse me , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15977 len. 18]: ` No , no , ' said Mr Boffin , ` it shall be seen to . '
Parsing [sent. 15978 len. 10]: ` Oh , thank you , thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15979 len. 3]: cried Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 15980 len. 64]: ` If my maid had a little note and half a crown , I could run round to the pastrycook 's to sign something , or I could sign something in the Square if somebody would come and cough for me to let 'em in with the key , and would bring a pen and ink with 'em and a bit of blotting-paper .
Parsing [sent. 15981 len. 5]: Oh , my gracious !
Parsing [sent. 15982 len. 15]: I must tear myself away , or Pa and Ma will both find out !
Parsing [sent. 15983 len. 10]: Dear , dear Sophronia , good , good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 15984 len. 21]: The credulous little creature again embraced Mrs Lammle most affectionately , and then held out her hand to Mr Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 15985 len. 11]: ` Good-bye , dear Mr Lammle -- I mean Alfred .
Parsing [sent. 15986 len. 26]: You wo n't think after to-day that I have deserted you and Sophronia because you have been brought low in the world , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 15987 len. 3]: Oh me !
Parsing [sent. 15988 len. 3]: oh me !
Parsing [sent. 15989 len. 24]: I have been crying my eyes out of my head , and Ma will he sure to ask me what 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 15990 len. 15]: Oh , take me down , somebody , please , please , please ! '
Parsing [sent. 15991 len. 66]: Mr Boffin took her down , and saw her driven away , with her poor little red eyes and weak chin peering over the great apron of the custard-coloured phaeton , as if she had been ordered to expiate some childish misdemeanour by going to bed in the daylight , and were peeping over the counterpane in a miserable flutter of repentance and low spirits .
Parsing [sent. 15992 len. 24]: Returning to the breakfast-room , he found Mrs Lammle still standing on her side of the table , and Mr Lammle on his .
Parsing [sent. 15993 len. 27]: ` I 'll take care , ' said Mr Boffin , showing the money and the necklace , ` that these are soon given back . '
Parsing [sent. 15994 len. 39]: Mrs Lammle had taken up her parasol from a side table , and stood sketching with it on the pattern of the damask cloth , as she had sketched on the pattern of Mr Twemlow 's papered wall .
Parsing [sent. 15995 len. 13]: ` You will not undeceive her I hope , Mr Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 15996 len. 14]: she said , turning her head towards him , but not her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 15997 len. 9]: ` No , ' said Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 15998 len. 32]: I mean , as to the worth and value of her friend , ' Mrs Lammle explained , in a measured voice , and with an emphasis on her last word .
Parsing [sent. 15999 len. 8]: ` No , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 16000 len. 45]: I may try to give a hint at her home that she is in want of kind and careful protection , but I shall say no more than that to her parents , and I shall say nothing to the young lady herself . '
Parsing [sent. 16001 len. 55]: ` Mr and Mrs Boffin , ' said Mrs Lammle , still sketching , and seeming to bestow great pains upon it , ` there are not many people , I think , who , under the circumstances , would have been so considerate and sparing as you have been to me just now .
Parsing [sent. 16002 len. 8]: Do you care to be thanked ? '
Parsing [sent. 16003 len. 18]: ` Thanks are always worth having , ' said Mrs Boffin , in her ready good nature .
Parsing [sent. 16004 len. 7]: ` Then thank you both . '
Parsing [sent. 16005 len. 16]: ` Sophronia , ' asked her husband , mockingly , ` are you sentimental ? '
Parsing [sent. 16006 len. 44]: ` Well , well , my good sir , ' Mr Boffin interposed , ` it 's a very good thing to think well of another person , and it 's a very good thing to be thought well of BY another person .
Parsing [sent. 16007 len. 15]: Mrs Lammle will be none the worse for it , if she is . '
Parsing [sent. 16008 len. 4]: ` Much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 16009 len. 10]: But I asked Mrs Lammle if she was . '
Parsing [sent. 16010 len. 18]: She stood sketching on the table-cloth , with her face clouded and set , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 16011 len. 29]: ` Because , ' said Alfred , ' I am disposed to be sentimental myself , on your appropriation of the jewels and the money , Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16012 len. 29]: As our little Georgiana said , three five-pound notes are better than nothing , and if you sell a necklace you can buy things with the produce . '
Parsing [sent. 16013 len. 21]: ` IF you sell it , ' was Mr Boffin 's comment , as he put it in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 16014 len. 23]: Alfred followed it with his looks , and also greedily pursued the notes until they vanished into Mr Boffin 's waistcoat pocket .
Parsing [sent. 16015 len. 16]: Then he directed a look , half exasperated and half jeering , at his wife .
Parsing [sent. 16016 len. 46]: She still stood sketching ; but , as she sketched , there was a struggle within her , which found expression in the depth of the few last lines the parasol point indented into the table-cloth , and then some tears fell from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 16017 len. 16]: ` Why , confound the woman , ' exclaimed Lammle , ` she IS sentimental !
Parsing [sent. 16018 len. 24]: She walked to the window , flinching under his angry stare , looked out for a moment , and turned round quite coldly .
Parsing [sent. 16019 len. 24]: ` You have had no former cause of complaint on the sentimental score , Alfred , and you will have none in future .
Parsing [sent. 16020 len. 7]: It is not worth your noticing .
Parsing [sent. 16021 len. 14]: We go abroad soon , with the money we have earned here ? '
Parsing [sent. 16022 len. 12]: ` You know we do ; you know we must . '
Parsing [sent. 16023 len. 13]: ` There is no fear of my taking any sentiment with me .
Parsing [sent. 16024 len. 12]: I should soon be eased of it , if I did .
Parsing [sent. 16025 len. 8]: But it will be all left behind .
Parsing [sent. 16026 len. 6]: It IS all left behind .
Parsing [sent. 16027 len. 7]: Are you ready , Alfred ? '
Parsing [sent. 16028 len. 15]: ` What the deuce have I been waiting for but you , Sophronia ? '
Parsing [sent. 16029 len. 6]: ` Let us go then .
Parsing [sent. 16030 len. 11]: I am sorry I have delayed our dignified departure . '
Parsing [sent. 16031 len. 8]: She passed out and he followed her .
Parsing [sent. 16032 len. 24]: Mr and Mrs Boffin had the curiosity softly to raise a window and look after them as they went down the long street .
Parsing [sent. 16033 len. 15]: They walked arm-in-arm , showily enough , but without appearing to interchange a syllable .
Parsing [sent. 16034 len. 55]: It might have been fanciful to suppose that under their outer bearing there was something of the shamed air of two cheats who were linked together by concealed handcuffs ; but , not so , to suppose that they were haggardly weary of one another , of themselves , and of all this world .
Parsing [sent. 16035 len. 39]: In turning the street corner they might have turned out of this world , for anything Mr and Mrs Boffin ever saw of them to the contrary ; for , they set eyes on the Lammles never more .
Parsing [sent. 16036 len. 61]: Chapter 3 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN SINKS AGAIN The evening of that day being one of the reading evenings at the Bower , Mr Boffin kissed Mrs Boffin after a five o'clock dinner , and trotted out , nursing his big stick in both arms , so that , as of old , it seemed to be whispering in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 16037 len. 28]: He carried so very attentive an expression on his countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of the big stick required to be followed closely .
Parsing [sent. 16038 len. 49]: Mr Boffin 's face was like the face of a thoughtful listener to an intricate communication , and , in trotting along , he occasionally glanced at that companion with the look of a man who was interposing the remark : ` You do n't mean it ! '
Parsing [sent. 16039 len. 41]: Mr Boffin and his stick went on alone together , until they arrived at certain cross-ways where they would be likely to fall in with any one coming , at about the same time , from Clerkenwell to the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 16040 len. 11]: Here they stopped , and Mr Boffin consulted his watch .
Parsing [sent. 16041 len. 17]: ` It wants five minutes , good , to Venus 's appointment , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 16042 len. 7]: ` I 'm rather early . '
Parsing [sent. 16043 len. 28]: But Venus was a punctual man , and , even as Mr Boffin replaced his watch in its pocket , was to be descried coming towards him .
Parsing [sent. 16044 len. 22]: He quickened his pace on seeing Mr Boffin already at the place of meeting , and was soon at his side .
Parsing [sent. 16045 len. 12]: ` Thank ` ee , Venus , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16046 len. 14]: ` Thank ` ee , thank ` ee , thank ` ee ! '
Parsing [sent. 16047 len. 27]: It would not have been very evident why he thanked the anatomist , but for his furnishing the explanation in what he went on to say .
Parsing [sent. 16048 len. 9]: ` All right , Venus , all right .
Parsing [sent. 16049 len. 37]: Now , that you 've been to see me , and have consented to keep up the appearance before Wegg of remaining in it for a time , I have got a sort of a backer .
Parsing [sent. 16050 len. 5]: All right , Venus .
Parsing [sent. 16051 len. 6]: Thank ` ee , Venus .
Parsing [sent. 16052 len. 13]: Thank ` ee , thank ` ee , thank ` ee ! '
Parsing [sent. 16053 len. 20]: Mr Venus shook the proffered hand with a modest air , and they pursued the direction of the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 16054 len. 17]: ` Do you think Wegg is likely to drop down upon me to-night , Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 16055 len. 12]: inquired Mr Boffin , wistfully , as they went along . '
Parsing [sent. 16056 len. 8]: I think he is , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 16057 len. 13]: ` Have you any particular reason for thinking so , Venus ? '
Parsing [sent. 16058 len. 59]: ` Well , sir , ' returned that personage , ` the fact is , he has given me another look-in , to make sure of what he calls our stock-in-trade being correct , and he has mentioned his intention that he was not to be put off beginning with you the very next time you should come .
Parsing [sent. 16059 len. 43]: And this , ' hinted Mr Venus , delicately , ` being the very next time , you know , sir -- ' -- ` Why , therefore you suppose he 'll turn to at the grindstone , eh , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 16060 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16061 len. 7]: ` Just so , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 16062 len. 28]: Mr Boffin took his nose in his hand , as if it were already excoriated , and the sparks were beginning to fly out of that feature .
Parsing [sent. 16063 len. 15]: ` He 's a terrible fellow , Venus ; he 's an awful fellow .
Parsing [sent. 16064 len. 13]: I do n't know how ever I shall go through with it .
Parsing [sent. 16065 len. 14]: You must stand by me , Venus like a good man and true .
Parsing [sent. 16066 len. 18]: You 'll do all you can to stand by me , Venus ; wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16067 len. 32]: Mr Venus replied with the assurance that he would ; and Mr Boffin , looking anxious and dispirited , pursued the way in silence until they rang at the Bower gate .
Parsing [sent. 16068 len. 28]: The stumping approach of Wegg was soon heard behind it , and as it turned upon its hinges he became visible with his hand on the lock .
Parsing [sent. 16069 len. 7]: ` Mr Boffin , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 16070 len. 3]: he remarked .
Parsing [sent. 16071 len. 8]: ` You 're quite a stranger ! '
Parsing [sent. 16072 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 16073 len. 9]: I 've been otherwise occupied , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 16074 len. 8]: ` Have you indeed , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 16075 len. 10]: returned the literary gentleman , with a threatening sneer .
Parsing [sent. 16076 len. 3]: ` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 16077 len. 17]: I 've been looking for you , sir , rather what I may call specially . '
Parsing [sent. 16078 len. 10]: ` You do n't say so , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 16079 len. 10]: ` Yes , I do say so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16080 len. 25]: And if you had n't come round to me tonight , dash my wig if I would n't have come round to you tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 16081 len. 2]: Now !
Parsing [sent. 16082 len. 5]: I tell you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16083 len. 10]: ` Nothing wrong , I hope , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 16084 len. 13]: ` Oh no , Mr Boffin , ' was the ironical answer .
Parsing [sent. 16085 len. 4]: ` Nothing wrong !
Parsing [sent. 16086 len. 8]: What should be wrong in Boffinses Bower !
Parsing [sent. 16087 len. 7]: Step in , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16088 len. 42]: `` If you 'll come to the Bower I 've shaded for you , Your bed sha n't be roses all spangled with doo : Will you , will you , will you , will you , come to the Bower ?
Parsing [sent. 16089 len. 25]: Oh , wo n't you , wo n't you , wo n't you , wo n't you , come to the Bower ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 16090 len. 35]: An unholy glare of contradiction and offence shone in the eyes of Mr Wegg , as he turned the key on his patron , after ushering him into the yard with this vocal quotation .
Parsing [sent. 16091 len. 9]: Mr Boffin 's air was crestfallen and submissive .
Parsing [sent. 16092 len. 30]: Whispered Wegg to Venus , as they crossed the yard behind him : ` Look at the worm and minion ; he 's down in the mouth already . '
Parsing [sent. 16093 len. 14]: Whispered Venus to Wegg : ` That 's because I 've told him .
Parsing [sent. 16094 len. 9]: I 've prepared the way for you . '
Parsing [sent. 16095 len. 45]: Mr Boffin , entering the usual chamber , laid his stick upon the settle usually reserved for him , thrust his hands into his pockets , and , with his shoulders raised and his hat drooping back upon them , looking disconsolately at Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 16096 len. 35]: ` My friend and partner , Mr Venus , gives me to understand , ' remarked that man of might , addressing him , ` that you are aware of our power over you .
Parsing [sent. 16097 len. 18]: Now , when you have took your hat off , we 'll go into that pint . '
Parsing [sent. 16098 len. 33]: Mr Boffin shook it off with one shake , so that it dropped on the floor behind him , and remained in his former attitude with his former rueful look upon him .
Parsing [sent. 16099 len. 20]: ` First of all , I 'm a-going to call you Boffin , for short , ' said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 16100 len. 19]: ` If you do n't like it , it 's open to you to lump it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16101 len. 13]: I do n't mind it , Wegg , ' Mr Boffin replied .
Parsing [sent. 16102 len. 9]: ` That 's lucky for you , Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16103 len. 12]: Now , do you want to be read to ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16104 len. 12]: I do n't particularly care about it to-night , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 16105 len. 33]: ` Because if you did want to , ' pursued Mr Wegg , the brilliancy of whose point was dimmed by his having been unexpectedly answered : ` you would n't be .
Parsing [sent. 16106 len. 8]: I 've been your slave long enough .
Parsing [sent. 16107 len. 13]: I 'm not to be trampled under-foot by a dustman any more .
Parsing [sent. 16108 len. 17]: With the single exception of the salary , I renounce the whole and total sitiwation . '
Parsing [sent. 16109 len. 30]: ` Since you say it is to be so , Wegg , ' returned Mr Boffin , with folded hands , ' I suppose it must be . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16110 len. 10]: I suppose it must be , ' Wegg retorted .
Parsing [sent. 16111 len. 32]: ` Next -LRB- to clear the ground before coming to business -RRB- , you 've placed in this yard a skulking , a sneaking , and a sniffing , menial . '
Parsing [sent. 16112 len. 20]: ` He had n't a cold in his head when I sent him here , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16113 len. 4]: ` Boffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 16114 len. 16]: retorted Wegg , ' I warn you not to attempt a joke with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16115 len. 76]: Here Mr Venus interposed , and remarked that he conceived Mr Boffin to have taken the description literally ; the rather , forasmuch as he , Mr Venus , had himself supposed the menial to have contracted an affliction or a habit of the nose , involving a serious drawback on the pleasures of social intercourse , until he had discovered that Mr Wegg 's description of him was to be accepted as merely figurative .
Parsing [sent. 16116 len. 23]: ` Anyhow , and every how , ' said Wegg , ` he has been planted here , and he is here .
Parsing [sent. 16117 len. 9]: Now , I wo n't have him here .
Parsing [sent. 16118 len. 25]: So I call upon Boffin , before I say another word , to fetch him in and send him packing to the right-about . '
Parsing [sent. 16119 len. 17]: The unsuspecting Sloppy was at that moment airing his many buttons within view of the window .
Parsing [sent. 16120 len. 22]: Mr Boffin , after a short interval of impassive discomfiture , opened the window and beckoned him to come in . '
Parsing [sent. 16121 len. 44]: I call upon Boffin , ' said Wegg , with one arm a-kimbo and his head on one side , like a bullying counsel pausing for an answer from a witness , ` to inform that menial that I am Master here ! '
Parsing [sent. 16122 len. 28]: In humble obedience , when the button-gleaming Sloppy entered Mr Boffin said to him : ` Sloppy , my fine fellow , Mr Wegg is Master here .
Parsing [sent. 16123 len. 15]: He does n't want you , and you are to go from here . '
Parsing [sent. 16124 len. 5]: ` For good ! '
Parsing [sent. 16125 len. 5]: Mr Wegg severely stipulated .
Parsing [sent. 16126 len. 9]: ` For good , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16127 len. 44]: Sloppy stared , with both his eyes and all his buttons , and his mouth wide open ; but was without loss of time escorted forth by Silas Wegg , pushed out at the yard gate by the shoulders , and locked out .
Parsing [sent. 16128 len. 33]: ` The atomspear , ' said Wegg , stumping back into the room again , a little reddened by his late exertion , ` is now freer for the purposes of respiration .
Parsing [sent. 16129 len. 9]: Mr Venus , sir , take a chair .
Parsing [sent. 16130 len. 8]: Boffin , you may sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 16131 len. 36]: Mr Boffin , still with his hands ruefully stuck in his pockets , sat on the edge of the settle , shrunk into a small compass , and eyed the potent Silas with conciliatory looks .
Parsing [sent. 16132 len. 31]: ` This gentleman , ' said Silas Wegg , pointing out Venus , ` this gentleman , Boffin , is more milk and watery with you than I 'll be .
Parsing [sent. 16133 len. 31]: But he has n't borne the Roman yoke as I have , nor yet he has n't been required to pander to your depraved appetite for miserly characters . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16134 len. 19]: I never meant , my dear Wegg -- ' Mr Boffin was beginning , when Silas stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 16135 len. 7]: ` Hold your tongue , Boffin !
Parsing [sent. 16136 len. 9]: Answer when you 're called upon to answer .
Parsing [sent. 16137 len. 11]: You 'll find you 've got quite enough to do .
Parsing [sent. 16138 len. 25]: Now , you 're aware -- are you -- that you 're in possession of property to which you 've no right at all ?
Parsing [sent. 16139 len. 7]: Are you aware of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 16140 len. 22]: ` Venus tells me so , ' said Mr Boffin , glancing towards him for any support he could give . '
Parsing [sent. 16141 len. 9]: I tell you so , ' returned Silas .
Parsing [sent. 16142 len. 16]: ` Now , here 's my hat , Boffin , and here 's my walking-stick .
Parsing [sent. 16143 len. 38]: Trifle with me , and instead of making a bargain with you , I 'll put on my hat and take up my walking-stick , and go out , and make a bargain with the rightful owner .
Parsing [sent. 16144 len. 9]: Now , what do you say ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16145 len. 33]: I say , ' returned Mr Boffin , leaning forward in alarmed appeal , with his hands on his knees , ` that I am sure I do n't want to trifle .
Parsing [sent. 16146 len. 2]: Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 16147 len. 8]: I have said so to Venus . '
Parsing [sent. 16148 len. 11]: ` You certainly have , sir , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 16149 len. 28]: ` You 're too milk and watery with our friend , you are indeed , ' remonstrated Silas , with a disapproving shake of his wooden head .
Parsing [sent. 16150 len. 16]: Then at once you confess yourself desirous to come to terms , do you Boffin ?
Parsing [sent. 16151 len. 18]: Before you answer , keep this hat well in your mind and also this walking-stick . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16152 len. 12]: I am willing , Wegg , to come to terms . '
Parsing [sent. 16153 len. 8]: ` Willing wo n't do , Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16154 len. 6]: I wo n't take willing .
Parsing [sent. 16155 len. 8]: Are you desirous to come to terms ?
Parsing [sent. 16156 len. 15]: Do you ask to be allowed as a favour to come to terms ? '
Parsing [sent. 16157 len. 15]: Mr Wegg again planted his arm , and put his head on one side .
Parsing [sent. 16158 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 16159 len. 5]: ` Yes what ? '
Parsing [sent. 16160 len. 12]: said the inexorable Wegg : ' I wo n't take yes .
Parsing [sent. 16161 len. 13]: I 'll have it out of you in full , Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 16162 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16163 len. 6]: cried that unfortunate gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 16164 len. 5]: I am so worrited !
Parsing [sent. 16165 len. 18]: I ask to be allowed to come to terms , supposing your document is all correct . '
Parsing [sent. 16166 len. 19]: ` Do n't you be afraid of that , ' said Silas , poking his head at him .
Parsing [sent. 16167 len. 9]: ` You shall be satisfied by seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 16168 len. 15]: Mr Venus will show it you , and I 'll hold you the while .
Parsing [sent. 16169 len. 10]: Then you want to know what the terms are .
Parsing [sent. 16170 len. 10]: Is that about the sum and substance of it ?
Parsing [sent. 16171 len. 11]: Will you or wo n't you answer , Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 16172 len. 7]: For he had paused a moment .
Parsing [sent. 16173 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16174 len. 21]: cried that unfortunate gentleman again , ' I am worrited to that degree that I 'm almost off my head .
Parsing [sent. 16175 len. 5]: You hurry me so .
Parsing [sent. 16176 len. 11]: Be so good as name the terms , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 16177 len. 27]: ` Now , mark , Boffin , ' returned Silas : ` Mark 'em well , because they 're the lowest terms and the only terms .
Parsing [sent. 16178 len. 45]: You 'll throw your Mound -LRB- the little Mound as comes to you any way -RRB- into the general estate , and then you 'll divide the whole property into three parts , and you 'll keep one and hand over the others . '
Parsing [sent. 16179 len. 28]: Mr Venus 's mouth screwed itself up , as Mr Boffin 's face lengthened itself , Mr Venus not having been prepared for such a rapacious demand .
Parsing [sent. 16180 len. 19]: ` Now , wait a bit , Boffin , ' Wegg proceeded , ` there 's something more .
Parsing [sent. 16181 len. 16]: You 've been a squandering this property -- laying some of it out on yourself .
Parsing [sent. 16182 len. 5]: THAT wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 16183 len. 6]: You 've bought a house .
Parsing [sent. 16184 len. 9]: You 'll be charged for it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16185 len. 8]: I shall be ruined , Wegg ! '
Parsing [sent. 16186 len. 5]: Mr Boffin faintly protested .
Parsing [sent. 16187 len. 14]: ` Now , wait a bit , Boffin ; there 's something more .
Parsing [sent. 16188 len. 17]: You 'll leave me in sole custody of these Mounds till they 're all laid low .
Parsing [sent. 16189 len. 17]: If any waluables should be found in 'em , I 'll take care of such waluables .
Parsing [sent. 16190 len. 39]: You 'll produce your contract for the sale of the Mounds , that we may know to a penny what they 're worth , and you 'll make out likewise an exact list of all the other property .
Parsing [sent. 16191 len. 19]: When the Mounds is cleared away to the last shovel-full , the final diwision will come off . '
Parsing [sent. 16192 len. 7]: ` Dreadful , dreadful , dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 16193 len. 8]: I shall die in a workhouse ! '
Parsing [sent. 16194 len. 12]: cried the Golden Dustman , with his hands to his head .
Parsing [sent. 16195 len. 14]: ` Now , wait a bit , Boffin ; there 's something more .
Parsing [sent. 16196 len. 9]: You 've been unlawfully ferreting about this yard .
Parsing [sent. 16197 len. 13]: You 've been seen in the act of ferreting about this yard .
Parsing [sent. 16198 len. 24]: Two pair of eyes at the present moment brought to bear upon you , have seen you dig up a Dutch bottle . '
Parsing [sent. 16199 len. 13]: ` It was mine , Wegg , ' protested Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 16200 len. 7]: I put it there myself . '
Parsing [sent. 16201 len. 9]: ` What was in it , Boffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 16202 len. 3]: inquired Silas .
Parsing [sent. 16203 len. 29]: ` Not gold , not silver , not bank notes , not jewels , nothing that you could turn into money , Wegg ; upon my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 16204 len. 50]: ` Prepared , Mr Venus , ' said Wegg , turning to his partner with a knowing and superior air , ` for an ewasive answer on the part of our dusty friend here , I have hit out a little idea which I think will meet your views .
Parsing [sent. 16205 len. 14]: We charge that bottle against our dusty friend at a thousand pound . '
Parsing [sent. 16206 len. 7]: Mr Boffin drew a deep groan .
Parsing [sent. 16207 len. 14]: ` Now , wait a bit , Boffin ; there 's something more .
Parsing [sent. 16208 len. 11]: In your employment is an under-handed sneak , named Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 16209 len. 17]: It wo n't answer to have HIM about , while this business of ours is about .
Parsing [sent. 16210 len. 6]: He must be discharged . '
Parsing [sent. 16211 len. 32]: ` Rokesmith is already discharged , ' said Mr Boffin , speaking in a muffled voice , with his hands before his face , as he rocked himself on the settle .
Parsing [sent. 16212 len. 8]: ` Already discharged , is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 16213 len. 5]: returned Wegg , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 16214 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 16215 len. 14]: Then , Boffin , I believe there 's nothing more at present . '
Parsing [sent. 16216 len. 44]: The unlucky gentleman continuing to rock himself to and fro , and to utter an occasional moan , Mr Venus besought him to bear up against his reverses , and to take time to accustom himself to the thought of his new position .
Parsing [sent. 16217 len. 23]: But , his taking time was exactly the thing of all others that Silas Wegg could not be induced to hear of .
Parsing [sent. 16218 len. 11]: ` Yes or no , and no half measures ! '
Parsing [sent. 16219 len. 37]: was the motto which that obdurate person many times repeated ; shaking his fist at Mr Boffin , and pegging his motto into the floor with his wooden leg , in a threatening and alarming manner .
Parsing [sent. 16220 len. 28]: At length , Mr Boffin entreated to be allowed a quarter of an hour 's grace , and a cooling walk of that duration in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 16221 len. 38]: With some difficulty Mr Wegg granted this great favour , but only on condition that he accompanied Mr Boffin in his walk , as not knowing what he might fraudulently unearth if he were left to himself .
Parsing [sent. 16222 len. 58]: A more absurd sight than Mr Boffin in his mental irritation trotting very nimbly , and Mr Wegg hopping after him with great exertion , eager to watch the slightest turn of an eyelash , lest it should indicate a spot rich with some secret , assuredly had never been seen in the shadow of the Mounds .
Parsing [sent. 16223 len. 24]: Mr Wegg was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired , and came hopping in , a very bad second . '
Parsing [sent. 16224 len. 7]: I ca n't help myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 16225 len. 28]: cried Mr Boffin , flouncing on the settle in a forlorn manner , with his hands deep in his pockets , as if his pockets had sunk .
Parsing [sent. 16226 len. 19]: ` What 's the good of my pretending to stand out , when I ca n't help myself ?
Parsing [sent. 16227 len. 8]: I must give in to the terms .
Parsing [sent. 16228 len. 10]: But I should like to see the document . '
Parsing [sent. 16229 len. 28]: Wegg , who was all for clinching the nail he had so strongly driven home , announced that Boffin should see it without an hour 's delay .
Parsing [sent. 16230 len. 71]: Taking him into custody for that purpose , or overshadowing him as if he really were his Evil Genius in visible form , Mr Wegg clapped Mr Boffin 's hat upon the back of his head , and walked him out by the arm , asserting a proprietorship over his soul and body that was at once more grim and more ridiculous than anything in Mr Venus 's rare collection .
Parsing [sent. 16231 len. 71]: That light-haired gentleman followed close upon their heels , at least backing up Mr Boffin in a literal sense , if he had not had recent opportunities of doing so spiritually ; while Mr Boffin , trotting on as hard as he could trot , involved Silas Wegg in frequent collisions with the public , much as a preoccupied blind man 's dog may be seen to involve his master .
Parsing [sent. 16232 len. 18]: Thus they reached Mr Venus 's establishment , somewhat heated by the nature of their progress thither .
Parsing [sent. 16233 len. 32]: Mr Wegg , especially , was in a flaming glow , and stood in the little shop , panting and mopping his head with his pocket-handkerchief , speechless for several minutes .
Parsing [sent. 16234 len. 30]: Meanwhile , Mr Venus , who had left the duelling frogs to fight it out in his absence by candlelight for the public delectation , put the shutters up .
Parsing [sent. 16235 len. 32]: When all was snug , and the shop-door fastened , he said to the perspiring Silas : ' I suppose , Mr Wegg , we may now produce the paper ? '
Parsing [sent. 16236 len. 20]: ` Hold on a minute , sir , ' replied that discreet character ; ` hold on a minute .
Parsing [sent. 16237 len. 29]: Will you obligingly shove that box -- which you mentioned on a former occasion as containing miscellanies -- towards me in the midst of the shop here ? '
Parsing [sent. 16238 len. 8]: Mr Venus did as he was asked .
Parsing [sent. 16239 len. 16]: ` Very good , ' said Silas , looking about : 've -- ry good .
Parsing [sent. 16240 len. 16]: Will you hand me that chair , sir , to put a-top of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 16241 len. 6]: Venus handed him the chair .
Parsing [sent. 16242 len. 22]: ` Now , Boffin , ' said Wegg , ` mount up here and take your seat , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16243 len. 43]: Mr Boffin , as if he were about to have his portrait painted , or to be electrified , or to be made a Freemason , or to be placed at any other solitary disadvantage , ascended the rostrum prepared for him .
Parsing [sent. 16244 len. 49]: ` Now , Mr Venus , ' said Silas , taking off his coat , ` when I catches our friend here round the arms and body , and pins him tight to the back of the chair , you may show him what he wants to see .
Parsing [sent. 16245 len. 30]: If you 'll open it and hold it well up in one hand , sir , and a candle in the other , he can read it charming . '
Parsing [sent. 16246 len. 23]: Mr Boffin seemed rather inclined to object to these precautionary arrangements , but , being immediately embraced by Wegg , resigned himself .
Parsing [sent. 16247 len. 45]: Venus then produced the document , and Mr Boffin slowly spelt it out aloud : so very slowly , that Wegg , who was holding him in the chair with the grip of a wrestler , became again exceedingly the worse for his exertions .
Parsing [sent. 16248 len. 29]: ` Say when you 've put it safe back , Mr Venus , ' he uttered with difficulty , ` for the strain of this is terrimenjious . '
Parsing [sent. 16249 len. 39]: At length the document was restored to its place ; and Wegg , whose uncomfortable attitude had been that of a very persevering man unsuccessfully attempting to stand upon his head , took a seat to recover himself .
Parsing [sent. 16250 len. 19]: Mr Boffin , for his part , made no attempt to come down , but remained aloft disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 16251 len. 6]: ` Well , Boffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 16252 len. 14]: said Wegg , as soon as he was in a condidon to speak .
Parsing [sent. 16253 len. 7]: ` Now , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 16254 len. 12]: ` Yes , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 16255 len. 7]: ` Now , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 16256 len. 11]: ` You have no doubts about it , Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 16257 len. 5]: ` No , Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 16258 len. 4]: No , Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 16259 len. 10]: None , ' was the slow and sad reply .
Parsing [sent. 16260 len. 20]: ` Then , take care , you , ' said Wegg , ` that you stick to your conditions .
Parsing [sent. 16261 len. 47]: Mr Venus , if on this auspicious occasion , you should happen to have a drop of anything not quite so mild as tea in the ` ouse , I think I 'd take the friendly liberty of asking you for a specimen of it . '
Parsing [sent. 16262 len. 14]: Mr Venus , reminded of the duties of hospitality , produced some rum .
Parsing [sent. 16263 len. 16]: In answer to the inquiry , ` Will you mix it , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 16264 len. 12]: that gentleman pleasantly rejoined , ' I think not , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16265 len. 19]: On so auspicious an occasion , I prefer to take it in the form of a Gum-Tickler . '
Parsing [sent. 16266 len. 22]: Mr Boffin , declining rum , being still elevated on his pedestal , was in a convenient position to be addressed .
Parsing [sent. 16267 len. 23]: Wegg having eyed him with an impudent air at leisure , addressed him , therefore , while refreshing himself with his dram .
Parsing [sent. 16268 len. 6]: ` Bof -- fin ! '
Parsing [sent. 16269 len. 22]: ` Yes , Wegg , ' he answered , coming out of a fit of abstraction , with a sigh . '
Parsing [sent. 16270 len. 17]: I have n't mentioned one thing , because it 's a detail that comes of course .
Parsing [sent. 16271 len. 9]: You must be followed up , you know .
Parsing [sent. 16272 len. 9]: You must be kept under inspection . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16273 len. 11]: I do n't quite understand , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16274 len. 6]: ` Do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16275 len. 3]: sneered Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 16276 len. 8]: ` Where 's your wits , Boffin ?
Parsing [sent. 16277 len. 20]: Till the Mounds is down and this business completed , you 're accountable for all the property , recollect .
Parsing [sent. 16278 len. 6]: Consider yourself accountable to me .
Parsing [sent. 16279 len. 19]: Mr Venus here being too milk and watery with you , I am the boy for you . '
Parsing [sent. 16280 len. 30]: ` I 've been a-thinking , ' said Mr Boffin , in a tone of despondency , ` that I must keep the knowledge from my old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 16281 len. 11]: ` The knowledge of the diwision , d'ye mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 16282 len. 18]: inquired Wegg , helping himself to a third Gum-Tickler -- for he had already taken a second .
Parsing [sent. 16283 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 16284 len. 38]: If she was to die first of us two she might then think all her life , poor thing , that I had got the rest of the fortune still , and was saving it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16285 len. 55]: I suspect , Boffin , ' returned Wegg , shaking his head sagaciously , and bestowing a wooden wink upon him , ` that you 've found out some account of some old chap , supposed to be a Miser , who got himself the credit of having much more money than he had .
Parsing [sent. 16286 len. 8]: However , I do n't mind . '
Parsing [sent. 16287 len. 9]: ` Do n't you see , Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 16288 len. 13]: Mr Boffin feelingly represented to him : ` do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 16289 len. 11]: My old lady has got so used to the property .
Parsing [sent. 16290 len. 10]: It would be such a hard surprise . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16291 len. 12]: I do n't see it at all , ' blustered Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 16292 len. 10]: ` You 'll have as much as I shall .
Parsing [sent. 16293 len. 6]: And who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16294 len. 22]: ` But then , again , ' Mr Boffin gently represented ; ` my old lady has very upright principles . '
Parsing [sent. 16295 len. 24]: ` Who 's your old lady , ' returned Wegg , ` to set herself up for having uprighter principles than mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 16296 len. 18]: Mr Boffin seemed a little less patient at this point than at any other of the negotiations .
Parsing [sent. 16297 len. 25]: But he commanded himself , and said tamely enough : ' I think it must be kept from my old lady , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 16298 len. 28]: ` Well , ' said Wegg , contemptuously , though , perhaps , perceiving some hint of danger otherwise , ` keep it from your old lady .
Parsing [sent. 16299 len. 8]: I ai n't going to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 16300 len. 10]: I can have you under close inspection without that .
Parsing [sent. 16301 len. 12]: I 'm as good a man as you , and better .
Parsing [sent. 16302 len. 5]: Ask me to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 16303 len. 9]: Give me the run of your ` ouse .
Parsing [sent. 16304 len. 23]: I was good enough for you and your old lady once , when I helped you out with your weal and hammers .
Parsing [sent. 16305 len. 21]: Was there no Miss Elizabeth , Master George , Aunt Jane , and Uncle Parker , before YOU two ? '
Parsing [sent. 16306 len. 12]: ` Gently , Mr Wegg , gently , ' Venus urged .
Parsing [sent. 16307 len. 29]: ` Milk and water-erily you mean , sir , ' he returned , with some little thickness of speech , in consequence of the Gum-Ticklers having tickled it .
Parsing [sent. 16308 len. 14]: ` I 've got him under inspection , and I 'll inspect him .
Parsing [sent. 16309 len. 21]: `` Along the line the signal ran England expects as this present man Will keep Boffin to his duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 16310 len. 10]: -- Boffin , I 'll see you home . '
Parsing [sent. 16311 len. 22]: Mr Boffin descended with an air of resignation , and gave himself up , after taking friendly leave of Mr Venus .
Parsing [sent. 16312 len. 21]: Once more , Inspector and Inspected went through the streets together , and so arrived at Mr Boffin 's door .
Parsing [sent. 16313 len. 47]: But even there , when Mr Boffin had given his keeper good-night , and had let himself in with his key , and had softly closed the door , even there and then , the all-powerful Silas must needs claim another assertion of his newly-asserted power .
Parsing [sent. 16314 len. 6]: ` Bof -- fin ! '
Parsing [sent. 16315 len. 6]: he called through the keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 16316 len. 14]: ` Yes , Wegg , ' was the reply through the same channel .
Parsing [sent. 16317 len. 4]: ` Come out .
Parsing [sent. 16318 len. 4]: Show yourself again .
Parsing [sent. 16319 len. 9]: Let 's have another look at you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16320 len. 16]: Mr Boffin -- ah , how fallen from the high estate of his honest simplicity !
Parsing [sent. 16321 len. 7]: -- opened the door and obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 16322 len. 4]: ` Go in .
Parsing [sent. 16323 len. 15]: You may get to bed now , ' said Wegg , with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 16324 len. 20]: The door was hardly closed , when he again called through the keyhole : ` Bof -- fin ! '
Parsing [sent. 16325 len. 6]: ` Yes , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 16326 len. 38]: This time Silas made no reply , but laboured with a will at turning an imaginary grindstone outside the keyhole , while Mr Boffin stooped at it within ; he then laughed silently , and stumped home .
Parsing [sent. 16327 len. 29]: Chapter 4 A RUNAWAY MATCH Cherubic Pa arose with as little noise as possible from beside majestic Ma , one morning early , having a holiday before him .
Parsing [sent. 16328 len. 13]: Pa and the lovely woman had a rather particular appointment to keep .
Parsing [sent. 16329 len. 12]: Yet Pa and the lovely woman were not going out together .
Parsing [sent. 16330 len. 12]: Bella was up before four , but had no bonnet on .
Parsing [sent. 16331 len. 44]: She was waiting at the foot of the stairs -- was sitting on the bottom stair , in fact -- to receive Pa when he came down , but her only object seemed to be to get Pa well out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 16332 len. 41]: ` Your breakfast is ready , sir , ' whispered Bella , after greeting him with a hug , ` and all you have to do , is , to eat it up and drink it up , and escape .
Parsing [sent. 16333 len. 8]: How do you feel , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16334 len. 34]: ` To the best of my judgement , like a housebreaker new to the business , my dear , who ca n't make himself quite comfortable till he is off the premises . '
Parsing [sent. 16335 len. 58]: Bella tucked her arm in his with a merry noiseless laugh , and they went down to the kitchen on tiptoe ; she stopping on every separate stair to put the tip of her forefinger on her rosy lips , and then lay it on his lips , according to her favourite petting way of kissing Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 16336 len. 10]: ` How do YOU feel , my love ? '
Parsing [sent. 16337 len. 12]: asked R. W. , as she gave him his breakfast . '
Parsing [sent. 16338 len. 26]: I feel as if the Fortune-teller was coming true , dear Pa , and the fair little man was turning out as was predicted . '
Parsing [sent. 16339 len. 3]: ` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 16340 len. 7]: Only the fair little man ? '
Parsing [sent. 16341 len. 4]: said her father .
Parsing [sent. 16342 len. 32]: Bella put another of those finger-seals upon his lips , and then said , kneeling down by him as he sat at table : ` Now , look here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16343 len. 18]: If you keep well up to the mark this day , what do you think you deserve ?
Parsing [sent. 16344 len. 19]: What did I promise you should have , if you were good , upon a certain occasion ? '
Parsing [sent. 16345 len. 11]: ` Upon my word I do n't remember , Precious .
Parsing [sent. 16346 len. 7]: Yes , I do , though .
Parsing [sent. 16347 len. 12]: Was n't it one of these beau -- tiful tresses ? '
Parsing [sent. 16348 len. 8]: with his caressing hand upon her hair .
Parsing [sent. 16349 len. 8]: ` Was n't it , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 16350 len. 7]: returned Bella , pretending to pout .
Parsing [sent. 16351 len. 5]: ` Upon my word !
Parsing [sent. 16352 len. 39]: Do you know , sir , that the Fortune-teller would give five thousand guineas -LRB- if it was quite convenient to him , which it is n't -RRB- for the lovely piece I have cut off for you ?
Parsing [sent. 16353 len. 31]: You can form no idea , sir , of the number of times he kissed quite a scrubby little piece -- in comparison -- that I cut off for HIM .
Parsing [sent. 16354 len. 16]: And he wears it , too , round his neck , I can tell you !
Parsing [sent. 16355 len. 5]: Near his heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 16356 len. 5]: said Bella , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 16357 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 16358 len. 5]: very near his heart !
Parsing [sent. 16359 len. 58]: However , you have been a good , good boy , and you are the best of all the dearest boys that ever were , this morning , and here 's the chain I have made of it , Pa , and you must let me put it round your neck with my own loving hands . '
Parsing [sent. 16360 len. 70]: As Pa bent his head , she cried over him a little , and then said -LRB- after having stopped to dry her eyes on his white waistcoat , the discovery of which incongruous circumstance made her laugh -RRB- : ` Now , darling Pa , give me your hands that I may fold them together , and do you say after me : -- My little Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 16361 len. 10]: ` My little Bella , ' repeated Pa. . '
Parsing [sent. 16362 len. 9]: I am very fond of you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16363 len. 14]: I am very fond of you , my darling , ' said Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 16364 len. 13]: ` You must n't say anything not dictated to you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16365 len. 26]: You dare n't do it in your responses at Church , and you must n't do it in your responses out of Church . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16366 len. 9]: I withdraw the darling , ' said Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 16367 len. 7]: ` That 's a pious boy !
Parsing [sent. 16368 len. 19]: Now again : -- You were always -- ' ` You were always , ' repeated Pa. . '
Parsing [sent. 16369 len. 15]: A vexatious -- ' ` No you were n't , ' said Pa. . '
Parsing [sent. 16370 len. 10]: A vexatious -LRB- do you hear , sir ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 16371 len. 34]: , a vexatious , capricious , thankless , troublesome , Animal ; but I hope you 'll do better in the time to come , and I bless you and forgive you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16372 len. 22]: Here , she quite forgot that it was Pa 's turn to make the responses , and clung to his neck .
Parsing [sent. 16373 len. 45]: ` Dear Pa , if you knew how much I think this morning of what you told me once , about the first time of our seeing old Mr Harmon , when I stamped and screamed and beat you with my detestable little bonnet !
Parsing [sent. 16374 len. 28]: I feel as if I had been stamping and screaming and beating you with my hateful little bonnet , ever since I was born , darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 16375 len. 6]: ` Nonsense , my love .
Parsing [sent. 16376 len. 36]: And as to your bonnets , they have always been nice bonnets , for they have always become you -- or you have become them ; perhaps it was that -- at every age . '
Parsing [sent. 16377 len. 12]: ` Did I hurt you much , poor little Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16378 len. 27]: asked Bella , laughing -LRB- notwithstanding her repentance -RRB- , with fantastic pleasure in the picture , ` when I beat you with my bonnet ? '
Parsing [sent. 16379 len. 6]: ` No , my child .
Parsing [sent. 16380 len. 8]: Would n't have hurt a fly ! '
Parsing [sent. 16381 len. 28]: ` Ay , but I am afraid I should n't have beat you at all , unless I had meant to hurt you , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 16382 len. 10]: ` Did I pinch your legs , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16383 len. 23]: ` Not much , my dear ; but I think it 's almost time I -- ' ` Oh , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 16384 len. 3]: cried Bella .
Parsing [sent. 16385 len. 13]: ` If I go on chattering , you 'll be taken alive .
Parsing [sent. 16386 len. 7]: Fly , Pa , fly ! '
Parsing [sent. 16387 len. 39]: So , they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe , and Bella with her light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door , and Pa , having received a parting hug , made off .
Parsing [sent. 16388 len. 12]: When he had gone a little way , he looked back .
Parsing [sent. 16389 len. 25]: Upon which , Bella set another of those finger seals upon the air , and thrust out her little foot expressive of the mark .
Parsing [sent. 16390 len. 22]: Pa , in appropriate action , expressed fidelity to the mark , and made off as fast as he could go .
Parsing [sent. 16391 len. 49]: Bella walked thoughtfully in the garden for an hour and more , and then , returning to the bedroom where Lavvy the Irrepressible still slumbered , put on a little bonnet of quiet , but on the whole of sly appearance , which she had yesterday made . '
Parsing [sent. 16392 len. 21]: I am going for a walk , Lavvy , ' she said , as she stooped down and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 16393 len. 35]: The Irrepressible , with a bounce in the bed , and a remark that it was n't time to get up yet , relapsed into unconsciousness , if she had come out of it .
Parsing [sent. 16394 len. 16]: Behold Bella tripping along the streets , the dearest girl afoot under the summer sun !
Parsing [sent. 16395 len. 18]: Behold Pa waiting for Bella behind a pump , at least three miles from the parental roof-tree .
Parsing [sent. 16396 len. 11]: Behold Bella and Pa aboard an early steamboat for Greenwich .
Parsing [sent. 16397 len. 6]: Were they expected at Greenwich ?
Parsing [sent. 16398 len. 2]: Probably .
Parsing [sent. 16399 len. 36]: At least , Mr John Rokesmith was on the pier looking out , about a couple of hours before the coaly -LRB- but to him gold-dusty -RRB- little steamboat got her steam up in London .
Parsing [sent. 16400 len. 2]: Probably .
Parsing [sent. 16401 len. 16]: At least , Mr John Rokesmith seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board .
Parsing [sent. 16402 len. 2]: Probably .
Parsing [sent. 16403 len. 59]: At least , Bella no sooner stepped ashore than she took Mr John Rokesmith 's arm , without evincing surprise , and the two walked away together with an ethereal air of happiness which , as it were , wafted up from the earth and drew after them a gruff and glum old pensioner to see it out .
Parsing [sent. 16404 len. 51]: Two wooden legs had this gruff and glum old pensioner , and , a minute before Bella stepped out of the boat , and drew that confiding little arm of hers through Rokesmith 's , he had had no object in life but tobacco , and not enough of that .
Parsing [sent. 16405 len. 26]: Stranded was Gruff and Glum in a harbour of everlasting mud , when all in an instant Bella floated him , and away he went .
Parsing [sent. 16406 len. 16]: Say , cherubic parent taking the lead , in what direction do we steer first ?
Parsing [sent. 16407 len. 52]: With some such inquiry in his thoughts , Gruff and Glum , stricken by so sudden an interest that he perked his neck and looked over the intervening people , as if he were trying to stand on tiptoe with his two wooden legs , took an observation of R. W .
Parsing [sent. 16408 len. 35]: There was no ` first ' in the case , Gruff and Glum made out ; the cherubic parent was bearing down and crowding on direct for Greenwich church , to see his relations .
Parsing [sent. 16409 len. 49]: For , Gruff and Glum , though most events acted on him simply as tobacco-stoppers , pressing down and condensing the quids within him , might be imagined to trace a family resemblance between the cherubs in the church architecture , and the cherub in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 16410 len. 41]: Some remembrance of old Valentines , wherein a cherub , less appropriately attired for a proverbially uncertain climate , had been seen conducting lovers to the altar , might have been fancied to inflame the ardour of his timber toes .
Parsing [sent. 16411 len. 18]: Be it as it might , he gave his moorings the slip , and followed in chase .
Parsing [sent. 16412 len. 24]: The cherub went before , all beaming smiles ; Bella and John Rokesmith followed ; Gruff and Glum stuck to them like wax .
Parsing [sent. 16413 len. 36]: For years , the wings of his mind had gone to look after the legs of his body ; but Bella had brought them back for him per steamer , and they were spread again .
Parsing [sent. 16414 len. 33]: He was a slow sailer on a wind of happiness , but he took a cross cut for the rendezvous , and pegged away as if he were scoring furiously at cribbage .
Parsing [sent. 16415 len. 22]: When the shadow of the church-porch swallowed them up , victorious Gruff and Glum likewise presented himself to be swallowed up .
Parsing [sent. 16416 len. 78]: And by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise , that , but for the two wooden legs on which Gruff and Glum was reassuringly mounted , his conscience might have introduced , in the person of that pensioner , his own stately lady disguised , arrived at Greenwich in a car and griffins , like the spiteful Fairy at the christenings of the Princesses , to do something dreadful to the marriage service .
Parsing [sent. 16417 len. 37]: And truly he had a momentary reason to be pale of face , and to whisper to Bella , ` You do n't think that can be your Ma ; do you , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 16418 len. 30]: on account of a mysterious rustling and a stealthy movement somewhere in the remote neighbourhood of the organ , though it was gone directly and was heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 16419 len. 19]: Albeit it was heard of afterwards , as will afterwards be read in this veracious register of marriage .
Parsing [sent. 16420 len. 3]: Who taketh ?
Parsing [sent. 16421 len. 11]: I , John , and so do I , Bella .
Parsing [sent. 16422 len. 3]: Who giveth ?
Parsing [sent. 16423 len. 41]: I , R. W. Forasmuch , Gruff and Glum , as John and Bella have consented together in holy wedlock , you may -LRB- in short -RRB- consider it done , and withdraw your two wooden legs from this temple .
Parsing [sent. 16424 len. 32]: To the foregoing purport , the Minister speaking , as directed by the Rubric , to the People , selectly represented in the present instance by G. and G. above mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 16425 len. 39]: And now , the church-porch having swallowed up Bella Wilfer for ever and ever , had it not in its power to relinquish that young woman , but slid into the happy sunlight , Mrs John Rokesmith instead .
Parsing [sent. 16426 len. 27]: And long on the bright steps stood Gruff and Glum , looking after the pretty bride , with a narcotic consciousness of having dreamed a dream .
Parsing [sent. 16427 len. 31]: After which , Bella took out from her pocket a little letter , and read it aloud to Pa and John ; this being a true copy of the same .
Parsing [sent. 16428 len. 43]: ` DEAREST MA , ' I hope you wo n't be angry , but I am most happily married to Mr John Rokesmith , who loves me better than I can ever deserve , except by loving him with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 16429 len. 21]: I thought it best not to mention it beforehand , in case it should cause any little difference at home .
Parsing [sent. 16430 len. 5]: Please tell darling Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 16431 len. 22]: With love to Lavvy , ` Ever dearest Ma , Your affectionate daughter , Bella -LRB- P.S. -- Rokesmith -RRB- . '
Parsing [sent. 16432 len. 27]: Then , John Rokesmith put the queen 's countenance on the letter -- when had Her Gracious Majesty looked so benign as on that blessed morning !
Parsing [sent. 16433 len. 32]: -- and then Bella popped it into the post-office , and said merrily , ` Now , dearest Pa , you are safe , and will never be taken alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 16434 len. 77]: Pa was , at first , in the stirred depths of his conscience , so far from sure of being safe yet , that he made out majestic matrons lurking in ambush among the harmless trees of Greenwich Park , and seemed to see a stately countenance tied up in a well-known pockethandkerchief glooming down at him from a window of the Observatory , where the Familiars of the Astronomer Royal nightly outwatch the winking stars .
Parsing [sent. 16435 len. 44]: But , the minutes passing on and no Mrs Wilfer in the flesh appearing , he became more confident , and so repaired with good heart and appetite to Mr and Mrs John Rokesmith 's cottage on Blackheath , where breakfast was ready .
Parsing [sent. 16436 len. 22]: A modest little cottage but a bright and a fresh , and on the snowy tablecloth the prettiest of little breakfasts .
Parsing [sent. 16437 len. 80]: In waiting , too , like an attendant summer breeze , a fluttering young damsel , all pink and ribbons , blushing as if she had been married instead of Bella , and yet asserting the triumph of her sex over both John and Pa , in an exulting and exalted flurry : as who should say , ` This is what you must all come to , gentlemen , when we choose to bring you to book . '
Parsing [sent. 16438 len. 92]: This same young damsel was Bella 's serving-maid , and unto her did deliver a bunch of keys , commanding treasures in the way of dry-saltery , groceries , jams and pickles , the investigation of which made pastime after breakfast , when Bella declared that ` Pa must taste everything , John dear , or it will never be lucky , ' and when Pa had all sorts of things poked into his mouth , and did n't quite know what to do with them when they were put there .
Parsing [sent. 16439 len. 48]: Then they , all three , out for a charming ride , and for a charming stroll among heath in bloom , and there behold the identical Gruff and Glum with his wooden legs horizontally disposed before him , apparently sitting meditating on the vicissitudes of life !
Parsing [sent. 16440 len. 13]: To whom said Bella , in her light-hearted surprise : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 16441 len. 6]: How do you do again ?
Parsing [sent. 16442 len. 9]: What a dear old pensioner you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 16443 len. 50]: To which Gruff and Glum responded that he see her married this morning , my Beauty , and that if it war n't a liberty he wished her ji and the fairest of fair wind and weather ; further , in a general way requesting to know what cheer ?
Parsing [sent. 16444 len. 29]: and scrambling up on his two wooden legs to salute , hat in hand , ship-shape , with the gallantry of a man-of-warsman and a heart of oak .
Parsing [sent. 16445 len. 51]: It was a pleasant sight , in the midst of the golden bloom , to see this salt old Gruff and Glum , waving his shovel hat at Bella , while his thin white hair flowed free , as if she had once more launched him into blue water again .
Parsing [sent. 16446 len. 30]: ` You are a charming old pensioner , ' said Bella , ` and I am so happy that I wish I could make you happy , too . '
Parsing [sent. 16447 len. 23]: Answered Gruff and Glum , ` Give me leave to kiss your hand , my Lovely , and it 's done ! '
Parsing [sent. 16448 len. 49]: So it was done to the general contentment ; and if Gruff and Glum did n't in the course of the afternoon splice the main brace , it was not for want of the means of inflicting that outrage on the feelings of the Infant Bands of Hope .
Parsing [sent. 16449 len. 47]: But , the marriage dinner was the crowning success , for what had bride and bridegroom plotted to do , but to have and to hold that dinner in the very room of the very hotel where Pa and the lovely woman had once dined together !
Parsing [sent. 16450 len. 40]: Bella sat between Pa and John , and divided her attentions pretty equally , but felt it necessary -LRB- in the waiter 's absence before dinner -RRB- to remind Pa that she was HIS lovely woman no longer . '
Parsing [sent. 16451 len. 23]: I am well aware of it , my dear , ' returned the cherub , ` and I resign you willingly . '
Parsing [sent. 16452 len. 5]: ` Willingly , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 16453 len. 7]: You ought to be brokenhearted . '
Parsing [sent. 16454 len. 21]: ` So I should be , my dear , if I thought that I was going to lose you . '
Parsing [sent. 16455 len. 16]: ` But you know you are not ; do n't you , poor dear Pa ?
Parsing [sent. 16456 len. 44]: You know that you have only made a new relation who will be as fond of you and as thankful to you -- for my sake and your own sake both -- as I am ; do n't you , dear little Pa ?
Parsing [sent. 16457 len. 6]: Look here , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 16458 len. 30]: Bella put her finger on her own lip , and then on Pa 's , and then on her own lip again , and then on her husband 's .
Parsing [sent. 16459 len. 83]: ` Now , we are a partnership of three , dear Pa. ' The appearance of dinner here cut Bella short in one of her disappearances : the more effectually , because it was put on under the auspices of a solemn gentleman in black clothes and a white cravat , who looked much more like a clergyman than THE clergyman , and seemed to have mounted a great deal higher in the church : not to say , scaled the steeple .
Parsing [sent. 16460 len. 32]: This dignitary , conferring in secrecy with John Rokesmith on the subject of punch and wines , bent his head as though stooping to the Papistical practice of receiving auricular confession .
Parsing [sent. 16461 len. 26]: Likewise , on John 's offering a suggestion which did n't meet his views , his face became overcast and reproachful , as enjoining penance .
Parsing [sent. 16462 len. 4]: What a dinner !
Parsing [sent. 16463 len. 81]: Specimens of all the fishes that swim in the sea , surely had swum their way to it , and if samples of the fishes of divers colours that made a speech in the Arabian Nights -LRB- quite a ministerial explanation in respect of cloudiness -RRB- , and then jumped out of the frying-pan , were not to be recognized , it was only because they had all become of one hue by being cooked in batter among the whitebait .
Parsing [sent. 16464 len. 44]: And the dishes being seasoned with Bliss -- an article which they are sometimes out of , at Greenwich -- were of perfect flavour , and the golden drinks had been bottled in the golden age and hoarding up their sparkles ever since .
Parsing [sent. 16465 len. 34]: The best of it was , that Bella and John and the cherub had made a covenant that they would not reveal to mortal eyes any appearance whatever of being a wedding party .
Parsing [sent. 16466 len. 24]: Now , the supervising dignitary , the Archbishop of Greenwich , knew this as well as if he had performed the nuptial ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 16467 len. 36]: And the loftiness with which his Grace entered into their confidence without being invited , and insisted on a show of keeping the waiters out of it , was the crowning glory of the entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 16468 len. 57]: There was an innocent young waiter of a slender form and with weakish legs , as yet unversed in the wiles of waiterhood , and but too evidently of a romantic temperament , and deeply -LRB- it were not too much to add hopelessly -RRB- in love with some young female not aware of his merit .
Parsing [sent. 16469 len. 42]: This guileless youth , descrying the position of affairs , which even his innocence could not mistake , limited his waiting to languishing admiringly against the sideboard when Bella did n't want anything , and swooping at her when she did .
Parsing [sent. 16470 len. 57]: Him , his Grace the Archbishop perpetually obstructed , cutting him out with his elbow in the moment of success , despatching him in degrading quest of melted butter , and , when by any chance he got hold of any dish worth having , bereaving him of it , and ordering him to stand back .
Parsing [sent. 16471 len. 35]: ` Pray excuse him , madam , ' said the Archbishop in a low stately voice ; ` he is a very young man on liking , and we DO N'T like him . '
Parsing [sent. 16472 len. 47]: This induced John Rokesmith to observe -- by way of making the thing more natural -- ` Bella , my love , this is so much more successful than any of our past anniversaries , that I think we must keep our future anniversaries here . '
Parsing [sent. 16473 len. 30]: Whereunto Bella replied , with probably the least successful attempt at looking matronly that ever was seen : ` Indeed , I think so , John , dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16474 len. 42]: Here the Archbishop of Greenwich coughed a stately cough to attract the attention of three of his ministers present , and staring at them , seemed to say : ' I call upon you by your fealty to believe this ! '
Parsing [sent. 16475 len. 67]: With his own hands he afterwards put on the dessert , as remarking to the three guests , ` The period has now arrived at which we can dispense with the assistance of those fellows who are not in our confidence , ' and would have retired with complete dignity but for a daring action issuing from the misguided brain of the young man on liking .
Parsing [sent. 16476 len. 34]: He finding , by ill-fortune , a piece of orange flower somewhere in the lobbies now approached undetected with the same in a finger-glass , and placed it on Bella 's right hand .
Parsing [sent. 16477 len. 15]: The Archbishop instantly ejected and excommunicated him ; but the thing was done . '
Parsing [sent. 16478 len. 50]: I trust , madam , ' said his Grace , returning alone , ` that you will have the kindness to overlook it , in consideration of its being the act of a very young man who is merely here on liking , and who will never answer . '
Parsing [sent. 16479 len. 20]: With that , he solemnly bowed and retired , and they all burst into laughter , long and merry .
Parsing [sent. 16480 len. 36]: ` Disguise is of no use , ' said Bella ; ` they all find me out ; I think it must be , Pa and John dear , because I look so happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 16481 len. 50]: Her husband feeling it necessary at this point to demand one of those mysterious disappearances on Bella 's part , she dutifully obeyed ; saying in a softened voice from her place of concealment : ` You remember how we talked about the ships that day , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16482 len. 7]: ` Yes , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16483 len. 23]: ` Is n't it strange , now , to think that there was no John in all the ships , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16484 len. 9]: ` Not at all , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16485 len. 5]: ` Oh , Pa !
Parsing [sent. 16486 len. 5]: Not at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 16487 len. 6]: ` No , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 16488 len. 24]: How can we tell what coming people are aboard the ships that may be sailing to us now from the unknown seas ! '
Parsing [sent. 16489 len. 29]: Bella remaining invisible and silent , her father remained at his dessert and wine , until he remembered it was time for him to get home to Holloway .
Parsing [sent. 16490 len. 38]: ` Though I positively can not tear myself away , ' he cherubically added , ' -- it would be a sin -- without drinking to many , many happy returns of this most happy day . '
Parsing [sent. 16491 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 16492 len. 5]: ten thousand times ! '
Parsing [sent. 16493 len. 4]: cried John . '
Parsing [sent. 16494 len. 11]: I fill my glass and my precious wife 's . '
Parsing [sent. 16495 len. 76]: ` Gentlemen , ' said the cherub , inaudibly addressing , in his AngloSaxon tendency to throw his feelings into the form of a speech , the boys down below , who were bidding against each other to put their heads in the mud for sixpence : ` Gentlemen -- and Bella and John -- you will readily suppose that it is not my intention to trouble you with many observations on the present occasion .
Parsing [sent. 16496 len. 25]: You will also at once infer the nature and even the terms of the toast I am about to propose on the present occasion .
Parsing [sent. 16497 len. 25]: Gentlemen -- and Bella and John -- the present occasion is an occasion fraught with feelings that I can not trust myself to express .
Parsing [sent. 16498 len. 71]: But gentlemen -- and Bella and John -- for the part I have had in it , for the confidence you have placed in me , and for the affectionate good-nature and kindness with which you have determined not to find me in the way , when I am well aware that I can not be otherwise than in it more or less , I do most heartily thank you .
Parsing [sent. 16499 len. 51]: Gentlemen -- and Bella and John -- my love to you , and may we meet , as on the present occasion , on many future occasions ; that is to say , gentlemen -- and Bella and John -- on many happy returns of the present happy occasion . '
Parsing [sent. 16500 len. 47]: Having thus concluded his address , the amiable cherub embraced his daughter , and took his flight to the steamboat which was to convey him to London , and was then lying at the floating pier , doing its best to bump the same to bits .
Parsing [sent. 16501 len. 39]: But , the happy couple were not going to part with him in that way , and before he had been on board two minutes , there they were , looking down at him from the wharf above .
Parsing [sent. 16502 len. 6]: ` Pa , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 16503 len. 19]: cried Bella , beckoning him with her parasol to approach the side , and bending gracefully to whisper .
Parsing [sent. 16504 len. 7]: ` Yes , my darling . '
Parsing [sent. 16505 len. 15]: ` Did I beat you much with that horrid little bonnet , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16506 len. 10]: ` Nothing to speak of ; my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16507 len. 10]: ` Did I pinch your legs , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16508 len. 8]: ` Only nicely , my pet . '
Parsing [sent. 16509 len. 11]: ` You are sure you quite forgive me , Pa ?
Parsing [sent. 16510 len. 11]: Please , Pa , please , forgive me quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 16511 len. 59]: Half laughing at him and half crying to him , Bella besought him in the prettiest manner ; in a manner so engaging and so playful and so natural , that her cherubic parent made a coaxing face as if she had never grown up , and said , ` What a silly little Mouse it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 16512 len. 19]: ` But you do forgive me that , and everything else ; do n't you , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16513 len. 7]: ` Yes , my dearest . '
Parsing [sent. 16514 len. 21]: ` And you do n't feel solitary or neglected , going away by yourself ; do you , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16515 len. 5]: ` Lord bless you !
Parsing [sent. 16516 len. 6]: No , my Life ! '
Parsing [sent. 16517 len. 6]: ` Good-bye , dearest Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 16518 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 16519 len. 6]: ` Good-bye , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 16520 len. 8]: Take her away , my dear John .
Parsing [sent. 16521 len. 5]: Take her home ! '
Parsing [sent. 16522 len. 29]: So , she leaning on her husband 's arm , they turned homeward by a rosy path which the gracious sun struck out for them in its setting .
Parsing [sent. 16523 len. 15]: And O there are days in this life , worth life and worth death .
Parsing [sent. 16524 len. 30]: And O what a bright old song it is , that O 't is love , 't is love , 't is love that makes the world go round !
Parsing [sent. 16525 len. 85]: Chapter 5 CONCERNING THE MENDICANT 'S BRIDE The impressive gloom with which Mrs Wilfer received her husband on his return from the wedding , knocked so hard at the door of the cherubic conscience , and likewise so impaired the firmness of the cherubic legs , that the culprit 's tottering condition of mind and body might have roused suspicion in less occupied persons that the grimly heroic lady , Miss Lavinia , and that esteemed friend of the family , Mr George Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 16526 len. 47]: But , the attention of all three being fully possessed by the main fact of the marriage , they had happily none to bestow on the guilty conspirator ; to which fortunate circumstance he owed the escape for which he was in nowise indebted to himself .
Parsing [sent. 16527 len. 24]: ` You do not , R. W. ' said Mrs Wilfer from her stately corner , ` inquire for your daughter Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 16528 len. 26]: ` To be sure , my dear , ' he returned , with a most flagrant assumption of unconsciousness , ' I did omit it .
Parsing [sent. 16529 len. 14]: How -- or perhaps I should rather say where -- IS Bella ? '
Parsing [sent. 16530 len. 13]: ` Not here , ' Mrs Wilfer proclaimed , with folded arms .
Parsing [sent. 16531 len. 19]: The cherub faintly muttered something to the abortive effect of ` Oh , indeed , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 16532 len. 15]: ` Not here , ' repeated Mrs Wilfer , in a stern sonorous voice .
Parsing [sent. 16533 len. 15]: ` In a word , R. W. , you have no daughter Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 16534 len. 9]: ` No daughter Bella , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 16535 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 16536 len. 70]: Your daughter Bella , ' said Mrs Wilfer , with a lofty air of never having had the least copartnership in that young lady : of whom she now made reproachful mention as an article of luxury which her husband had set up entirely on his own account , and in direct opposition to her advice : ' -- your daughter Bella has bestowed herself upon a Mendicant . '
Parsing [sent. 16537 len. 8]: ` Good gracious , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 16538 len. 31]: ` Show your father his daughter Bella 's letter , Lavinia , ' said Mrs Wilfer , in her monotonous Act of Parliament tone , and waving her hand . '
Parsing [sent. 16539 len. 17]: I think your father will admit it to be documentary proof of what I tell him .
Parsing [sent. 16540 len. 13]: I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter Bella 's writing .
Parsing [sent. 16541 len. 6]: But I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 16542 len. 8]: He may tell you he is not .
Parsing [sent. 16543 len. 6]: Nothing will surprise me . '
Parsing [sent. 16544 len. 25]: ` Posted at Greenwich , and dated this morning , ' said the Irrepressible , flouncing at her father in handing him the evidence .
Parsing [sent. 16545 len. 62]: ` Hopes Ma wo n't be angry , but is happily married to Mr John Rokesmith , and did n't mention it beforehand to avoid words , and please tell darling you , and love to me , and I should like to know what you 'd have said if any other unmarried member of the family had done it ! '
Parsing [sent. 16546 len. 13]: He read the letter , and faintly exclaimed ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16547 len. 9]: ` You may well say Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16548 len. 9]: rejoined Mrs Wilfer , in a deep tone .
Parsing [sent. 16549 len. 35]: Upon which encouragement he said it again , though scarcely with the success he had expected ; for the scornful lady then remarked , with extreme bitterness : ` You said that before . '
Parsing [sent. 16550 len. 6]: ` It 's very surprising .
Parsing [sent. 16551 len. 32]: But I suppose , my dear , ' hinted the cherub , as he folded the letter after a disconcerting silence , ` that we must make the best of it ?
Parsing [sent. 16552 len. 35]: Would you object to my pointing out , my dear , that Mr John Rokesmith is not -LRB- so far as I am acquainted with him -RRB- , strictly speaking , a Mendicant . '
Parsing [sent. 16553 len. 4]: ` Indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 16554 len. 11]: returned Mrs Wilfer , with an awful air of politeness .
Parsing [sent. 16555 len. 4]: ` Truly so ?
Parsing [sent. 16556 len. 15]: I was not aware that Mr John Rokesmith was a gentleman of landed property .
Parsing [sent. 16557 len. 11]: But I am much relieved to hear it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16558 len. 18]: I doubt if you HAVE heard it , my dear , ' the cherub submitted with hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 16559 len. 10]: ` Thank you , ' said Mrs Wilfer . '
Parsing [sent. 16560 len. 8]: I make false statements , it appears ?
Parsing [sent. 16561 len. 4]: So be it .
Parsing [sent. 16562 len. 13]: If my daughter flies in my face , surely my husband may .
Parsing [sent. 16563 len. 11]: The one thing is not more unnatural than the other .
Parsing [sent. 16564 len. 8]: There seems a fitness in the arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 16565 len. 5]: By all means ! '
Parsing [sent. 16566 len. 12]: Assuming , with a shiver of resignation , a deadly cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 16567 len. 20]: But , here the Irrepressible skirmished into the conflict , dragging the reluctant form of Mr Sampson after her .
Parsing [sent. 16568 len. 52]: ` Ma , ' interposed the young lady , ' I must say I think it would be much better if you would keep to the point , and not hold forth about people 's flying into people 's faces , which is nothing more nor less than impossible nonsense . '
Parsing [sent. 16569 len. 4]: ` How ! '
Parsing [sent. 16570 len. 9]: exclaimed Mrs Wilfer , knitting her dark brows .
Parsing [sent. 16571 len. 26]: ` Just im-possible nonsense , Ma , ' returned Lavvy , ` and George Sampson knows it is , as well as I do . '
Parsing [sent. 16572 len. 47]: Mrs Wilfer suddenly becoming petrified , fixed her indignant eyes upon the wretched George : who , divided between the support due from him to his love , and the support due from him to his love 's mamma , supported nobody , not even himself .
Parsing [sent. 16573 len. 131]: ` The true point is , ' pursued Lavinia , ` that Bella has behaved in a most unsisterly way to me , and might have severely compromised me with George and with George 's family , by making off and getting married in this very low and disreputable manner -- with some pew-opener or other , I suppose , for a bridesmaid -- when she ought to have confided in me , and ought to have said , `` If , Lavvy , you consider it due to your engagement with George , that you should countenance the occasion by being present , then Lavvy , I beg you to BE present , keeping my secret from Ma and Pa. '' As of course I should have done . '
Parsing [sent. 16574 len. 9]: ` As of course you would have done ?
Parsing [sent. 16575 len. 3]: Ingrate ! '
Parsing [sent. 16576 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 16577 len. 5]: ` Viper ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16578 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 16579 len. 4]: You know ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 16580 len. 34]: Upon my honour you must n't , ' Mr Sampson remonstrated , shaking his head seriously , ` With the highest respect for you , ma'am , upon my life you must n't .
Parsing [sent. 16581 len. 6]: No really , you know .
Parsing [sent. 16582 len. 38]: When a man with the feelings of a gentleman finds himself engaged to a young lady , and it comes -LRB- even on the part of a member of the family -RRB- to vipers , you know !
Parsing [sent. 16583 len. 25]: -- I would merely put it to your own good feeling , you know , ' said Mr Sampson , in rather lame conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 16584 len. 37]: Mrs Wilfer 's baleful stare at the young gentleman in acknowledgment of his obliging interference was of such a nature that Miss Lavinia burst into tears , and caught him round the neck for his protection .
Parsing [sent. 16585 len. 18]: ` My own unnatural mother , ' screamed the young lady , ` wants to annihilate George !
Parsing [sent. 16586 len. 9]: But you sha n't be annihilated , George .
Parsing [sent. 16587 len. 6]: I 'll die first ! '
Parsing [sent. 16588 len. 47]: Mr Sampson , in the arms of his mistress , still struggled to shake his head at Mrs Wilfer , and to remark : ` With every sentiment of respect for you , you know , ma'am -- vipers really does n't do you credit . '
Parsing [sent. 16589 len. 10]: ` You shall not be annihilated , George ! '
Parsing [sent. 16590 len. 4]: cried Miss Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 16591 len. 14]: ` Ma shall destroy me first , and then she 'll be contented .
Parsing [sent. 16592 len. 6]: Oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 16593 len. 14]: Have I lured George from his happy home to expose him to this !
Parsing [sent. 16594 len. 7]: George , dear , be free !
Parsing [sent. 16595 len. 14]: Leave me , ever dearest George , to Ma and to my fate .
Parsing [sent. 16596 len. 28]: Give my love to your aunt , George dear , and implore her not to curse the viper that has crossed your path and blighted your existence .
Parsing [sent. 16597 len. 7]: Oh , oh , oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 16598 len. 84]: The young lady who , hysterically speaking , was only just come of age , and had never gone off yet , here fell into a highly creditable crisis , which , regarded as a first performance , was very successful ; Mr Sampson , bending over the body meanwhile , in a state of distraction , which induced him to address Mrs Wilfer in the inconsistent expressions : ` Demon -- with the highest respect for you -- behold your work ! '
Parsing [sent. 16599 len. 42]: The cherub stood helplessly rubbing his chin and looking on , but on the whole was inclined to welcome this diversion as one in which , by reason of the absorbent properties of hysterics , the previous question would become absorbed .
Parsing [sent. 16600 len. 31]: And so , indeed , it proved , for the Irrepressible gradually coming to herself ; and asking with wild emotion , ` George dear , are you safe ? '
Parsing [sent. 16601 len. 11]: and further , ` George love , what has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 16602 len. 5]: Where is Ma ? '
Parsing [sent. 16603 len. 32]: Mr Sampson , with words of comfort , raised her prostrate form , and handed her to Mrs Wilfer as if the young lady were something in the nature of refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 16604 len. 74]: Mrs Wilfer with dignity partaking of the refreshments , by kissing her once on the brow -LRB- as if accepting an oyster -RRB- , Miss Lavvy , tottering , returned to the protection of Mr Sampson ; to whom she said , ` George dear , I am afraid I have been foolish ; but I am still a little weak and giddy ; do n't let go my hand , George ! '
Parsing [sent. 16605 len. 40]: And whom she afterwards greatly agitated at intervals , by giving utterance , when least expected , to a sound between a sob and a bottle of soda water , that seemed to rend the bosom of her frock .
Parsing [sent. 16606 len. 55]: Among the most remarkable effects of this crisis may be mentioned its having , when peace was restored , an inexplicable moral influence , of an elevating kind , on Miss Lavinia , Mrs Wilfer , and Mr George Sampson , from which R. W. was altogether excluded , as an outsider and non-sympathizer .
Parsing [sent. 16607 len. 34]: Miss Lavinia assumed a modest air of having distinguished herself ; Mrs Wilfer , a serene air of forgiveness and resignation ; Mr Sampson , an air of having been improved and chastened .
Parsing [sent. 16608 len. 14]: The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question .
Parsing [sent. 16609 len. 44]: ` George dear , ' said Lavvy , with a melancholy smile , ` after what has passed , I am sure Ma will tell Pa that he may tell Bella we shall all be glad to see her and her husband . '
Parsing [sent. 16610 len. 26]: Mr Sampson said he was sure of it too ; murmuring how eminently he respected Mrs Wilfer , and ever must , and ever would .
Parsing [sent. 16611 len. 13]: Never more eminently , he added , than after what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 16612 len. 57]: ` Far be it from me , ' said Mrs Wilfer , making deep proclamation from her corner , ` to run counter to the feelings of a child of mine , and of a Youth , ' Mr Sampson hardly seemed to like that word , ` who is the object of her maiden preference .
Parsing [sent. 16613 len. 16]: I may feel -- nay , know -- that I have been deluded and deceived .
Parsing [sent. 16614 len. 18]: I may feel -- nay , know -- that I have been set aside and passed over .
Parsing [sent. 16615 len. 83]: I may feel -- nay , know -- that after having so far overcome my repugnance towards Mr and Mrs Boffin as to receive them under this roof , and to consent to your daughter Bella 's , ' here turning to her husband , ` residing under theirs , it were well if your daughter Bella , ' again turning to her husband , ` had profited in a worldly point of view by a connection so distasteful , so disreputable .
Parsing [sent. 16616 len. 33]: I may feel -- nay , know -- that in uniting herself to Mr Rokesmith she has united herself to one who is , in spite of shallow sophistry , a Mendicant .
Parsing [sent. 16617 len. 31]: And I may feel well assured that your daughter Bella , ' again turning to her husband , ` does not exalt her family by becoming a Mendicant 's bride .
Parsing [sent. 16618 len. 14]: But I suppress what I feel , and say nothing of it . '
Parsing [sent. 16619 len. 30]: Mr Sampson murmured that this was the sort of thing you might expect from one who had ever in her own family been an example and never an outrage .
Parsing [sent. 16620 len. 29]: And ever more so -LRB- Mr Sampson added , with some degree of obscurity , -RRB- and never more so , than in and through what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 16621 len. 41]: He must take the liberty of adding , that what was true of the mother was true of the youngest daughter , and that he could never forget the touching feelings that the conduct of both had awakened within him .
Parsing [sent. 16622 len. 40]: In conclusion , he did hope that there was n't a man with a beating heart who was capable of something that remained undescribed , in consequence of Miss Lavinia 's stopping him as he reeled in his speech .
Parsing [sent. 16623 len. 36]: ` Therefore , R. W. ' said Mrs Wilfer , resuming her discourse and turning to her lord again , ` let your daughter Bella come when she will , and she will be received .
Parsing [sent. 16624 len. 25]: So , ' after a short pause , and an air of having taken medicine in it , ` so will her husband . '
Parsing [sent. 16625 len. 23]: ` And I beg , Pa , ' said Lavinia , ` that you will not tell Bella what I have undergone .
Parsing [sent. 16626 len. 16]: It can do no good , and it might cause her to reproach herself . '
Parsing [sent. 16627 len. 18]: ` My dearest girl , ' urged Mr Sampson , ` she ought to know it . '
Parsing [sent. 16628 len. 16]: ` No , George , ' said Lavinia , in a tone of resolute self-denial .
Parsing [sent. 16629 len. 14]: ` No , dearest George , let it be buried in oblivion . '
Parsing [sent. 16630 len. 10]: Mr Sampson considered that , ` too noble . '
Parsing [sent. 16631 len. 13]: ` Nothing is too noble , dearest George , ' returned Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 16632 len. 28]: ` And Pa , I hope you will be careful not to refer before Bella , if you can help it , to my engagement to George .
Parsing [sent. 16633 len. 13]: It might seem like reminding her of her having cast herself away .
Parsing [sent. 16634 len. 26]: And I hope , Pa , that you will think it equally right to avoid mentioning George 's rising prospects , when Bella is present .
Parsing [sent. 16635 len. 12]: It might seem like taunting her with her own poor fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 16636 len. 27]: Let me ever remember that I am her younger sister , and ever spare her painful contrasts , which could not but wound her sharply . '
Parsing [sent. 16637 len. 13]: Mr Sampson expressed his belief that such was the demeanour of Angels .
Parsing [sent. 16638 len. 25]: Miss Lavvy replied with solemnity , ` No , dearest George , I am but too well aware that I am merely human . '
Parsing [sent. 16639 len. 40]: Mrs Wilfer , for her part , still further improved the occasion by sitting with her eyes fastened on her husband , like two great black notes of interrogation , severely inquiring , Are you looking into your breast ?
Parsing [sent. 16640 len. 6]: Do you deserve your blessings ?
Parsing [sent. 16641 len. 20]: Can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you are worthy of so hysterical a daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 16642 len. 46]: I do not ask you if you are worthy of such a wife -- put Me out of the question -- but are you sufficiently conscious of , and thankful for , the pervading moral grandeur of the family spectacle on which you are gazing ?
Parsing [sent. 16643 len. 38]: These inquiries proved very harassing to R. W. who , besides being a little disturbed by wine , was in perpetual terror of committing himself by the utterance of stray words that would betray his guilty foreknowledge .
Parsing [sent. 16644 len. 30]: However , the scene being over , and -- all things considered -- well over , he sought refuge in a doze ; which gave his lady immense offence .
Parsing [sent. 16645 len. 13]: ` Can you think of your daughter Bella , and sleep ? '
Parsing [sent. 16646 len. 4]: she disdainfully inquired .
Parsing [sent. 16647 len. 18]: To which he mildly answered , ` Yes , I think I can , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16648 len. 31]: ` Then , ' said Mrs Wilfer , with solemn indignation , ' I would recommend you , if you have a human feeling , to retire to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 16649 len. 23]: ` Thank you , my dear , ' he replied ; ' I think it IS the best place for me . '
Parsing [sent. 16650 len. 9]: And with these unsympathetic words very gladly withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 16651 len. 30]: Within a few weeks afterwards , the Mendicant 's bride -LRB- arm-in-arm with the Mendicant -RRB- came to tea , in fulfilment of an engagement made through her father .
Parsing [sent. 16652 len. 40]: And the way in which the Mendicant 's bride dashed at the unassailable position so considerately to be held by Miss Lavy , and scattered the whole of the works in all directions in a moment , was triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 16653 len. 27]: ` Dearest Ma , ' cried Bella , running into the room with a radiant face , ` how do you do , dearest Ma ? '
Parsing [sent. 16654 len. 7]: And then embraced her , joyously .
Parsing [sent. 16655 len. 41]: ` And Lavvy darling , how do YOU do , and how 's George Sampson , and how is he getting on , and when are you going to be married , and how rich are you going to grow ?
Parsing [sent. 16656 len. 13]: You must tell me all about it , Lavvy dear , immediately .
Parsing [sent. 16657 len. 21]: John , love , kiss Ma and Lavvy , and then we shall all be at home and comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 16658 len. 8]: Mrs Wilfer stared , but was helpless .
Parsing [sent. 16659 len. 8]: Miss Lavinia stared , but was helpless .
Parsing [sent. 16660 len. 25]: Apparently with no compunction , and assuredly with no ceremony , Bella tossed her bonnet away , and sat down to make the tea .
Parsing [sent. 16661 len. 14]: ` Dearest Ma and Lavvy , you both take sugar , I know .
Parsing [sent. 16662 len. 15]: And Pa -LRB- you good little Pa -RRB- , you do n't take milk .
Parsing [sent. 16663 len. 3]: John does .
Parsing [sent. 16664 len. 17]: I did n't before I was married ; but I do now , because John does .
Parsing [sent. 16665 len. 10]: John dear , did you kiss Ma and Lavvy ?
Parsing [sent. 16666 len. 5]: Oh , you did !
Parsing [sent. 16667 len. 19]: Quite correct , John dear ; but I did n't see you do it , so I asked .
Parsing [sent. 16668 len. 13]: Cut some bread and butter , John ; that 's a love .
Parsing [sent. 16669 len. 5]: Ma likes it doubled .
Parsing [sent. 16670 len. 18]: And now you must tell me , dearest Ma and Lavvy , upon your words and honours !
Parsing [sent. 16671 len. 29]: Did n't you for a moment -- just a moment -- think I was a dreadful little wretch when I wrote to say I had run away ? '
Parsing [sent. 16672 len. 22]: Before Mrs Wilfer could wave her gloves , the Mendicant 's bride in her merriest affectionate manner went on again . '
Parsing [sent. 16673 len. 27]: I think it must have made you rather cross , dear Ma and Lavvy , and I know I deserved that you should be very cross .
Parsing [sent. 16674 len. 50]: But you see I had been such a heedless , heartless creature , and had led you so to expect that I should marry for money , and so to make sure that I was incapable of marrying for love , that I thought you could n't believe me .
Parsing [sent. 16675 len. 24]: Because , you see , you did n't know how much of Good , Good , Good , I had learnt from John .
Parsing [sent. 16676 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 16677 len. 61]: So I was sly about it , and ashamed of what you supposed me to be , and fearful that we could n't understand one another and might come to words , which we should all be sorry for afterwards , and so I said to John that if he liked to take me without any fuss , he might .
Parsing [sent. 16678 len. 10]: And as he did like , I let him .
Parsing [sent. 16679 len. 35]: And we were married at Greenwich church in the presence of nobody -- except an unknown individual who dropped in , ' here her eyes sparkled more brightly , ` and half a pensioner .
Parsing [sent. 16680 len. 46]: And now , is n't it nice , dearest Ma and Lavvy , to know that no words have been said which any of us can be sorry for , and that we are all the best of friends at the pleasantest of teas ! '
Parsing [sent. 16681 len. 34]: Having got up and kissed them again , she slipped back to her chair -LRB- after a loop on the road to squeeze her husband round the neck -RRB- and again went on .
Parsing [sent. 16682 len. 28]: ` And now you will naturally want to know , dearest Ma and Lavvy , how we live , and what we have got to live upon .
Parsing [sent. 16683 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 16684 len. 70]: And so we live on Blackheath , in the charm -- ingest of dolls ' houses , de -- lightfully furnished , and we have a clever little servant who is de -- cidedly pretty , and we are economical and orderly , and do everything by clockwork , and we have a hundred and fifty pounds a year , and we have all we want , and more .
Parsing [sent. 16685 len. 36]: And lastly , if you would like to know in confidence , as perhaps you may , what is my opinion of my husband , my opinion is -- that I almost love him ! '
Parsing [sent. 16686 len. 50]: ` And if you would like to know in confidence , as perhaps you may , ' said her husband , smiling , as he stood by her side , without her having detected his approach , ` my opinion of my wife , my opinion is -- . '
Parsing [sent. 16687 len. 13]: But Bella started up , and put her hand upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 16688 len. 5]: ` Stop , Sir !
Parsing [sent. 16689 len. 6]: No , John , dear !
Parsing [sent. 16690 len. 2]: Seriously !
Parsing [sent. 16691 len. 6]: Please not yet a while !
Parsing [sent. 16692 len. 18]: I want to be something so much worthier than the doll in the doll 's house . '
Parsing [sent. 16693 len. 9]: ` My darling , are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 16694 len. 21]: ` Not half , not a quarter , so much worthier as I hope you may some day find me !
Parsing [sent. 16695 len. 28]: Try me through some reverse , John -- try me through some trial -- and tell them after THAT , what you think of me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16696 len. 11]: I will , my Life , ' said John . '
Parsing [sent. 16697 len. 5]: I promise it . '
Parsing [sent. 16698 len. 7]: ` That 's my dear John .
Parsing [sent. 16699 len. 13]: And you wo n't speak a word now ; will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16700 len. 27]: ` And I wo n't , ' said John , with a very expressive look of admiration around him , ` speak a word now ! '
Parsing [sent. 16701 len. 40]: She laid her laughing cheek upon his breast to thank him , and said , looking at the rest of them sideways out of her bright eyes : ` I 'll go further , Pa and Ma and Lavvy .
Parsing [sent. 16702 len. 20]: John do n't suspect it -- he has no idea of it -- but I quite love him ! '
Parsing [sent. 16703 len. 47]: Even Mrs Wilfer relaxed under the influence of her married daughter , and seemed in a majestic manner to imply remotely that if R. W. had been a more deserving object , she too might have condescended to come down from her pedestal for his beguilement .
Parsing [sent. 16704 len. 40]: Miss Lavinia , on the other hand , had strong doubts of the policy of the course of treatment , and whether it might not spoil Mr Sampson , if experimented on in the case of that young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 16705 len. 46]: R. W. himself was for his part convinced that he was father of one of the most charming of girls , and that Rokesmith was the most favoured of men ; which opinion , if propounded to him , Rokesmith would probably not have contested .
Parsing [sent. 16706 len. 22]: The newly-married pair left early , so that they might walk at leisure to their starting-place from London , for Greenwich .
Parsing [sent. 16707 len. 25]: At first they were very cheerful and talked much ; but after a while , Bella fancied that her husband was turning somewhat thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 16708 len. 15]: So she asked him : ` John dear , what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 16709 len. 7]: ` Matter , my love ? '
Parsing [sent. 16710 len. 25]: ` Wo n't you tell me , ' said Bella , looking up into his face , ` what you are thinking of ? '
Parsing [sent. 16711 len. 12]: ` There 's not much in the thought , my soul .
Parsing [sent. 16712 len. 14]: I was thinking whether you would n't like me to be rich ? '
Parsing [sent. 16713 len. 7]: ` You rich , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 16714 len. 8]: repeated Bella , shrinking a little . '
Parsing [sent. 16715 len. 6]: I mean , really rich .
Parsing [sent. 16716 len. 8]: Say , as rich as Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 16717 len. 7]: You would like that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16718 len. 11]: I should be almost afraid to try , John dear .
Parsing [sent. 16719 len. 9]: Was he much the better for his wealth ?
Parsing [sent. 16720 len. 16]: Was I much the better for the little part I once had in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 16721 len. 15]: ` But all people are not the worse for riches , my own . '
Parsing [sent. 16722 len. 5]: ` Most people ? '
Parsing [sent. 16723 len. 7]: Bella musingly suggested with raised eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 16724 len. 11]: ` Nor even most people , it may be hoped .
Parsing [sent. 16725 len. 21]: If you were rich , for instance , you would have a great power of doing good to others . '
Parsing [sent. 16726 len. 24]: ` Yes , sir , for instance , ' Bella playfully rejoined ; ` but should I exercise the power , for instance ?
Parsing [sent. 16727 len. 27]: And again , sir , for instance ; should I , at the same time , have a great power of doing harm to myself ? '
Parsing [sent. 16728 len. 25]: Laughing and pressing her arm , he retorted : ` But still , again for instance ; would you exercise that power ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16729 len. 15]: I do n't know , ' said Bella , thoughtfully shaking her head . '
Parsing [sent. 16730 len. 4]: I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 16731 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 16732 len. 17]: But it 's so easy to hope not and think not , without the riches . '
Parsing [sent. 16733 len. 19]: ` Why do n't you say , my darling -- instead of that phrase -- being poor ? '
Parsing [sent. 16734 len. 8]: he asked , looking earnestly at her .
Parsing [sent. 16735 len. 10]: ` Why do n't I say , being poor !
Parsing [sent. 16736 len. 6]: Because I am not poor .
Parsing [sent. 16737 len. 18]: Dear John , it 's not possible that you suppose I think we are poor ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16738 len. 7]: I do , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 16739 len. 5]: ` Oh John ! '
Parsing [sent. 16740 len. 6]: ` Understand me , sweetheart .
Parsing [sent. 16741 len. 24]: I know that I am rich beyond all wealth in having you ; but I think OF you , and think FOR you .
Parsing [sent. 16742 len. 34]: In such a dress as you are wearing now , you first charmed me , and in no dress could you ever look , to my thinking , more graceful or more beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 16743 len. 27]: But you have admired many finer dresses this very day ; and is it not natural that I wish I could give them to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16744 len. 13]: ` It 's very nice that you should wish it , John .
Parsing [sent. 16745 len. 20]: It brings these tears of grateful pleasure into my eyes , to hear you say so with such tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 16746 len. 8]: But I do n't want them . '
Parsing [sent. 16747 len. 17]: ` Again , ' he pursued , ` we are now walking through the muddy streets .
Parsing [sent. 16748 len. 27]: I love those pretty feet so dearly , that I feel as if I could not bear the dirt to soil the sole of your shoe .
Parsing [sent. 16749 len. 15]: Is it not natural that I wish you could ride in a carriage ? '
Parsing [sent. 16750 len. 49]: ` It 's very nice , ' said Bella , glancing downward at the feet in question , ` to know that you admire them so much , John dear , and since you do , I am sorry that these shoes are a full size too large .
Parsing [sent. 16751 len. 12]: But I do n't want a carriage , believe me . '
Parsing [sent. 16752 len. 15]: ` You would like one if you could have one , Bella ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16753 len. 20]: I should n't like it for its own sake , half so well as such a wish for it .
Parsing [sent. 16754 len. 27]: Dear John , your wishes are as real to me as the wishes in the Fairy story , that were all fulfilled as soon as spoken .
Parsing [sent. 16755 len. 25]: Wish me everything that you can wish for the woman you dearly love , and I have as good as got it , John .
Parsing [sent. 16756 len. 10]: I have better than got it , John ! '
Parsing [sent. 16757 len. 22]: They were not the less happy for such talk , and home was not the less home for coming after it .
Parsing [sent. 16758 len. 10]: Bella was fast developing a perfect genius for home .
Parsing [sent. 16759 len. 28]: All the loves and graces seemed -LRB- her husband thought -RRB- to have taken domestic service with her , and to help her to make home engaging .
Parsing [sent. 16760 len. 7]: Her married life glided happily on .
Parsing [sent. 16761 len. 31]: She was alone all day , for , after an early breakfast her husband repaired every morning to the City , and did not return until their late dinner hour .
Parsing [sent. 16762 len. 67]: He was ` in a China house , ' he explained to Bella : which she found quite satisfactory , without pursuing the China house into minuter details than a wholesale vision of tea , rice , odd-smelling silks , carved boxes , and tight-eyed people in more than double-soled shoes , with their pigtails pulling their heads of hair off , painted on transparent porcelain .
Parsing [sent. 16763 len. 46]: She always walked with her husband to the railroad , and was always there again to meet him ; her old coquettish ways a little sobered down -LRB- but not much -RRB- , and her dress as daintily managed as if she managed nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 16764 len. 62]: But , John gone to business and Bella returned home , the dress would be laid aside , trim little wrappers and aprons would be substituted , and Bella , putting back her hair with both hands , as if she were making the most business-like arrangements for going dramatically distracted , would enter on the household affairs of the day .
Parsing [sent. 16765 len. 47]: Such weighing and mixing and chopping and grating , such dusting and washing and polishing , such snipping and weeding and trowelling and other small gardening , such making and mending and folding and airing , such diverse arrangements , and above all such severe study !
Parsing [sent. 16766 len. 72]: For Mrs J. R. , who had never been wont to do too much at home as Miss B. W. , was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume entitled The Complete British Family Housewife , which she would sit consulting , with her elbows on the table and her temples on her hands , like some perplexed enchantress poring over the Black Art .
Parsing [sent. 16767 len. 48]: This , principally because the Complete British Housewife , however sound a Briton at heart , was by no means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue , and sometimes might have issued her directions to equal purpose in the Kamskatchan language .
Parsing [sent. 16768 len. 27]: In any crisis of this nature , Bella would suddenly exclaim aloud , ` Oh you ridiculous old thing , what do you mean by that ?
Parsing [sent. 16769 len. 7]: You must have been drinking ! '
Parsing [sent. 16770 len. 25]: And having made this marginal note , would try the Housewife again , with all her dimples screwed into an expression of profound research .
Parsing [sent. 16771 len. 21]: There was likewise a coolness on the part of the British Housewife , which Mrs John Rokesmith found highly exasperating .
Parsing [sent. 16772 len. 23]: She would say , ` Take a salamander , ' as if a general should command a private to catch a Tartar .
Parsing [sent. 16773 len. 21]: Or , she would casually issue the order , ` Throw in a handful -- ' of something entirely unattainable .
Parsing [sent. 16774 len. 39]: In these , the Housewife 's most glaring moments of unreason , Bella would shut her up and knock her on the table , apostrophising her with the compliment , ' O you ARE a stupid old Donkey !
Parsing [sent. 16775 len. 12]: Where am I to get it , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 16776 len. 18]: Another branch of study claimed the attention of Mrs John Rokesmith for a regular period every day .
Parsing [sent. 16777 len. 25]: This was the mastering of the newspaper , so that she might be close up with John on general topics when John came home .
Parsing [sent. 16778 len. 37]: In her desire to be in all things his companion , she would have set herself with equal zeal to master Algebra , or Euclid , if he had divided his soul between her and either .
Parsing [sent. 16779 len. 86]: Wonderful was the way in which she would store up the City Intelligence , and beamingly shed it upon John in the course of the evening ; incidentally mentioning the commodities that were looking up in the markets , and how much gold had been taken to the Bank , and trying to look wise and serious over it until she would laugh at herself most charmingly and would say , kissing him : ` It all comes of my love , John dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16780 len. 39]: For a City man , John certainly did appear to care as little as might be for the looking up or looking down of things , as well as for the gold that got taken to the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 16781 len. 39]: But he cared , beyond all expression , for his wife , as a most precious and sweet commodity that was always looking up , and that never was worth less than all the gold in the world .
Parsing [sent. 16782 len. 42]: And she , being inspired by her affection , and having a quick wit and a fine ready instinct , made amazing progress in her domestic efficiency , though , as an endearing creature , she made no progress at all .
Parsing [sent. 16783 len. 31]: This was her husband 's verdict , and he justified it by telling her that she had begun her married life as the most endearing creature that could possibly be .
Parsing [sent. 16784 len. 10]: ` And you have such a cheerful spirit ! '
Parsing [sent. 16785 len. 5]: he said , fondly .
Parsing [sent. 16786 len. 12]: ` You are like a bright light in the house . '
Parsing [sent. 16787 len. 8]: ` Am I truly , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 16788 len. 5]: ` Are you truly ?
Parsing [sent. 16789 len. 4]: Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 16790 len. 9]: Only much more , and much better . '
Parsing [sent. 16791 len. 39]: ` Do you know , John dear , ' said Bella , taking him by a button of his coat , ` that I sometimes , at odd moments -- do n't laugh , John , please . '
Parsing [sent. 16792 len. 18]: Nothing should induce John to do it , when she asked him not to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 16793 len. 15]: -- That I sometimes think , John , I feel a little serious . '
Parsing [sent. 16794 len. 12]: ` Are you too much alone , my darling ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16795 len. 7]: O dear , no , John !
Parsing [sent. 16796 len. 18]: The time is so short that I have not a moment too much in the week . '
Parsing [sent. 16797 len. 9]: ` Why serious , my life , then ?
Parsing [sent. 16798 len. 4]: When serious ? '
Parsing [sent. 16799 len. 22]: ` When I laugh , I think , ' said Bella , laughing as she laid her head upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 16800 len. 14]: ` You would n't believe , sir , that I feel serious now ?
Parsing [sent. 16801 len. 5]: But I do . '
Parsing [sent. 16802 len. 12]: And she laughed again , and something glistened in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 16803 len. 11]: ` Would you like to be rich , pet ? '
Parsing [sent. 16804 len. 5]: he asked her coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 16805 len. 5]: ` Rich , John !
Parsing [sent. 16806 len. 10]: How CAN you ask such goose 's questions ? '
Parsing [sent. 16807 len. 10]: ` Do you regret anything , my love ? '
Parsing [sent. 16808 len. 4]: ` Regret anything ?
Parsing [sent. 16809 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 16810 len. 4]: Bella confidently answered .
Parsing [sent. 16811 len. 22]: But then , suddenly changing , she said , between laughing and glistening : ` Oh yes , I do though .
Parsing [sent. 16812 len. 6]: I regret Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 16813 len. 11]: ` I , too , regret that separation very much .
Parsing [sent. 16814 len. 7]: But perhaps it is only temporary .
Parsing [sent. 16815 len. 26]: Perhaps things may so fall out , as that you may sometimes see her again -- as that we may sometimes see her again . '
Parsing [sent. 16816 len. 18]: Bella might be very anxious on the subject , but she scarcely seemed so at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 16817 len. 25]: With an absent air , she was investigating that button on her husband 's coat , when Pa came in to spend the evening .
Parsing [sent. 16818 len. 33]: Pa had his special chair and his special corner reserved for him on all occasions , and -- without disparagement of his domestic joys -- was far happier there , than anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 16819 len. 28]: It was always pleasantly droll to see Pa and Bella together ; but on this present evening her husband thought her more than usually fantastic with him .
Parsing [sent. 16820 len. 28]: ` You are a very good little boy , ' said Bella , ` to come unexpectedly , as soon as you could get out of school .
Parsing [sent. 16821 len. 14]: And how have they used you at school to-day , you dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 16822 len. 31]: ` Well , my pet , ' replied the cherub , smiling and rubbing his hands as she sat him down in his chair , ' I attend two schools .
Parsing [sent. 16823 len. 15]: There 's the Mincing Lane establishment , and there 's your mother 's Academy .
Parsing [sent. 16824 len. 9]: Which might you mean , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 16825 len. 7]: ` Both , ' said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 16826 len. 5]: ` Both , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 16827 len. 27]: Why , to say the truth , both have taken a little out of me to-day , my dear , but that was to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 16828 len. 16]: There 's no royal road to learning ; and what is life but learning ! '
Parsing [sent. 16829 len. 22]: ` And what do you do with yourself when you have got your learning by heart , you silly child ? '
Parsing [sent. 16830 len. 24]: ` Why then , my dear , ' said the cherub , after a little consideration , ' I suppose I die . '
Parsing [sent. 16831 len. 25]: ` You are a very bad boy , ' retorted Bella , ` to talk about dismal things and be out of spirits . '
Parsing [sent. 16832 len. 17]: ` My Bella , ' rejoined her father , ' I am not out of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 16833 len. 9]: I am as gay as a lark . '
Parsing [sent. 16834 len. 5]: Which his face confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 16835 len. 34]: ` Then if you are sure and certain it 's not you , I suppose it must be I , ' said Bella ; ` so I wo n't do so any more .
Parsing [sent. 16836 len. 16]: John dear , we must give this little fellow his supper , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 16837 len. 10]: ` Of course we must , my darling . '
Parsing [sent. 16838 len. 34]: ` He has been grubbing and grubbing at school , ' said Bella , looking at her father 's hand and lightly slapping it , 'till he 's not fit to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 16839 len. 7]: O what a grubby child ! '
Parsing [sent. 16840 len. 34]: ` Indeed , my dear , ' said her father , ' I was going to ask to be allowed to wash my hands , only you find me out so soon . '
Parsing [sent. 16841 len. 7]: ` Come here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 16842 len. 20]: cried Bella , taking him by the front of his coat , ` come here and be washed directly .
Parsing [sent. 16843 len. 12]: You are not to be trusted to do it for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 16844 len. 6]: Come here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 16845 len. 76]: The cherub , to his genial amusement , was accordingly conducted to a little washing-room , where Bella soaped his face and rubbed his face , and soaped his hands and rubbed his hands , and splashed him and rinsed him and towelled him , until he was as red as beetroot , even to his very ears : ` Now you must be brushed and combed , sir , ' said Bella , busily .
Parsing [sent. 16846 len. 7]: ` Hold the light , John .
Parsing [sent. 16847 len. 15]: Shut your eyes , sir , and let me take hold of your chin .
Parsing [sent. 16848 len. 12]: Be good directly , and do as you are told ! '
Parsing [sent. 16849 len. 56]: Her father being more than willing to obey , she dressed his hair in her most elaborate manner , brushing it out straight , parting it , winding it over her fingers , sticking it up on end , and constantly falling back on John to get a good look at the effect of it .
Parsing [sent. 16850 len. 23]: Who always received her on his disengaged arm , and detained her , while the patient cherub stood waiting to be finished .
Parsing [sent. 16851 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 16852 len. 13]: said Bella , when she had at last completed the final touches .
Parsing [sent. 16853 len. 11]: ` Now , you are something like a genteel boy !
Parsing [sent. 16854 len. 13]: Put your jacket on , and come and have your supper . '
Parsing [sent. 16855 len. 62]: The cherub investing himself with his coat was led back to his corner -- where , but for having no egotism in his pleasant nature , he would have answered well enough for that radiant though selfsufficient boy , Jack Horner -- Bella with her own hands laid a cloth for him , and brought him his supper on a tray .
Parsing [sent. 16856 len. 33]: ` Stop a moment , ' said she , ` we must keep his little clothes clean ; ' and tied a napkin under his chin , in a very methodical manner .
Parsing [sent. 16857 len. 41]: While he took his supper , Bella sat by him , sometimes admonishing him to hold his fork by the handle , like a polite child , and at other times carving for him , or pouring out his drink .
Parsing [sent. 16858 len. 47]: Fantastic as it all was , and accustomed as she ever had been to make a plaything of her good father , ever delighted that she should put him to that account , still there was an occasional something on Bella 's part that was new .
Parsing [sent. 16859 len. 65]: It could not be said that she was less playful , whimsical , or natural , than she always had been ; but it seemed , her husband thought , as if there were some rather graver reason than he had supposed for what she had so lately said , and as if throughout all this , there were glimpses of an underlying seriousness .
Parsing [sent. 16860 len. 56]: It was a circumstance in support of this view of the case , that when she had lighted her father 's pipe , and mixed him his glass of grog , she sat down on a stool between her father and her husband , leaning her arm upon the latter , and was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 16861 len. 29]: So quiet , that when her father rose to take his leave , she looked round with a start , as if she had forgotten his being there .
Parsing [sent. 16862 len. 12]: ` You go a little way with Pa , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 16863 len. 6]: ` Yes , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 16864 len. 5]: Do you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16865 len. 24]: I have not written to Lizzie Hexam since I wrote and told her that I really had a lover -- a whole one .
Parsing [sent. 16866 len. 34]: I have often thought I would like to tell her how right she was when she pretended to read in the live coals that I would go through fire and water for him .
Parsing [sent. 16867 len. 24]: I am in the humour to tell her so to-night , John , and I 'll stay at home and do it . '
Parsing [sent. 16868 len. 6]: ` You are tired . '
Parsing [sent. 16869 len. 18]: ` Not at all tired , John dear , but in the humour to write to Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 16870 len. 6]: Good night , dear Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 16871 len. 12]: Good night , you dear , good , gentle Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 16872 len. 16]: Left to herself she sat down to write , and wrote Lizzie a long letter .
Parsing [sent. 16873 len. 16]: She had but completed it and read it over , when her husband came back .
Parsing [sent. 16874 len. 25]: ` You are just in time , sir , ' said Bella ; ' I am going to give you your first curtain lecture .
Parsing [sent. 16875 len. 7]: It shall be a parlour-curtain lecture .
Parsing [sent. 16876 len. 56]: You shall take this chair of mine when I have folded my letter , and I will take the stool -LRB- though you ought to take it , I can tell you , sir , if it 's the stool of repentance -RRB- , and you 'll soon find yourself taken to task soundly . '
Parsing [sent. 16877 len. 85]: Her letter folded , sealed , and directed , and her pen wiped , and her middle finger wiped , and her desk locked up and put away , and these transactions performed with an air of severe business sedateness , which the Complete British Housewife might have assumed , and certainly would not have rounded off and broken down in with a musical laugh , as Bella did : she placed her husband in his chair , and placed herself upon her stool .
Parsing [sent. 16878 len. 5]: ` Now , sir !
Parsing [sent. 16879 len. 6]: To begin at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 16880 len. 6]: What is your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 16881 len. 20]: A question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from her , could not have astounded him .
Parsing [sent. 16882 len. 20]: But he kept his countenance and his secret , and answered , ` John Rokesmith , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16883 len. 4]: ` Good boy !
Parsing [sent. 16884 len. 7]: Who gave you that name ? '
Parsing [sent. 16885 len. 29]: With a returning suspicion that something might have betrayed him to her , he answered , interrogatively , ` My godfathers and my godmothers , dear love ? '
Parsing [sent. 16886 len. 5]: ` Pretty good ! '
Parsing [sent. 16887 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 16888 len. 11]: ` Not goodest good , because you hesitate about it .
Parsing [sent. 16889 len. 20]: However , as you know your Catechism fairly , so far , I 'll let you off the rest .
Parsing [sent. 16890 len. 14]: Now , I am going to examine you out of my own head .
Parsing [sent. 16891 len. 29]: John dear , why did you go back , this evening , to the question you once asked me before -- would I like to be rich ? '
Parsing [sent. 16892 len. 5]: Again , his secret !
Parsing [sent. 16893 len. 31]: He looked down at her as she looked up at him , with her hands folded on his knee , and it was as nearly told as ever secret was .
Parsing [sent. 16894 len. 14]: Having no reply ready , he could do no better than embrace her .
Parsing [sent. 16895 len. 35]: ` In short , dear John , ' said Bella , ` this is the topic of my lecture : I want nothing on earth , and I want you to believe it . '
Parsing [sent. 16896 len. 18]: ` If that 's all , the lecture may be considered over , for I do . '
Parsing [sent. 16897 len. 13]: ` It 's not all , John dear , ' Bella hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 16898 len. 6]: ` It 's only Firstly .
Parsing [sent. 16899 len. 33]: There 's a dreadful Secondly , and a dreadful Thirdly to come -- as I used to say to myself in sermon-time when I was a very small-sized sinner at church . '
Parsing [sent. 16900 len. 9]: ` Let them come , my dearest . '
Parsing [sent. 16901 len. 21]: ` Are you sure , John dear ; are you absolutely certain in your innermost heart of hearts -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 16902 len. 12]: ` Which is not in my keeping , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 16903 len. 10]: ` No , John , but the key is .
Parsing [sent. 16904 len. 42]: -- Are you absolutely certain that down at the bottom of that heart of hearts , which you have given to me as I have given mine to you , there is no remembrance that I was once very mercenary ? '
Parsing [sent. 16905 len. 78]: ` Why , if there were no remembrance in me of the time you speak of , ' he softly asked her with his lips to hers , ` could I love you quite as well as I do ; could I have in the Calendar of my life the brightest of its days ; could I whenever I look at your dear face , or hear your dear voice , see and hear my noble champion ?
Parsing [sent. 16906 len. 14]: It can never have been that which made you serious , darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 16907 len. 22]: ` No John , it was n't that , and still less was it Mrs Boffin , though I love her .
Parsing [sent. 16908 len. 13]: Wait a moment , and I 'll go on with the lecture .
Parsing [sent. 16909 len. 13]: Give me a moment , because I like to cry for joy .
Parsing [sent. 16910 len. 14]: It 's so delicious , John dear , to cry for joy . '
Parsing [sent. 16911 len. 34]: She did so on his neck , and , still clinging there , laughed a little when she said , ' I think I am ready now for Thirdly , John . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16912 len. 17]: I am ready for Thirdly , ' said John , ` whatever it is . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16913 len. 37]: I believe , John , ' pursued Bella , ` that you believe that I believe -- ' ` My dear child , ' cried her husband gaily , ` what a quantity of believing ! '
Parsing [sent. 16914 len. 6]: ` Is n't there ? '
Parsing [sent. 16915 len. 8]: said Bella , with another laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 16916 len. 7]: I never knew such a quantity !
Parsing [sent. 16917 len. 8]: It 's like verbs in an exercise .
Parsing [sent. 16918 len. 10]: But I ca n't get on with less believing .
Parsing [sent. 16919 len. 5]: I 'll try again .
Parsing [sent. 16920 len. 30]: I believe , dear John , that you believe that I believe that we have as much money as we require , and that we want for nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 16921 len. 9]: ` It is strictly true , Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 16922 len. 49]: ` But if our money should by any means be rendered not so much -- if we had to stint ourselves a little in purchases that we can afford to make now -- would you still have the same confidence in my being quite contented , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 16923 len. 10]: ` Precisely the same confidence , my soul . '
Parsing [sent. 16924 len. 13]: ` Thank you , John dear , thousands upon thousands of times .
Parsing [sent. 16925 len. 28]: And I may take it for granted , no doubt , ' with a little faltering , ` that you would be quite as contented yourself John ?
Parsing [sent. 16926 len. 9]: But , yes , I know I may .
Parsing [sent. 16927 len. 42]: For , knowing that I should be so , how surely I may know that you would be so ; you who are so much stronger , and firmer , and more reasonable and more generous , than I am . '
Parsing [sent. 16928 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 16929 len. 11]: said her husband , ' I must not hear that .
Parsing [sent. 16930 len. 14]: You are all wrong there , though otherwise as right as can be .
Parsing [sent. 16931 len. 26]: And now I am brought to a little piece of news , my dearest , that I might have told you earlier in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 16932 len. 25]: I have strong reason for confidently believing that we shall never be in the receipt of a smaller income than our present income . '
Parsing [sent. 16933 len. 40]: She might have shown herself more interested in the intelligence ; but she had returned to the investigation of the coat-button that had engaged her attention a few hours before , and scarcely seemed to heed what he said .
Parsing [sent. 16934 len. 34]: ` And now we have got to the bottom of it at last , ' cried her husband , rallying her , ` and this is the thing that made you serious ? '
Parsing [sent. 16935 len. 23]: ` No dear , ' said Bella , twisting the button and shaking her head , ` it was n't this . '
Parsing [sent. 16936 len. 18]: ` Why then , Lord bless this little wife of mine , there 's a Fourthly ! '
Parsing [sent. 16937 len. 3]: exclaimed John .
Parsing [sent. 16938 len. 48]: ` This worried me a little , and so did Secondly , ' said Bella , occupied with the button , ` but it was quite another sort of seriousness -- a much deeper and quieter sort of seriousness -- that I spoke of John dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16939 len. 30]: As he bent his face to hers , she raised hers to meet it , and laid her little right hand on his eyes , and kept it there .
Parsing [sent. 16940 len. 32]: ` Do you remember , John , on the day we were married , Pa 's speaking of the ships that might be sailing towards us from the unknown seas ? '
Parsing [sent. 16941 len. 8]: ` Perfectly , my darling ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16942 len. 28]: I think ... among them ... there is a ship upon the ocean ... bringing ... to you and me ... a little baby , John . '
Parsing [sent. 16943 len. 40]: Chapter 6 A CRY FOR HELP The Paper Mill had stopped work for the night , and the paths and roads in its neighbourhood were sprinkled with clusters of people going home from their day 's labour in it .
Parsing [sent. 16944 len. 28]: There were men , women , and children in the groups , and there was no want of lively colour to flutter in the gentle evening wind .
Parsing [sent. 16945 len. 29]: The mingling of various voices and the sound of laughter made a cheerful impression upon the ear , analogous to that of the fluttering colours upon the eye .
Parsing [sent. 16946 len. 34]: Into the sheet of water reflecting the flushed sky in the foreground of the living picture , a knot of urchins were casting stones , and watching the expansion of the rippling circles .
Parsing [sent. 16947 len. 95]: So , in the rosy evening , one might watch the ever-widening beauty of the landscape -- beyond the newly-released workers wending home -- beyond the silver river -- beyond the deep green fields of corn , so prospering , that the loiterers in their narrow threads of pathway seemed to float immersed breast-high -- beyond the hedgerows and the clumps of trees -- beyond the windmills on the ridge -- away to where the sky appeared to meet the earth , as if there were no immensity of space between mankind and Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 16948 len. 37]: It was a Saturday evening , and at such a time the village dogs , always much more interested in the doings of humanity than in the affairs of their own species , were particularly active .
Parsing [sent. 16949 len. 24]: At the general shop , at the butcher 's and at the public-house , they evinced an inquiring spirit never to he satiated .
Parsing [sent. 16950 len. 63]: Their especial interest in the public-house would seem to imply some latent rakishness in the canine character ; for little was eaten there , and they , having no taste for beer or tobacco -LRB- Mrs Hubbard 's dog is said to have smoked , but proof is wanting -RRB- , could only have been attracted by sympathy with loose convivial habits .
Parsing [sent. 16951 len. 43]: Moreover , a most wretched fiddle played within ; a fiddle so unutterably vile , that one lean long-bodied cur , with a better ear than the rest , found himself under compulsion at intervals to go round the corner and howl .
Parsing [sent. 16952 len. 19]: Yet , even he returned to the public-house on each occasion with the tenacity of a confirmed drunkard .
Parsing [sent. 16953 len. 16]: Fearful to relate , there was even a sort of little Fair in the village .
Parsing [sent. 16954 len. 41]: Some despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of itself all over the country , and had cast a quantity of dust upon its head in its mortification , again appealed to the public from an infirm booth .
Parsing [sent. 16955 len. 29]: So did a heap of nuts , long , long exiled from Barcelona , and yet speaking English so indifferently as to call fourteen of themselves a pint .
Parsing [sent. 16956 len. 39]: A Peep-show which had originally started with the Battle of Waterloo , and had since made it every other battle of later date by altering the Duke of Wellington 's nose , tempted the student of illustrated history .
Parsing [sent. 16957 len. 40]: A Fat Lady , perhaps in part sustained upon postponed pork , her professional associate being a Learned Pig , displayed her life-size picture in a low dress as she appeared when presented at Court , several yards round .
Parsing [sent. 16958 len. 36]: All this was a vicious spectacle as any poor idea of amusement on the part of the rougher hewers of wood and drawers of water in this land of England ever is and shall be .
Parsing [sent. 16959 len. 9]: They MUST NOT vary the rheumatism with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 16960 len. 30]: They may vary it with fever and ague , or with as many rheumatic variations as they have joints ; but positively not with entertainment after their own manner .
Parsing [sent. 16961 len. 42]: The various sounds arising from this scene of depravity , and floating away into the still evening air , made the evening , at any point which they just reached fitfully , mellowed by the distance , more still by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 16962 len. 23]: Such was the stillness of the evening to Eugene Wrayburn , as he walked by the river with his hands behind him .
Parsing [sent. 16963 len. 18]: He walked slowly , and with the measured step and preoccupied air of one who was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 16964 len. 31]: He walked between the two points , an osier-bed at this end and some floating lilies at that , and at each point stopped and looked expectantly in one direction .
Parsing [sent. 16965 len. 10]: ` It is very quiet , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 16966 len. 5]: It was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 16967 len. 32]: Some sheep were grazing on the grass by the river-side , and it seemed to him that he had never before heard the crisp tearing sound with which they cropped it .
Parsing [sent. 16968 len. 9]: He stopped idly , and looked at them .
Parsing [sent. 16969 len. 9]: ` You are stupid enough , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 16970 len. 35]: But if you are clever enough to get through life tolerably to your satisfaction , you have got the better of me , Man as I am , and Mutton as you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 16971 len. 12]: A rustle in a field beyond the hedge attracted his attention .
Parsing [sent. 16972 len. 8]: ` What 's here to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 16973 len. 12]: he asked himself leisurely going towards the gate and looking over .
Parsing [sent. 16974 len. 5]: ` No jealous paper-miller ?
Parsing [sent. 16975 len. 12]: No pleasures of the chase in this part of the country ?
Parsing [sent. 16976 len. 5]: Mostly fishing hereabouts ! '
Parsing [sent. 16977 len. 33]: The field had been newly mown , and there were yet the marks of the scythe on the yellow-green ground , and the track of wheels where the hay had been carried .
Parsing [sent. 16978 len. 18]: Following the tracks with his eyes , the view closed with the new hayrick in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 16979 len. 16]: Now , if he had gone on to the hayrick , and gone round it ?
Parsing [sent. 16980 len. 23]: But , say that the event was to be , as the event fell out , and how idle are such suppositions !
Parsing [sent. 16981 len. 21]: Besides , if he had gone ; what is there of warning in a Bargeman lying on his face ? '
Parsing [sent. 16982 len. 24]: A bird flying to the hedge , ' was all he thought about it ; and came back , and resumed his walk .
Parsing [sent. 16983 len. 39]: ` If I had not a reliance on her being truthful , ' said Eugene , after taking some half-dozen turns , ' I should begin to think she had given me the slip for the second time .
Parsing [sent. 16984 len. 14]: But she promised , and she is a girl of her word . '
Parsing [sent. 16985 len. 18]: Turning again at the water-lilies , he saw her coming , and advanced to meet her . '
Parsing [sent. 16986 len. 22]: I was saying to myself , Lizzie , that you were sure to come , though you were late . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16987 len. 32]: I had to linger through the village as if I had no object before me , and I had to speak to several people in passing along , Mr Wrayburn . '
Parsing [sent. 16988 len. 16]: ` Are the lads of the village -- and the ladies -- such scandal-mongers ? '
Parsing [sent. 16989 len. 15]: he asked , as he took her hand and drew it through his arm .
Parsing [sent. 16990 len. 11]: She submitted to walk slowly on , with downcast eyes .
Parsing [sent. 16991 len. 15]: He put her hand to his lips , and she quietly drew it away .
Parsing [sent. 16992 len. 16]: ` Will you walk beside me , Mr Wrayburn , and not touch me ? '
Parsing [sent. 16993 len. 11]: For , his arm was already stealing round her waist .
Parsing [sent. 16994 len. 12]: She stopped again , and gave him an earnest supplicating look .
Parsing [sent. 16995 len. 8]: ` Well , Lizzie , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 16996 len. 26]: said he , in an easy way though ill at ease with himself ` do n't be unhappy , do n't be reproachful . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16997 len. 16]: I can not help being unhappy , but I do not mean to be reproachful .
Parsing [sent. 16998 len. 17]: Mr Wrayburn , I implore you to go away from this neighbourhood , to-morrow morning . '
Parsing [sent. 16999 len. 8]: ` Lizzie , Lizzie , Lizzie ! '
Parsing [sent. 17000 len. 3]: he remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 17001 len. 9]: ` As well be reproachful as wholly unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 17002 len. 7]: I ca n't go away . '
Parsing [sent. 17003 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 17004 len. 4]: ` Faith ! '
Parsing [sent. 17005 len. 8]: said Eugene in his airily candid manner .
Parsing [sent. 17006 len. 8]: ` Because you wo n't let me .
Parsing [sent. 17007 len. 2]: Mind !
Parsing [sent. 17008 len. 9]: I do n't mean to be reproachful either .
Parsing [sent. 17009 len. 12]: I do n't complain that you design to keep me here .
Parsing [sent. 17010 len. 10]: But you do it , you do it . '
Parsing [sent. 17011 len. 37]: ` Will you walk beside me , and not touch me ; ' for , his arm was coming about her again ; ` while I speak to you very seriously , Mr Wrayburn ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17012 len. 27]: I will do anything within the limits of possibility , for you , Lizzie , ' he answered with pleasant gaiety as he folded his arms .
Parsing [sent. 17013 len. 4]: ` See here !
Parsing [sent. 17014 len. 7]: Napoleon Buonaparte at St Helena . '
Parsing [sent. 17015 len. 60]: ` When you spoke to me as I came from the Mill the night before last , ' said Lizzie , fixing her eyes upon him with the look of supplication which troubled his better nature , ` you told me that you were much surprised to see me , and that you were on a solitary fishing excursion .
Parsing [sent. 17016 len. 5]: Was it true ? '
Parsing [sent. 17017 len. 16]: ` It was not , ' replied Eugene composedly , ` in the least true .
Parsing [sent. 17018 len. 16]: I came here , because I had information that I should find you here . '
Parsing [sent. 17019 len. 14]: ` Can you imagine why I left London , Mr Wrayburn ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17020 len. 22]: I am afraid , Lizzie , ' he openly answered , ` that you left London to get rid of me .
Parsing [sent. 17021 len. 17]: It is not flattering to my self-love , but I am afraid you did . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17022 len. 4]: I did . '
Parsing [sent. 17023 len. 10]: ` How could you be so cruel ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17024 len. 21]: O Mr Wrayburn , ' she answered , suddenly breaking into tears , ` is the cruelty on my side !
Parsing [sent. 17025 len. 18]: O Mr Wrayburn , Mr Wrayburn , is there no cruelty in your being here to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 17026 len. 40]: ` In the name of all that 's good -- and that is not conjuring you in my own name , for Heaven knows I am not good ' -- said Eugene , ` do n't be distressed ! '
Parsing [sent. 17027 len. 18]: ` What else can I be , when I know the distance and the difference between us ?
Parsing [sent. 17028 len. 23]: What else can I be , when to tell me why you came here , is to put me to shame ! '
Parsing [sent. 17029 len. 7]: said Lizzie , covering her face .
Parsing [sent. 17030 len. 14]: He looked at her with a real sentiment of remorseful tenderness and pity .
Parsing [sent. 17031 len. 22]: It was not strong enough to impell him to sacrifice himself and spare her , but it was a strong emotion .
Parsing [sent. 17032 len. 3]: ` Lizzie !
Parsing [sent. 17033 len. 24]: I never thought before , that there was a woman in the world who could affect me so much by saying so little .
Parsing [sent. 17034 len. 11]: But do n't be hard in your construction of me .
Parsing [sent. 17035 len. 13]: You do n't know what my state of mind towards you is .
Parsing [sent. 17036 len. 12]: You do n't know how you haunt me and bewilder me .
Parsing [sent. 17037 len. 28]: You do n't know how the cursed carelessness that is over-officious in helping me at every other turning of my life , WO N'T help me here .
Parsing [sent. 17038 len. 24]: You have struck it dead , I think , and I sometimes almost wish you had struck me dead along with it . '
Parsing [sent. 17039 len. 25]: She had not been prepared for such passionate expressions , and they awakened some natural sparks of feminine pride and joy in her breast .
Parsing [sent. 17040 len. 28]: To consider , wrong as he was , that he could care so much for her , and that she had the power to move him so !
Parsing [sent. 17041 len. 20]: ` It grieves you to see me distressed , Mr Wrayburn ; it grieves me to see you distressed .
Parsing [sent. 17042 len. 6]: I do n't reproach you .
Parsing [sent. 17043 len. 7]: Indeed I do n't reproach you .
Parsing [sent. 17044 len. 24]: You have not felt this as I feel it , being so different from me , and beginning from another point of view .
Parsing [sent. 17045 len. 5]: You have not thought .
Parsing [sent. 17046 len. 12]: But I entreat you to think now , think now ! '
Parsing [sent. 17047 len. 9]: ` What am I to think of ? '
Parsing [sent. 17048 len. 5]: asked Eugene , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 17049 len. 6]: ` Think of me . '
Parsing [sent. 17050 len. 21]: ` Tell me how NOT to think of you , Lizzie , and you 'll change me altogether . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17051 len. 8]: I do n't mean in that way .
Parsing [sent. 17052 len. 19]: Think of me , as belonging to another station , and quite cut off from you in honour .
Parsing [sent. 17053 len. 18]: Remember that I have no protector near me , unless I have one in your noble heart .
Parsing [sent. 17054 len. 5]: Respect my good name .
Parsing [sent. 17055 len. 32]: If you feel towards me , in one particular , as you might if I was a lady , give me the full claims of a lady upon your generous behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 17056 len. 14]: I am removed from you and your family by being a working girl .
Parsing [sent. 17057 len. 21]: How true a gentleman to be as considerate of me as if I was removed by being a Queen ! '
Parsing [sent. 17058 len. 14]: He would have been base indeed to have stood untouched by her appeal .
Parsing [sent. 17059 len. 21]: His face expressed contrition and indecision as he asked : ` Have I injured you so much , Lizzie ? '
Parsing [sent. 17060 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 17061 len. 7]: You may set me quite right .
Parsing [sent. 17062 len. 19]: I do n't speak of the past , Mr Wrayburn , but of the present and the future .
Parsing [sent. 17063 len. 37]: Are we not here now , because through two days you have followed me so closely where there are so many eyes to see you , that I consented to this appointment as an escape ? '
Parsing [sent. 17064 len. 20]: ` Again , not very flattering to my self-love , ' said Eugene , moodily ; ` but yes .
Parsing [sent. 17065 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 17066 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 17067 len. 19]: ` Then I beseech you , Mr Wrayburn , I beg and pray you , leave this neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 17068 len. 14]: If you do not , consider to what you will drive me . '
Parsing [sent. 17069 len. 19]: He did consider within himself for a moment or two , and then retorted , ` Drive you ?
Parsing [sent. 17070 len. 10]: To what shall I drive you , Lizzie ? '
Parsing [sent. 17071 len. 7]: ` You will drive me away .
Parsing [sent. 17072 len. 14]: I live here peacefully and respected , and I am well employed here .
Parsing [sent. 17073 len. 41]: You will force me to quit this place as I quitted London , and -- by following me again -- will force me to quit the next place in which I may find refuge , as I quitted this . '
Parsing [sent. 17074 len. 30]: ` Are you so determined , Lizzie -- forgive the word I am going to use , for its literal truth -- to fly from a lover ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17075 len. 21]: I am so determined , ' she answered resolutely , though trembling , ` to fly from such a lover .
Parsing [sent. 17076 len. 33]: There was a poor woman died here but a little while ago , scores of years older than I am , whom I found by chance , lying on the wet earth .
Parsing [sent. 17077 len. 11]: You may have heard some account of her ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17078 len. 17]: I think I have , ' he answered , ` if her name was Higden . '
Parsing [sent. 17079 len. 6]: ` Her name was Higden .
Parsing [sent. 17080 len. 19]: Though she was so weak and old , she kept true to one purpose to the very last .
Parsing [sent. 17081 len. 29]: Even at the very last , she made me promise that her purpose should be kept to , after she was dead , so settled was her determination .
Parsing [sent. 17082 len. 8]: What she did , I can do .
Parsing [sent. 17083 len. 46]: Mr Wrayburn , if I believed -- but I do not believe -- that you could be so cruel to me as to drive me from place to place to wear me out , you should drive me to death and not do it . '
Parsing [sent. 17084 len. 55]: He looked full at her handsome face , and in his own handsome face there was a light of blended admiration , anger , and reproach , which she -- who loved him so in secret whose heart had long been so full , and he the cause of its overflowing -- drooped before .
Parsing [sent. 17085 len. 18]: She tried hard to retain her firmness , but he saw it melting away under his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17086 len. 30]: In the moment of its dissolution , and of his first full knowledge of his influence upon her , she dropped , and he caught her on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 17087 len. 3]: ` Lizzie !
Parsing [sent. 17088 len. 5]: Rest so a moment .
Parsing [sent. 17089 len. 6]: Answer what I ask you .
Parsing [sent. 17090 len. 31]: If I had not been what you call removed from you and cut off from you , would you have made this appeal to me to leave you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17091 len. 10]: I do n't know , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 17092 len. 8]: Do n't ask me , Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 17093 len. 7]: Let me go back . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17094 len. 12]: I swear to you , Lizzie , you shall go directly .
Parsing [sent. 17095 len. 10]: I swear to you , you shall go alone .
Parsing [sent. 17096 len. 18]: I 'll not accompany you , I 'll not follow you , if you will reply . '
Parsing [sent. 17097 len. 8]: ` How can I , Mr Wrayburn ?
Parsing [sent. 17098 len. 21]: How can I tell you what I should have done , if you had not been what you are ? '
Parsing [sent. 17099 len. 36]: ` If I had not been what you make me out to be , ' he struck in , skilfully changing the form of words , ` would you still have hated me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17100 len. 24]: O Mr Wrayburn , ' she replied appealingly , and weeping , ` you know me better than to think I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 17101 len. 27]: ` If I had not been what you make me out to be , Lizzie , would you still have been indifferent to me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17102 len. 20]: O Mr Wrayburn , ' she answered as before , ` you know me better than that too ! '
Parsing [sent. 17103 len. 36]: There was something in the attitude of her whole figure as he supported it , and she hung her head , which besought him to be merciful and not force her to disclose her heart .
Parsing [sent. 17104 len. 14]: He was not merciful with her , and he made her do it .
Parsing [sent. 17105 len. 18]: ` If I know you better than quite to believe -LRB- unfortunate dog though I am ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 17106 len. 29]: that you hate me , or even that you are wholly indifferent to me , Lizzie , let me know so much more from yourself before we separate .
Parsing [sent. 17107 len. 29]: Let me know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being what you would have considered on equal terms with you . '
Parsing [sent. 17108 len. 8]: ` It is impossible , Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 17109 len. 14]: How can I think of you as being on equal terms with me ?
Parsing [sent. 17110 len. 18]: If my mind could put you on equal terms with me , you could not be yourself .
Parsing [sent. 17111 len. 31]: How could I remember , then , the night when I first saw you , and when I went out of the room because you looked at me so attentively ?
Parsing [sent. 17112 len. 20]: Or , the night that passed into the morning when you broke to me that my father was dead ?
Parsing [sent. 17113 len. 17]: Or , the nights when you used to come to see me at my next home ?
Parsing [sent. 17114 len. 19]: Or , your having known how uninstructed I was , and having caused me to be taught better ?
Parsing [sent. 17115 len. 30]: Or , my having so looked up to you and wondered at you , and at first thought you so good to be at all mindful of me ? '
Parsing [sent. 17116 len. 13]: ` Only `` at first '' thought me so good , Lizzie ?
Parsing [sent. 17117 len. 11]: What did you think me after `` at first '' ?
Parsing [sent. 17118 len. 5]: So bad ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17119 len. 6]: I do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 17120 len. 6]: I do n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 17121 len. 42]: But after the first wonder and pleasure of being noticed by one so different from any one who had ever spoken to me , I began to feel that it might have been better if I had never seen you . '
Parsing [sent. 17122 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 17123 len. 15]: ` Because you WERE so different , ' she answered in a lower voice .
Parsing [sent. 17124 len. 10]: ` Because it was so endless , so hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 17125 len. 4]: Spare me ! '
Parsing [sent. 17126 len. 12]: ` Did you think for me at all , Lizzie ? '
Parsing [sent. 17127 len. 11]: he asked , as if he were a little stung .
Parsing [sent. 17128 len. 7]: ` Not much , Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 17129 len. 6]: Not much until to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 17130 len. 9]: ` Will you tell me why ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17131 len. 13]: I never supposed until to-night that you needed to be thought for .
Parsing [sent. 17132 len. 53]: But if you do need to be ; if you do truly feel at heart that you have indeed been towards me what you have called yourself to-night , and that there is nothing for us in this life but separation ; then Heaven help you , and Heaven bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17133 len. 30]: The purity with which in these words she expressed something of her own love and her own suffering , made a deep impression on him for the passing time .
Parsing [sent. 17134 len. 31]: He held her , almost as if she were sanctified to him by death , and kissed her , once , almost as he might have kissed the dead . '
Parsing [sent. 17135 len. 13]: I promised that I would not accompany you , nor follow you .
Parsing [sent. 17136 len. 7]: Shall I keep you in view ?
Parsing [sent. 17137 len. 13]: You have been agitated , and it 's growing dark . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17138 len. 22]: I am used to be out alone at this hour , and I entreat you not to do so . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17139 len. 3]: I promise .
Parsing [sent. 17140 len. 23]: I can bring myself to promise nothing more tonight , Lizzie , except that I will try what I can do . '
Parsing [sent. 17141 len. 21]: ` There is but one means , Mr Wrayburn , of sparing yourself and of sparing me , every way .
Parsing [sent. 17142 len. 8]: Leave this neighbourhood to-morrow morning . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17143 len. 5]: I will try . '
Parsing [sent. 17144 len. 27]: As he spoke the words in a grave voice , she put her hand in his , removed it , and went away by the river-side .
Parsing [sent. 17145 len. 9]: ` Now , could Mortimer believe this ? '
Parsing [sent. 17146 len. 16]: murmured Eugene , still remaining , after a while , where she had left him .
Parsing [sent. 17147 len. 9]: ` Can I even believe it myself ? '
Parsing [sent. 17148 len. 21]: He referred to the circumstance that there were tears upon his hand , as he stood covering his eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 17149 len. 13]: A most ridiculous position this , to be found out in ! '
Parsing [sent. 17150 len. 5]: was his next thought .
Parsing [sent. 17151 len. 18]: And his next struck its root in a little rising resentment against the cause of the tears .
Parsing [sent. 17152 len. 25]: ` Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her , too , let her be as much in earnest as she will ! '
Parsing [sent. 17153 len. 19]: The reflection brought back the yielding of her face and form as she had drooped under his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 17154 len. 28]: Contemplating the reproduction , he seemed to see , for the second time , in the appeal and in the confession of weakness , a little fear .
Parsing [sent. 17155 len. 6]: ` And she loves me .
Parsing [sent. 17156 len. 13]: And so earnest a character must be very earnest in that passion .
Parsing [sent. 17157 len. 23]: She can not choose for herself to be strong in this fancy , wavering in that , and weak in the other .
Parsing [sent. 17158 len. 16]: She must go through with her nature , as I must go through with mine .
Parsing [sent. 17159 len. 18]: If mine exacts its pains and penalties all round , so must hers , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 17160 len. 19]: Pursuing the inquiry into his own nature , he thought , ` Now , if I married her .
Parsing [sent. 17161 len. 49]: If , outfacing the absurdity of the situation in correspondence with M. R. F. , I astonished M. R. F. to the utmost extent of his respected powers , by informing him that I had married her , how would M. R. F. reason with the legal mind ?
Parsing [sent. 17162 len. 21]: `` You would n't marry for some money and some station , because you were frightfully likely to become bored .
Parsing [sent. 17163 len. 17]: Are you less frightfully likely to become bored , marrying for no money and no station ?
Parsing [sent. 17164 len. 7]: Are you sure of yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17165 len. 30]: Legal mind , in spite of forensic protestations , must secretly admit , `` Good reasoning on the part of M. R. F. NOT sure of myself . '' '
Parsing [sent. 17166 len. 29]: In the very act of calling this tone of levity to his aid , he felt it to be profligate and worthless , and asserted her against it .
Parsing [sent. 17167 len. 63]: ` And yet , ' said Eugene , ' I should like to see the fellow -LRB- Mortimer excepted -RRB- who would undertake to tell me that this was not a real sentiment on my part , won out of me by her beauty and her worth , in spite of myself , and that I would not be true to her .
Parsing [sent. 17168 len. 58]: I should particularly like to see the fellow to-night who would tell me so , or who would tell me anything that could he construed to her disadvantage ; for I am wearily out of sorts with one Wrayburn who cuts a sorry figure , and I would far rather be out of sorts with somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 17169 len. 14]: `` Eugene , Eugene , Eugene , this is a bad business . ''
Parsing [sent. 17170 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 17171 len. 14]: So go the Mortimer Lightwood bells , and they sound melancholy to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 17172 len. 15]: Strolling on , he thought of something else to take himself to task for .
Parsing [sent. 17173 len. 56]: ` Where is the analogy , Brute Beast , ' he said impatiently , ` between a woman whom your father coolly finds out for you and a woman whom you have found out for yourself , and have ever drifted after with more and more of constancy since you first set eyes upon her ?
Parsing [sent. 17174 len. 2]: Ass !
Parsing [sent. 17175 len. 9]: Can you reason no better than that ? '
Parsing [sent. 17176 len. 27]: But , again he subsided into a reminiscence of his first full knowledge of his power just now , and of her disclosure of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 17177 len. 22]: To try no more to go away , and to try her again , was the reckless conclusion it turned uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 17178 len. 18]: And yet again , ` Eugene , Eugene , Eugene , this is a bad business ! '
Parsing [sent. 17179 len. 20]: And , ' I wish I could stop the Lightwood peal , for it sounds like a knell . '
Parsing [sent. 17180 len. 46]: Looking above , he found that the young moon was up , and that the stars were beginning to shine in the sky from which the tones of red and yellow were flickering out , in favour of the calm blue of a summer night .
Parsing [sent. 17181 len. 7]: He was still by the river-side .
Parsing [sent. 17182 len. 25]: Turning suddenly , he met a man , so close upon him that Eugene , surprised , stepped back , to avoid a collision .
Parsing [sent. 17183 len. 32]: The man carried something over his shoulder which might have been a broken oar , or spar , or bar , and took no notice of him , but passed on .
Parsing [sent. 17184 len. 6]: ` Halloa , friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 17185 len. 13]: said Eugene , calling after him , ` are you blind ? '
Parsing [sent. 17186 len. 11]: The man made no reply , but went his way .
Parsing [sent. 17187 len. 19]: Eugene Wrayburn went the opposite way , with his hands behind him and his purpose in his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 17188 len. 25]: He passed the sheep , and passed the gate , and came within hearing of the village sounds , and came to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 17189 len. 31]: The inn where he stayed , like the village and the mill , was not across the river , but on that side of the stream on which he walked .
Parsing [sent. 17190 len. 75]: However , knowing the rushy bank and the backwater on the other side to be a retired place , and feeling out of humour for noise or company , he crossed the bridge , and sauntered on : looking up at the stars as they seemed one by one to be kindled in the sky , and looking down at the river as the same stars seemed to be kindled deep in the water .
Parsing [sent. 17191 len. 25]: A landing-place overshadowed by a willow , and a pleasure-boat lying moored there among some stakes , caught his eye as he passed along .
Parsing [sent. 17192 len. 24]: The spot was in such dark shadow , that he paused to make out what was there , and then passed on again .
Parsing [sent. 17193 len. 16]: The rippling of the river seemed to cause a correspondent stir in his uneasy reflections .
Parsing [sent. 17194 len. 30]: He would have laid them asleep if he could , but they were in movement , like the stream , and all tending one way with a strong current .
Parsing [sent. 17195 len. 43]: As the ripple under the moon broke unexpectedly now and then , and palely flashed in a new shape and with a new sound , so parts of his thoughts started , unbidden , from the rest , and revealed their wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 17196 len. 23]: ` Out of the question to marry her , ' said Eugene , ` and out of the question to leave her .
Parsing [sent. 17197 len. 4]: The crisis ! '
Parsing [sent. 17198 len. 6]: He had sauntered far enough .
Parsing [sent. 17199 len. 21]: Before turning to retrace his steps , he stopped upon the margin , to look down at the reflected night .
Parsing [sent. 17200 len. 33]: In an instant , with a dreadful crash , the reflected night turned crooked , flames shot jaggedly across the air , and the moon and stars came bursting from the sky .
Parsing [sent. 17201 len. 6]: Was he struck by lightning ?
Parsing [sent. 17202 len. 50]: With some incoherent half-formed thought to that effect , he turned under the blows that were blinding him and mashing his life , and closed with a murderer , whom he caught by a red neckerchief -- unless the raining down of his own blood gave it that hue .
Parsing [sent. 17203 len. 49]: Eugene was light , active , and expert ; but his arms were broken , or he was paralysed , and could do no more than hang on to the man , with his head swung back , so that he could see nothing but the heaving sky .
Parsing [sent. 17204 len. 32]: After dragging at the assailant , he fell on the bank with him , and then there was another great crash , and then a splash , and all was done .
Parsing [sent. 17205 len. 56]: Lizzie Hexam , too , had avoided the noise , and the Saturday movement of people in the straggling street , and chose to walk alone by the water until her tears should be dry , and she could so compose herself as to escape remark upon her looking ill or unhappy on going home .
Parsing [sent. 17206 len. 28]: The peaceful serenity of the hour and place , having no reproaches or evil intentions within her breast to contend against , sank healingly into its depths .
Parsing [sent. 17207 len. 7]: She had meditated and taken comfort .
Parsing [sent. 17208 len. 15]: She , too , was turning homeward , when she heard a strange sound .
Parsing [sent. 17209 len. 13]: It startled her , for it was like a sound of blows .
Parsing [sent. 17210 len. 7]: She stood still , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 17211 len. 17]: It sickened her , for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the quiet of the night .
Parsing [sent. 17212 len. 10]: As she listened , undecided , all was silent .
Parsing [sent. 17213 len. 18]: As she yet listened , she heard a faint groan , and a fall into the river .
Parsing [sent. 17214 len. 10]: Her old bold life and habit instantly inspired her .
Parsing [sent. 17215 len. 28]: Without vain waste of breath in crying for help where there were none to hear , she ran towards the spot from which the sounds had come .
Parsing [sent. 17216 len. 37]: It lay between her and the bridge , but it was more removed from her than she had thought ; the night being so very quiet , and sound travelling far with the help of water .
Parsing [sent. 17217 len. 33]: At length , she reached a part of the green bank , much and newly trodden , where there lay some broken splintered pieces of wood and some torn fragments of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 17218 len. 10]: Stooping , she saw that the grass was bloody .
Parsing [sent. 17219 len. 18]: Following the drops and smears , she saw that the watery margin of the bank was bloody .
Parsing [sent. 17220 len. 22]: Following the current with her eyes , she saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon , and drifting away .
Parsing [sent. 17221 len. 31]: Now , merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time , and grant , O Blessed Lord , that through thy wonderful workings it may turn to good at last !
Parsing [sent. 17222 len. 41]: To whomsoever the drifting face belongs , be it man 's or woman 's , help my humble hands , Lord God , to raise it from death and restore it to some one to whom it must be dear !
Parsing [sent. 17223 len. 18]: It was thought , fervently thought , but not for a moment did the prayer check her .
Parsing [sent. 17224 len. 51]: She was away before it welled up in her mind , away , swift and true , yet steady above all -- for without steadiness it could never be done -- to the landing-place under the willow-tree , where she also had seen the boat lying moored among the stakes .
Parsing [sent. 17225 len. 33]: A sure touch of her old practised hand , a sure step of her old practised foot , a sure light balance of her body , and she was in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 17226 len. 27]: A quick glance of her practised eye showed her , even through the deep dark shadow , the sculls in a rack against the redbrick garden-wall .
Parsing [sent. 17227 len. 42]: Another moment , and she had cast off -LRB- taking the line with her -RRB- , and the boat had shot out into the moonlight , and she was rowing down the stream as never other woman rowed on English water .
Parsing [sent. 17228 len. 17]: Intently over her shoulder , without slackening speed , she looked ahead for the driving face .
Parsing [sent. 17229 len. 72]: She passed the scene of the struggle -- yonder it was , on her left , well over the boat 's stern -- she passed on her right , the end of the village street , a hilly street that almost dipped into the river ; its sounds were growing faint again , and she slackened ; looking as the boat drove , everywhere , everywhere , for the floating face .
Parsing [sent. 17230 len. 38]: She merely kept the boat before the stream now , and rested on her oars , knowing well that if the face were not soon visible , it had gone down , and she would overshoot it .
Parsing [sent. 17231 len. 22]: An untrained sight would never have seen by the moonlight what she saw at the length of a few strokes astern .
Parsing [sent. 17232 len. 26]: She saw the drowning figure rise to the surface , slightly struggle , and as if by instinct turn over on its back to float .
Parsing [sent. 17233 len. 16]: Just so had she first dimly seen the face which she now dimly saw again .
Parsing [sent. 17234 len. 42]: Firm of look and firm of purpose , she intently watched its coming on , until it was very near ; then , with a touch unshipped her sculls , and crept aft in the boat , between kneeling and crouching .
Parsing [sent. 17235 len. 16]: Once , she let the body evade her , not being sure of her grasp .
Parsing [sent. 17236 len. 12]: Twice , and she had seized it by its bloody hair .
Parsing [sent. 17237 len. 25]: It was insensible , if not virtually dead ; it was mutilated , and streaked the water all about it with dark red streaks .
Parsing [sent. 17238 len. 18]: As it could not help itself , it was impossible for her to get it on board .
Parsing [sent. 17239 len. 27]: She bent over the stern to secure it with the line , and then the river and its shores rang to the terrible cry she uttered .
Parsing [sent. 17240 len. 39]: But , as if possessed by supernatural spirit and strength , she lashed it safe , resumed her seat , and rowed in , desperately , for the nearest shallow water where she might run the boat aground .
Parsing [sent. 17241 len. 23]: Desperately , but not wildly , for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention , all was lost and gone .
Parsing [sent. 17242 len. 36]: She ran the boat ashore , went into the water , released him from the line , and by main strength lifted him in her arms and laid him in the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 17243 len. 19]: He had fearful wounds upon him , and she bound them up with her dress torn into strips .
Parsing [sent. 17244 len. 34]: Else , supposing him to be still alive , she foresaw that he must bleed to death before he could be landed at his inn , which was the nearest place for succour .
Parsing [sent. 17245 len. 35]: This done very rapidly , she kissed his disfigured forehead , looked up in anguish to the stars , and blessed him and forgave him , ` if she had anything to forgive . '
Parsing [sent. 17246 len. 22]: It was only in that instant that she thought of herself , and then she thought of herself only for him .
Parsing [sent. 17247 len. 35]: Now , merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time , enabling me , without a wasted moment , to have got the boat afloat again , and to row back against the stream !
Parsing [sent. 17248 len. 41]: And grant , O Blessed Lord God , that through poor me he may be raised from death , and preserved to some one else to whom he may be dear one day , though never dearer than to me !
Parsing [sent. 17249 len. 25]: She rowed hard -- rowed desperately , but never wildly -- and seldom removed her eyes from him in the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 17250 len. 40]: She had so laid him there , as that she might see his disfigured face ; it was so much disfigured that his mother might have covered it , but it was above and beyond disfigurement in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17251 len. 18]: The boat touched the edge of the patch of inn lawn , sloping gently to the water .
Parsing [sent. 17252 len. 18]: There were lights in the windows , but there chanced to be no one out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 17253 len. 29]: She made the boat fast , and again by main strength took him up , and never laid him down until she laid him down in the house .
Parsing [sent. 17254 len. 12]: Surgeons were sent for , and she sat supporting his head .
Parsing [sent. 17255 len. 32]: She had oftentimes heard in days that were gone , how doctors would lift the hand of an insensible wounded person , and would drop it if the person were dead .
Parsing [sent. 17256 len. 24]: She waited for the awful moment when the doctors might lift this hand , all broken and bruised , and let it fall .
Parsing [sent. 17257 len. 24]: The first of the surgeons came , and asked , before proceeding to his examination , ` Who brought him in ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17258 len. 17]: I brought him in , sir , ' answered Lizzie , at whom all present looked .
Parsing [sent. 17259 len. 6]: ` You , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 17260 len. 14]: You could not lift , far less carry , this weight . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17261 len. 20]: I think I could not , at another time , sir ; but I am sure I did . '
Parsing [sent. 17262 len. 14]: The surgeon looked at her with great attention , and with some compassion .
Parsing [sent. 17263 len. 22]: Having with a grave face touched the wounds upon the head , and the broken arms , he took the hand .
Parsing [sent. 17264 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 17265 len. 6]: would he let it drop ?
Parsing [sent. 17266 len. 4]: He appeared irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 17267 len. 34]: He did not retain it , but laid it gently down , took a candle , looked more closely at the injuries on the head , and at the pupils of the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17268 len. 13]: That done , he replaced the candle and took the hand again .
Parsing [sent. 17269 len. 19]: Another surgeon then coming in , the two exchanged a whisper , and the second took the hand .
Parsing [sent. 17270 len. 21]: Neither did he let it fall at once , but kept it for a while and laid it gently down .
Parsing [sent. 17271 len. 14]: ` Attend to the poor girl , ' said the first surgeon then .
Parsing [sent. 17272 len. 6]: ` She is quite unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 17273 len. 7]: She sees nothing and hears nothing .
Parsing [sent. 17274 len. 6]: All the better for her !
Parsing [sent. 17275 len. 15]: Do n't rouse her , if you can help it ; only move her .
Parsing [sent. 17276 len. 6]: Poor girl , poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 17277 len. 25]: She must be amazingly strong of heart , but it is much to be feared that she has set her heart upon the dead .
Parsing [sent. 17278 len. 6]: Be gentle with her . '
Parsing [sent. 17279 len. 17]: Chapter 7 BETTER TO BE ABEL THAN CAIN Day was breaking at Plashwater Weir Mill Lock .
Parsing [sent. 17280 len. 21]: Stars were yet visible , but there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night .
Parsing [sent. 17281 len. 37]: The moon had gone down , and a mist crept along the banks of the river , seen through which the trees were the ghosts of trees , and the water was the ghost of water .
Parsing [sent. 17282 len. 44]: This earth looked spectral , and so did the pale stars : while the cold eastern glare , expressionless as to heat or colour , with the eye of the firmament quenched , might have been likened to the stare of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 17283 len. 18]: Perhaps it was so likened by the lonely Bargeman , standing on the brink of the lock .
Parsing [sent. 17284 len. 48]: For certain , Bradley Headstone looked that way , when a chill air came up , and when it passed on murmuring , as if it whispered something that made the phantom trees and water tremble -- or threaten -- for fancy might have made it either .
Parsing [sent. 17285 len. 10]: He turned away , and tried the Lock-house door .
Parsing [sent. 17286 len. 7]: It was fastened on the inside .
Parsing [sent. 17287 len. 8]: ` Is he afraid of me ? '
Parsing [sent. 17288 len. 5]: he muttered , knocking .
Parsing [sent. 17289 len. 16]: Rogue Riderhood was soon roused , and soon undrew the bolt and let him in .
Parsing [sent. 17290 len. 14]: ` Why , T'otherest , I thought you had been and got lost !
Parsing [sent. 17291 len. 4]: Two nights away !
Parsing [sent. 17292 len. 37]: I a ` most believed as you 'd giv ' me the slip , and I had as good as half a mind for to advertise you in the newspapers to come for ` ard . '
Parsing [sent. 17293 len. 22]: Bradley 's face turned so dark on this hint , that Riderhood deemed it expedient to soften it into a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 17294 len. 20]: ` But not you , governor , not you , ' he went on , stolidly shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 17295 len. 29]: ` For what did I say to myself arter having amused myself with that there stretch of a comic idea , as a sort of a playful game ?
Parsing [sent. 17296 len. 17]: Why , I says to myself ; `` He 's a man o ' honour . ''
Parsing [sent. 17297 len. 8]: That 's what I says to myself .
Parsing [sent. 17298 len. 12]: `` He 's a man o ' double honour . '' '
Parsing [sent. 17299 len. 10]: Very remarkably , Riderhood put no question to him .
Parsing [sent. 17300 len. 38]: He had looked at him on opening the door , and he now looked at him again -LRB- stealthily this time -RRB- , and the result of his looking was , that he asked him no question .
Parsing [sent. 17301 len. 48]: ` You 'll be for another forty on 'em , governor , as I judges , afore you turns your mind to breakfast , ' said Riderhood , when his visitor sat down , resting his chin on his hand , with his eyes on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 17302 len. 31]: And very remarkably again : Riderhood feigned to set the scanty furniture in order , while he spoke , to have a show of reason for not looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 17303 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 17304 len. 18]: I had better sleep , I think , ' said Bradley , without changing his position . '
Parsing [sent. 17305 len. 12]: I myself should recommend it , governor , ' assented Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 17306 len. 8]: ` Might you be anyways dry ? '
Parsing [sent. 17307 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 17308 len. 17]: I should like a drink , ' said Bradley ; but without appearing to attend much .
Parsing [sent. 17309 len. 19]: Mr Riderhood got out his bottle , and fetched his jug-full of water , and administered a potation .
Parsing [sent. 17310 len. 26]: Then , he shook the coverlet of his bed and spread it smooth , and Bradley stretched himself upon it in the clothes he wore .
Parsing [sent. 17311 len. 44]: Mr Riderhood poetically remarking that he would pick the bones of his night 's rest , in his wooden chair , sat in the window as before ; but , as before , watched the sleeper narrowly until he was very sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 17312 len. 23]: Then , he rose and looked at him close , in the bright daylight , on every side , with great minuteness .
Parsing [sent. 17313 len. 14]: He went out to his Lock to sum up what he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 17314 len. 27]: ` One of his sleeves is tore right away below the elber , and the t ` other 's had a good rip at the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 17315 len. 21]: He 's been hung on to , pretty tight , for his shirt 's all tore out of the neck-gathers .
Parsing [sent. 17316 len. 14]: He 's been in the grass and he 's been in the water .
Parsing [sent. 17317 len. 15]: And he 's spotted , and I know with what , and with whose .
Parsing [sent. 17318 len. 3]: Hooroar ! '
Parsing [sent. 17319 len. 4]: Bradley slept long .
Parsing [sent. 17320 len. 9]: Early in the afternoon a barge came down .
Parsing [sent. 17321 len. 36]: Other barges had passed through , both ways , before it ; but the Lock-keeper hailed only this particular barge , for news , as if he had made a time calculation with some nicety .
Parsing [sent. 17322 len. 24]: The men on board told him a piece of news , and there was a lingering on their part to enlarge upon it .
Parsing [sent. 17323 len. 15]: Twelve hours had intervened since Bradley 's lying down , when he got up .
Parsing [sent. 17324 len. 41]: ` Not that I swaller it , ' said Riderhood , squinting at his Lock , when he saw Bradley coming out of the house , ` as you 've been a sleeping all the time , old boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 17325 len. 18]: Bradley came to him , sitting on his wooden lever , and asked what o'clock it was ?
Parsing [sent. 17326 len. 10]: Riderhood told him it was between two and three .
Parsing [sent. 17327 len. 7]: ` When are you relieved ? '
Parsing [sent. 17328 len. 3]: asked Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 17329 len. 8]: ` Day arter to-morrow , governor . '
Parsing [sent. 17330 len. 5]: ` Not sooner ? '
Parsing [sent. 17331 len. 9]: ` Not a inch sooner , governor . '
Parsing [sent. 17332 len. 13]: On both sides , importance seemed attached to this question of relief .
Parsing [sent. 17333 len. 32]: Riderhood quite petted his reply ; saying a second time , and prolonging a negative roll of his head , 'n -- n -- not a inch sooner , governor . '
Parsing [sent. 17334 len. 12]: ` Did I tell you I was going on to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 17335 len. 3]: asked Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 17336 len. 27]: ` No , governor , ' returned Riderhood , in a cheerful , affable , and conversational manner , ` you did not tell me so .
Parsing [sent. 17337 len. 12]: But most like you meant to it and forgot to it .
Parsing [sent. 17338 len. 18]: How , otherways , could a doubt have come into your head about it , governor ? '
Parsing [sent. 17339 len. 17]: ` As the sun goes down , I intend to go on , ' said Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 17340 len. 14]: ` So much the more necessairy is a Peck , ' returned Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 17341 len. 10]: ` Come in and have it , T'otherest . '
Parsing [sent. 17342 len. 70]: The formality of spreading a tablecloth not being observed in Mr Riderhood 's establishment , the serving of the ` peck ' was the affair of a moment ; it merely consisting in the handing down of a capacious baking dish with three-fourths of an immense meat pie in it , and the production of two pocket-knives , an earthenware mug , and a large brown bottle of beer .
Parsing [sent. 17343 len. 12]: Both ate and drank , but Riderhood much the more abundantly .
Parsing [sent. 17344 len. 43]: In lieu of plates , that honest man cut two triangular pieces from the thick crust of the pie , and laid them , inside uppermost , upon the table : the one before himself , and the other before his guest .
Parsing [sent. 17345 len. 86]: Upon these platters he placed two goodly portions of the contents of the pie , thus imparting the unusual interest to the entertainment that each partaker scooped out the inside of his plate , and consumed it with his other fare , besides having the sport of pursuing the clots of congealed gravy over the plain of the table , and successfully taking them into his mouth at last from the blade of his knife , in case of their not first sliding off it .
Parsing [sent. 17346 len. 16]: Bradley Headstone was so remarkably awkward at these exercises , that the Rogue observed it .
Parsing [sent. 17347 len. 7]: ` Look out , T'otherest ! '
Parsing [sent. 17348 len. 11]: he cried , ` you 'll cut your hand ! '
Parsing [sent. 17349 len. 16]: But , the caution came too late , for Bradley gashed it at the instant .
Parsing [sent. 17350 len. 44]: And , what was more unlucky , in asking Riderhood to tie it up , and in standing close to him for the purpose , he shook his hand under the smart of the wound , and shook blood over Riderhood 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 17351 len. 53]: When dinner was done , and when what remained of the platters and what remained of the congealed gravy had been put back into what remained of the pie , which served as an economical investment for all miscellaneous savings , Riderhood filled the mug with beer and took a long drink .
Parsing [sent. 17352 len. 14]: And now he did look at Bradley , and with an evil eye .
Parsing [sent. 17353 len. 4]: ` T'otherest ! '
Parsing [sent. 17354 len. 16]: he said , hoarsely , as he bent across the table to touch his arm .
Parsing [sent. 17355 len. 12]: ` The news has gone down the river afore you . '
Parsing [sent. 17356 len. 5]: ` What news ? '
Parsing [sent. 17357 len. 32]: ` Who do you think , ' said Riderhood , with a hitch of his head , as if he disdainfully jerked the feint away , ` picked up the body ?
Parsing [sent. 17358 len. 4]: Guess . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17359 len. 9]: I am not good at guessing anything . '
Parsing [sent. 17360 len. 4]: ` She did .
Parsing [sent. 17361 len. 2]: Hooroar !
Parsing [sent. 17362 len. 6]: You had him there agin .
Parsing [sent. 17363 len. 4]: She did . '
Parsing [sent. 17364 len. 28]: The convulsive twitching of Bradley Headstone 's face , and the sudden hot humour that broke out upon it , showed how grimly the intelligence touched him .
Parsing [sent. 17365 len. 12]: But he said not a single word , good or bad .
Parsing [sent. 17366 len. 22]: He only smiled in a lowering manner , and got up and stood leaning at the window , looking through it .
Parsing [sent. 17367 len. 7]: Riderhood followed him with his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17368 len. 11]: Riderhood cast down his eyes on his own besprinkled clothes .
Parsing [sent. 17369 len. 19]: Riderhood began to have an air of being better at a guess than Bradley owned to being . '
Parsing [sent. 17370 len. 27]: I have been so long in want of rest , ' said the schoolmaster , ` that with your leave I 'll lie down again . '
Parsing [sent. 17371 len. 7]: ` And welcome , T'otherest ! '
Parsing [sent. 17372 len. 8]: was the hospitable answer of his host .
Parsing [sent. 17373 len. 22]: He had laid himself down without waiting for it , and he remained upon the bed until the sun was low .
Parsing [sent. 17374 len. 28]: When he arose and came out to resume his journey , he found his host waiting for him on the grass by the towing-path outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 17375 len. 27]: ` Whenever it may be necessary that you and I should have any further communication together , ' said Bradley , ' I will come back .
Parsing [sent. 17376 len. 3]: Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 17377 len. 22]: ` Well , since no better can be , ' said Riderhood , turning on his heel , ` Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 17378 len. 44]: But he turned again as the other set forth , and added under his breath , looking after him with a leer : ` You would n't be let to go like that , if my Relief war n't as good as come .
Parsing [sent. 17379 len. 10]: I 'll catch you up in a mile . '
Parsing [sent. 17380 len. 28]: In a word , his real time of relief being that evening at sunset , his mate came lounging in , within a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 17381 len. 40]: Not staying to fill up the utmost margin of his time , but borrowing an hour or so , to be repaid again when he should relieve his reliever , Riderhood straightway followed on the track of Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 17382 len. 8]: He was a better follower than Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 17383 len. 24]: It had been the calling of his life to slink and skulk and dog and waylay , and he knew his calling well .
Parsing [sent. 17384 len. 43]: He effected such a forced march on leaving the Lock House that he was close up with him -- that is to say , as close up with him as he deemed it convenient to be -- before another Lock was passed .
Parsing [sent. 17385 len. 17]: His man looked back pretty often as he went , but got no hint of him .
Parsing [sent. 17386 len. 47]: HE knew how to take advantage of the ground , and where to put the hedge between them , and where the wall , and when to duck , and when to drop , and had a thousand arts beyond the doomed Bradley 's slow conception .
Parsing [sent. 17387 len. 98]: But , all his arts were brought to a standstill , like himself when Bradley , turning into a green lane or riding by the river-side -- a solitary spot run wild in nettles , briars , and brambles , and encumbered with the scathed trunks of a whole hedgerow of felled trees , on the outskirts of a little wood -- began stepping on these trunks and dropping down among them and stepping on them again , apparently as a schoolboy might have done , but assuredly with no schoolboy purpose , or want of purpose .
Parsing [sent. 17388 len. 8]: ` What are you up to ? '
Parsing [sent. 17389 len. 19]: muttered Riderhood , down in the ditch , and holding the hedge a little open with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 17390 len. 10]: And soon his actions made a most extraordinary reply .
Parsing [sent. 17391 len. 8]: ` By George and the Draggin ! '
Parsing [sent. 17392 len. 14]: cried Riderhood , ` if he ai n't a going to bathe ! '
Parsing [sent. 17393 len. 29]: He had passed back , on and among the trunks of trees again , and has passed on to the water-side and had begun undressing on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 17394 len. 16]: For a moment it had a suspicious look of suicide , arranged to counterfeit accident .
Parsing [sent. 17395 len. 25]: ` But you would n't have fetched a bundle under your arm , from among that timber , if such was your game ! '
Parsing [sent. 17396 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 17397 len. 20]: Nevertheless it was a relief to him when the bather after a plunge and a few strokes came out .
Parsing [sent. 17398 len. 32]: ` For I should n't , ' he said in a feeling manner , ` have liked to lose you till I had made more money out of you neither . '
Parsing [sent. 17399 len. 46]: Prone in another ditch -LRB- he had changed his ditch as his man had changed his position -RRB- , and holding apart so small a patch of the hedge that the sharpest eyes could not have detected him , Rogue Riderhood watched the bather dressing .
Parsing [sent. 17400 len. 22]: And now gradually came the wonder that he stood up , completely clothed , another man , and not the Bargeman .
Parsing [sent. 17401 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 17402 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 17403 len. 9]: ` Much as you was dressed that night .
Parsing [sent. 17404 len. 3]: I see .
Parsing [sent. 17405 len. 10]: You 're a taking me with you , now .
Parsing [sent. 17406 len. 4]: You 're deep .
Parsing [sent. 17407 len. 7]: But I knows a deeper . '
Parsing [sent. 17408 len. 30]: When the bather had finished dressing , he kneeled on the grass , doing something with his hands , and again stood up with his bundle under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 17409 len. 32]: Looking all around him with great attention , he then went to the river 's edge , and flung it in as far , and yet as lightly as he could .
Parsing [sent. 17410 len. 36]: It was not until he was so decidedly upon his way again as to be beyond a bend of the river and for the time out of view , that Riderhood scrambled from the ditch .
Parsing [sent. 17411 len. 32]: ` Now , ' was his debate with himself ` shall I foller you on , or shall I let you loose for this once , and go a fishing ? '
Parsing [sent. 17412 len. 22]: The debate continuing , he followed , as a precautionary measure in any case , and got him again in sight .
Parsing [sent. 17413 len. 41]: ` If I was to let you loose this once , ' said Riderhood then , still following , ' I could make you come to me agin , or I could find you out in one way or another .
Parsing [sent. 17414 len. 12]: If I was n't to go a fishing , others might .
Parsing [sent. 17415 len. 15]: -- I 'll let you loose this once , and go a fishing ! '
Parsing [sent. 17416 len. 11]: With that , he suddenly dropped the pursuit and turned .
Parsing [sent. 17417 len. 21]: The miserable man whom he had released for the time , but not for long , went on towards London .
Parsing [sent. 17418 len. 51]: Bradley was suspicious of every sound he heard , and of every face he saw , but was under a spell which very commonly falls upon the shedder of blood , and had no suspicion of the real danger that lurked in his life , and would have it yet .
Parsing [sent. 17419 len. 77]: Riderhood was much in his thoughts -- had never been out of his thoughts since the night-adventure of their first meeting ; but Riderhood occupied a very different place there , from the place of pursuer ; and Bradley had been at the pains of devising so many means of fitting that place to him , and of wedging him into it , that his mind could not compass the possibility of his occupying any other .
Parsing [sent. 17420 len. 17]: And this is another spell against which the shedder of blood for ever strives in vain .
Parsing [sent. 17421 len. 10]: There are fifty doors by which discovery may enter .
Parsing [sent. 17422 len. 25]: With infinite pains and cunning , he double locks and bars forty-nine of them , and can not see the fiftieth standing wide open .
Parsing [sent. 17423 len. 20]: Now , too , was he cursed with a state of mind more wearing and more wearisome than remorse .
Parsing [sent. 17424 len. 35]: He had no remorse ; but the evildoer who can hold that avenger at bay , can not escape the slower torture of incessantly doing the evil deed again and doing it more efficiently .
Parsing [sent. 17425 len. 25]: In the defensive declarations and pretended confessions of murderers , the pursuing shadow of this torture may be traced through every lie they tell .
Parsing [sent. 17426 len. 21]: If I had done it as alleged , is it conceivable that I would have made this and this mistake ?
Parsing [sent. 17427 len. 28]: If I had done it as alleged , should I have left that unguarded place which that false and wicked witness against me so infamously deposed to ?
Parsing [sent. 17428 len. 69]: The state of that wretch who continually finds the weak spots in his own crime , and strives to strengthen them when it is unchangeable , is a state that aggravates the offence by doing the deed a thousand times instead of once ; but it is a state , too , that tauntingly visits the offence upon a sullen unrepentant nature with its heaviest punishment every time .
Parsing [sent. 17429 len. 35]: Bradley toiled on , chained heavily to the idea of his hatred and his vengeance , and thinking how he might have satiated both in many better ways than the way he had taken .
Parsing [sent. 17430 len. 18]: The instrument might have been better , the spot and the hour might have been better chosen .
Parsing [sent. 17431 len. 76]: To batter a man down from behind in the dark , on the brink of a river , was well enough , but he ought to have been instantly disabled , whereas he had turned and seized his assailant ; and so , to end it before chance-help came , and to be rid of him , he had been hurriedly thrown backward into the river before the life was fully beaten out of him .
Parsing [sent. 17432 len. 15]: Now if it could be done again , it must not be so done .
Parsing [sent. 17433 len. 13]: Supposing his head had been held down under water for a while .
Parsing [sent. 17434 len. 8]: Supposing the first blow had been truer .
Parsing [sent. 17435 len. 6]: Supposing he had been shot .
Parsing [sent. 17436 len. 6]: Supposing he had been strangled .
Parsing [sent. 17437 len. 11]: Suppose this way , that way , the other way .
Parsing [sent. 17438 len. 16]: Suppose anything but getting unchained from the one idea , for that was inexorably impossible .
Parsing [sent. 17439 len. 6]: The school reopened next day .
Parsing [sent. 17440 len. 22]: The scholars saw little or no change in their master 's face , for it always wore its slowly labouring expression .
Parsing [sent. 17441 len. 19]: But , as he heard his classes , he was always doing the deed and doing it better .
Parsing [sent. 17442 len. 47]: As he paused with his piece of chalk at the black board before writing on it , he was thinking of the spot , and whether the water was not deeper and the fall straighter , a little higher up , or a little lower down .
Parsing [sent. 17443 len. 22]: He had half a mind to draw a line or two upon the board , and show himself what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 17444 len. 29]: He was doing it again and improving on the manner , at prayers , in his mental arithmetic , all through his questioning , all through the day .
Parsing [sent. 17445 len. 15]: Charley Hexam was a master now , in another school , under another head .
Parsing [sent. 17446 len. 48]: It was evening , and Bradley was walking in his garden observed from behind a blind by gentle little Miss Peecher , who contemplated offering him a loan of her smelling salts for headache , when Mary Anne , in faithful attendance , held up her arm .
Parsing [sent. 17447 len. 7]: ` Yes , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 17448 len. 18]: ` Young Mr Hexam , if you please , ma'am , coming to see Mr Headstone . '
Parsing [sent. 17449 len. 8]: ` Very good , Mary Anne . '
Parsing [sent. 17450 len. 8]: Again Mary Anne held up her arm .
Parsing [sent. 17451 len. 9]: ` You may speak , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 17452 len. 47]: ` Mr Headstone has beckoned young Mr Hexam into his house , ma'am , and he has gone in himself without waiting for young Mr Hexam to come up , and now HE has gone in too , ma'am , and has shut the door . '
Parsing [sent. 17453 len. 10]: ` With all my heart , Mary Anne . '
Parsing [sent. 17454 len. 8]: Again Mary Anne 's telegraphic arm worked .
Parsing [sent. 17455 len. 8]: ` What more , Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 17456 len. 29]: ` They must find it rather dull and dark , Miss Peecher , for the parlour blind 's down , and neither of them pulls it up . '
Parsing [sent. 17457 len. 41]: ` There is no accounting , ' said good Miss Peecher with a little sad sigh which she repressed by laying her hand on her neat methodical boddice , ` there is no accounting for tastes , Mary Anne . '
Parsing [sent. 17458 len. 20]: Charley , entering the dark room , stopped short when he saw his old friend in its yellow shade .
Parsing [sent. 17459 len. 10]: ` Come in , Hexam , come in . '
Parsing [sent. 17460 len. 21]: Charley advanced to take the hand that was held out to him ; but stopped again , short of it .
Parsing [sent. 17461 len. 23]: The heavy , bloodshot eyes of the schoolmaster , rising to his face with an effort , met his look of scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 17462 len. 10]: ` Mr Headstone , what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 17463 len. 3]: ` Matter ?
Parsing [sent. 17464 len. 3]: Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 17465 len. 10]: ` Mr Headstone , have you heard the news ?
Parsing [sent. 17466 len. 10]: This news about the fellow , Mr Eugene Wrayburn ?
Parsing [sent. 17467 len. 6]: That he is killed ? '
Parsing [sent. 17468 len. 8]: ` He is dead , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 17469 len. 3]: exclaimed Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 17470 len. 31]: Young Hexam standing looking at him , he moistened his lips with his tongue , looked about the room , glanced at his former pupil , and looked down . '
Parsing [sent. 17471 len. 29]: I heard of the outrage , ' said Bradley , trying to constrain his working mouth , ` but I had not heard the end of it . '
Parsing [sent. 17472 len. 25]: ` Where were you , ' said the boy , advancing a step as he lowered his voice , ` when it was done ?
Parsing [sent. 17473 len. 2]: Stop !
Parsing [sent. 17474 len. 6]: I do n't ask that .
Parsing [sent. 17475 len. 5]: Do n't tell me .
Parsing [sent. 17476 len. 20]: If you force your confidence upon me , Mr Headstone , I 'll give up every word of it .
Parsing [sent. 17477 len. 2]: Mind !
Parsing [sent. 17478 len. 3]: Take notice .
Parsing [sent. 17479 len. 13]: I 'll give up it , and I 'll give up you .
Parsing [sent. 17480 len. 4]: I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 17481 len. 11]: The wretched creature seemed to suffer acutely under this renunciation .
Parsing [sent. 17482 len. 17]: A desolate air of utter and complete loneliness fell upon him , like a visible shade .
Parsing [sent. 17483 len. 16]: ` It 's for me to speak , not you , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 17484 len. 13]: ` If you do , you 'll do it at your peril .
Parsing [sent. 17485 len. 43]: I am going to put your selfishness before you , Mr Headstone -- your passionate , violent , and ungovernable selfishness -- to show you why I can , and why I will , have nothing more to do with you . '
Parsing [sent. 17486 len. 30]: He looked at young Hexam as if he were waiting for a scholar to go on with a lesson that he knew by heart and was deadly tired of .
Parsing [sent. 17487 len. 10]: But he had said his last word to him .
Parsing [sent. 17488 len. 64]: ` If you had any part -- I do n't say what -- in this attack , ' pursued the boy ; ` or if you know anything about it -- I do n't say how much -- or if you know who did it -- I go no closer -- you did an injury to me that 's never to be forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 17489 len. 33]: You know that I took you with me to his chambers in the Temple when I told him my opinion of him , and made myself responsible for my opinion of you .
Parsing [sent. 17490 len. 55]: You know that I took you with me when I was watching him with a view to recovering my sister and bringing her to her senses ; you know that I have allowed myself to be mixed up with you , all through this business , in favouring your desire to marry my sister .
Parsing [sent. 17491 len. 25]: And how do you know that , pursuing the ends of your own violent temper , you have not laid me open to suspicion ?
Parsing [sent. 17492 len. 11]: Is that your gratitude to me , Mr Headstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 17493 len. 11]: Bradley sat looking steadily before him at the vacant air .
Parsing [sent. 17494 len. 33]: As often as young Hexam stopped , he turned his eyes towards him , as if he were waiting for him to go on with the lesson , and get it done .
Parsing [sent. 17495 len. 14]: As often as the boy resumed , Bradley resumed his fixed face . '
Parsing [sent. 17496 len. 60]: I am going to be plain with you , Mr Headstone , ' said young Hexam , shaking his head in a half-threatening manner , ` because this is no time for affecting not to know things that I do know -- except certain things at which it might not be very safe for you , to hint again .
Parsing [sent. 17497 len. 19]: What I mean is this : if you were a good master , I was a good pupil .
Parsing [sent. 17498 len. 22]: I have done you plenty of credit , and in improving my own reputation I have improved yours quite as much .
Parsing [sent. 17499 len. 4]: Very well then .
Parsing [sent. 17500 len. 35]: Starting on equal terms , I want to put before you how you have shown your gratitude to me , for doing all I could to further your wishes with reference to my sister .
Parsing [sent. 17501 len. 19]: You have compromised me by being seen about with me , endeavouring to counteract this Mr Eugene Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 17502 len. 9]: That 's the first thing you have done .
Parsing [sent. 17503 len. 33]: If my character , and my now dropping you , help me out of that , Mr Headstone , the deliverance is to be attributed to me , and not to you .
Parsing [sent. 17504 len. 8]: No thanks to you for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17505 len. 12]: The boy stopping again , he moved his eyes again . '
Parsing [sent. 17506 len. 14]: I am going on , Mr Headstone , do n't you be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 17507 len. 19]: I am going on to the end , and I have told you beforehand what the end is .
Parsing [sent. 17508 len. 7]: Now , you know my story .
Parsing [sent. 17509 len. 22]: You are as well aware as I am , that I have had many disadvantages to leave behind me in life .
Parsing [sent. 17510 len. 41]: You have heard me mention my father , and you are sufficiently acquainted with the fact that the home from which I , as I may say , escaped , might have been a more creditable one than it was .
Parsing [sent. 17511 len. 20]: My father died , and then it might have been supposed that my way to respectability was pretty clear .
Parsing [sent. 17512 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 17513 len. 7]: For then my sister begins . '
Parsing [sent. 17514 len. 30]: He spoke as confidently , and with as entire an absence of any telltale colour in his cheek , as if there were no softening old time behind him .
Parsing [sent. 17515 len. 13]: Not wonderful , for there WAS none in his hollow empty heart .
Parsing [sent. 17516 len. 13]: What is there but self , for selfishness to see behind it ?
Parsing [sent. 17517 len. 21]: ` When I speak of my sister , I devoutly wish that you had never seen her , Mr Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 17518 len. 13]: However , you did see her , and that 's useless now .
Parsing [sent. 17519 len. 7]: I confided in you about her .
Parsing [sent. 17520 len. 28]: I explained her character to you , and how she interposed some ridiculous fanciful notions in the way of our being as respectable as I tried for .
Parsing [sent. 17521 len. 16]: You fell in love with her , and I favoured you with all my might .
Parsing [sent. 17522 len. 21]: She could not be induced to favour you , and so we came into collision with this Mr Eugene Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 17523 len. 7]: Now , what have you done ?
Parsing [sent. 17524 len. 28]: Why , you have justified my sister in being firmly set against you from first to last , and you have put me in the wrong again !
Parsing [sent. 17525 len. 7]: And why have you done it ?
Parsing [sent. 17526 len. 31]: Because , Mr Headstone , you are in all your passions so selfish , and so concentrated upon yourself that you have not bestowed one proper thought on me . '
Parsing [sent. 17527 len. 26]: The cool conviction with which the boy took up and held his position , could have been derived from no other vice in human nature .
Parsing [sent. 17528 len. 42]: ` It is , ' he went on , actually with tears , ` an extraordinary circumstance attendant on my life , that every effort I make towards perfect respectability , is impeded by somebody else through no fault of mine !
Parsing [sent. 17529 len. 70]: Not content with doing what I have put before you , you will drag my name into notoriety through dragging my sister 's -- which you are pretty sure to do , if my suspicions have any foundation at all -- and the worse you prove to be , the harder it will be for me to detach myself from being associated with you in people 's minds . '
Parsing [sent. 17530 len. 21]: When he had dried his eyes and heaved a sob over his injuries , he began moving towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 17531 len. 31]: ` However , I have made up my mind that I will become respectable in the scale of society , and that I will not be dragged down by others .
Parsing [sent. 17532 len. 12]: I have done with my sister as well as with you .
Parsing [sent. 17533 len. 27]: Since she cares so little for me as to care nothing for undermining my respectability , she shall go her way and I will go mine .
Parsing [sent. 17534 len. 14]: My prospects are very good , and I mean to follow them alone .
Parsing [sent. 17535 len. 21]: Mr Headstone , I do n't say what you have got upon your conscience , for I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 17536 len. 32]: Whatever lies upon it , I hope you will see the justice of keeping wide and clear of me , and will find a consolation in completely exonerating all but yourself .
Parsing [sent. 17537 len. 40]: I hope , before many years are out , to succeed the master in my present school , and the mistress being a single woman , though some years older than I am , I might even marry her .
Parsing [sent. 17538 len. 36]: If it is any comfort to you to know what plans I may work out by keeping myself strictly respectable in the scale of society , these are the plans at present occurring to me .
Parsing [sent. 17539 len. 42]: In conclusion , if you feel a sense of having injured me , and a desire to make some small reparation , I hope you will think how respectable you might have been yourself and will contemplate your blighted existence . '
Parsing [sent. 17540 len. 14]: Was it strange that the wretched man should take this heavily to heart ?
Parsing [sent. 17541 len. 67]: Perhaps he had taken the boy to heart , first , through some long laborious years ; perhaps through the same years he had found his drudgery lightened by communication with a brighter and more apprehensive spirit than his own ; perhaps a family resemblance of face and voice between the boy and his sister , smote him hard in the gloom of his fallen state .
Parsing [sent. 17542 len. 52]: For whichsoever reason , or for all , he drooped his devoted head when the boy was gone , and shrank together on the floor , and grovelled there , with the palms of his hands tight-clasping his hot temples , in unutterable misery , and unrelieved by a single tear .
Parsing [sent. 17543 len. 11]: Rogue Riderhood had been busy with the river that day .
Parsing [sent. 17544 len. 22]: He had fished with assiduity on the previous evening , but the light was short , and he had fished unsuccessfully .
Parsing [sent. 17545 len. 26]: He had fished again that day with better luck , and had carried his fish home to Plashwater Weir Mill Lock-house , in a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 17546 len. 46]: Chapter 8 A FEW GRAINS OF PEPPER The dolls ' dressmaker went no more to the business-premises of Pubsey and Co. in St Mary Axe , after chance had disclosed to her -LRB- as she supposed -RRB- the flinty and hypocritical character of Mr Riah .
Parsing [sent. 17547 len. 30]: She often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat , but made her little purchases elsewhere , and lived a secluded life .
Parsing [sent. 17548 len. 37]: After much consultation with herself , she decided not to put Lizzie Hexam on her guard against the old man , arguing that the disappointment of finding him out would come upon her quite soon enough .
Parsing [sent. 17549 len. 37]: Therefore , in her communication with her friend by letter , she was silent on this theme , and principally dilated on the backslidings of her bad child , who every day grew worse and worse .
Parsing [sent. 17550 len. 56]: ` You wicked old boy , ' Miss Wren would say to him , with a menacing forefinger , ` you 'll force me to run away from you , after all , you will ; and then you 'll shake to bits , and there 'll be nobody to pick up the pieces ! '
Parsing [sent. 17551 len. 48]: At this foreshadowing of a desolate decease , the wicked old boy would whine and whimper , and would sit shaking himself into the lowest of low spirits , until such time as he could shake himself out of the house and shake another threepennyworth into himself .
Parsing [sent. 17552 len. 69]: But dead drunk or dead sober -LRB- he had come to such a pass that he was least alive in the latter state -RRB- , it was always on the conscience of the paralytic scarecrow that he had betrayed his sharp parent for sixty threepennyworths of rum , which were all gone , and that her sharpness would infallibly detect his having done it , sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 17553 len. 53]: All things considered therefore , and addition made of the state of his body to the state of his mind , the bed on which Mr Dolls reposed was a bed of roses from which the flowers and leaves had entirely faded , leaving him to lie upon the thorns and stalks .
Parsing [sent. 17554 len. 74]: On a certain day , Miss Wren was alone at her work , with the house-door set open for coolness , and was trolling in a small sweet voice a mournful little song which might have been the song of the doll she was dressing , bemoaning the brittleness and meltability of wax , when whom should she descry standing on the pavement , looking in at her , but Mr Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 17555 len. 7]: I thought it was you ? '
Parsing [sent. 17556 len. 9]: said Fledgeby , coming up the two steps .
Parsing [sent. 17557 len. 5]: ` Did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 17558 len. 4]: Miss Wren retorted .
Parsing [sent. 17559 len. 11]: ` And I thought it was you , young man .
Parsing [sent. 17560 len. 4]: Quite a coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 17561 len. 11]: You 're not mistaken , and I 'm not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 17562 len. 6]: How clever we are ! '
Parsing [sent. 17563 len. 9]: ` Well , and how are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 17564 len. 4]: said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 17565 len. 15]: I am pretty much as usual , sir , ' replied Miss Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 17566 len. 19]: A very unfortunate parent , worried out of my life and senses by a very bad child . '
Parsing [sent. 17567 len. 34]: Fledgeby 's small eyes opened so wide that they might have passed for ordinary-sized eyes , as he stared about him for the very young person whom he supposed to be in question .
Parsing [sent. 17568 len. 29]: ` But you 're not a parent , ' said Miss Wren , ` and consequently it 's of no use talking to you upon a family subject .
Parsing [sent. 17569 len. 13]: -- To what am I to attribute the honour and favour ? '
Parsing [sent. 17570 len. 14]: ` To a wish to improve your acquaintance , ' Mr Fledgeby replied .
Parsing [sent. 17571 len. 15]: Miss Wren , stopping to bite her thread , looked at him very knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 17572 len. 15]: ` We never meet now , ' said Fledgeby ; ` do we ? '
Parsing [sent. 17573 len. 13]: ` No , ' said Miss Wren , chopping off the word .
Parsing [sent. 17574 len. 31]: ` So I had a mind , ' pursued Fledgeby , ` to come and have a talk with you about our dodging friend , the child of Israel . '
Parsing [sent. 17575 len. 12]: ` So HE gave you my address ; did he ? '
Parsing [sent. 17576 len. 5]: asked Miss Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 17577 len. 15]: I got it out of him , ' said Fledgeby , with a stammer .
Parsing [sent. 17578 len. 21]: ` You seem to see a good deal of him , ' remarked Miss Wren , with shrewd distrust . '
Parsing [sent. 17579 len. 13]: A good deal of him you seem to see , considering . '
Parsing [sent. 17580 len. 10]: ` Yes , I do , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17581 len. 4]: ` Considering . '
Parsing [sent. 17582 len. 30]: ` Have n't you , ' inquired the dressmaker , bending over the doll on which her art was being exercised , ` done interceding with him yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 17583 len. 11]: ` No , ' said Fledgeby , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 17584 len. 3]: ` La !
Parsing [sent. 17585 len. 15]: Been interceding with him all this time , and sticking to him still ? '
Parsing [sent. 17586 len. 9]: said Miss Wren , busy with her work .
Parsing [sent. 17587 len. 12]: ` Sticking to him is the word , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17588 len. 28]: Miss Wren pursued her occupation with a concentrated air , and asked , after an interval of silent industry : ` Are you in the army ? '
Parsing [sent. 17589 len. 14]: ` Not exactly , ' said Fledgeby , rather flattered by the question .
Parsing [sent. 17590 len. 4]: ` Navy ? '
Parsing [sent. 17591 len. 4]: asked Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 17592 len. 9]: ` N -- no , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17593 len. 22]: He qualified these two negatives , as if he were not absolutely in either service , but was almost in both .
Parsing [sent. 17594 len. 7]: ` What are you then ? '
Parsing [sent. 17595 len. 5]: demanded Miss Wren . '
Parsing [sent. 17596 len. 12]: I am a gentleman , I am , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17597 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 17598 len. 13]: assented Jenny , screwing up her mouth with an appearance of conviction .
Parsing [sent. 17599 len. 7]: ` Yes , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 17600 len. 13]: That accounts for your having so much time to give to interceding .
Parsing [sent. 17601 len. 15]: But only to think how kind and friendly a gentleman you must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 17602 len. 22]: Mr Fledgeby found that he was skating round a board marked Dangerous , and had better cut out a fresh track .
Parsing [sent. 17603 len. 16]: ` Let 's get back to the dodgerest of the dodgers , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 17604 len. 16]: ` What 's he up to in the case of your friend the handsome gal ?
Parsing [sent. 17605 len. 6]: He must have some object .
Parsing [sent. 17606 len. 6]: What 's his object ? '
Parsing [sent. 17607 len. 14]: ` Can not undertake to say , sir , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 17608 len. 6]: returned Miss Wren , composedly .
Parsing [sent. 17609 len. 31]: ` He wo n't acknowledge where she 's gone , ' said Fledgeby ; ` and I have a fancy that I should like to have another look at her .
Parsing [sent. 17610 len. 11]: Now I know he knows where she is gone . '
Parsing [sent. 17611 len. 14]: ` Can not undertake to say , sir , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 17612 len. 5]: Miss Wren again rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 17613 len. 13]: ` And you know where she is gone , ' hazarded Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17614 len. 16]: ` Can not undertake to say , sir , really , ' replied Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 17615 len. 36]: The quaint little chin met Mr Fledgeby 's gaze with such a baffling hitch , that that agreeable gentleman was for some time at a loss how to resume his fascinating part in the dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 17616 len. 9]: At length he said : ` Miss Jenny !
Parsing [sent. 17617 len. 13]: -- That 's your name , if I do n't mistake ? '
Parsing [sent. 17618 len. 27]: ` Probably you do n't mistake , sir , ' was Miss Wren 's cool answer ; ` because you had it on the best authority .
Parsing [sent. 17619 len. 6]: Mine , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 17620 len. 4]: ` Miss Jenny !
Parsing [sent. 17621 len. 16]: Instead of coming up and being dead , let 's come out and look alive .
Parsing [sent. 17622 len. 23]: It 'll pay better , I assure you , ' said Fledgeby , bestowing an inveigling twinkle or two upon the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 17623 len. 9]: ` You 'll find it pay better . '
Parsing [sent. 17624 len. 67]: ` Perhaps , ' said Miss Jenny , holding out her doll at arm 's length , and critically contemplating the effect of her art with her scissors on her lips and her head thrown back , as if her interest lay there , and not in the conversation ; ` perhaps you 'll explain your meaning , young man , which is Greek to me .
Parsing [sent. 17625 len. 16]: -- You must have another touch of blue in your trimming , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 17626 len. 42]: Having addressed the last remark to her fair client , Miss Wren proceeded to snip at some blue fragments that lay before her , among fragments of all colours , and to thread a needle from a skein of blue silk .
Parsing [sent. 17627 len. 8]: ` Look here , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17628 len. 8]: -- ` Are you attending ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17629 len. 19]: I am attending , sir , ' replied Miss Wren , without the slightest appearance of so doing .
Parsing [sent. 17630 len. 13]: ` Another touch of blue in your trimming , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 17631 len. 24]: ` Well , look here , ' said Fledgeby , rather discouraged by the circumstances under which he found himself pursuing the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 17632 len. 43]: ` If you 're attending -- ' -LRB- ` Light blue , my sweet young lady , ' remarked Miss Wren , in a sprightly tone , ` being best suited to your fair complexion and your flaxen curls . ' -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 17633 len. 21]: I say , if you 're attending , ' proceeded Fledgeby , ` it 'll pay better in this way .
Parsing [sent. 17634 len. 30]: It 'll lead in a roundabout manner to your buying damage and waste of Pubsey and Co. at a nominal price , or even getting it for nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 17635 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 17636 len. 4]: thought the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 17637 len. 25]: ` But you are not so roundabout , Little Eyes , that I do n't notice your answering for Pubsey and Co. after all !
Parsing [sent. 17638 len. 14]: Little Eyes , Little Eyes , you 're too cunning by half . '
Parsing [sent. 17639 len. 34]: ` And I take it for granted , ' pursued Fledgeby , ` that to get the most of your materials for nothing would be well worth your while , Miss Jenny ? '
Parsing [sent. 17640 len. 31]: ` You may take it for granted , ' returned the dressmaker with many knowing nods , ` that it 's always well worth my while to make money . '
Parsing [sent. 17641 len. 17]: ` Now , ' said Fledgeby approvingly , ` you 're answering to a sensible purpose .
Parsing [sent. 17642 len. 10]: Now , you 're coming out and looking alive !
Parsing [sent. 17643 len. 26]: So I make so free , Miss Jenny , as to offer the remark , that you and Judah were too thick together to last .
Parsing [sent. 17644 len. 35]: You ca n't come to be intimate with such a deep file as Judah without beginning to see a little way into him , you know , ' said Fledgeby with a wink . '
Parsing [sent. 17645 len. 28]: I must own , ' returned the dressmaker , with her eyes upon her work , ` that we are not good friends at present . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17646 len. 15]: I know you 're not good friends at present , ' said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 17647 len. 6]: I know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 17648 len. 20]: I should like to pay off Judah , by not letting him have his own deep way in everything .
Parsing [sent. 17649 len. 19]: In most things he 'll get it by hook or by crook , but -- hang it all !
Parsing [sent. 17650 len. 13]: -- do n't let him have his own deep way in everything .
Parsing [sent. 17651 len. 6]: That 's too much . '
Parsing [sent. 17652 len. 22]: Mr Fledgeby said this with some display of indignant warmth , as if he was counsel in the cause for Virtue .
Parsing [sent. 17653 len. 12]: ` How can I prevent his having his own way ? '
Parsing [sent. 17654 len. 4]: began the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 17655 len. 13]: ` Deep way , I called it , ' said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 17656 len. 10]: -- His own deep way , in anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 17657 len. 11]: ` I 'll tell you , ' said Fledgeby . '
Parsing [sent. 17658 len. 14]: I like to hear you ask it , because it 's looking alive .
Parsing [sent. 17659 len. 15]: It 's what I should expect to find in one of your sagacious understanding .
Parsing [sent. 17660 len. 5]: Now , candidly . '
Parsing [sent. 17661 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 17662 len. 5]: cried Miss Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 17663 len. 16]: I said , now candidly , ' Mr Fledgeby explained , a little put out .
Parsing [sent. 17664 len. 5]: ` Oh-h ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 17665 len. 16]: I should be glad to countermine him , respecting the handsome gal , your friend .
Parsing [sent. 17666 len. 5]: He means something there .
Parsing [sent. 17667 len. 11]: You may depend upon it , Judah means something there .
Parsing [sent. 17668 len. 15]: He has a motive , and of course his motive is a dark motive .
Parsing [sent. 17669 len. 47]: Now , whatever his motive is , it 's necessary to his motive ' -- Mr Fledgeby 's constructive powers were not equal to the avoidance of some tautology here -- ` that it should be kept from me , what he has done with her .
Parsing [sent. 17670 len. 17]: So I put it to you , who know : What HAS he done with her ?
Parsing [sent. 17671 len. 5]: I ask no more .
Parsing [sent. 17672 len. 15]: And is that asking much , when you understand that it will pay ? '
Parsing [sent. 17673 len. 34]: Miss Jenny Wren , who had cast her eyes upon the bench again after her last interruption , sat looking at it , needle in hand but not working , for some moments .
Parsing [sent. 17674 len. 28]: She then briskly resumed her work , and said with a sidelong glance of her eyes and chin at Mr Fledgeby : ` Where d'ye live ? '
Parsing [sent. 17675 len. 9]: ` Albany , Piccadilly , ' replied Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17676 len. 8]: ` When are you at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 17677 len. 6]: ` When you like . '
Parsing [sent. 17678 len. 4]: ` Breakfast-time ? '
Parsing [sent. 17679 len. 10]: said Jenny , in her abruptest and shortest manner .
Parsing [sent. 17680 len. 12]: ` No better time in the day , ' said Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17681 len. 12]: ` I 'll look in upon you to-morrow , young man .
Parsing [sent. 17682 len. 20]: Those two ladies , ' pointing to dolls , ` have an appointment in Bond Street at ten precisely .
Parsing [sent. 17683 len. 14]: When I 've dropped 'em there , I 'll drive round to you .
Parsing [sent. 17684 len. 16]: With a weird little laugh , Miss Jenny pointed to her crutch-stick as her equipage .
Parsing [sent. 17685 len. 8]: ` This is looking alive indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 17686 len. 5]: cried Fledgeby , rising .
Parsing [sent. 17687 len. 4]: ` Mark you !
Parsing [sent. 17688 len. 30]: I promise you nothing , ' said the dolls ' dressmaker , dabbing two dabs at him with her needle , as if she put out both his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17689 len. 4]: ` No no .
Parsing [sent. 17690 len. 7]: I understand , ' returned Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17691 len. 11]: ` The damage and waste question shall be settled first .
Parsing [sent. 17692 len. 13]: It shall be made to pay ; do n't you be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 17693 len. 6]: Good-day , Miss Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 17694 len. 7]: ` Good-day , young man . '
Parsing [sent. 17695 len. 41]: Mr Fledgeby 's prepossessing form withdrew itself ; and the little dressmaker , clipping and snipping and stitching , and stitching and snipping and clipping , fell to work at a great rate ; musing and muttering all the time .
Parsing [sent. 17696 len. 7]: ` Misty , misty , misty .
Parsing [sent. 17697 len. 6]: Ca n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 17698 len. 9]: Little Eyes and the wolf in a conspiracy ?
Parsing [sent. 17699 len. 10]: Or Little Eyes and the wolf against one another ?
Parsing [sent. 17700 len. 6]: Ca n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 17701 len. 14]: My poor Lizzie , have they both designs against you , either way ?
Parsing [sent. 17702 len. 6]: Ca n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 17703 len. 10]: Is Little Eyes Pubsey , and the wolf Co ?
Parsing [sent. 17704 len. 6]: Ca n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 17705 len. 10]: Pubsey true to Co , and Co to Pubsey ?
Parsing [sent. 17706 len. 10]: Pubsey false to Co , and Co to Pubsey ?
Parsing [sent. 17707 len. 6]: Ca n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 17708 len. 5]: What said Little Eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 17709 len. 6]: `` Now , candidly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17710 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 17711 len. 10]: However the cat jumps , HE 'S a liar .
Parsing [sent. 17712 len. 32]: That 's all I can make out at present ; but you may go to bed in the Albany , Piccadilly , with THAT for your pillow , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 17713 len. 41]: Thereupon , the little dressmaker again dabbed out his eyes separately , and making a loop in the air of her thread and deftly catching it into a knot with her needle , seemed to bowstring him into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 17714 len. 49]: For the terrors undergone by Mr Dolls that evening when his little parent sat profoundly meditating over her work , and when he imagined himself found out , as often as she changed her attitude , or turned her eyes towards him , there is no adequate name .
Parsing [sent. 17715 len. 25]: Moreover it was her habit to shake her head at that wretched old boy whenever she caught his eye as he shivered and shook .
Parsing [sent. 17716 len. 56]: What are popularly called ` the trembles ' being in full force upon him that evening , and likewise what are popularly called ` the horrors , ' he had a very bad time of it ; which was not made better by his being so remorseful as frequently to moan ` Sixty threepennorths . '
Parsing [sent. 17717 len. 51]: This imperfect sentence not being at all intelligible as a confession , but sounding like a Gargantuan order for a dram , brought him into new difficulties by occasioning his parent to pounce at him in a more than usually snappish manner , and to overwhelm him with bitter reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 17718 len. 23]: What was a bad time for Mr Dolls , could not fail to be a bad time for the dolls ' dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 17719 len. 36]: However , she was on the alert next morning , and drove to Bond Street , and set down the two ladies punctually , and then directed her equipage to conduct her to the Albany .
Parsing [sent. 17720 len. 43]: Arrived at the doorway of the house in which Mr Fledgeby 's chambers were , she found a lady standing there in a travelling dress , holding in her hand -- of all things in the world -- a gentleman 's hat .
Parsing [sent. 17721 len. 7]: ` You want some one ? '
Parsing [sent. 17722 len. 9]: said the lady in a stern manner . '
Parsing [sent. 17723 len. 11]: I am going up stairs to Mr Fledgeby 's . '
Parsing [sent. 17724 len. 10]: ` You can not do that at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 17725 len. 7]: There is a gentleman with him .
Parsing [sent. 17726 len. 7]: I am waiting for the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 17727 len. 18]: His business with Mr Fledgeby will very soon be transacted , and then you can go up .
Parsing [sent. 17728 len. 12]: Until the gentleman comes down , you must wait here . '
Parsing [sent. 17729 len. 28]: While speaking , and afterwards , the lady kept watchfully between her and the staircase , as if prepared to oppose her going up , by force .
Parsing [sent. 17730 len. 23]: The lady being of a stature to stop her with a hand , and looking mightily determined , the dressmaker stood still .
Parsing [sent. 17731 len. 3]: ` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 17732 len. 6]: Why do you listen ? '
Parsing [sent. 17733 len. 5]: asked the lady . '
Parsing [sent. 17734 len. 10]: I am not listening , ' said the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 17735 len. 7]: ` What do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 17736 len. 8]: asked the lady , altering her phrase .
Parsing [sent. 17737 len. 11]: ` Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere ? '
Parsing [sent. 17738 len. 9]: said the dressmaker , with an inquiring look .
Parsing [sent. 17739 len. 16]: ` Mr Fledgeby in his shower-bath , perhaps , ' remarked the lady , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 17740 len. 12]: ` And somebody 's beating a carpet , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 17741 len. 16]: ` Mr Fledgeby 's carpet , I dare say , ' replied the smiling lady .
Parsing [sent. 17742 len. 33]: Miss Wren had a reasonably good eye for smiles , being well accustomed to them on the part of her young friends , though their smiles mostly ran smaller than in nature .
Parsing [sent. 17743 len. 17]: But she had never seen so singular a smile as that upon this lady 's face .
Parsing [sent. 17744 len. 17]: It twitched her nostrils open in a remarkable manner , and contracted her lips and eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 17745 len. 31]: It was a smile of enjoyment too , though of such a fierce kind that Miss Wren thought she would rather not enjoy herself than do it in that way .
Parsing [sent. 17746 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 17747 len. 7]: said the lady , watching her .
Parsing [sent. 17748 len. 6]: ` What now ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17749 len. 9]: I hope there 's nothing the matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 17750 len. 4]: said the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 17751 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 17752 len. 5]: inquired the lady . '
Parsing [sent. 17753 len. 15]: I do n't know where , ' said Miss Wren , staring about her .
Parsing [sent. 17754 len. 9]: ` But I never heard such odd noises .
Parsing [sent. 17755 len. 12]: Do n't you think I had better call somebody ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17756 len. 20]: I think you had better not , ' returned the lady with a significant frown , and drawing closer .
Parsing [sent. 17757 len. 25]: On this hint , the dressmaker relinquished the idea , and stood looking at the lady as hard as the lady looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 17758 len. 33]: Meanwhile the dressmaker listened with amazement to the odd noises which still continued , and the lady listened too , but with a coolness in which there was no trace of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 17759 len. 34]: Soon afterwards , came a slamming and banging of doors ; and then came running down stairs , a gentleman with whiskers , and out of breath , who seemed to be red-hot .
Parsing [sent. 17760 len. 9]: ` Is your business done , Alfred ? '
Parsing [sent. 17761 len. 4]: inquired the lady .
Parsing [sent. 17762 len. 18]: ` Very thoroughly done , ' replied the gentleman , as he took his hat from her .
Parsing [sent. 17763 len. 23]: ` You can go up to Mr Fledgeby as soon as you like , ' said the lady , moving haughtily away .
Parsing [sent. 17764 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 17765 len. 41]: And you can take these three pieces of stick with you , ' added the gentleman politely , ` and say , if you please , that they come from Mr Alfred Lammle , with his compliments on leaving England .
Parsing [sent. 17766 len. 4]: Mr Alfred Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 17767 len. 11]: Be so good as not to forget the name . '
Parsing [sent. 17768 len. 17]: The three pieces of stick were three broken and frayed fragments of a stout lithe cane .
Parsing [sent. 17769 len. 26]: Miss Jenny taking them wonderingly , and the gentleman repeating with a grin , ` Mr Alfred Lammle , if you 'll be so good .
Parsing [sent. 17770 len. 26]: Compliments , on leaving England , ' the lady and gentleman walked away quite deliberately , and Miss Jenny and her crutch-stick went up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 17771 len. 8]: ` Lammle , Lammle , Lammle ? '
Parsing [sent. 17772 len. 19]: Miss Jenny repeated as she panted from stair to stair , ` where have I heard that name ?
Parsing [sent. 17773 len. 4]: Lammle , Lammle ?
Parsing [sent. 17774 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 17775 len. 5]: Saint Mary Axe ! '
Parsing [sent. 17776 len. 21]: With a gleam of new intelligence in her sharp face , the dolls ' dressmaker pulled at Fledgeby 's bell .
Parsing [sent. 17777 len. 25]: No one answered ; but , from within the chambers , there proceeded a continuous spluttering sound of a highly singular and unintelligible nature .
Parsing [sent. 17778 len. 4]: ` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 17779 len. 6]: Is Little Eyes choking ? '
Parsing [sent. 17780 len. 4]: cried Miss Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 17781 len. 22]: Pulling at the bell again and getting no reply , she pushed the outer door , and found it standing ajar .
Parsing [sent. 17782 len. 62]: No one being visible on her opening it wider , and the spluttering continuing , she took the liberry of opening an inner door , and then beheld the extraordinary spectacle of Mr Fledgeby in a shirt , a pair of Turkish trousers , and a Turkish cap , rolling over and over on his own carpet , and spluttering wonderfully .
Parsing [sent. 17783 len. 5]: ` Oh Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 17784 len. 4]: gasped Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17785 len. 5]: ` Oh my eye !
Parsing [sent. 17786 len. 3]: Stop thief !
Parsing [sent. 17787 len. 4]: I am strangling .
Parsing [sent. 17788 len. 2]: Fire !
Parsing [sent. 17789 len. 4]: Oh my eye !
Parsing [sent. 17790 len. 5]: A glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 17791 len. 7]: Give me a glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 17792 len. 4]: Shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 17793 len. 2]: Murder !
Parsing [sent. 17794 len. 4]: Oh Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 17795 len. 9]: And then rolled and spluttered more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 17796 len. 47]: Hurrying into another room , Miss Jenny got a glass of water , and brought it for Fledgeby 's relief : who , gasping , spluttering , and rattling in his throat betweenwhiles , drank some water , and laid his head faintly on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 17797 len. 6]: ` Oh my eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 17798 len. 6]: cried Fledgehy , struggling anew .
Parsing [sent. 17799 len. 7]: ` It 's salt and snuff .
Parsing [sent. 17800 len. 16]: It 's up my nose , and down my throat , and in my wind-pipe .
Parsing [sent. 17801 len. 2]: Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 17802 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17803 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17804 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17805 len. 9]: Ah -- h -- h -- h ! '
Parsing [sent. 17806 len. 27]: And here , crowing fearfully , with his eyes starting out of his head , appeared to be contending with every mortal disease incidental to poultry .
Parsing [sent. 17807 len. 12]: ` And Oh my Eye , I 'm so sore ! '
Parsing [sent. 17808 len. 24]: cried Fledgeby , starting , over on his back , in a spasmodic way that caused the dressmaker to retreat to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 17809 len. 6]: ` Oh I smart so !
Parsing [sent. 17810 len. 14]: Do put something to my back and arms , and legs and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 17811 len. 2]: Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 17812 len. 12]: It 's down my throat again and ca n't come up .
Parsing [sent. 17813 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17814 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17815 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17816 len. 8]: Ah -- h -- h -- h !
Parsing [sent. 17817 len. 6]: Oh I smart so ! '
Parsing [sent. 17818 len. 18]: Here Mr Fledgeby bounded up , and bounded down , and went rolling over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 17819 len. 46]: The dolls ' dressmaker looked on until he rolled himself into a corner with his Turkish slippers uppermost , and then , resolving in the first place to address her ministration to the salt and snuff , gave him more water and slapped his back .
Parsing [sent. 17820 len. 28]: But , the latter application was by no means a success , causing Mr Fledgeby to scream , and to cry out , ` Oh my eye !
Parsing [sent. 17821 len. 5]: do n't slap me !
Parsing [sent. 17822 len. 11]: I 'm covered with weales and I smart so ! '
Parsing [sent. 17823 len. 54]: However , he gradually ceased to choke and crow , saving at intervals , and Miss Jenny got him into an easy-chair : where , with his eyes red and watery , with his features swollen , and with some half-dozen livid bars across his face , he presented a most rueful sight .
Parsing [sent. 17824 len. 15]: ` What ever possessed you to take salt and snuff , young man ? '
Parsing [sent. 17825 len. 5]: inquired Miss Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 17826 len. 12]: I did n't take it , ' the dismal youth replied .
Parsing [sent. 17827 len. 9]: ` It was crammed into my mouth . '
Parsing [sent. 17828 len. 6]: ` Who crammed it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17829 len. 4]: asked Miss Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 17830 len. 8]: ` He did , ' answered Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17831 len. 4]: ` The assassin .
Parsing [sent. 17832 len. 2]: Lammle .
Parsing [sent. 17833 len. 17]: He rubbed it into my mouth and up my nose and down my throat -- Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17834 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17835 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 17836 len. 8]: Ah -- h -- h -- h !
Parsing [sent. 17837 len. 2]: Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 17838 len. 14]: -- to prevent my crying out , and then cruelly assaulted me . '
Parsing [sent. 17839 len. 5]: ` With this ? '
Parsing [sent. 17840 len. 10]: asked Miss Jenny , showing the pieces of cane .
Parsing [sent. 17841 len. 19]: ` That 's the weapon , ' said Fledgeby , eyeing it with the air of an acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 17842 len. 7]: ` He broke it over me .
Parsing [sent. 17843 len. 5]: Oh I smart so !
Parsing [sent. 17844 len. 8]: How did you come by it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17845 len. 25]: ` When he ran down stairs and joined the lady he had left in the hall with his hat ' -- Miss Jenny began .
Parsing [sent. 17846 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 17847 len. 16]: groaned Mr Fledgeby , writhing , ` she was holding his hat , was she ?
Parsing [sent. 17848 len. 10]: I might have known she was in it . '
Parsing [sent. 17849 len. 46]: ` When he came down stairs and joined the lady who would n't let me come up , he gave me the pieces for you , and I was to say , `` With Mr Alfred Lammle 's compliments on his leaving England . '' '
Parsing [sent. 17850 len. 46]: Miss Jenny said it with such spiteful satisfaction , and such a hitch of her chin and eyes as might have added to Mr Fledgehy 's miseries , if he could have noticed either , in his bodily pain with his hand to his head .
Parsing [sent. 17851 len. 9]: ` Shall I go for the police ? '
Parsing [sent. 17852 len. 12]: inquired Miss Jenny , with a nimble start towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 17853 len. 3]: ` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 17854 len. 6]: No , do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 17855 len. 3]: cried Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17856 len. 6]: ` Do n't , please .
Parsing [sent. 17857 len. 7]: We had better keep it quiet .
Parsing [sent. 17858 len. 10]: Will you be so good as shut the door ?
Parsing [sent. 17859 len. 7]: Oh I do smart so ! '
Parsing [sent. 17860 len. 27]: In testimony of the extent to which he smarted , Mr Fledgeby came wallowing out of the easy-chair , and took another roll on the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 17861 len. 48]: Now the door 's shut , ' said Mr Fledgeby , sitting up in anguish , with his Turkish cap half on and half off , and the bars on his face getting bluer , ` do me the kindness to look at my back and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 17862 len. 24]: They must be in an awful state , for I had n't got my dressing-gown on , when the brute came rushing in .
Parsing [sent. 17863 len. 18]: Cut my shirt away from the collar ; there 's a pair of scissors on that table .
Parsing [sent. 17864 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 17865 len. 12]: groaned Mr Fledgeby , with his hand to his head again .
Parsing [sent. 17866 len. 11]: ` How I do smart , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 17867 len. 4]: ` There ? '
Parsing [sent. 17868 len. 11]: inquired Miss Jenny , alluding to the back and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 17869 len. 7]: ` Oh Lord , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 17870 len. 6]: moaned Fledgeby , rocking himself .
Parsing [sent. 17871 len. 5]: ` And all over !
Parsing [sent. 17872 len. 3]: Everywhere ! '
Parsing [sent. 17873 len. 28]: The busy little dressmaker quickly snipped the shirt away , and laid bare the results of as furious and sound a thrashing as even Mr Fledgeby merited .
Parsing [sent. 17874 len. 10]: ` You may well smart , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 17875 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 17876 len. 26]: And stealthily rubbed her little hands behind him , and poked a few exultant pokes with her two forefingers over the crown of his head .
Parsing [sent. 17877 len. 12]: ` What do you think of vinegar and brown paper ? '
Parsing [sent. 17878 len. 10]: inquired the suffering Fledgeby , still rocking and moaning .
Parsing [sent. 17879 len. 17]: ` Does it look as if vinegar and brown paper was the sort of application ? '
Parsing [sent. 17880 len. 13]: ` Yes , ' said Miss Jenny , with a silent chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 17881 len. 12]: ` It looks as if it ought to be Pickled . '
Parsing [sent. 17882 len. 14]: Mr Fledgeby collapsed under the word ` Pickled , ' and groaned again .
Parsing [sent. 17883 len. 32]: ` My kitchen is on this floor , ' he said ; ` you 'll find brown paper in a dresser-drawer there , and a bottle of vinegar on a shelf .
Parsing [sent. 17884 len. 15]: Would you have the kindness to make a few plasters and put 'em on ?
Parsing [sent. 17885 len. 9]: It ca n't be kept too quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 17886 len. 11]: ` One , two -- hum -- five , six .
Parsing [sent. 17887 len. 10]: You 'll want six , ' said the dress-maker .
Parsing [sent. 17888 len. 21]: ` There 's smart enough , ' whimpered Mr Fledgeby , groaning and writhing again , ` for sixty . '
Parsing [sent. 17889 len. 30]: Miss Jenny repaired to the kitchen , scissors in hand , found the brown paper and found the vinegar , and skilfully cut out and steeped six large plasters .
Parsing [sent. 17890 len. 25]: When they were all lying ready on the dresser , an idea occurred to her as she was about to gather them up . '
Parsing [sent. 17891 len. 21]: I think , ' said Miss Jenny with a silent laugh , ` he ought to have a little pepper ?
Parsing [sent. 17892 len. 5]: Just a few grains ?
Parsing [sent. 17893 len. 21]: I think the young man 's tricks and manners make a claim upon his friends for a little pepper ? '
Parsing [sent. 17894 len. 34]: Mr Fledgeby 's evil star showing her the pepper-box on the chimneypiece , she climbed upon a chair , and got it down , and sprinkled all the plasters with a judicious hand .
Parsing [sent. 17895 len. 29]: She then went back to Mr Fledgeby , and stuck them all on him : Mr Fledgeby uttering a sharp howl as each was put in its place .
Parsing [sent. 17896 len. 7]: ` There , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 17897 len. 6]: said the dolls ' dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 17898 len. 10]: ` Now I hope you feel pretty comfortable ? '
Parsing [sent. 17899 len. 25]: Apparently , Mr Fledgeby did not , for he cried by way of answer , ` Oh -- h how I do smart ! '
Parsing [sent. 17900 len. 31]: Miss Jenny got his Persian gown upon him , extinguished his eyes crookedly with his Persian cap , and helped him to his bed : upon which he climbed groaning .
Parsing [sent. 17901 len. 35]: ` Business between you and me being out of the question to-day , young man , and my time being precious , ' said Miss Jenny then , ` I 'll make myself scarce .
Parsing [sent. 17902 len. 6]: Are you comfortable now ? '
Parsing [sent. 17903 len. 6]: ` Oh my eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 17904 len. 4]: cried Mr Fledgeby .
Parsing [sent. 17905 len. 7]: ` No , I ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 17906 len. 6]: Oh -- h -- h !
Parsing [sent. 17907 len. 6]: how I do smart ! '
Parsing [sent. 17908 len. 42]: The last thing Miss Jenny saw , as she looked back before closing the room door , was Mr Fledgeby in the act of plunging and gambolling all over his bed , like a porpoise or dolphin in its native element .
Parsing [sent. 17909 len. 68]: She then shut the bedroom door , and all the other doors , and going down stairs and emerging from the Albany into the busy streets , took omnibus for Saint Mary Axe : pressing on the road all the gaily-dressed ladies whom she could see from the window , and making them unconscious lay-figures for dolls , while she mentally cut them out and basted them .
Parsing [sent. 17910 len. 45]: Chapter 9 TWO PLACES VACATED Set down by the omnibus at the corner of Saint Mary Axe , and trusting to her feet and her crutch-stick within its precincts , the dolls ' dressmaker proceeded to the place of business of Pubsey and Co. .
Parsing [sent. 17911 len. 14]: All there was sunny and quiet externally , and shady and quiet internally .
Parsing [sent. 17912 len. 30]: Hiding herself in the entry outside the glass door , she could see from that post of observation the old man in his spectacles sitting writing at his desk .
Parsing [sent. 17913 len. 4]: ` Boh ! '
Parsing [sent. 17914 len. 12]: cried the dressmaker , popping in her head at the glass-door .
Parsing [sent. 17915 len. 7]: ` Mr Wolf at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 17916 len. 16]: The old man took his glasses off , and mildly laid them down beside him .
Parsing [sent. 17917 len. 8]: ` Ah Jenny , is it you ?
Parsing [sent. 17918 len. 9]: I thought you had given me up . '
Parsing [sent. 17919 len. 31]: ` And so I had given up the treacherous wolf of the forest , ' she replied ; ` but , godmother , it strikes me you have come back .
Parsing [sent. 17920 len. 14]: I am not quite sure , because the wolf and you change forms .
Parsing [sent. 17921 len. 22]: I want to ask you a question or two , to find out whether you are really godmother or really wolf .
Parsing [sent. 17922 len. 4]: May I ? '
Parsing [sent. 17923 len. 8]: ` Yes , Jenny , yes . '
Parsing [sent. 17924 len. 19]: But Riah glanced towards the door , as if he thought his principal might appear there , unseasonably .
Parsing [sent. 17925 len. 26]: ` If you 're afraid of the fox , ' said Miss Jenny , ` you may dismiss all present expectations of seeing that animal .
Parsing [sent. 17926 len. 13]: HE wo n't show himself abroad , for many a day . '
Parsing [sent. 17927 len. 11]: ` What do you mean , my child ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17928 len. 58]: I mean , godmother , ' replied Miss Wren , sitting down beside the Jew , ` that the fox has caught a famous flogging , and that if his skin and bones are not tingling , aching , and smarting at this present instant , no fox did ever tingle , ache , and smart . '
Parsing [sent. 17929 len. 20]: Therewith Miss Jenny related what had come to pass in the Albany , omitting the few grains of pepper .
Parsing [sent. 17930 len. 30]: ` Now , godmother , ' she went on , ' I particularly wish to ask you what has taken place here , since I left the wolf here ?
Parsing [sent. 17931 len. 19]: Because I have an idea about the size of a marble , rolling about in my little noddle .
Parsing [sent. 17932 len. 15]: First and foremost , are you Pubsey and Co. , or are you either ?
Parsing [sent. 17933 len. 8]: Upon your solemn word and honour . '
Parsing [sent. 17934 len. 7]: The old man shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 17935 len. 12]: ` Secondly , is n't Fledgeby both Pubsey and Co. ? '
Parsing [sent. 17936 len. 9]: The old man answered with a reluctant nod .
Parsing [sent. 17937 len. 19]: ` My idea , ' exclaimed Miss Wren , ` is now about the size of an orange .
Parsing [sent. 17938 len. 14]: But before it gets any bigger , welcome back , dear godmother ! '
Parsing [sent. 17939 len. 21]: The little creature folded her arms about the old man 's neck with great earnestness , and kissed him . '
Parsing [sent. 17940 len. 8]: I humbly beg your forgiveness , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 17941 len. 5]: I am truly sorry .
Parsing [sent. 17942 len. 10]: I ought to have had more faith in you .
Parsing [sent. 17943 len. 15]: But what could I suppose when you said nothing for yourself , you know ?
Parsing [sent. 17944 len. 28]: I do n't mean to offer that as a justification , but what could I suppose , when you were a silent party to all he said ?
Parsing [sent. 17945 len. 11]: It did look bad ; now did n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17946 len. 32]: ` It looked so bad , Jenny , ' responded the old man , with gravity , ` that I will straightway tell you what an impression it wrought upon me .
Parsing [sent. 17947 len. 8]: I was hateful in mine own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17948 len. 17]: I was hateful to myself , in being so hateful to the debtor and to you .
Parsing [sent. 17949 len. 46]: But more than that , and worse than that , and to pass out far and broad beyond myself -- I reflected that evening , sitting alone in my garden on the housetop , that I was doing dishonour to my ancient faith and race .
Parsing [sent. 17950 len. 35]: I reflected -- clearly reflected for the first time -- that in bending my neck to the yoke I was willing to wear , I bent the unwilling necks of the whole Jewish people .
Parsing [sent. 17951 len. 17]: For it is not , in Christian countries , with the Jews as with other peoples .
Parsing [sent. 17952 len. 16]: Men say , ` This is a bad Greek , but there are good Greeks .
Parsing [sent. 17953 len. 13]: This is a bad Turk , but there are good Turks . '
Parsing [sent. 17954 len. 6]: Not so with the Jews .
Parsing [sent. 17955 len. 19]: Men find the bad among us easily enough -- among what peoples are the bad not easily found ?
Parsing [sent. 17956 len. 36]: -- but they take the worst of us as samples of the best ; they take the lowest of us as presentations of the highest ; and they say `` All Jews are alike . ''
Parsing [sent. 17957 len. 46]: If , doing what I was content to do here , because I was grateful for the past and have small need of money now , I had been a Christian , I could have done it , compromising no one but my individual self .
Parsing [sent. 17958 len. 22]: But doing it as a Jew , I could not choose but compromise the Jews of all conditions and all countries .
Parsing [sent. 17959 len. 14]: It is a little hard upon us , but it is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 17960 len. 9]: I would that all our people remembered it !
Parsing [sent. 17961 len. 20]: Though I have little right to say so , seeing that it came home so late to me . '
Parsing [sent. 17962 len. 20]: The dolls ' dressmaker sat holding the old man by the hand , and looking thoughtfully in his face .
Parsing [sent. 17963 len. 18]: ` Thus I reflected , I say , sitting that evening in my garden on the housetop .
Parsing [sent. 17964 len. 73]: And passing the painful scene of that day in review before me many times , I always saw that the poor gentleman believed the story readily , because I was one of the Jews -- that you believed the story readily , my child , because I was one of the Jews-that the story itself first came into the invention of the originator thereof , because I was one of the Jews .
Parsing [sent. 17965 len. 28]: This was the result of my having had you three before me , face to face , and seeing the thing visibly presented as upon a theatre .
Parsing [sent. 17966 len. 14]: Wherefore I perceived that the obligation was upon me to leave this service .
Parsing [sent. 17967 len. 29]: But Jenny , my dear , ' said Riah , breaking off , ' I promised that you should pursue your questions , and I obstruct them . '
Parsing [sent. 17968 len. 29]: ` On the contrary , godmother ; my idea is as large now as a pumpkin -- and YOU know what a pumpkin is , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 17969 len. 9]: So you gave notice that you were going ?
Parsing [sent. 17970 len. 6]: Does that come next ? '
Parsing [sent. 17971 len. 11]: asked Miss Jenny with a look of close attention . '
Parsing [sent. 17972 len. 8]: I indited a letter to my master .
Parsing [sent. 17973 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 17974 len. 5]: To that effect . '
Parsing [sent. 17975 len. 9]: ` And what said Tingling-Tossing-Aching - ScreamingScratching-Smarter ? '
Parsing [sent. 17976 len. 22]: asked Miss Wren with an unspeakable enjoyment in the utterance of those honourable titles and in the recollection of the pepper .
Parsing [sent. 17977 len. 18]: ` He held me to certain months of servitude , which were his lawful term of notice .
Parsing [sent. 17978 len. 4]: They expire to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 17979 len. 19]: Upon their expiration -- not before -- I had meant to set myself right with my Cinderella . '
Parsing [sent. 17980 len. 27]: ` My idea is getting so immense now , ' cried Miss Wren , clasping her temples , ` that my head wo n't hold it !
Parsing [sent. 17981 len. 10]: Listen , godmother ; I am going to expound .
Parsing [sent. 17982 len. 17]: Little Eyes -LRB- that 's Screaming - ScratchingSmarter -RRB- owes you a heavy grudge for going .
Parsing [sent. 17983 len. 11]: Little Eyes casts about how best to pay you off .
Parsing [sent. 17984 len. 6]: Little Eyes thinks of Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 17985 len. 32]: Little Eyes says to himself , ` I 'll find out where he has placed that girl , and I 'll betray his secret because it 's dear to him . '
Parsing [sent. 17986 len. 29]: Perhaps Little Eyes thinks , `` I 'll make love to her myself too ; '' but that I ca n't swear -- all the rest I can .
Parsing [sent. 17987 len. 15]: So , Little Eyes comes to me , and I go to Little Eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17988 len. 7]: That 's the way of it .
Parsing [sent. 17989 len. 51]: And now the murder 's all out , I 'm sorry , ' added the dolls ' dressmaker , rigid from head to foot with energy as she shook her little fist before her eyes , ` that I did n't give him Cayenne pepper and chopped pickled Capsicum ! '
Parsing [sent. 17990 len. 39]: This expression of regret being but partially intelligible to Mr Riah , the old man reverted to the injuries Fledgeby had received , and hinted at the necessity of his at once going to tend that beaten cur .
Parsing [sent. 17991 len. 8]: ` Godmother , godmother , godmother ! '
Parsing [sent. 17992 len. 14]: cried Miss Wren irritably , ' I really lose all patience with you .
Parsing [sent. 17993 len. 10]: One would think you believed in the Good Samaritan .
Parsing [sent. 17994 len. 8]: How can you be so inconsistent ? '
Parsing [sent. 17995 len. 26]: ` Jenny dear , ' began the old man gently , ` it is the custom of our people to help -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 17996 len. 5]: Bother your people ! '
Parsing [sent. 17997 len. 11]: interposed Miss Wren , with a toss of her head .
Parsing [sent. 17998 len. 27]: ` If your people do n't know better than to go and help Little Eyes , it 's a pity they ever got out of Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 17999 len. 21]: Over and above that , ' she added , ` he would n't take your help if you offered it .
Parsing [sent. 18000 len. 4]: Too much ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 18001 len. 18]: Wants to keep it close and quiet , and to keep you out of the way . '
Parsing [sent. 18002 len. 33]: They were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry , and the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter unceremoniously addressed , ` Riah . '
Parsing [sent. 18003 len. 10]: To which he said there was an answer wanted .
Parsing [sent. 18004 len. 32]: The letter , which was scrawled in pencil uphill and downhill and round crooked corners , ran thus : ` OLD RIAH , ` Your accounts being all squared , go .
Parsing [sent. 18005 len. 17]: Shut up the place , turn out directly , and send me the key by bearer .
Parsing [sent. 18006 len. 2]: Go .
Parsing [sent. 18007 len. 9]: You are an unthankful dog of a Jew .
Parsing [sent. 18008 len. 3]: Get out .
Parsing [sent. 18009 len. 27]: ` F. ' The dolls ' dressmaker found it delicious to trace the screaming and smarting of Little Eyes in the distorted writing of this epistle .
Parsing [sent. 18010 len. 35]: She laughed over it and jeered at it in a convenient corner -LRB- to the great astonishment of the messenger -RRB- while the old man got his few goods together in a black bag .
Parsing [sent. 18011 len. 29]: That done , the shutters of the upper windows closed , and the office blind pulled down , they issued forth upon the steps with the attendant messenger .
Parsing [sent. 18012 len. 33]: There , while Miss Jenny held the bag , the old man locked the house door , and handed over the key to him ; who at once retired with the same .
Parsing [sent. 18013 len. 23]: ` Well , godmother , ' said Miss Wren , as they remained upon the steps together , looking at one another .
Parsing [sent. 18014 len. 11]: ` And so you 're thrown upon the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 18015 len. 13]: ` It would appear so , Jenny , and somewhat suddenly . '
Parsing [sent. 18016 len. 11]: ` Where are you going to seek your fortune ? '
Parsing [sent. 18017 len. 4]: asked Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 18018 len. 29]: The old man smiled , but looked about him with a look of having lost his way in life , which did not escape the dolls ' dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 18019 len. 24]: ` Verily , Jenny , ' said he , ` the question is to the purpose , and more easily asked than answered .
Parsing [sent. 18020 len. 32]: But as I have experience of the ready goodwill and good help of those who have given occupation to Lizzie , I think I will seek them out for myself . '
Parsing [sent. 18021 len. 5]: ` On foot ? '
Parsing [sent. 18022 len. 8]: asked Miss Wren , with a chop .
Parsing [sent. 18023 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 18024 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18025 len. 8]: ` Have I not my staff ? '
Parsing [sent. 18026 len. 24]: It was exactly because he had his staff , and presented so quaint an aspect , that she mistrusted his making the journey .
Parsing [sent. 18027 len. 31]: ` The best thing you can do , ' said Jenny , ` for the time being , at all events , is to come home with me , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 18028 len. 16]: Nobody 's there but my bad child , and Lizzie 's lodging stands empty . '
Parsing [sent. 18029 len. 33]: The old man when satisfied that no inconvenience could be entailed on any one by his compliance , readily complied ; and the singularly-assorted couple once more went through the streets together .
Parsing [sent. 18030 len. 91]: Now , the bad child having been strictly charged by his parent to remain at home in her absence , of course went out ; and , being in the very last stage of mental decrepitude , went out with two objects ; firstly , to establish a claim he conceived himself to have upon any licensed victualler living , to be supplied with threepennyworth of rum for nothing ; and secondly , to bestow some maudlin remorse on Mr Eugene Wrayburn , and see what profit came of it .
Parsing [sent. 18031 len. 51]: Stumblingly pursuing these two designs -- they both meant rum , the only meaning of which he was capable -- the degraded creature staggered into Covent Garden Market and there bivouacked , to have an attack of the trembles succeeded by an attack of the horrors , in a doorway .
Parsing [sent. 18032 len. 38]: This market of Covent Garden was quite out of the creature 's line of road , but it had the attraction for him which it has for the worst of the solitary members of the drunken tribe .
Parsing [sent. 18033 len. 79]: It may be the companionship of the nightly stir , or it may be the companionship of the gin and beer that slop about among carters and hucksters , or it may be the companionship of the trodden vegetable refuse which is so like their own dress that perhaps they take the Market for a great wardrobe ; but be it what it may , you shall see no such individual drunkards on doorsteps anywhere , as there .
Parsing [sent. 18034 len. 30]: Of dozing women-drunkards especially , you shall come upon such specimens there , in the morning sunlight , as you might seek out of doors in vain through London .
Parsing [sent. 18035 len. 27]: Such stale vapid rejected cabbage-leaf and cabbage-stalk dress , such damaged-orange countenance , such squashed pulp of humanity , are open to the day nowhere else .
Parsing [sent. 18036 len. 42]: So , the attraction of the Market drew Mr Dolls to it , and he had out his two fits of trembles and horrors in a doorway on which a woman had had out her sodden nap a few hours before .
Parsing [sent. 18037 len. 39]: There is a swarm of young savages always flitting about this same place , creeping off with fragments of orange-chests , and mouldy litter -- Heaven knows into what holes they can convey them , having no home !
Parsing [sent. 18038 len. 46]: -- whose bare feet fall with a blunt dull softness on the pavement as the policeman hunts them , and who are -LRB- perhaps for that reason -RRB- little heard by the Powers that be , whereas in top-boots they would make a deafening clatter .
Parsing [sent. 18039 len. 38]: These , delighting in the trembles and the horrors of Mr Dolls , as in a gratuitous drama , flocked about him in his doorway , butted at him , leaped at him , and pelted him .
Parsing [sent. 18040 len. 29]: Hence , when he came out of his invalid retirement and shook off that ragged train , he was much bespattered , and in worse case than ever .
Parsing [sent. 18041 len. 61]: But , not yet at his worst ; for , going into a public-house , and being supplied in stress of business with his rum , and seeking to vanish without payment , he was collared , searched , found penniless , and admonished not to try that again , by having a pail of dirty water cast over him .
Parsing [sent. 18042 len. 35]: This application superinduced another fit of the trembles ; after which Mr Dolls , as finding himself in good cue for making a call on a professional friend , addressed himself to the Temple .
Parsing [sent. 18043 len. 10]: There was nobody at the chambers but Young Blight .
Parsing [sent. 18044 len. 42]: That discreet youth , sensible of a certain incongruity in the association of such a client with the business that might be coming some day , with the best intentions temporized with Dolls , and offered a shilling for coach-hire home .
Parsing [sent. 18045 len. 27]: Mr Dolls , accepting the shilling , promptly laid it out in two threepennyworths of conspiracy against his life , and two threepennyworths of raging repentance .
Parsing [sent. 18046 len. 47]: Returning to the Chambers with which burden , he was descried coming round into the court , by the wary young Blight watching from the window : who instantly closed the outer door , and left the miserable object to expend his fury on the panels .
Parsing [sent. 18047 len. 20]: The more the door resisted him , the more dangerous and imminent became that bloody conspiracy against his life .
Parsing [sent. 18048 len. 26]: Force of police arriving , he recognized in them the conspirators , and laid about him hoarsely , fiercely , staringly , convulsively , foamingly .
Parsing [sent. 18049 len. 52]: A humble machine , familiar to the conspirators and called by the expressive name of Stretcher , being unavoidably sent for , he was rendered a harmless bundle of torn rags by being strapped down upon it , with voice and consciousness gone out of him , and life fast going .
Parsing [sent. 18050 len. 30]: As this machine was borne out at the Temple gate by four men , the poor little dolls ' dressmaker and her Jewish friend were coming up the street .
Parsing [sent. 18051 len. 13]: ` Let us see what it is , ' cried the dressmaker .
Parsing [sent. 18052 len. 11]: ` Let us make haste and look , godmother . '
Parsing [sent. 18053 len. 10]: The brisk little crutch-stick was but too brisk . '
Parsing [sent. 18054 len. 11]: O gentlemen , gentlemen , he belongs to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18055 len. 6]: ` Belongs to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18056 len. 11]: said the head of the party , stopping it . '
Parsing [sent. 18057 len. 15]: O yes , dear gentlemen , he 's my child , out without leave .
Parsing [sent. 18058 len. 7]: My poor bad , bad boy !
Parsing [sent. 18059 len. 13]: and he do n't know me , he do n't know me !
Parsing [sent. 18060 len. 29]: O what shall I do , ' cried the little creature , wildly beating her hands together , ` when my own child do n't know me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18061 len. 19]: The head of the party looked -LRB- as well he might -RRB- to the old man for explanation .
Parsing [sent. 18062 len. 33]: He whispered , as the dolls ' dressmaker bent over the exhausted form and vainly tried to extract some sign of recognition from it : ` It 's her drunken father . '
Parsing [sent. 18063 len. 29]: As the load was put down in the street , Riah drew the head of the party aside , and whispered that he thought the man was dying .
Parsing [sent. 18064 len. 7]: ` No , surely not ? '
Parsing [sent. 18065 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 18066 len. 25]: But he became less confident , on looking , and directed the bearers to ` bring him to the nearest doctor 's shop . '
Parsing [sent. 18067 len. 41]: Thither he was brought ; the window becoming from within , a wall of faces , deformed into all kinds of shapes through the agency of globular red bottles , green bottles , blue bottles , and other coloured bottles .
Parsing [sent. 18068 len. 55]: A ghastly light shining upon him that he did n't need , the beast so furious but a few minutes gone , was quiet enough now , with a strange mysterious writing on his face , reflected from one of the great bottles , as if Death had marked him : ` Mine . '
Parsing [sent. 18069 len. 21]: The medical testimony was more precise and more to the purpose than it sometimes is in a Court of Justice .
Parsing [sent. 18070 len. 11]: ` You had better send for something to cover it .
Parsing [sent. 18071 len. 5]: All 's over . '
Parsing [sent. 18072 len. 26]: Therefore , the police sent for something to cover it , and it was covered and borne through the streets , the people falling away .
Parsing [sent. 18073 len. 34]: After it , went the dolls ' dressmaker , hiding her face in the Jewish skirts , and clinging to them with one hand , while with the other she plied her stick .
Parsing [sent. 18074 len. 61]: It was carried home , and , by reason that the staircase was very narrow , it was put down in the parlour -- the little working-bench being set aside to make room for it -- and there , in the midst of the dolls with no speculation in their eyes , lay Mr Dolls with no speculation in his .
Parsing [sent. 18075 len. 25]: Many flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed , before the money was in the dressmaker 's pocket to get mourning for Mr Dolls .
Parsing [sent. 18076 len. 40]: As the old man , Riah , sat by , helping her in such small ways as he could , he found it difficult to make out whether she really did realize that the deceased had been her father .
Parsing [sent. 18077 len. 24]: ` If my poor boy , ' she would say , ` had been brought up better , he might have done better .
Parsing [sent. 18078 len. 6]: Not that I reproach myself .
Parsing [sent. 18079 len. 10]: I hope I have no cause for that . '
Parsing [sent. 18080 len. 12]: ` None indeed , Jenny , I am very certain . '
Parsing [sent. 18081 len. 6]: ` Thank you , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 18082 len. 9]: It cheers me to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 18083 len. 25]: But you see it is so hard to bring up a child well , when you work , work , work , all day .
Parsing [sent. 18084 len. 16]: When he was out of employment , I could n't always keep him near me .
Parsing [sent. 18085 len. 18]: He got fractious and nervous , and I was obliged to let him go into the streets .
Parsing [sent. 18086 len. 17]: And he never did well in the streets , he never did well out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 18087 len. 8]: How often it happens with children ! '
Parsing [sent. 18088 len. 11]: ` Too often , even in this sad sense ! '
Parsing [sent. 18089 len. 5]: thought the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18090 len. 33]: ` How can I say what I might have turned out myself , but for my back having been so bad and my legs so queer , when I was young ! '
Parsing [sent. 18091 len. 7]: the dressmaker would go on . '
Parsing [sent. 18092 len. 13]: I had nothing to do but work , and so I worked .
Parsing [sent. 18093 len. 5]: I could n't play .
Parsing [sent. 18094 len. 18]: But my poor unfortunate child could play , and it turned out the worse for him . '
Parsing [sent. 18095 len. 10]: ` And not for him alone , Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 18096 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 18097 len. 7]: I do n't know , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 18098 len. 9]: He suffered heavily , did my unfortunate boy .
Parsing [sent. 18099 len. 8]: He was very , very ill sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 18100 len. 22]: And I called him a quantity of names ; ' shaking her head over her work , and dropping tears . '
Parsing [sent. 18101 len. 15]: I do n't know that his going wrong was much the worse for me .
Parsing [sent. 18102 len. 11]: If it ever was , let us forget it . '
Parsing [sent. 18103 len. 14]: ` You are a good girl , you are a patient girl . '
Parsing [sent. 18104 len. 21]: ` As for patience , ' she would reply with a shrug , ` not much of that , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 18105 len. 14]: If I had been patient , I should never have called him names .
Parsing [sent. 18106 len. 10]: But I hope I did it for his good .
Parsing [sent. 18107 len. 14]: And besides , I felt my responsibility as a mother , so much .
Parsing [sent. 18108 len. 8]: I tried reasoning , and reasoning failed .
Parsing [sent. 18109 len. 8]: I tried coaxing , and coaxing failed .
Parsing [sent. 18110 len. 7]: I tried scolding and scolding failed .
Parsing [sent. 18111 len. 19]: But I was bound to try everything , you know , with such a charge upon my hands .
Parsing [sent. 18112 len. 20]: Where would have been my duty to my poor lost boy , if I had not tried everything ! '
Parsing [sent. 18113 len. 64]: With such talk , mostly in a cheerful tone on the part of the industrious little creature , the day-work and the night-work were beguiled until enough of smart dolls had gone forth to bring into the kitchen , where the working-bench now stood , the sombre stuff that the occasion required , and to bring into the house the other sombre preparations .
Parsing [sent. 18114 len. 27]: ` And now , ' said Miss Jenny , ` having knocked off my rosy-cheeked young friends , I 'll knock off my white-cheeked self . '
Parsing [sent. 18115 len. 15]: This referred to her making her own dress , which at last was done .
Parsing [sent. 18116 len. 58]: ` The disadvantage of making for yourself , ' said Miss Jenny , as she stood upon a chair to look at the result in the glass , ` is , that you ca n't charge anybody else for the job , and the advantage is , that you have n't to go out to try on .
Parsing [sent. 18117 len. 2]: Humph !
Parsing [sent. 18118 len. 4]: Very fair indeed !
Parsing [sent. 18119 len. 22]: If He could see me now -LRB- whoever he is -RRB- I hope he would n't repent of his bargain ! '
Parsing [sent. 18120 len. 44]: The simple arrangements were of her own making , and were stated to Riah thus : ' I mean to go alone , godmother , in my usual carriage , and you 'll be so kind as keep house while I am gone .
Parsing [sent. 18121 len. 6]: It 's not far off .
Parsing [sent. 18122 len. 20]: And when I return , we 'll have a cup of tea , and a chat over future arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 18123 len. 65]: It 's a very plain last house that I have been able to give my poor unfortunate boy ; but he 'll accept the will for the deed if he knows anything about it ; and if he does n't know anything about it , ' with a sob , and wiping her eyes , ` why , it wo n't matter to him .
Parsing [sent. 18124 len. 26]: I see the service in the Prayer-book says , that we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can take nothing out .
Parsing [sent. 18125 len. 56]: It comforts me for not being able to hire a lot of stupid undertaker 's things for my poor child , and seeming as if I was trying to smuggle 'em out of this world with him , when of course I must break down in the attempt , and bring 'em all back again .
Parsing [sent. 18126 len. 32]: As it is , there 'll be nothing to bring back but me , and that 's quite consistent , for I sha n't be brought back , some day ! '
Parsing [sent. 18127 len. 20]: After that previous carrying of him in the streets , the wretched old fellow seemed to he twice buried .
Parsing [sent. 18128 len. 65]: He was taken on the shoulders of half a dozen blossom-faced men , who shuffled with him to the churchyard , and who were preceded by another blossom-faced man , affecting a stately stalk , as if he were a Policeman of the D -LRB- eath -RRB- Division , and ceremoniously pretending not to know his intimate acquaintances , as he led the pageant .
Parsing [sent. 18129 len. 25]: Yet , the spectacle of only one little mourner hobbling after , caused many people to turn their heads with a look of interest .
Parsing [sent. 18130 len. 44]: At last the troublesome deceased was got into the ground , to be buried no more , and the stately stalker stalked back before the solitary dressmaker , as if she were bound in honour to have no notion of the way home .
Parsing [sent. 18131 len. 15]: Those Furies , the conventionalities , being thus appeased , he left her . '
Parsing [sent. 18132 len. 26]: I must have a very short cry , godmother , before I cheer up for good , ' said the little creature , coming in .
Parsing [sent. 18133 len. 14]: ` Because after all a child is a child , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 18134 len. 11]: It was a longer cry than might have been expected .
Parsing [sent. 18135 len. 28]: Howbeit , it wore itself out in a shadowy corner , and then the dressmaker came forth , and washed her face , and made the tea .
Parsing [sent. 18136 len. 19]: ` You would n't mind my cutting out something while we are at tea , would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18137 len. 11]: she asked her Jewish friend , with a coaxing air .
Parsing [sent. 18138 len. 19]: ` Cinderella , dear child , ' the old man expostulated , ` will you never rest ? '
Parsing [sent. 18139 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 18140 len. 28]: It 's not work , cutting out a pattern is n't , ' said Miss Jenny , with her busy little scissors already snipping at some paper .
Parsing [sent. 18141 len. 22]: ` The truth is , godmother , I want to fix it while I have it correct in my mind . '
Parsing [sent. 18142 len. 9]: ` Have you seen it to-day then ? '
Parsing [sent. 18143 len. 3]: asked Riah .
Parsing [sent. 18144 len. 5]: ` Yes , godmother .
Parsing [sent. 18145 len. 5]: Saw it just now .
Parsing [sent. 18146 len. 11]: It 's a surplice , that 's what it is .
Parsing [sent. 18147 len. 21]: Thing our clergymen wear , you know , ' explained Miss Jenny , in consideration of his professing another faith .
Parsing [sent. 18148 len. 13]: ` And what have you to do with that , Jenny ? '
Parsing [sent. 18149 len. 34]: ` Why , godmother , ' replied the dressmaker , ` you must know that we Professors who live upon our taste and invention , are obliged to keep our eyes always open .
Parsing [sent. 18150 len. 15]: And you know already that I have many extra expenses to meet just now .
Parsing [sent. 18151 len. 31]: So , it came into my head while I was weeping at my poor boy 's grave , that something in my way might be done with a clergyman . '
Parsing [sent. 18152 len. 7]: ` What can be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 18153 len. 5]: asked the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18154 len. 9]: ` Not a funeral , never fear ! '
Parsing [sent. 18155 len. 11]: returned Miss Jenny , anticipating his objection with a nod .
Parsing [sent. 18156 len. 16]: ` The public do n't like to be made melancholy , I know very well .
Parsing [sent. 18157 len. 29]: I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into mourning ; not into real mourning , that is ; Court mourning they are rather proud of .
Parsing [sent. 18158 len. 39]: But a doll clergyman , my dear , -- glossy black curls and whiskers -- uniting two of my young friends in matrimony , ' said Miss Jenny , shaking her forefinger , ` is quite another affair .
Parsing [sent. 18159 len. 25]: If you do n't see those three at the altar in Bond Street , in a jiffy , my name 's Jack Robinson ! '
Parsing [sent. 18160 len. 46]: With her expert little ways in sharp action , she had got a doll into whitey-brown paper orders , before the meal was over , and was displaying it for the edification of the Jewish mind , when a knock was heard at the street-door .
Parsing [sent. 18161 len. 30]: Riah went to open it , and presently came back , ushering in , with the grave and courteous air that sat so well upon him , a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 18162 len. 37]: The gentleman was a stranger to the dressmaker ; but even in the moment of his casting his eyes upon her , there was something in his manner which brought to her remembrance Mr Eugene Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 18163 len. 9]: ` Pardon me , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 18164 len. 10]: ` You are the dolls ' dressmaker ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18165 len. 10]: I am the dolls ' dressmaker , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18166 len. 7]: ` Lizzie Hexam 's friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 18167 len. 15]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Miss Jenny , instantly on the defensive .
Parsing [sent. 18168 len. 8]: ` And Lizzie Hexam 's friend . '
Parsing [sent. 18169 len. 23]: ` Here is a note from her , entreating you to accede to the request of Mr Mortimer Lightwood , the bearer .
Parsing [sent. 18170 len. 19]: Mr Riah chances to know that I am Mr Mortimer Lightwood , and will tell you so . '
Parsing [sent. 18171 len. 7]: Riah bent his head in corroboration .
Parsing [sent. 18172 len. 8]: ` Will you read the note ? '
Parsing [sent. 18173 len. 22]: ` It 's very short , ' said Jenny , with a look of wonder , when she had read it .
Parsing [sent. 18174 len. 10]: ` There was no time to make it longer .
Parsing [sent. 18175 len. 6]: Time was so very precious .
Parsing [sent. 18176 len. 10]: My dear friend Mr Eugene Wrayburn is dying . '
Parsing [sent. 18177 len. 13]: The dressmaker clasped her hands , and uttered a little piteous cry .
Parsing [sent. 18178 len. 18]: ` Is dying , ' repeated Lightwood , with emotion , ` at some distance from here .
Parsing [sent. 18179 len. 19]: He is sinking under injuries received at the hands of a villain who attacked him in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 18180 len. 7]: I come straight from his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 18181 len. 6]: He is almost always insensible .
Parsing [sent. 18182 len. 28]: In a short restless interval of sensibility , or partial sensibility , I made out that he asked for you to be brought to sit by him .
Parsing [sent. 18183 len. 20]: Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct sounds he made , I caused Lizzie to hear them .
Parsing [sent. 18184 len. 11]: We were both sure that he asked for you . '
Parsing [sent. 18185 len. 22]: The dressmaker , with her hands still clasped , looked affrightedly from the one to the other of her two companions .
Parsing [sent. 18186 len. 33]: ` If you delay , he may die with his request ungratified , with his last wish -- intrusted to me -- we have long been much more than brothers -- unfulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 18187 len. 12]: I shall break down , if I try to say more .
Parsing [sent. 18188 len. 47]: In a few moments the black bonnet and the crutch-stick were on duty , the good Jew was left in possession of the house , and the dolls ' dressmaker , side by side in a chaise with Mortimer Lightwood , was posting out of town .
Parsing [sent. 18189 len. 56]: Chapter 10 THE DOLLS ' DRESSMAKER DISCOVERS A WORD A darkened and hushed room ; the river outside the windows flowing on to the vast ocean ; a figure on the bed , swathed and bandaged and bound , lying helpless on its back , with its two useless arms in splints at its sides .
Parsing [sent. 18190 len. 29]: Only two days of usage so familiarized the little dressmaker with this scene , that it held the place occupied two days ago by the recollections of years .
Parsing [sent. 18191 len. 8]: He had scarcely moved since her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 18192 len. 9]: Sometimes his eyes were open , sometimes closed .
Parsing [sent. 18193 len. 37]: When they were open , there was no meaning in their unwinking stare at one spot straight before them , unless for a moment the brow knitted into a faint expression of anger , or surprise .
Parsing [sent. 18194 len. 30]: Then , Mortimer Lightwood would speak to him , and on occasions he would be so far roused as to make an attempt to pronounce his friend 's name .
Parsing [sent. 18195 len. 23]: But , in an instant consciousness was gone again , and no spirit of Eugene was in Eugene 's crushed outer form .
Parsing [sent. 18196 len. 24]: They provided Jenny with materials for plying her work , and she had a little table placed at the foot of his bed .
Parsing [sent. 18197 len. 22]: Sitting there , with her rich shower of hair falling over the chair-back , they hoped she might attract his notice .
Parsing [sent. 18198 len. 43]: With the same object , she would sing , just above her breath , when he opened his eyes , or she saw his brow knit into that faint expression , so evanescent that it was like a shape made in water .
Parsing [sent. 18199 len. 8]: But as yet he had not heeded .
Parsing [sent. 18200 len. 31]: The ` they ' here mentioned were the medical attendant ; Lizzie , who was there in all her intervals of rest ; and Lightwood , who never left him .
Parsing [sent. 18201 len. 13]: The two days became three , and the three days became four .
Parsing [sent. 18202 len. 13]: At length , quite unexpectedly , he said something in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 18203 len. 10]: ` What was it , my dear Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 18204 len. 12]: ` Will you , Mortimer -- ' ` Will I -- ?
Parsing [sent. 18205 len. 7]: -- ` Send for her ? '
Parsing [sent. 18206 len. 10]: ` My dear fellow , she is here . '
Parsing [sent. 18207 len. 16]: Quite unconscious of the long blank , he supposed that they were still speaking together .
Parsing [sent. 18208 len. 23]: The little dressmaker stood up at the foot of the bed , humming her song , and nodded to him brightly . '
Parsing [sent. 18209 len. 30]: I ca n't shake hands , Jenny , ' said Eugene , with something of his old look ; ` but I am very glad to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 18210 len. 26]: Mortimer repeated this to her , for it could only be made out by bending over him and closely watching his attempts to say it .
Parsing [sent. 18211 len. 19]: In a little while , he added : ` Ask her if she has seen the children . '
Parsing [sent. 18212 len. 26]: Mortimer could not understand this , neither could Jenny herself , until he added : ` Ask her if she has smelt the flowers . '
Parsing [sent. 18213 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 18214 len. 4]: I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 18215 len. 4]: cried Jenny . '
Parsing [sent. 18216 len. 6]: I understand him now ! '
Parsing [sent. 18217 len. 45]: Then , Lightwood yielded his place to her quick approach , and she said , bending over the bed , with that better look : ` You mean my long bright slanting rows of children , who used to bring me ease and rest ?
Parsing [sent. 18218 len. 17]: You mean the children who used to take me up , and make me light ? '
Parsing [sent. 18219 len. 8]: Eugene smiled , ` Yes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18220 len. 10]: I have not seen them since I saw you .
Parsing [sent. 18221 len. 16]: I never see them now , but I am hardly ever in pain now . '
Parsing [sent. 18222 len. 11]: ` It was a pretty fancy , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 18223 len. 23]: ` But I have heard my birds sing , ' cried the little creature , ` and I have smelt my flowers .
Parsing [sent. 18224 len. 6]: Yes , indeed I have !
Parsing [sent. 18225 len. 10]: And both were most beautiful and most Divine ! '
Parsing [sent. 18226 len. 15]: ` Stay and help to nurse me , ' said Eugene , quietly . '
Parsing [sent. 18227 len. 15]: I should like you to have the fancy here , before I die . '
Parsing [sent. 18228 len. 29]: She touched his lips with her hand , and shaded her eyes with that same hand as she went back to her work and her little low song .
Parsing [sent. 18229 len. 19]: He heard the song with evident pleasure , until she allowed it gradually to sink away into silence .
Parsing [sent. 18230 len. 4]: ` Mortimer . '
Parsing [sent. 18231 len. 6]: ` My dear Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 18232 len. 26]: ` If you can give me anything to keep me here for only a few minutes -- ' To keep you here , Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 18233 len. 40]: ` To prevent my wandering away I do n't know where -- for I begin to be sensible that I have just come back , and that I shall lose myself again -- do so , dear boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 18234 len. 53]: Mortimer gave him such stimulants as could be given him with safety -LRB- they were always at hand , ready -RRB- , and bending over him once more , was about to caution him , when he said : ` Do n't tell me not to speak , for I must speak .
Parsing [sent. 18235 len. 27]: If you knew the harassing anxiety that gnaws and wears me when I am wandering in those places -- where are those endless places , Mortimer ?
Parsing [sent. 18236 len. 9]: They must be at an immense distance ! '
Parsing [sent. 18237 len. 32]: He saw in his friend 's face that he was losing himself ; for he added after a moment : ` Do n't be afraid -- I am not gone yet .
Parsing [sent. 18238 len. 5]: What was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18239 len. 10]: ` You wanted to tell me something , Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 18240 len. 57]: My poor dear fellow , you wanted to say something to your old friend -- to the friend who has always loved you , admired you , imitated you , founded himself upon you , been nothing without you , and who , God knows , would be here in your place if he could ! '
Parsing [sent. 18241 len. 6]: ` Tut , tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 18242 len. 17]: said Eugene with a tender glance as the other put his hand before his face . '
Parsing [sent. 18243 len. 6]: I am not worth it .
Parsing [sent. 18244 len. 17]: I acknowledge that I like it , dear boy , but I am not worth it .
Parsing [sent. 18245 len. 31]: This attack , my dear Mortimer ; this murder -- ' His friend leaned over him with renewed attention , saying : ` You and I suspect some one . '
Parsing [sent. 18246 len. 5]: ` More than suspect .
Parsing [sent. 18247 len. 31]: But , Mortimer , while I lie here , and when I lie here no longer , I trust to you that the perpetrator is never brought to justice . '
Parsing [sent. 18248 len. 4]: ` Eugene ? '
Parsing [sent. 18249 len. 11]: ` Her innocent reputation would be ruined , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 18250 len. 8]: She would be punished , not he .
Parsing [sent. 18251 len. 17]: I have wronged her enough in fact ; I have wronged her still more in intention .
Parsing [sent. 18252 len. 13]: You recollect what pavement is said to be made of good intentions .
Parsing [sent. 18253 len. 8]: It is made of bad intentions too .
Parsing [sent. 18254 len. 13]: Mortimer , I am lying on it , and I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 18255 len. 10]: ` Be comforted , my dear Eugene . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18256 len. 9]: I will , when you have promised me .
Parsing [sent. 18257 len. 10]: Dear Mortimer , the man must never be pursued .
Parsing [sent. 18258 len. 15]: If he should be accused , you must keep him silent and save him .
Parsing [sent. 18259 len. 17]: Do n't think of avenging me ; think only of hushing the story and protecting her .
Parsing [sent. 18260 len. 12]: You can confuse the case , and turn aside the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 18261 len. 8]: Listen to what I say to you .
Parsing [sent. 18262 len. 9]: It was not the schoolmaster , Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 18263 len. 5]: Do you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 18264 len. 11]: Twice ; it was not the schoolmaster , Bradley Headstone .
Parsing [sent. 18265 len. 5]: Do you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 18266 len. 13]: Three times ; it was not the schoolmaster , Bradley Headstone . '
Parsing [sent. 18267 len. 5]: He stopped , exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 18268 len. 26]: His speech had been whispered , broken , and indistinct ; but by a great effort he had made it plain enough to be unmistakeable .
Parsing [sent. 18269 len. 9]: ` Dear fellow , I am wandering away .
Parsing [sent. 18270 len. 11]: Stay me for another moment , if you can . '
Parsing [sent. 18271 len. 16]: Lightwood lifted his head at the neck , and put a wine-glass to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 18272 len. 4]: He rallied . '
Parsing [sent. 18273 len. 19]: I do n't know how long ago it was done , whether weeks , days , or hours .
Parsing [sent. 18274 len. 3]: No matter .
Parsing [sent. 18275 len. 9]: There is inquiry on foot , and pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 18276 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 18277 len. 5]: Is there not ? '
Parsing [sent. 18278 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 18279 len. 7]: ` Check it ; divert it !
Parsing [sent. 18280 len. 9]: Do n't let her be brought in question .
Parsing [sent. 18281 len. 3]: Shield her .
Parsing [sent. 18282 len. 13]: The guilty man , brought to justice , would poison her name .
Parsing [sent. 18283 len. 7]: Let the guilty man go unpunished .
Parsing [sent. 18284 len. 7]: Lizzie and my reparation before all !
Parsing [sent. 18285 len. 4]: Promise me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18286 len. 6]: ` Eugene , I do .
Parsing [sent. 18287 len. 5]: I promise you ! '
Parsing [sent. 18288 len. 16]: In the act of turning his eyes gratefully towards his friend , he wandered away .
Parsing [sent. 18289 len. 14]: His eyes stood still , and settled into that former intent unmeaning stare .
Parsing [sent. 18290 len. 15]: Hours and hours , days and nights , he remained in this same condition .
Parsing [sent. 18291 len. 31]: There were times when he would calmly speak to his friend after a long period of unconsciousness , and would say he was better , and would ask for something .
Parsing [sent. 18292 len. 13]: Before it could he given him , he would be gone again .
Parsing [sent. 18293 len. 19]: The dolls ' dressmaker , all softened compassion now , watched him with an earnestness that never relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 18294 len. 39]: She would regularly change the ice , or the cooling spirit , on his head , and would keep her ear at the pillow betweenwhiles , listening for any faint words that fell from him in his wanderings .
Parsing [sent. 18295 len. 27]: It was amazing through how many hours at a time she would remain beside him , in a crouching attitude , attentive to his slightest moan .
Parsing [sent. 18296 len. 45]: As he could not move a hand , he could make no sign of distress ; but , through this close watching -LRB- if through no secret sympathy or power -RRB- the little creature attained an understanding of him that Lightwood did not possess .
Parsing [sent. 18297 len. 60]: Mortimer would often turn to her , as if she were an interpreter between this sentient world and the insensible man ; and she would change the dressing of a wound , or ease a ligature , or turn his face , or alter the pressure of the bedclothes on him , with an absolute certainty of doing right .
Parsing [sent. 18298 len. 35]: The natural lightness and delicacy of touch which had become very refined by practice in her miniature work , no doubt was involved in this ; but her perception was at least as fine .
Parsing [sent. 18299 len. 12]: The one word , Lizzie , he muttered millions of times .
Parsing [sent. 18300 len. 54]: In a certain phase of his distressful state , which was the worst to those who tended him , he would roll his head upon the pillow , incessantly repeating the name in a hurried and impatient manner , with the misery of a disturbed mind , and the monotony of a machine .
Parsing [sent. 18301 len. 31]: Equally , when he lay still and staring , he would repeat it for hours without cessation , but then , always in a tone of subdued warning and horror .
Parsing [sent. 18302 len. 45]: Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face would often stop this , and then they learned to expect that he would for some time remain still , with his eyes closed , and that he would be conscious on opening them .
Parsing [sent. 18303 len. 42]: But , the heavy disappointment of their hope -- revived by the welcome silence of the room -- was , that his spirit would glide away again and be lost , in the moment of their joy that it was there .
Parsing [sent. 18304 len. 21]: This frequent rising of a drowning man from the deep , to sink again , was dreadful to the beholders .
Parsing [sent. 18305 len. 15]: But , gradually the change stole upon him that it became dreadful to himself .
Parsing [sent. 18306 len. 42]: His desire to impart something that was on his mind , his unspeakable yearning to have speech with his friend and make a communication to him , so troubled him when he recovered consciousness , that its term was thereby shortened .
Parsing [sent. 18307 len. 27]: As the man rising from the deep would disappear the sooner for fighting with the water , so he in his desperate struggle went down again .
Parsing [sent. 18308 len. 32]: One afternoon when he had been lying still , and Lizzie , unrecognized , had just stolen out of the room to pursue her occupation , he uttered Lightwood 's name .
Parsing [sent. 18309 len. 10]: ` My dear Eugene , I am here . '
Parsing [sent. 18310 len. 11]: ` How long is this to last , Mortimer ? '
Parsing [sent. 18311 len. 5]: Lightwood shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 18312 len. 14]: ` Still , Eugene , you are no worse than you were . '
Parsing [sent. 18313 len. 9]: ` But I know there 's no hope .
Parsing [sent. 18314 len. 26]: Yet I pray it may last long enough for you to do me one last service , and for me to do one last action .
Parsing [sent. 18315 len. 9]: Keep me here a few moments , Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 18316 len. 5]: Try , try ! '
Parsing [sent. 18317 len. 34]: His friend gave him what aid he could , and encouraged him to believe that he was more composed , though even then his eyes were losing the expression they so rarely recovered .
Parsing [sent. 18318 len. 12]: ` Hold me here , dear fellow , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 18319 len. 5]: Stop my wandering away .
Parsing [sent. 18320 len. 5]: I am going ! '
Parsing [sent. 18321 len. 7]: ` Not yet , not yet .
Parsing [sent. 18322 len. 14]: Tell me , dear Eugene , what is it I shall do ? '
Parsing [sent. 18323 len. 10]: ` Keep me here for only a single minute .
Parsing [sent. 18324 len. 6]: I am going away again .
Parsing [sent. 18325 len. 6]: Do n't let me go .
Parsing [sent. 18326 len. 5]: Hear me speak first .
Parsing [sent. 18327 len. 7]: Stop me -- stop me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18328 len. 12]: ` My poor Eugene , try to be calm . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18329 len. 4]: I do try .
Parsing [sent. 18330 len. 5]: I try so hard .
Parsing [sent. 18331 len. 7]: If you only knew how hard !
Parsing [sent. 18332 len. 10]: Do n't let me wander till I have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 18333 len. 8]: Give me a little more wine . '
Parsing [sent. 18334 len. 3]: Lightwood complied .
Parsing [sent. 18335 len. 52]: Eugene , with a most pathetic struggle against the unconsciousness that was coming over him , and with a look of appeal that affected his friend profoundly , said : ` You can leave me with Jenny , while you speak to her and tell her what I beseech of her .
Parsing [sent. 18336 len. 12]: You can leave me with Jenny , while you are gone .
Parsing [sent. 18337 len. 9]: There 's not much for you to do .
Parsing [sent. 18338 len. 8]: You wo n't be long away . '
Parsing [sent. 18339 len. 7]: ` No , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 18340 len. 15]: But tell me what it is that I shall do , Eugene ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18341 len. 4]: I am going !
Parsing [sent. 18342 len. 7]: You ca n't hold me . '
Parsing [sent. 18343 len. 10]: ` Tell me in a word , Eugene ! '
Parsing [sent. 18344 len. 23]: His eyes were fixed again , and the only word that came from his lips was the word millions of times repeated .
Parsing [sent. 18345 len. 6]: Lizzie , Lizzie , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 18346 len. 35]: But , the watchful little dressmaker had been vigilant as ever in her watch , and she now came up and touched Lightwood 's arm as he looked down at his friend , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 18347 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 18348 len. 10]: she said , with her finger on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 18349 len. 6]: ` His eyes are closing .
Parsing [sent. 18350 len. 10]: He 'll be conscious when he next opens them .
Parsing [sent. 18351 len. 14]: Shall I give you a leading word to say to him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18352 len. 15]: O Jenny , if you could only give me the right word ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18353 len. 3]: I can .
Parsing [sent. 18354 len. 4]: Stoop down . '
Parsing [sent. 18355 len. 10]: He stooped , and she whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 18356 len. 13]: She whispered in his ear one short word of a single syllable .
Parsing [sent. 18357 len. 8]: Lightwood started , and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 18358 len. 17]: ` Try it , ' said the little creature , with an excited and exultant face .
Parsing [sent. 18359 len. 33]: She then bent over the unconscious man , and , for the first time , kissed him on the cheek , and kissed the poor maimed hand that was nearest to her .
Parsing [sent. 18360 len. 11]: Then , she withdrew to the foot of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 18361 len. 24]: Some two hours afterwards , Mortimer Lightwood saw his consciousness come back , and instantly , but very tranquilly , bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 18362 len. 7]: ` Do n't speak , Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 18363 len. 13]: Do no more than look at me , and listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 18364 len. 7]: You follow what I say . '
Parsing [sent. 18365 len. 8]: He moved his head in assent . '
Parsing [sent. 18366 len. 12]: I am going on from the point where we broke off .
Parsing [sent. 18367 len. 17]: Is the word we should soon have come to -- is it -- Wife ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18368 len. 8]: O God bless you , Mortimer ! '
Parsing [sent. 18369 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 18370 len. 5]: Do n't be agitated .
Parsing [sent. 18371 len. 4]: Do n't speak .
Parsing [sent. 18372 len. 6]: Hear me , dear Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 18373 len. 18]: Your mind will be more at peace , lying here , if you make Lizzie your wife .
Parsing [sent. 18374 len. 21]: You wish me to speak to her , and tell her so , and entreat her to be your wife .
Parsing [sent. 18375 len. 21]: You ask her to kneel at this bedside and be married to you , that your reparation may be complete .
Parsing [sent. 18376 len. 5]: Is that so ? '
Parsing [sent. 18377 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 18378 len. 4]: God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 18379 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 18380 len. 8]: ` It shall be done , Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 18381 len. 5]: Trust it to me .
Parsing [sent. 18382 len. 18]: I shall have to go away for some few hours , to give effect to your wishes .
Parsing [sent. 18383 len. 7]: You see this is unavoidable ? '
Parsing [sent. 18384 len. 9]: ` Dear friend , I said so . '
Parsing [sent. 18385 len. 3]: ` True .
Parsing [sent. 18386 len. 8]: But I had not the clue then .
Parsing [sent. 18387 len. 9]: How do you think I got it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18388 len. 32]: Glancing wistfully around , Eugene saw Miss Jenny at the foot of the bed , looking at him with her elbows on the bed , and her head upon her hands .
Parsing [sent. 18389 len. 19]: There was a trace of his whimsical air upon him , as he tried to smile at her .
Parsing [sent. 18390 len. 14]: ` Yes indeed , ' said Lightwood , ` the discovery was hers .
Parsing [sent. 18391 len. 40]: Observe my dear Eugene ; while I am away you will know that I have discharged my trust with Lizzie , by finding her here , in my present place at your bedside , to leave you no more .
Parsing [sent. 18392 len. 7]: A final word before I go .
Parsing [sent. 18393 len. 12]: This is the right course of a true man , Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 18394 len. 42]: And I solemnly believe , with all my soul , that if Providence should mercifully restore you to us , you will be blessed with a noble wife in the preserver of your life , whom you will dearly love . '
Parsing [sent. 18395 len. 3]: ` Amen .
Parsing [sent. 18396 len. 6]: I am sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 18397 len. 11]: But I shall not come through it , Mortimer . '
Parsing [sent. 18398 len. 18]: ` You will not be the less hopeful or less strong , for this , Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 18399 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 18400 len. 18]: Touch my face with yours , in case I should not hold out till you come back .
Parsing [sent. 18401 len. 6]: I love you , Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 18402 len. 11]: Do n't be uneasy for me while you are gone .
Parsing [sent. 18403 len. 26]: If my dear brave girl will take me , I feel persuaded that I shall live long enough to be married , dear fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 18404 len. 37]: Miss Jenny gave up altogether on this parting taking place between the friends , and sitting with her back towards the bed in the bower made by her bright hair , wept heartily , though noiselessly .
Parsing [sent. 18405 len. 6]: Mortimer Lightwood was soon gone .
Parsing [sent. 18406 len. 27]: As the evening light lengthened the heavy reflections of the trees in the river , another figure came with a soft step into the sick room .
Parsing [sent. 18407 len. 6]: ` Is he conscious ? '
Parsing [sent. 18408 len. 15]: asked the little dressmaker , as the figure took its station by the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 18409 len. 31]: For , Jenny had given place to it immediately , and could not see the sufferer 's face , in the dark room , from her new and removed position .
Parsing [sent. 18410 len. 13]: ` He is conscious , Jenny , ' murmured Eugene for himself .
Parsing [sent. 18411 len. 7]: ` He knows his wife . '
Parsing [sent. 18412 len. 70]: Chapter 11 EFFECT IS GIVEN TO THE DOLLS ' DRESSMAKER 'S DISCOVERY Mrs John Rokesmith sat at needlework in her neat little room , beside a basket of neat little articles of clothing , which presented so much of the appearance of being in the dolls ' dressmaker 's way of business , that one might have supposed she was going to set up in opposition to Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 18413 len. 29]: Whether the Complete British Family Housewife had imparted sage counsel anent them , did not appear , but probably not , as that cloudy oracle was nowhere visible .
Parsing [sent. 18414 len. 26]: For certain , however , Mrs John Rokesmith stitched at them with so dexterous a hand , that she must have taken lessons of somebody .
Parsing [sent. 18415 len. 41]: Love is in all things a most wonderful teacher , and perhaps love -LRB- from a pictorial point of view , with nothing on but a thimble -RRB- , had been teaching this branch of needlework to Mrs John Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 18416 len. 36]: It was near John 's time for coming home , but as Mrs John was desirous to finish a special triumph of her skill before dinner , she did not go out to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 18417 len. 31]: Placidly , though rather consequentially smiling , she sat stitching away with a regular sound , like a sort of dimpled little charming Dresden-china clock by the very best maker .
Parsing [sent. 18418 len. 13]: A knock at the door , and a ring at the bell .
Parsing [sent. 18419 len. 13]: Not John ; or Bella would have flown out to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 18420 len. 7]: Then who , if not John ?
Parsing [sent. 18421 len. 25]: Bella was asking herself the question , when that fluttering little fool of a servant fluttered in , saying , ` Mr Lightwood ! '
Parsing [sent. 18422 len. 4]: Oh good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 18423 len. 19]: Bella had but time to throw a handkerchief over the basket , when Mr Lightwood made his bow .
Parsing [sent. 18424 len. 17]: There was something amiss with Mr Lightwood , for he was strangely grave and looked ill .
Parsing [sent. 18425 len. 35]: With a brief reference to the happy time when it had been his privilege to know Mrs Rokesmith as Miss Wilfer , Mr Lightwood explained what was amiss with him and why he came .
Parsing [sent. 18426 len. 17]: He came bearing Lizzie Hexam 's earnest hope that Mrs John Rokesmith would see her married .
Parsing [sent. 18427 len. 32]: Bella was so fluttered by the request , and by the short narrative he had feelingly given her , that there never was a more timely smelling-bottle than John 's knock .
Parsing [sent. 18428 len. 16]: ` My husband , ' said Bella ; ` I 'll bring him in . '
Parsing [sent. 18429 len. 38]: But , that turned out to be more easily said than done ; for , the instant she mentioned Mr Lightwood 's name , John stopped , with his hand upon the lock of the room door .
Parsing [sent. 18430 len. 9]: ` Come up stairs , my darling . '
Parsing [sent. 18431 len. 17]: Bella was amazed by the flush in his face , and by his sudden turning away .
Parsing [sent. 18432 len. 7]: ` What can it mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 18433 len. 10]: she thought , as she accompanied him up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 18434 len. 24]: ` Now , my life , ' said John , taking her on his knee , ` tell me all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 18435 len. 21]: All very well to say , ` Tell me all about it ; ' but John was very much confused .
Parsing [sent. 18436 len. 19]: His attention evidently trailed off , now and then , even while Bella told him all about it .
Parsing [sent. 18437 len. 15]: Yet she knew that he took a great interest in Lizzie and her fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 18438 len. 5]: What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 18439 len. 14]: ` You will come to this marriage with me , John dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 18440 len. 15]: ` N -- no , my love ; I ca n't do that . '
Parsing [sent. 18441 len. 10]: ` You ca n't do that , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 18442 len. 14]: ` No , my dear , it 's quite out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 18443 len. 7]: Not to be thought of . '
Parsing [sent. 18444 len. 10]: ` Am I to go alone , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 18445 len. 14]: ` No , my dear , you will go with Mr Lightwood . '
Parsing [sent. 18446 len. 19]: ` Do n't you think it 's time we went down to Mr Lightwood , John dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 18447 len. 3]: Bella insinuated .
Parsing [sent. 18448 len. 24]: ` My darling , it 's almost time you went , but I must ask you to excuse me to him altogether . '
Parsing [sent. 18449 len. 17]: ` You never mean , John dear , that you are not going to see him ?
Parsing [sent. 18450 len. 9]: Why , he knows you have come home .
Parsing [sent. 18451 len. 6]: I told him so . '
Parsing [sent. 18452 len. 14]: ` That 's a little unfortunate , but it ca n't be helped .
Parsing [sent. 18453 len. 15]: Unfortunate or fortunate , I positively can not see him , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 18454 len. 32]: Bella cast about in her mind what could be his reason for this unaccountable behaviour ; as she sat on his knee looking at him in astonishment and pouting a little .
Parsing [sent. 18455 len. 6]: A weak reason presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 18456 len. 14]: ` John dear , you never can be jealous of Mr Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 18457 len. 24]: ` Why , my precious child , ' returned her husband , laughing outright : ` how could I be jealous of him ?
Parsing [sent. 18458 len. 9]: Why should I be jealous of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 18459 len. 33]: ` Because , you know , John , ' pursued Bella , pouting a little more , ` though he did rather admire me once , it was not my fault . '
Parsing [sent. 18460 len. 34]: ` It was your fault that I admired you , ' returned her husband , with a look of pride in her , ` and why not your fault that he admired you ?
Parsing [sent. 18461 len. 8]: But , I jealous on that account ?
Parsing [sent. 18462 len. 28]: Why , I must go distracted for life , if I turned jealous of every one who used to find my wife beautiful and winning ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18463 len. 47]: I am half angry with you , John dear , ' said Bella , laughing a little , ` and half pleased with you ; because you are such a stupid old fellow , and yet you say nice things , as if you meant them .
Parsing [sent. 18464 len. 7]: Do n't be mysterious , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18465 len. 10]: What harm do you know of Mr Lightwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 18466 len. 7]: ` None , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 18467 len. 12]: ` What has he ever done to you , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 18468 len. 12]: ` He has never done anything to me , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 18469 len. 26]: I know no more against him than I know against Mr Wrayburn ; he has never done anything to me ; neither has Mr Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 18470 len. 14]: And yet I have exactly the same objection to both of them . '
Parsing [sent. 18471 len. 6]: ` Oh , John ! '
Parsing [sent. 18472 len. 23]: retorted Bella , as if she were giving him up for a bad job , as she used to give up herself .
Parsing [sent. 18473 len. 9]: ` You are nothing better than a sphinx !
Parsing [sent. 18474 len. 25]: And a married sphinx is n't a -- is n't a nice confidential husband , ' said Bella , in a tone of injury .
Parsing [sent. 18475 len. 35]: ` Bella , my life , ' said John Rokesmith , touching her cheek , with a grave smile , as she cast down her eyes and pouted again ; ` look at me .
Parsing [sent. 18476 len. 8]: I want to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 18477 len. 12]: ` In earnest , Blue Beard of the secret chamber ? '
Parsing [sent. 18478 len. 8]: asked Bella , clearing her pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 18479 len. 4]: ` In earnest .
Parsing [sent. 18480 len. 8]: And I confess to the secret chamber .
Parsing [sent. 18481 len. 25]: Do n't you remember that you asked me not to declare what I thought of your higher qualities until you had been tried ? '
Parsing [sent. 18482 len. 6]: ` Yes , John dear .
Parsing [sent. 18483 len. 13]: And I fully meant it , and I fully mean it . '
Parsing [sent. 18484 len. 26]: ` The time will come , my darling -- I am no prophet , but I say so , -- when you WILL be tried .
Parsing [sent. 18485 len. 35]: The time will come , I think , when you will undergo a trial through which you will never pass quite triumphantly for me , unless you can put perfect faith in me . '
Parsing [sent. 18486 len. 32]: ` Then you may be sure of me , John dear , for I can put perfect faith in you , and I do , and I always , always will .
Parsing [sent. 18487 len. 13]: Do n't judge me by a little thing like this , John .
Parsing [sent. 18488 len. 15]: In little things , I am a little thing myself -- I always was .
Parsing [sent. 18489 len. 25]: But in great things , I hope not ; I do n't mean to boast , John dear , but I hope not ! '
Parsing [sent. 18490 len. 25]: He was even better convinced of the truth of what she said than she was , as he felt her loving arms about him .
Parsing [sent. 18491 len. 35]: If the Golden Dustman 's riches had been his to stake , he would have staked them to the last farthing on the fidelity through good and evil of her affectionate and trusting heart .
Parsing [sent. 18492 len. 24]: ` Now , I 'll go down to , and go away with , Mr Lightwood , ' said Bella , springing up .
Parsing [sent. 18493 len. 47]: ` You are the most creasing and tumbling Clumsy-Boots of a packer , John , that ever was ; but if you 're quite good , and will promise never to do so any more -LRB- though I do n't know what you have done ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 18494 len. 19]: you may pack me a little bag for a night , while I get my bonnet on . '
Parsing [sent. 18495 len. 57]: He gaily complied , and she tied her dimpled chin up , and shook her head into her bonnet , and pulled out the bows of her bonnetstrings , and got her gloves on , finger by finger , and finally got them on her little plump hands , and bade him good-bye and went down .
Parsing [sent. 18496 len. 15]: Mr Lightwood 's impatience was much relieved when he found her dressed for departure .
Parsing [sent. 18497 len. 8]: ` Mr Rokesmith goes with us ? '
Parsing [sent. 18498 len. 12]: he said , hesitating , with a look towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 18499 len. 7]: ` Oh , I forgot ! '
Parsing [sent. 18500 len. 3]: replied Bella .
Parsing [sent. 18501 len. 5]: ` His best compliments .
Parsing [sent. 18502 len. 37]: His face is swollen to the size of two faces , and he is to go to bed directly , poor fellow , to wait for the doctor , who is coming to lance him . '
Parsing [sent. 18503 len. 30]: ` It is curious , ' observed Lightwood , ` that I have never yet seen Mr Rokesmith , though we have been engaged in the same affairs . '
Parsing [sent. 18504 len. 4]: ` Really ? '
Parsing [sent. 18505 len. 6]: said the unblushing Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 18506 len. 18]: I begin to think , ' observed Lightwood , ` that I never shall see him . '
Parsing [sent. 18507 len. 27]: ` These things happen so oddly sometimes , ' said Bella with a steady countenance , ` that there seems a kind of fatality in them .
Parsing [sent. 18508 len. 10]: But I am quite ready , Mr Lightwood . '
Parsing [sent. 18509 len. 66]: They started directly , in a little carriage that Lightwood had brought with him from never-to-be-forgotten Greenwich ; and from Greenwich they started directly for London ; and in London they waited at a railway station until such time as the Reverend Frank Milvey , and Margaretta his wife , with whom Mortimer Lightwood had been already in conference , should come and join them .
Parsing [sent. 18510 len. 65]: That worthy couple were delayed by a portentous old parishioner of the female gender , who was one of the plagues of their lives , and with whom they bore with most exemplary sweetness and goodhumour , notwithstanding her having an infection of absurdity about her , that communicated itself to everything with which , and everybody with whom , she came in contact .
Parsing [sent. 18511 len. 90]: She was a member of the Reverend Frank 's congregation , and made a point of distinguishing herself in that body , by conspicuously weeping at everything , however cheering , said by the Reverend Frank in his public ministration ; also by applying to herself the various lamentations of David , and complaining in a personally injured manner -LRB- much in arrear of the clerk and the rest of the respondents -RRB- that her enemies were digging pit-falls about her , and breaking her with rods of iron .
Parsing [sent. 18512 len. 34]: Indeed , this old widow discharged herself of that portion of the Morning and Evening Service as if she were lodging a complaint on oath and applying for a warrant before a magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 18513 len. 51]: But this was not her most inconvenient characteristic , for that took the form of an impression , usually recurring in inclement weather and at about daybreak , that she had something on her mind and stood in immediate need of the Reverend Frank to come and take it off .
Parsing [sent. 18514 len. 52]: Many a time had that kind creature got up , and gone out to Mrs Sprodgkin -LRB- such was the disciple 's name -RRB- , suppressing a strong sense of her comicality by his strong sense of duty , and perfectly knowing that nothing but a cold would come of it .
Parsing [sent. 18515 len. 41]: However , beyond themselves , the Reverend Frank Milvey and Mrs Milvey seldom hinted that Mrs Sprodgkin was hardly worth the trouble she gave ; but both made the best of her , as they did of all their troubles .
Parsing [sent. 18516 len. 39]: This very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a sixth sense , in regard of knowing when the Reverend Frank Milvey least desired her company , and with promptitude appearing in his little hall .
Parsing [sent. 18517 len. 53]: Consequently , when the Reverend Frank had willingly engaged that he and his wife would accompany Lightwood back , he said , as a matter of course : ` We must make haste to get out , Margaretta , my dear , or we shall be descended on by Mrs Sprodgkin . '
Parsing [sent. 18518 len. 31]: To which Mrs Milvey replied , in her pleasantly emphatic way , ` Oh YES , for she IS such a marplot , Frank , and DOES worry so ! '
Parsing [sent. 18519 len. 23]: Words that were scarcely uttered when their theme was announced as in faithful attendance below , desiring counsel on a spiritual matter .
Parsing [sent. 18520 len. 56]: The points on which Mrs Sprodkgin sought elucidation being seldom of a pressing nature -LRB- as Who begat Whom , or some information concerning the Amorites -RRB- , Mrs Milvey on this special occasion resorted to the device of buying her off with a present of tea and sugar , and a loaf and butter .
Parsing [sent. 18521 len. 27]: These gifts Mrs Sprodgkin accepted , but still insisted on dutifully remaining in the hall , to curtsey to the Reverend Frank as he came forth .
Parsing [sent. 18522 len. 19]: Who , incautiously saying in his genial manner , ` Well , Sally , there you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 18523 len. 40]: involved himself in a discursive address from Mrs Sprodgkin , revolving around the result that she regarded tea and sugar in the light of myrrh and frankincense , and considered bread and butter identical with locusts and wild honey .
Parsing [sent. 18524 len. 33]: Having communicated this edifying piece of information , Mrs Sprodgkin was left still unadjourned in the hall , and Mr and Mrs Milvey hurried in a heated condition to the railway station .
Parsing [sent. 18525 len. 56]: All of which is here recorded to the honour of that good Christian pair , representatives of hundreds of other good Christian pairs as conscientious and as useful , who merge the smallness of their work in its greatness , and feel in no danger of losing dignity when they adapt themselves to incomprehensible humbugs .
Parsing [sent. 18526 len. 31]: ` Detained at the last moment by one who had a claim upon me , ' was the Reverend Frank 's apology to Lightwood , taking no thought of himself .
Parsing [sent. 18527 len. 29]: To which Mrs Milvey added , taking thought for him , like the championing little wife she was ; ` Oh yes , detained at the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 18528 len. 30]: But AS to the claim , Frank , I MUST say that I DO think you are OVER-considerate sometimes , and allow THAT to be a LITTLE abused . '
Parsing [sent. 18529 len. 28]: Bella felt conscious , in spite of her late pledge for herself , that her husband 's absence would give disagreeable occasion for surprise to the Milveys .
Parsing [sent. 18530 len. 33]: Nor could she appear quite at her ease when Mrs Milvey asked : ` HOW is Mr Rokesmith , and IS he gone before us , or DOES he follow us ? '
Parsing [sent. 18531 len. 27]: It becoming necessary , upon this , to send him to bed again and hold him in waiting to be lanced again , Bella did it .
Parsing [sent. 18532 len. 40]: But not half as well on the second occasion as on the first ; for , a twice-told white one seems almost to become a black one , when you are not used to it ` Oh DEAR ! '
Parsing [sent. 18533 len. 10]: said Mrs Milvey , ' I am SO sorry !
Parsing [sent. 18534 len. 16]: Mr Rokesmith took SUCH an interest in Lizzie Hexam , when we were there before .
Parsing [sent. 18535 len. 31]: And if we had ONLY known of his face , we COULD have given him something that would have kept it down long enough for so SHORT a purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 18536 len. 20]: By way of making the white one whiter , Bella hastened to stipulate that he was not in pain .
Parsing [sent. 18537 len. 9]: Mrs Milvey was SO glad of it . '
Parsing [sent. 18538 len. 36]: I do n't know HOW it is , ' said Mrs Milvey , ` and I am SURE you do n't , Frank , but the clergy and their wives seem to CAUSE swelled faces .
Parsing [sent. 18539 len. 22]: Whenever I take notice of a child in the school , it seems to me as if its face swelled INSTANTLY .
Parsing [sent. 18540 len. 16]: Frank NEVER makes acquaintance with a new old woman , but she gets the faceache .
Parsing [sent. 18541 len. 14]: And another thing is , we DO make the poor children sniff so .
Parsing [sent. 18542 len. 32]: I do n't know HOW we do it , and I should be so glad not to ; but the MORE we take notice of them , the MORE they sniff .
Parsing [sent. 18543 len. 11]: Just as they do when the text is given out .
Parsing [sent. 18544 len. 8]: -- Frank , that 's a schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 18545 len. 7]: I have seen him somewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 18546 len. 26]: The reference was to a young man of reserved appearance , in a coat and waistcoat of black , and pantaloons of pepper and salt .
Parsing [sent. 18547 len. 44]: He had come into the office of the station , from its interior , in an unsettled way , immediately after Lightwood had gone out to the train ; and he had been hurriedly reading the printed hills and notices on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 18548 len. 21]: He had had a wandering interest in what was said among the people waiting there and passing to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 18549 len. 36]: He had drawn nearer , at about the time when Mrs Milvey mentioned Lizzie Hexam , and had remained near , since : though always glancing towards the door by which Lightwood had gone out .
Parsing [sent. 18550 len. 16]: He stood with his back towards them , and his gloved hands clasped behind him .
Parsing [sent. 18551 len. 34]: There was now so evident a faltering upon him , expressive of indecision whether or no he should express his having heard himself referred to , that Mr Milvey spoke to him . '
Parsing [sent. 18552 len. 24]: I can not recall your name , ' he said , ` but I remember to have seen you in your school . '
Parsing [sent. 18553 len. 21]: ` My name is Bradley Headstone , sir , ' he replied , backing into a more retired place . '
Parsing [sent. 18554 len. 18]: I ought to have remembered it , ' said Mr Milvey , giving him his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 18555 len. 6]: I hope you are well ?
Parsing [sent. 18556 len. 9]: A little overworked , I am afraid ? '
Parsing [sent. 18557 len. 13]: ` Yes , I am overworked just at present , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18558 len. 11]: ` Had no play in your last holiday time ? '
Parsing [sent. 18559 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18560 len. 38]: ` All work and no play , Mr Headstone , will not make dulness , in your case , I dare say ; but it will make dyspepsia , if you do n't take care . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18561 len. 9]: I will endeavour to take care , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18562 len. 15]: Might I beg leave to speak to you , outside , a moment ? '
Parsing [sent. 18563 len. 6]: ` By all means . '
Parsing [sent. 18564 len. 11]: It was evening , and the office was well lighted .
Parsing [sent. 18565 len. 68]: The schoolmaster , who had never remitted his watch on Lightwood 's door , now moved by another door to a corner without , where there was more shadow than light ; and said , plucking at his gloves : ` One of your ladies , sir , mentioned within my hearing a name that I am acquainted with ; I may say , well acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 18566 len. 12]: The name of the sister of an old pupil of mine .
Parsing [sent. 18567 len. 18]: He was my pupil for a long time , and has got on and gone upward rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 18568 len. 5]: The name of Hexam .
Parsing [sent. 18569 len. 7]: The name of Lizzie Hexam . '
Parsing [sent. 18570 len. 20]: He seemed to be a shy man , struggling against nervousness , and spoke in a very constrained way .
Parsing [sent. 18571 len. 16]: The break he set between his last two sentences was quite embarrassing to his hearer .
Parsing [sent. 18572 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' replied Mr Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 18573 len. 11]: ` We are going down to see her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18574 len. 7]: I gathered as much , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18575 len. 14]: I hope there is nothing amiss with the sister of my old pupil ?
Parsing [sent. 18576 len. 8]: I hope no bereavement has befallen her .
Parsing [sent. 18577 len. 8]: I hope she is in no affliction ?
Parsing [sent. 18578 len. 7]: Has lost no -- relation ? '
Parsing [sent. 18579 len. 28]: Mr Milvey thought this a man with a very odd manner , and a dark downward look ; but he answered in his usual open way . '
Parsing [sent. 18580 len. 24]: I am glad to tell you , Mr Headstone , that the sister of your old pupil has not sustained any such loss .
Parsing [sent. 18581 len. 13]: You thought I might be going down to bury some one ? '
Parsing [sent. 18582 len. 25]: ` That may have been the connexion of ideas , sir , with your clerical character , but I was not conscious of it .
Parsing [sent. 18583 len. 9]: -- Then you are not , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18584 len. 19]: A man with a very odd manner indeed , and with a lurking look that was quite oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 18585 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 18586 len. 38]: In fact , ' said Mr Milvey , ` since you are so interested in the sister of your old pupil , I may as well tell you that I am going down to marry her . '
Parsing [sent. 18587 len. 5]: The schoolmaster started back .
Parsing [sent. 18588 len. 25]: ` Not to marry her , myself , ' said Mr Milvey , with a smile , ` because I have a wife already .
Parsing [sent. 18589 len. 10]: To perform the marriage service at her wedding . '
Parsing [sent. 18590 len. 10]: Bradley Headstone caught hold of a pillar behind him .
Parsing [sent. 18591 len. 17]: If Mr Milvey knew an ashy face when he saw it , he saw it then .
Parsing [sent. 18592 len. 10]: ` You are quite ill , Mr Headstone ! '
Parsing [sent. 18593 len. 8]: ` It is not much , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18594 len. 7]: It will pass over very soon .
Parsing [sent. 18595 len. 9]: I am accustomed to be seized with giddiness .
Parsing [sent. 18596 len. 21]: Do n't let me detain you , sir ; I stand in need of no assistance , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 18597 len. 13]: Much obliged by your sparing me these minutes of your time . '
Parsing [sent. 18598 len. 55]: As Mr Milvey , who had no more minutes to spare , made a suitable reply and turned back into the office , he observed the schoolmaster to lean against the pillar with his hat in his hand , and to pull at his neckcloth as if he were trying to tear it off .
Parsing [sent. 18599 len. 45]: The Reverend Frank accordingly directed the notice of one of the attendants to him , by saying : ` There is a person outside who seems to be really ill , and to require some help , though he says he does not . '
Parsing [sent. 18600 len. 18]: Lightwood had by this time secured their places , and the departurebell was about to be rung .
Parsing [sent. 18601 len. 31]: They took their seats , and were beginning to move out of the station , when the same attendant came running along the platform , looking into all the carriages .
Parsing [sent. 18602 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 18603 len. 7]: You are here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18604 len. 21]: he said , springing on the step , and holding the window-frame by his elbow , as the carriage moved .
Parsing [sent. 18605 len. 15]: ` That person you pointed out to me is in a fit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18606 len. 15]: I infer from what he told me that he is subject to such attacks .
Parsing [sent. 18607 len. 15]: He will come to , in the air , in a little while . '
Parsing [sent. 18608 len. 23]: He was took very bad to be sure , and was biting and knocking about him -LRB- the man said -RRB- furiously .
Parsing [sent. 18609 len. 15]: Would the gentleman give him his card , as he had seen him first ?
Parsing [sent. 18610 len. 47]: The gentleman did so , with the explanation that he knew no more of the man attacked than that he was a man of a very respectable occupation , who had said he was out of health , as his appearance would of itself have indicated .
Parsing [sent. 18611 len. 21]: The attendant received the card , watched his opportunity for sliding down , slid down , and so it ended .
Parsing [sent. 18612 len. 70]: Then , the train rattled among the house-tops , and among the ragged sides of houses torn down to make way for it , and over the swarming streets , and under the fruitful earth , until it shot across the river : bursting over the quiet surface like a bomb-shell , and gone again as if it had exploded in the rush of smoke and steam and glare .
Parsing [sent. 18613 len. 40]: A little more , and again it roared across the river , a great rocket : spurning the watery turnings and doublings with ineffable contempt , and going straight to its end , as Father Time goes to his .
Parsing [sent. 18614 len. 63]: To whom it is no matter what living waters run high or low , reflect the heavenly lights and darknesses , produce their little growth of weeds and flowers , turn here , turn there , are noisy or still , are troubled or at rest , for their course has one sure termination , though their sources and devices are many .
Parsing [sent. 18615 len. 66]: Then , a carriage ride succeeded , near the solemn river , stealing away by night , as all things steal away , by night and by day , so quietly yielding to the attraction of the loadstone rock of Eternity ; and the nearer they drew to the chamber where Eugene lay , the more they feared that they might find his wanderings done .
Parsing [sent. 18616 len. 38]: At last they saw its dim light shining out , and it gave them hope : though Lightwood faltered as he thought : ` If he were gone , she would still be sitting by him . '
Parsing [sent. 18617 len. 13]: But he lay quiet , half in stupor , half in sleep .
Parsing [sent. 18618 len. 19]: Bella , entering with a raised admonitory finger , kissed Lizzie softly , but said not a word .
Parsing [sent. 18619 len. 21]: Neither did any of them speak , but all sat down at the foot of the bed , silently waiting .
Parsing [sent. 18620 len. 44]: And now , in this night-watch , mingling with the flow of the river and with the rush of the train , came the questions into Bella 's mind again : What could be in the depths of that mystery of John 's ?
Parsing [sent. 18621 len. 18]: Why was it that he had never been seen by Mr Lightwood , whom he still avoided ?
Parsing [sent. 18622 len. 30]: When would that trial come , through which her faith in , and her duty to , her dear husband , was to carry her , rendering him triumphant ?
Parsing [sent. 18623 len. 8]: For , that had been his term .
Parsing [sent. 18624 len. 19]: Her passing through the trial was to make the man she loved with all her heart , triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 18625 len. 12]: Term not to sink out of sight in Bella 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 18626 len. 11]: Far on in the night , Eugene opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 18627 len. 16]: He was sensible , and said at once : ` How does the time go ?
Parsing [sent. 18628 len. 7]: Has our Mortimer come back ? '
Parsing [sent. 18629 len. 10]: Lightwood was there immediately , to answer for himself .
Parsing [sent. 18630 len. 11]: ` Yes , Eugene , and all is ready . '
Parsing [sent. 18631 len. 5]: ` Dear boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 18632 len. 13]: returned Eugene with a smile , ` we both thank you heartily .
Parsing [sent. 18633 len. 20]: Lizzie , tell them how welcome they are , and that I would be eloquent if I could . '
Parsing [sent. 18634 len. 11]: ` There is no need , ' said Mr Milvey .
Parsing [sent. 18635 len. 5]: ` We know it .
Parsing [sent. 18636 len. 9]: Are you better , Mr Wrayburn ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18637 len. 9]: I am much happier , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 18638 len. 9]: ` Much better too , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 18639 len. 65]: Eugene turned his eyes towards Lizzie , as if to spare her , and answered nothing Then , they all stood around the bed , and Mr Milvey , opening his book , began the service ; so rarely associated with the shadow of death ; so inseparable in the mind from a flush of life and gaiety and hope and health and joy .
Parsing [sent. 18640 len. 14]: Bella thought how different from her own sunny little wedding , and wept .
Parsing [sent. 18641 len. 10]: Mrs Milvey overflowed with pity , and wept too .
Parsing [sent. 18642 len. 18]: The dolls ' dressmaker , with her hands before her face , wept in her golden bower .
Parsing [sent. 18643 len. 28]: Reading in a low clear voice , and bending over Eugene , who kept his eyes upon him , Mr Milvey did his office with suitable simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 18644 len. 25]: As the bridegroom could not move his hand , they touched his fingers with the ring , and so put it on the bride .
Parsing [sent. 18645 len. 18]: When the two plighted their troth , she laid her hand on his and kept it there .
Parsing [sent. 18646 len. 36]: When the ceremony was done , and all the rest departed from the room , she drew her arm under his head , and laid her own head down upon the pillow by his side .
Parsing [sent. 18647 len. 26]: ` Undraw the curtains , my dear girl , ' said Eugene , after a while , ` and let us see our wedding-day . '
Parsing [sent. 18648 len. 27]: The sun was rising , and his first rays struck into the room , as she came back , and put her lips to his . '
Parsing [sent. 18649 len. 6]: I bless the day ! '
Parsing [sent. 18650 len. 4]: said Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 18651 len. 6]: I bless the day ! '
Parsing [sent. 18652 len. 3]: said Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 18653 len. 19]: ` You have made a poor marriage of it , my sweet wife , ' said Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 18654 len. 26]: A shattered graceless fellow , stretched at his length here , and next to nothing for you when you are a young widow . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18655 len. 23]: I have made the marriage that I would have given all the world to dare to hope for , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 18656 len. 15]: ` You have thrown yourself away , ' said Eugene , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 18657 len. 11]: ` But you have followed the treasure of your heart .
Parsing [sent. 18658 len. 16]: My justification is , that you had thrown that away first , dear girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 18659 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 18660 len. 8]: I had given it to you . '
Parsing [sent. 18661 len. 10]: ` The same thing , my poor Lizzie ! '
Parsing [sent. 18662 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 18663 len. 2]: hush !
Parsing [sent. 18664 len. 6]: A very different thing . '
Parsing [sent. 18665 len. 15]: There were tears in his eyes , and she besought him to close them .
Parsing [sent. 18666 len. 25]: ` No , ' said Eugene , again shaking his head ; ` let me look at you , Lizzie , while I can .
Parsing [sent. 18667 len. 5]: You brave devoted girl !
Parsing [sent. 18668 len. 4]: You heroine ! '
Parsing [sent. 18669 len. 8]: Her own eyes filled under his praises .
Parsing [sent. 18670 len. 28]: And when he mustered strength to move his wounded head a very little way , and lay it on her bosom , the tears of both fell .
Parsing [sent. 18671 len. 44]: ` Lizzie , ' said Eugene , after a silence : ` when you see me wandering away from this refuge that I have so ill deserved , speak to me by my name , and I think I shall come back . '
Parsing [sent. 18672 len. 7]: ` Yes , dear Eugene . '
Parsing [sent. 18673 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 18674 len. 6]: he exclaimed , smiling . '
Parsing [sent. 18675 len. 11]: I should have gone then , but for that ! '
Parsing [sent. 18676 len. 31]: A little while afterwards , when he appeared to be sinking into insensibility , she said , in a calm loving voice : ` Eugene , my dear husband ! '
Parsing [sent. 18677 len. 8]: He immediately answered : ` There again !
Parsing [sent. 18678 len. 9]: You see how you can recall me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18679 len. 23]: And afterwards , when he could not speak , he still answered by a slight movement of his head upon her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 18680 len. 23]: The sun was high in the sky , when she gently disengaged herself to give him the stimulants and nourishment he required .
Parsing [sent. 18681 len. 27]: The utter helplessness of the wreck of him that lay cast ashore there , now alarmed her , but he himself appeared a little more hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 18682 len. 8]: ` Ah , my beloved Lizzie ! '
Parsing [sent. 18683 len. 5]: he said , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 18684 len. 16]: ` How shall I ever pay all I owe you , if I recover ! '
Parsing [sent. 18685 len. 23]: ` Do n't be ashamed of me , ' she replied , ` and you will have more than paid all . '
Parsing [sent. 18686 len. 19]: ` It would require a life , Lizzie , to pay all ; more than a life . '
Parsing [sent. 18687 len. 32]: ` Live for that , then ; live for me , Eugene ; live to see how hard I will try to improve myself , and never to discredit you . '
Parsing [sent. 18688 len. 23]: ` My darling girl , ' he replied , rallying more of his old manner than he had ever yet got together .
Parsing [sent. 18689 len. 24]: ` On the contrary , I have been thinking whether it is not the best thing I can do , to die . '
Parsing [sent. 18690 len. 18]: ` The best thing you can do , to leave me with a broken heart ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18691 len. 10]: I do n't mean that , my dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 18692 len. 7]: I was not thinking of that .
Parsing [sent. 18693 len. 8]: What I was thinking of was this .
Parsing [sent. 18694 len. 35]: Out of your compassion for me , in this maimed and broken state , you make so much of me -- you think so well of me -- you love me so dearly . '
Parsing [sent. 18695 len. 9]: ` Heaven knows I love you dearly ! '
Parsing [sent. 18696 len. 8]: ` And Heaven knows I prize it !
Parsing [sent. 18697 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 18698 len. 12]: If I live , you 'll find me out . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18699 len. 26]: I shall find out that my husband has a mine of purpose and energy , and will turn it to the best account ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18700 len. 19]: I hope so , dearest Lizzie , ' said Eugene , wistfully , and yet somewhat whimsically . '
Parsing [sent. 18701 len. 4]: I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 18702 len. 11]: But I ca n't summon the vanity to think so .
Parsing [sent. 18703 len. 17]: How can I think so , looking back on such a trifiling wasted youth as mine !
Parsing [sent. 18704 len. 12]: I humbly hope it ; but I dare n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 18705 len. 36]: There is a sharp misgiving in my conscience that if I were to live , I should disappoint your good opinion and my own -- and that I ought to die , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 18706 len. 46]: Chapter 12 THE PASSING SHADOW The winds and tides rose and fell a certain number of times , the earth moved round the sun a certain number of times , the ship upon the ocean made her voyage safely , and brought a baby-Bella home .
Parsing [sent. 18707 len. 18]: Then who so blest and happy as Mrs John Rokesmith , saving and excepting Mr John Rokesmith !
Parsing [sent. 18708 len. 14]: ` Would you not like to be rich NOW , my darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 18709 len. 13]: ` How can you ask me such a question , John dear ?
Parsing [sent. 18710 len. 6]: Am I not rich ? '
Parsing [sent. 18711 len. 16]: These were among the first words spoken near the baby Bella as she lay asleep .
Parsing [sent. 18712 len. 42]: She soon proved to be a baby of wonderful intelligence , evincing the strongest objection to her grandmother 's society , and being invariably seized with a painful acidity of the stomach when that dignified lady honoured her with any attention .
Parsing [sent. 18713 len. 33]: It was charming to see Bella contemplating this baby , and finding out her own dimples in that tiny reflection , as if she were looking in the glass without personal vanity .
Parsing [sent. 18714 len. 42]: Her cherubic father justly remarked to her husband that the baby seemed to make her younger than before , reminding him of the days when she had a pet doll and used to talk to it as she carried it about .
Parsing [sent. 18715 len. 110]: The world might have been challenged to produce another baby who had such a store of pleasant nonsense said and sung to it , as Bella said and sung to this baby ; or who was dressed and undressed as often in four-and-twenty hours as Bella dressed and undressed this baby ; or who was held behind doors and poked out to stop its father 's way when he came home , as this baby was ; or , in a word , who did half the number of baby things , through the lively invention of a gay and proud young mother , that this inexhaustible baby did .
Parsing [sent. 18716 len. 23]: The inexhaustible baby was two or three months old , when Bella began to notice a cloud upon her husband 's brow .
Parsing [sent. 18717 len. 18]: Watching it , she saw a gathering and deepening anxiety there , which caused her great disquiet .
Parsing [sent. 18718 len. 39]: More than once , she awoke him muttering in his sleep ; and , though he muttered nothing worse than her own name , it was plain to her that his restlessness originated in some load of care .
Parsing [sent. 18719 len. 21]: Therefore , Bella at length put in her claim to divide this load , and hear her half of it .
Parsing [sent. 18720 len. 31]: ` You know , John dear , ' she said , cheerily reverting to their former conversation , ` that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things .
Parsing [sent. 18721 len. 16]: And it surely can not be a little thing that causes you so much uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 18722 len. 33]: It 's very considerate of you to try to hide from me that you are uncomfortable about something , but it 's quite impossible to be done , John love . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18723 len. 12]: I admit that I am rather uneasy , my own . '
Parsing [sent. 18724 len. 12]: ` Then please to tell me what about , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18725 len. 7]: But no , he evaded that .
Parsing [sent. 18726 len. 5]: ` Never mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 18727 len. 5]: thought Bella , resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 18728 len. 19]: ` John requires me to put perfect faith in him , and he shall not be disappointed . '
Parsing [sent. 18729 len. 21]: She went up to London one day , to meet him , in order that they might make some purchases .
Parsing [sent. 18730 len. 21]: She found him waiting for her at her journey 's end , and they walked away together through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 18731 len. 65]: He was in gay spirits , though still harping on that notion of their being rich ; and he said , now let them make believe that yonder fine carriage was theirs , and that it was waiting to take them home to a fine house they had ; what would Bella , in that case , best like to find in the house ?
Parsing [sent. 18732 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 18733 len. 16]: Bella did n't know : already having everything she wanted , she could n't say .
Parsing [sent. 18734 len. 28]: But , by degrees she was led on to confess that she would like to have for the inexhaustible baby such a nursery as never was seen .
Parsing [sent. 18735 len. 73]: It was to be ' a very rainbow for colours ' , as she was quite sure baby noticed colours ; and the staircase was to be adorned with the most exquisite flowers , as she was absolutely certain baby noticed flowers ; and there was to be an aviary somewhere , of the loveliest little birds , as there was not the smallest doubt in the world that baby noticed birds .
Parsing [sent. 18736 len. 5]: Was there nothing else ?
Parsing [sent. 18737 len. 5]: No , John dear .
Parsing [sent. 18738 len. 17]: The predilections of the inexhaustible baby being provided for , Bella could think of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 18739 len. 25]: They were chatting on in this way , and John had suggested , ` No jewels for your own wear , for instance ? '
Parsing [sent. 18740 len. 6]: and Bella had replied laughing .
Parsing [sent. 18741 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 18742 len. 33]: if he came to that , yes , there might be a beautiful ivory case of jewels on her dressing-table ; when these pictures were in a moment darkened and blotted out .
Parsing [sent. 18743 len. 10]: They turned a corner , and met Mr Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 18744 len. 24]: He stopped as if he were petrified by the sight of Bella 's husband , who in the same moment had changed colour .
Parsing [sent. 18745 len. 13]: ` Mr Lightwood and I have met before , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 18746 len. 7]: ` Met before , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 18747 len. 8]: Bella repeated in a tone of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 18748 len. 13]: ` Mr Lightwood told me he had never seen you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18749 len. 18]: I did not then know that I had , ' said Lightwood , discomposed on her account .
Parsing [sent. 18750 len. 13]: I believed that I had only heard of -- Mr Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 18751 len. 7]: With an emphasis on the name .
Parsing [sent. 18752 len. 33]: ` When Mr Lightwood saw me , my love , ' observed her husband , not avoiding his eye , but looking at him , ` my name was Julius Handford . '
Parsing [sent. 18753 len. 3]: Julius Handford !
Parsing [sent. 18754 len. 23]: The name that Bella had so often seen in old newspapers , when she was an inmate of Mr Boffin 's house !
Parsing [sent. 18755 len. 24]: Julius Handford , who had been publicly entreated to appear , and for intelligence of whom a reward had been publicly offered ! '
Parsing [sent. 18756 len. 34]: I would have avoided mentioning it in your presence , ' said Lightwood to Bella , delicately ; ` but since your husband mentions it himself , I must confirm his strange admission .
Parsing [sent. 18757 len. 26]: I saw him as Mr Julius Handford , and I afterwards -LRB- unquestionably to his knowledge -RRB- took great pains to trace him out . '
Parsing [sent. 18758 len. 4]: ` Quite true .
Parsing [sent. 18759 len. 23]: But it was not my object or my interest , ' said Rokesmith , quietly , ` to be traced out . '
Parsing [sent. 18760 len. 12]: Bella looked from the one to the other , in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 18761 len. 80]: ` Mr Lightwood , ' pursued her husband , ` as chance has brought us face to face at last -- which is not to be wondered at , for the wonder is , that , in spite of all my pains to the contrary , chance has not confronted us together sooner -- I have only to remind you that you have been at my house , and to add that I have not changed my residence . '
Parsing [sent. 18762 len. 22]: ` Sir ' returned Lightwood , with a meaning glance towards Bella , ` my position is a truly painful one .
Parsing [sent. 18763 len. 35]: I hope that no complicity in a very dark transaction may attach to you , but you can not fail to know that your own extraordinary conduct has laid you under suspicion . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18764 len. 11]: I know it has , ' was all the reply .
Parsing [sent. 18765 len. 55]: ` My professional duty , ' said Lightwood hesitating , with another glance towards Bella , ` is greatly at variance with my personal inclination ; but I doubt , Mr Handford , or Mr Rokesmith , whether I am justified in taking leave of you here , with your whole course unexplained . '
Parsing [sent. 18766 len. 8]: Bella caught her husband by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 18767 len. 9]: ` Do n't be alarmed , my darling .
Parsing [sent. 18768 len. 16]: Mr Lightwood will find that he is quite justified in taking leave of me here .
Parsing [sent. 18769 len. 24]: At all events , ' added Rokesmith , ` he will find that I mean to take leave of him here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18770 len. 39]: I think , sir , ' said Lightwood , ` you can scarcely deny that when I came to your house on the occasion to which you have referred , you avoided me of a set purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 18771 len. 21]: ` Mr Lightwood , I assure you I have no disposition to deny it , or intention to deny it .
Parsing [sent. 18772 len. 29]: I should have continued to avoid you , in pursuance of the same set purpose , for a short time longer , if we had not met now .
Parsing [sent. 18773 len. 15]: I am going straight home , and shall remain at home to-morrow until noon .
Parsing [sent. 18774 len. 10]: Hereafter , I hope we may be better acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 18775 len. 3]: Good-day . '
Parsing [sent. 18776 len. 36]: Lightwood stood irresolute , but Bella 's husband passed him in the steadiest manner , with Bella on his arm ; and they went home without encountering any further remonstrance or molestation from any one .
Parsing [sent. 18777 len. 39]: When they had dined and were alone , John Rokesmith said to his wife , who had preserved her cheerfulness : ` And you do n't ask me , my dear , why I bore that name ? '
Parsing [sent. 18778 len. 6]: ` No , John love .
Parsing [sent. 18779 len. 33]: I should dearly like to know , of course ; ' -LRB- which her anxious face confirmed ;-RRB- ` but I wait until you can tell me of your own free will .
Parsing [sent. 18780 len. 23]: You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you , and I said yes , and I meant it . '
Parsing [sent. 18781 len. 14]: It did not escape Bella 's notice that he began to look triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 18782 len. 27]: She wanted no strengthening in her firmness ; but if she had had need of any , she would have derived it from his kindling face .
Parsing [sent. 18783 len. 28]: ` You can not have been prepared , my dearest , for such a discovery as that this mysterious Mr Handford was identical with your husband ? '
Parsing [sent. 18784 len. 10]: ` No , John dear , of course not .
Parsing [sent. 18785 len. 16]: But you told me to prepare to be tried , and I prepared myself . '
Parsing [sent. 18786 len. 25]: He drew her to nestle closer to him , and told her it would soon be over , and the truth would soon appear .
Parsing [sent. 18787 len. 26]: ` And now , ' he went on , ` lay stress , my dear , on these words that I am going to add .
Parsing [sent. 18788 len. 22]: I stand in no kind of peril , and I can by possibility be hurt at no one 's hand . '
Parsing [sent. 18789 len. 14]: ` You are quite , quite sure of that , John dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 18790 len. 8]: ` Not a hair of my head !
Parsing [sent. 18791 len. 14]: Moreover , I have done no wrong , and have injured no man .
Parsing [sent. 18792 len. 6]: Shall I swear it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18793 len. 6]: ` No , John ! '
Parsing [sent. 18794 len. 15]: cried Bella , laying her hand upon his lips , with a proud look .
Parsing [sent. 18795 len. 6]: ` Never to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18796 len. 35]: ` But circumstances , ' he went on ' -- I can , and I will , disperse them in a moment -- have surrounded me with one of the strangest suspicions ever known .
Parsing [sent. 18797 len. 11]: You heard Mr Lightwood speak of a dark transaction ? '
Parsing [sent. 18798 len. 6]: ` Yes , John . '
Parsing [sent. 18799 len. 12]: ` You are prepared to hear explicitly what he meant ? '
Parsing [sent. 18800 len. 6]: ` Yes , John . '
Parsing [sent. 18801 len. 17]: ` My life , he meant the murder of John Harmon , your allotted husband . '
Parsing [sent. 18802 len. 13]: With a fast palpitating heart , Bella grasped him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 18803 len. 10]: ` You can not be suspected , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 18804 len. 13]: ` Dear love , I can be -- for I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 18805 len. 26]: There was silence between them , as she sat looking in his face , with the colour quite gone from her own face and lips .
Parsing [sent. 18806 len. 6]: ` How dare they ! '
Parsing [sent. 18807 len. 12]: she cried at length , in a burst of generous indignation .
Parsing [sent. 18808 len. 10]: ` My beloved husband , how dare they ! '
Parsing [sent. 18809 len. 18]: He caught her in his arms as she opened hers , and held her to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 18810 len. 14]: ` Even knowing this , you can trust me , Bella ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18811 len. 13]: I can trust you , John dear , with all my soul .
Parsing [sent. 18812 len. 16]: If I could not trust you , I should fall dead at your feet . '
Parsing [sent. 18813 len. 34]: The kindling triumph in his face was bright indeed , as he looked up and rapturously exclaimed , what had he done to deserve the blessing of this dear confiding creature 's heart !
Parsing [sent. 18814 len. 15]: Again she put her hand upon his lips , saying , ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 18815 len. 87]: and then told him , in her own little natural pathetic way , that if all the world were against him , she would be for him ; that if all the world repudiated him , she would believe him ; that if he were infamous in other eyes , he would be honoured in hers ; and that , under the worst unmerited suspicion , she could devote her life to consoling him , and imparting her own faith in him to their little child .
Parsing [sent. 18816 len. 28]: A twilight calm of happiness then succeeding to their radiant noon , they remained at peace , until a strange voice in the room startled them both .
Parsing [sent. 18817 len. 39]: The room being by that time dark , the voice said , ` Do n't let the lady be alarmed by my striking a light , ' and immediately a match rattled , and glimmered in a hand .
Parsing [sent. 18818 len. 28]: The hand and the match and the voice were then seen by John Rokesmith to belong to Mr Inspector , once meditatively active in this chronicle . '
Parsing [sent. 18819 len. 43]: I take the liberty , ' said Mr Inspector , in a business-like manner , ` to bring myself to the recollection of Mr Julius Handford , who gave me his name and address down at our place a considerable time ago .
Parsing [sent. 18820 len. 24]: Would the lady object to my lighting the pair of candles on the chimneypiece , to throw a further light upon the subject ?
Parsing [sent. 18821 len. 2]: No ?
Parsing [sent. 18822 len. 5]: Thank you , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 18823 len. 7]: Now , we look cheerful . '
Parsing [sent. 18824 len. 39]: Mr Inspector , in a dark-blue buttoned-up frock coat and pantaloons , presented a serviceable , half-pay , Royal Arms kind of appearance , as he applied his pocket handkerchief to his nose and bowed to the lady .
Parsing [sent. 18825 len. 35]: ` You favoured me , Mr Handford , ' said Mr Inspector , ` by writing down your name and address , and I produce the piece of paper on which you wrote it .
Parsing [sent. 18826 len. 37]: Comparing the same with the writing on the fly-leaf of this book on the table -- and a sweet pretty volume it is -- I find the writing of the entry , ` Mrs John Rokesmith .
Parsing [sent. 18827 len. 22]: From her husband on her birthday '' -- and very gratifying to the feelings such memorials are -- to correspond exactly .
Parsing [sent. 18828 len. 9]: Can I have a word with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18829 len. 3]: ` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 18830 len. 11]: Here , if you please , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 18831 len. 85]: ` Why , ' retorted Mr Inspector , again using his pocket handkerchief , ` though there 's nothing for the lady to be at all alarmed at , still , ladies are apt to take alarm at matters of business -- being of that fragile sex that they 're not accustomed to them when not of a strictly domestic character -- and I do generally make it a rule to propose retirement from the presence of ladies , before entering upon business topics .
Parsing [sent. 18832 len. 26]: Or perhaps , ' Mr Inspector hinted , ` if the lady was to step up-stairs , and take a look at baby now ! '
Parsing [sent. 18833 len. 36]: ` Mrs Rokesmith , ' -- her husband was beginning ; when Mr Inspector , regarding the words as an introduction , said , ` Happy I am sure , to have the honour . '
Parsing [sent. 18834 len. 6]: And bowed , with gallantry .
Parsing [sent. 18835 len. 28]: ` Mrs Rokesmith , ' resumed her husband , ` is satisfied that she can have no reason for being alarmed , whatever the business is . '
Parsing [sent. 18836 len. 3]: ` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 18837 len. 5]: Is that so ? '
Parsing [sent. 18838 len. 4]: said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 18839 len. 31]: ` But it 's a sex to live and learn from , and there 's nothing a lady ca n't accomplish when she once fully gives her mind to it .
Parsing [sent. 18840 len. 9]: It 's the case with my own wife .
Parsing [sent. 18841 len. 33]: Well , ma'am , this good gentleman of yours has given rise to a rather large amount of trouble which might have been avoided if he had come forward and explained himself .
Parsing [sent. 18842 len. 4]: Well you see !
Parsing [sent. 18843 len. 9]: He DID N'T come forward and explain himself .
Parsing [sent. 18844 len. 58]: Consequently , now that we meet , him and me , you 'll say -- and say right -- that there 's nothing to be alarmed at , in my proposing to him TO come forward -- or , putting the same meaning in another form , to come along with me -- and explain himself . '
Parsing [sent. 18845 len. 36]: When Mr Inspector put it in that other form , ` to come along with me , ' there was a relishing roll in his voice , and his eye beamed with an official lustre .
Parsing [sent. 18846 len. 11]: ` Do you propose to take me into custody ? '
Parsing [sent. 18847 len. 7]: inquired John Rokesmith , very coolly .
Parsing [sent. 18848 len. 5]: ` Why argue ? '
Parsing [sent. 18849 len. 27]: returned Mr Inspector in a comfortable sort of remonstrance ; ` ai n't it enough that I propose that you shall come along with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 18850 len. 6]: ` For what reason ? '
Parsing [sent. 18851 len. 8]: Lord bless my soul and body ! '
Parsing [sent. 18852 len. 16]: returned Mr Inspector , ' I wonder at it in a man of your education .
Parsing [sent. 18853 len. 4]: Why argue ? '
Parsing [sent. 18854 len. 10]: ` What do you charge against me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18855 len. 37]: I wonder at you before a lady , ' said Mr Inspector , shaking his head reproachfully : ' I wonder , brought up as you have been , you have n't a more delicate mind !
Parsing [sent. 18856 len. 16]: I charge you , then , with being some way concerned in the Harmon Murder .
Parsing [sent. 18857 len. 16]: I do n't say whether before , or in , or after , the fact .
Parsing [sent. 18858 len. 18]: I do n't say whether with having some knowledge of it that has n't come out . '
Parsing [sent. 18859 len. 7]: ` You do n't surprise me .
Parsing [sent. 18860 len. 8]: I foresaw your visit this afternoon . '
Parsing [sent. 18861 len. 5]: ` Do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 18862 len. 4]: said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 18863 len. 6]: ` Why , why argue ?
Parsing [sent. 18864 len. 20]: It 's my duty to inform you that whatever you say , will be used against you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18865 len. 8]: I do n't think it will . '
Parsing [sent. 18866 len. 13]: ` But I tell you it will , ' said Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 18867 len. 21]: ` Now , having received the caution , do you still say that you foresaw my visit this afternoon ? '
Parsing [sent. 18868 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 18869 len. 19]: And I will say something more , if you will step with me into the next room . '
Parsing [sent. 18870 len. 36]: With a reassuring kiss on the lips of the frightened Bella , her husband -LRB- to whom Mr Inspector obligingly offered his arm -RRB- , took up a candle , and withdrew with that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 18871 len. 8]: They were a full half-hour in conference .
Parsing [sent. 18872 len. 11]: When they returned , Mr Inspector looked considerably astonished . '
Parsing [sent. 18873 len. 30]: I have invited this worthy officer , my dear , ' said John , ` to make a short excursion with me in which you shall be a sharer .
Parsing [sent. 18874 len. 26]: He will take something to eat and drink , I dare say , on your invitation , while you are getting your bonnet on . '
Parsing [sent. 18875 len. 18]: Mr Inspector declined eating , but assented to the proposal of a glass of brandy and water .
Parsing [sent. 18876 len. 57]: Mixing this cold , and pensively consuming it , he broke at intervals into such soliloquies as that he never did know such a move , that he never had been so gravelled , and that what a game was this to try the sort of stuff a man 's opinion of himself was made of !
Parsing [sent. 18877 len. 42]: Concurrently with these comments , he more than once burst out a laughing , with the halfenjoying and half-piqued air of a man , who had given up a good conundrum , after much guessing , and been told the answer .
Parsing [sent. 18878 len. 34]: Bella was so timid of him , that she noted these things in a halfshrinking , half-perceptive way , and similarly noted that there was a great change in his manner towards John .
Parsing [sent. 18879 len. 45]: That coming - alongwith-him deportment was now lost in long musing looks at John and at herself and sometimes in slow heavy rubs of his hand across his forehead , as if he were ironing cut the creases which his deep pondering made there .
Parsing [sent. 18880 len. 44]: He had had some coughing and whistling satellites secretly gravitating towards him about the premises , but they were now dismissed , and he eyed John as if he had meant to do him a public service , but had unfortunately been anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 18881 len. 48]: Whether Bella might have noted anything more , if she had been less afraid of him , she could not determine ; but it was all inexplicable to her , and not the faintest flash of the real state of the case broke in upon her mind .
Parsing [sent. 18882 len. 35]: Mr Inspector 's increased notice of herself and knowing way of raising his eyebrows when their eyes by any chance met , as if he put the question ` Do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 18883 len. 11]: augmented her timidity , and , consequently , her perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 18884 len. 103]: For all these reasons , when he and she and John , at towards nine o'clock of a winter evening went to London , and began driving from London Bridge , among low-lying water-side wharves and docks and strange places , Bella was in the state of a dreamer ; perfectly unable to account for her being there , perfectly unable to forecast what would happen next , or whither she was going , or why ; certain of nothing in the immediate present , but that she confided in John , and that John seemed somehow to be getting more triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 18885 len. 7]: But what a certainty was that !
Parsing [sent. 18886 len. 24]: They alighted at last at the corner of a court , where there was a building with a bright lamp and wicket gate .
Parsing [sent. 18887 len. 21]: Its orderly appearance was very unlike that of the surrounding neighbourhood , and was explained by the inscription POLICE STATION .
Parsing [sent. 18888 len. 11]: ` We are not going in here , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 18889 len. 7]: said Bella , clinging to him .
Parsing [sent. 18890 len. 12]: ` Yes , my dear ; but of our own accord .
Parsing [sent. 18891 len. 12]: We shall come out again as easily , never fear . '
Parsing [sent. 18892 len. 35]: The whitewashed room was pure white as of old , the methodical book-keeping was in peaceful progress as of old , and some distant howler was banging against a cell door as of old .
Parsing [sent. 18893 len. 16]: The sanctuary was not a permanent abiding-place , but a kind of criminal Pickford 's .
Parsing [sent. 18894 len. 32]: The lower passions and vices were regularly ticked off in the books , warehoused in the cells , carted away as per accompanying invoice , and left little mark upon it .
Parsing [sent. 18895 len. 57]: Mr Inspector placed two chairs for his visitors , before the fire , and communed in a low voice with a brother of his order -LRB- also of a half-pay , and Royal Arms aspect -RRB- , who , judged only by his occupation at the moment , might have been a writing-master , setting copies .
Parsing [sent. 18896 len. 32]: Their conference done , Mr Inspector returned to the fireplace , and , having observed that he would step round to the Fellowships and see how matters stood , went out .
Parsing [sent. 18897 len. 36]: He soon came back again , saying , ` Nothing could be better , for they 're at supper with Miss Abbey in the bar ; ' and then they all three went out together .
Parsing [sent. 18898 len. 33]: Still , as in a dream , Bella found herself entering a snug oldfashioned public-house , and found herself smuggled into a little three-cornered room nearly opposite the bar of that establishment .
Parsing [sent. 18899 len. 51]: Mr Inspector achieved the smuggling of herself and John into this queer room , called Cosy in an inscription on the door , by entering in the narrow passage first in order , and suddenly turning round upon them with extended arms , as if they had been two sheep .
Parsing [sent. 18900 len. 8]: The room was lighted for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 18901 len. 39]: ` Now , ' said Mr Inspector to John , turning the gas lower ; ` I 'll mix with 'em in a casual way , and when I say Identification , perhaps you 'll show yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 18902 len. 15]: John nodded , and Mr Inspector went alone to the half-door of the bar .
Parsing [sent. 18903 len. 40]: From the dim doorway of Cosy , within which Bella and her husband stood , they could see a comfortable little party of three persons sitting at supper in the bar , and could hear everything that was said .
Parsing [sent. 18904 len. 11]: The three persons were Miss Abbey and two male guests .
Parsing [sent. 18905 len. 19]: To whom collectively , Mr Inspector remarked that the weather was getting sharp for the time of year .
Parsing [sent. 18906 len. 17]: ` It need be sharp to suit your wits , sir , ' said Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 18907 len. 10]: ` What have you got in hand now ? '
Parsing [sent. 18908 len. 20]: ` Thanking you for your compliment : not much , Miss Abbey , ' was Mr Inspector 's rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 18909 len. 9]: ` Who have you got in Cosy ? '
Parsing [sent. 18910 len. 4]: asked Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 18911 len. 16]: ` Only a gentleman and his wife , Miss. ' ` And who are they ?
Parsing [sent. 18912 len. 20]: If one may ask it without detriment to your deep plans in the interests of the honest public ? '
Parsing [sent. 18913 len. 13]: said Miss Abbey , proud of Mr Inspector as an administrative genius .
Parsing [sent. 18914 len. 14]: ` They are strangers in this part of the town , Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 18915 len. 20]: They are waiting till I shall want the gentleman to show himself somewhere , for half a moment . '
Parsing [sent. 18916 len. 19]: ` While they 're waiting , ' said Miss Abbey , ` could n't you join us ? '
Parsing [sent. 18917 len. 33]: Mr Inspector immediately slipped into the bar , and sat down at the side of the half-door , with his back towards the passage , and directly facing the two guests . '
Parsing [sent. 18918 len. 29]: I do n't take my supper till later in the night , ' said he , ` and therefore I wo n't disturb the compactness of the table .
Parsing [sent. 18919 len. 21]: But I 'll take a glass of flip , if that 's flip in the jug in the fender . '
Parsing [sent. 18920 len. 35]: ` That 's flip , ' replied Miss Abbey , ` and it 's my making , and if even you can find out better , I shall be glad to know where . '
Parsing [sent. 18921 len. 42]: Filling him , with hospitable hands , a steaming tumbler , Miss Abbey replaced the jug by the fire ; the company not having yet arrived at the flip-stage of their supper , but being as yet skirmishing with strong ale .
Parsing [sent. 18922 len. 6]: ` Ah -- h ! '
Parsing [sent. 18923 len. 4]: cried Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 18924 len. 6]: ` That 's the smack !
Parsing [sent. 18925 len. 22]: There 's not a Detective in the Force , Miss Abbey , that could find out better stuff than that . '
Parsing [sent. 18926 len. 13]: ` Glad to hear you say so , ' rejoined Miss Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 18927 len. 11]: ` You ought to know , if anybody does . '
Parsing [sent. 18928 len. 16]: ` Mr Job Potterson , ' Mr Inspector continued , ' I drink your health .
Parsing [sent. 18929 len. 8]: Mr Jacob Kibble , I drink yours .
Parsing [sent. 18930 len. 13]: Hope you have made a prosperous voyage home , gentlemen both . '
Parsing [sent. 18931 len. 34]: Mr Kibble , an unctuous broad man of few words and many mouthfuls , said , more briefly than pointedly , raising his ale to his lips : ` Same to you . '
Parsing [sent. 18932 len. 20]: Mr Job Potterson , a semi-seafaring man of obliging demeanour , said , ` Thank you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18933 len. 9]: ` Lord bless my soul and body ! '
Parsing [sent. 18934 len. 4]: cried Mr Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 18935 len. 39]: ` Talk of trades , Miss Abbey , and the way they set their marks on men ' -LRB- a subject which nobody had approached -RRB- ; ` who would n't know your brother to be a Steward !
Parsing [sent. 18936 len. 48]: There 's a bright and ready twinkle in his eye , there 's a neatness in his action , there 's a smartness in his figure , there 's an air of reliability about him in case you wanted a basin , which points out the steward !
Parsing [sent. 18937 len. 12]: And Mr Kibble ; ai n't he Passenger , all over ?
Parsing [sent. 18938 len. 35]: While there 's that mercantile cut upon him which would make you happy to give him credit for five hundred pound , do n't you see the salt sea shining on him too ? '
Parsing [sent. 18939 len. 19]: ` YOU do , I dare say , ' returned Miss Abbey , ` but I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 18940 len. 28]: And as for stewarding , I think it 's time my brother gave that up , and took his House in hand on his sister 's retiring .
Parsing [sent. 18941 len. 11]: The House will go to pieces if he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 18942 len. 37]: I would n't sell it for any money that could be told out , to a person that I could n't depend upon to be a Law to the Porters , as I have been . '
Parsing [sent. 18943 len. 14]: ` There you 're right , Miss , ' said Mr Inspector . '
Parsing [sent. 18944 len. 11]: A better kept house is not known to our men .
Parsing [sent. 18945 len. 5]: What do I say ?
Parsing [sent. 18946 len. 13]: Half so well a kept house is not known to our men .
Parsing [sent. 18947 len. 29]: Show the Force the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters , and the Force -- to a constable -- will show you a piece of perfection , Mr Kibble . '
Parsing [sent. 18948 len. 16]: That gentleman , with a very serious shake of his head , subscribed the article .
Parsing [sent. 18949 len. 45]: ` And talk of Time slipping by you , as if it was an animal at rustic sports with its tail soaped , ' said Mr Inspector -LRB- again , a subject which nobody had approached -RRB- ; ` why , well you may .
Parsing [sent. 18950 len. 4]: Well you may .
Parsing [sent. 18951 len. 42]: How has it slipped by us , since the time when Mr Job Potterson here present , Mr Jacob Kibble here present , and an Officer of the Force here present , first came together on a matter of Identification ! '
Parsing [sent. 18952 len. 16]: Bella 's husband stepped softly to the half-door of the bar , and stood there .
Parsing [sent. 18953 len. 43]: ` How has Time slipped by us , ' Mr Inspector went on slowly , with his eyes narrowly observant of the two guests , ` since we three very men , at an Inquest in this very house -- Mr Kibble ?
Parsing [sent. 18954 len. 6]: Taken ill , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18955 len. 24]: Mr Kibble had staggered up , with his lower jaw dropped , catching Potterson by the shoulder , and pointing to the half-door .
Parsing [sent. 18956 len. 8]: He now cried out : ` Potterson !
Parsing [sent. 18957 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 18958 len. 4]: Look there ! '
Parsing [sent. 18959 len. 20]: Potterson started up , started back , and exclaimed : ` Heaven defend us , what 's that ! '
Parsing [sent. 18960 len. 37]: Bella 's husband stepped back to Bella , took her in his arms -LRB- for she was terrified by the unintelligible terror of the two men -RRB- , and shut the door of the little room .
Parsing [sent. 18961 len. 26]: A hurry of voices succeeded , in which Mr Inspector 's voice was busiest ; it gradually slackened and sank ; and Mr Inspector reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 18962 len. 9]: ` Sharp 's the word , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18963 len. 10]: he said , looking in with a knowing wink .
Parsing [sent. 18964 len. 11]: ` We 'll get your lady out at once . '
Parsing [sent. 18965 len. 27]: Immediately , Bella and her husband were under the stars , making their way back , alone , to the vehicle they had kept in waiting .
Parsing [sent. 18966 len. 21]: All this was most extraordinary , and Bella could make nothing of it but that John was in the right .
Parsing [sent. 18967 len. 19]: How in the right , and how suspected of being in the wrong , she could not divine .
Parsing [sent. 18968 len. 37]: Some vague idea that he had never really assumed the name of Handford , and that there was a remarkable likeness between him and that mysterious person , was her nearest approach to any definite explanation .
Parsing [sent. 18969 len. 19]: But John was triumphant ; that much was made apparent ; and she could wait for the rest .
Parsing [sent. 18970 len. 36]: When John came home to dinner next day , he said , sitting down on the sofa by Bella and baby-Bella : ` My dear , I have a piece of news to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 18971 len. 8]: I have left the China House . '
Parsing [sent. 18972 len. 23]: As he seemed to like having left it , Bella took it for granted that there was no misfortune in the case .
Parsing [sent. 18973 len. 22]: ` In a word , my love , ' said John , ` the China House is broken up and abolished .
Parsing [sent. 18974 len. 9]: There is no such thing any more . '
Parsing [sent. 18975 len. 13]: ` Then , are you already in another House , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 18976 len. 6]: ` Yes , my darling .
Parsing [sent. 18977 len. 8]: I am in another way of business .
Parsing [sent. 18978 len. 8]: And I am rather better off . '
Parsing [sent. 18979 len. 38]: The inexhaustible baby was instantly made to congratulate him , and to say , with appropriate action on the part of a very limp arm and a speckled fist : ` Three cheers , ladies and gemplemorums .
Parsing [sent. 18980 len. 6]: Hoo -- ray ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18981 len. 24]: I am afraid , my life , ' said John , ` that you have become very much attached to this cottage ? '
Parsing [sent. 18982 len. 7]: ` Afraid I have , John ?
Parsing [sent. 18983 len. 6]: Of course I have . '
Parsing [sent. 18984 len. 22]: ` The reason why I said afraid , ' returned John , ` is , because we must move . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18985 len. 4]: O John ! '
Parsing [sent. 18986 len. 10]: ` Yes , my dear , we must move .
Parsing [sent. 18987 len. 9]: We must have our head-quarters in London now .
Parsing [sent. 18988 len. 22]: In short , there 's a dwelling-house rent-free , attached to my new position , and we must occupy it . '
Parsing [sent. 18989 len. 9]: ` That 's a gain , John . '
Parsing [sent. 18990 len. 13]: ` Yes , my dear , it is undoubtedly a gain . '
Parsing [sent. 18991 len. 14]: He gave her a very blithe look , and a very sly look .
Parsing [sent. 18992 len. 24]: Which occasioned the inexhaustible baby to square at him with the speckled fists , and demand in a threatening manner what he meant ?
Parsing [sent. 18993 len. 19]: ` My love , you said it was a gain , and I said it was a gain .
Parsing [sent. 18994 len. 9]: A very innocent remark , surely . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18995 len. 31]: I wo n't , ' said the inexhaustible baby , ' -- allow -- you -- to -- make -- game -- of -- my -- venerable -- Ma . '
Parsing [sent. 18996 len. 14]: At each division administering a soft facer with one of the speckled fists .
Parsing [sent. 18997 len. 22]: John having stooped down to receive these punishing visitations , Bella asked him , would it be necessary to move soon ?
Parsing [sent. 18998 len. 19]: Why yes , indeed -LRB- said John -RRB- , he did propose that they should move very soon .
Parsing [sent. 18999 len. 9]: Taking the furniture with them , of course ?
Parsing [sent. 19000 len. 5]: -LRB- said Bella -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 19001 len. 30]: Why , no -LRB- said John -RRB- , the fact was , that the house was -- in a sort of a kind of a way -- furnished already .
Parsing [sent. 19002 len. 25]: The inexhaustible baby , hearing this , resumed the offensive , and said : ` But there 's no nursery for me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19003 len. 9]: What do you mean , marble-hearted parent ? '
Parsing [sent. 19004 len. 30]: To which the marble-hearted parent rejoined that there was a -- sort of a kind of a -- nursery , and it might be ` made to do ' .
Parsing [sent. 19005 len. 6]: ` Made to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 19006 len. 17]: returned the Inexhaustible , administering more punishment , ` what do you take me for ? '
Parsing [sent. 19007 len. 18]: And was then turned over on its back in Bella 's lap , and smothered with kisses .
Parsing [sent. 19008 len. 36]: ` But really , John dear , ' said Bella , flushed in quite a lovely manner by these exercises , ` will the new house , just as it stands , do for baby ?
Parsing [sent. 19009 len. 7]: That 's the question . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19010 len. 32]: I felt that to be the question , ' he returned , ` and therefore I arranged that you should come with me and look at it , to-morrow morning . '
Parsing [sent. 19011 len. 22]: Appointment made , accordingly , for Bella to go up with him tomorrow morning ; John kissed ; and Bella delighted .
Parsing [sent. 19012 len. 18]: When they reached London in pursuance of their little plan , they took coach and drove westward .
Parsing [sent. 19013 len. 29]: Not only drove westward , but drove into that particular westward division , which Bella had seen last when she turned her face from Mr Boffin 's door .
Parsing [sent. 19014 len. 17]: Not only drove into that particular division , but drove at last into that very street .
Parsing [sent. 19015 len. 17]: Not only drove into that very street , but stopped at last at that very house .
Parsing [sent. 19016 len. 5]: ` John dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 19017 len. 11]: cried Bella , looking out of window in a flutter .
Parsing [sent. 19018 len. 9]: ` Do you see where we are ? '
Parsing [sent. 19019 len. 6]: ` Yes , my love .
Parsing [sent. 19020 len. 7]: The coachman 's quite right . '
Parsing [sent. 19021 len. 17]: The house-door was opened without any knocking or ringing , and John promptly helped her out .
Parsing [sent. 19022 len. 29]: The servant who stood holding the door , asked no question of John , neither did he go before them or follow them as they went straight up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 19023 len. 25]: It was only her husband 's encircling arm , urging her on , that prevented Bella from stopping at the foot of the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 19024 len. 17]: As they ascended , it was seen to be tastefully ornamented with most beautiful flowers . '
Parsing [sent. 19025 len. 4]: O John ! '
Parsing [sent. 19026 len. 5]: said Bella , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 19027 len. 7]: ` What does this mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 19028 len. 8]: ` Nothing , my darling , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 19029 len. 6]: Let us go on . '
Parsing [sent. 19030 len. 60]: Going on a little higher , they came to a charming aviary , in which a number of tropical birds , more gorgeous in colour than the flowers , were flying about ; and among those birds were gold and silver fish , and mosses , and water-lilies , and a fountain , and all manner of wonders . '
Parsing [sent. 19031 len. 6]: O my dear John ! '
Parsing [sent. 19032 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19033 len. 7]: ` What does this mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 19034 len. 8]: ` Nothing , my darling , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 19035 len. 6]: Let us go on . '
Parsing [sent. 19036 len. 11]: They went on , until they came to a door .
Parsing [sent. 19037 len. 16]: As John put out his hand to open it , Bella caught his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 19038 len. 16]: I do n't know what it means , but it 's too much for me .
Parsing [sent. 19039 len. 8]: Hold me , John , love . '
Parsing [sent. 19040 len. 17]: John caught her up in his arm , and lightly dashed into the room with her .
Parsing [sent. 19041 len. 8]: Behold Mr and Mrs Boffin , beaming !
Parsing [sent. 19042 len. 62]: Behold Mrs Boffin clapping her hands in an ecstacy , running to Bella with tears of joy pouring down her comely face , and folding her to her breast , with the words : ` My deary deary , deary girl , that Noddy and me saw married and could n't wish joy to , or so much as speak to !
Parsing [sent. 19043 len. 17]: My deary , deary , deary , wife of John and mother of his little child !
Parsing [sent. 19044 len. 10]: My loving loving , bright bright , Pretty Pretty !
Parsing [sent. 19045 len. 11]: Welcome to your house and home , my deary ! '
Parsing [sent. 19046 len. 35]: Chapter 13 SHOWING HOW THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN HELPED TO SCATTER DUST In all the first bewilderment of her wonder , the most bewilderingly wonderful thing to Bella was the shining countenance of Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19047 len. 42]: That his wife should be joyous , open-hearted , and genial , or that her face should express every quality that was large and trusting , and no quality that was little or mean , was accordant with Bella 's experience .
Parsing [sent. 19048 len. 36]: But , that he , with a perfectly beneficent air and a plump rosy face , should be standing there , looking at her and John , like some jovial good spirit , was marvellous .
Parsing [sent. 19049 len. 58]: For , how had he looked when she last saw him in that very room -LRB- it was the room in which she had given him that piece of her mind at parting -RRB- , and what had become of all those crooked lines of suspicion , avarice , and distrust , that twisted his visage then ?
Parsing [sent. 19050 len. 48]: Mrs Boffin seated Bella on the large ottoman , and seated herself beside her , and John her husband seated himself on the other side of her , and Mr Boffin stood beaming at every one and everything he could see , with surpassing jollity and enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 19051 len. 50]: Mrs Boffin was then taken with a laughing fit of clapping her hands , and clapping her knees , and rocking herself to and fro , and then with another laughing fit of embracing Bella , and rocking her to and fro -- both fits , of considerable duration .
Parsing [sent. 19052 len. 26]: ` Old lady , old lady , ' said Mr Boffin , at length ; ` if you do n't begin somebody else must . '
Parsing [sent. 19053 len. 18]: ` I 'm a going to begin , Noddy , my dear , ' returned Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19054 len. 27]: ` Only it is n't easy for a person to know where to begin , when a person is in this state of delight and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 19055 len. 5]: Bella , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 19056 len. 8]: Tell me , who 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 19057 len. 6]: ` Who is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 19058 len. 3]: repeated Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19059 len. 5]: ` My husband . '
Parsing [sent. 19060 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19061 len. 9]: But tell me his name , deary ! '
Parsing [sent. 19062 len. 4]: cried Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19063 len. 4]: ` Rokesmith . '
Parsing [sent. 19064 len. 8]: ` No , it ai n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 19065 len. 13]: cried Mrs Boffin , clapping her hands , and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 19066 len. 8]: ` Not a bit of it . '
Parsing [sent. 19067 len. 8]: ` Handford then , ' suggested Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19068 len. 8]: ` No , it ai n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 19069 len. 13]: cried Mrs Boffin , again clapping her hands and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 19070 len. 8]: ` Not a bit of it . '
Parsing [sent. 19071 len. 13]: ` At least , his name is John , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 19072 len. 3]: said Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19073 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19074 len. 8]: I should think so , deary ! '
Parsing [sent. 19075 len. 5]: cried Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 19076 len. 5]: I should hope so !
Parsing [sent. 19077 len. 16]: Many and many is the time I have called him by his name of John .
Parsing [sent. 19078 len. 12]: But what 's his other name , his true other name ?
Parsing [sent. 19079 len. 9]: Give a guess , my pretty ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 19080 len. 19]: I ca n't guess , ' said Bella , turning her pale face from one to another . '
Parsing [sent. 19081 len. 17]: I could , ' cried Mrs Boffin , ` and what 's more , I did !
Parsing [sent. 19082 len. 17]: I found him out , all in a flash as I may say , one night .
Parsing [sent. 19083 len. 7]: Did n't I , Noddy ? '
Parsing [sent. 19084 len. 3]: ` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 19085 len. 7]: That the old lady did ! '
Parsing [sent. 19086 len. 11]: said Mr Boffin , with stout pride in the circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 19087 len. 30]: ` Harkee to me , deary , ' pursued Mrs Boffin , taking Bella 's hands between her own , and gently beating on them from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 19088 len. 21]: ` It was after a particular night when John had been disappointed -- as he thought -- in his affections .
Parsing [sent. 19089 len. 26]: It was after a night when John had made an offer to a certain young lady , and the certain young lady had refused it .
Parsing [sent. 19090 len. 25]: It was after a particular night , when he felt himself cast-away-like , and had made up his mind to go seek his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 19091 len. 7]: It was the very next night .
Parsing [sent. 19092 len. 35]: My Noddy wanted a paper out of his Secretary 's room , and I says to Noddy , `` I am going by the door , and I 'll ask him for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 19093 len. 13]: I tapped at his door , and he did n't hear me .
Parsing [sent. 19094 len. 18]: I looked in , and saw him a sitting lonely by his fire , brooding over it .
Parsing [sent. 19095 len. 56]: He chanced to look up with a pleased kind of smile in my company when he saw me , and then in a single moment every grain of the gunpowder that had been lying sprinkled thick about him ever since I first set eyes upon him as a man at the Bower , took fire !
Parsing [sent. 19096 len. 26]: Too many a time had I seen him sitting lonely , when he was a poor child , to be pitied , heart and hand !
Parsing [sent. 19097 len. 19]: Too many a time had I seen him in need of being brightened up with a comforting word !
Parsing [sent. 19098 len. 20]: Too many and too many a time to be mistaken , when that glimpse of him come at last !
Parsing [sent. 19099 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 19100 len. 13]: I just makes out to cry , `` I know you now !
Parsing [sent. 19101 len. 5]: You 're John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19102 len. 8]: And he catches me as I drops .
Parsing [sent. 19103 len. 39]: -- So what , ' says Mrs Boffin , breaking off in the rush of her speech to smile most radiantly , ` might you think by this time that your husband 's name was , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 19104 len. 15]: ` Not , ' returned Bella , with quivering lips ; ` not Harmon ?
Parsing [sent. 19105 len. 6]: That 's not possible ? '
Parsing [sent. 19106 len. 5]: ` Do n't tremble .
Parsing [sent. 19107 len. 14]: Why not possible , deary , when so many things are possible ? '
Parsing [sent. 19108 len. 9]: demanded Mrs Boffin , in a soothing tone .
Parsing [sent. 19109 len. 9]: ` He was killed , ' gasped Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19110 len. 10]: ` Thought to be , ' said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19111 len. 29]: ` But if ever John Harmon drew the breath of life on earth , that is certainly John Harmon 's arm round your waist now , my pretty .
Parsing [sent. 19112 len. 16]: If ever John Harmon had a wife on earth , that wife is certainly you .
Parsing [sent. 19113 len. 20]: If ever John Harmon and his wife had a child on earth , that child is certainly this . '
Parsing [sent. 19114 len. 23]: By a master-stroke of secret arrangement , the inexhaustible baby here appeared at the door , suspended in mid-air by invisible agency .
Parsing [sent. 19115 len. 40]: Mrs Boffin , plunging at it , brought it to Bella 's lap , where both Mrs and Mr Boffin -LRB- as the saying is -RRB- ` took it out of ' the Inexhaustible in a shower of caresses .
Parsing [sent. 19116 len. 12]: It was only this timely appearance that kept Bella from swooning .
Parsing [sent. 19117 len. 87]: This , and her husband 's earnestness in explaining further to her how it had come to pass that he had been supposed to be slain , and had even been suspected of his own murder ; also , how he had put a pious fraud upon her which had preyed upon his mind , as the time for its disclosure approached , lest she might not make full allowance for the object with which it had originated , and in which it had fully developed .
Parsing [sent. 19118 len. 9]: ` But bless ye , my beauty ! '
Parsing [sent. 19119 len. 20]: cried Mrs Boflin , taking him up short at this point , with another hearty clap of her hands .
Parsing [sent. 19120 len. 11]: ` It was n't John only that was in it .
Parsing [sent. 19121 len. 10]: We was all of us in it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19122 len. 35]: I do n't , ' said Bella , looking vacantly from one to another , ` yet understand -- ' ` Of course you do n't , my deary , ' exclaimed Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19123 len. 9]: ` How can you till you 're told !
Parsing [sent. 19124 len. 10]: So now I am a going to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 19125 len. 41]: So you put your two hands between my two hands again , ' cried the comfortable creature , embracing her , ` with that blessed little picter lying on your lap , and you shall be told all the story .
Parsing [sent. 19126 len. 11]: Now , I 'm a going to tell the story .
Parsing [sent. 19127 len. 13]: Once , twice , three times , and the horses is off .
Parsing [sent. 19128 len. 4]: Here they go !
Parsing [sent. 19129 len. 18]: When I cries out that night , `` I know you now , you 're John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19130 len. 14]: -- which was my exact words ; was n't they , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 19131 len. 15]: ` Your exact words , ' said John , laying his hand on hers .
Parsing [sent. 19132 len. 13]: ` That 's a very good arrangement , ' cried Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19133 len. 7]: ` Keep it there , John .
Parsing [sent. 19134 len. 35]: And as we was all of us in it , Noddy you come and lay yours a top of his , and we wo n't break the pile till the story 's done . '
Parsing [sent. 19135 len. 18]: Mr Boffin hitched up a chair , and added his broad brown right hand to the heap .
Parsing [sent. 19136 len. 6]: ` That 's capital ! '
Parsing [sent. 19137 len. 9]: said Mrs Boffin , giving it a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 19138 len. 11]: ` Seems quite a family building ; do n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 19139 len. 6]: But the horses is off .
Parsing [sent. 19140 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19141 len. 13]: When I cries out that night , `` I know you now !
Parsing [sent. 19142 len. 5]: you 're John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19143 len. 29]: John catches of me , it is true ; but I ai n't a light weight , bless ye , and he 's forced to let me down .
Parsing [sent. 19144 len. 54]: Noddy , he hears a noise , and in he trots , and as soon as I anyways comes to myself I calls to him , `` Noddy , well I might say as I did say , that night at the Bower , for the Lord be thankful this is John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19145 len. 20]: On which he gives a heave , and down he goes likewise , with his head under the writing-table .
Parsing [sent. 19146 len. 29]: This brings me round comfortable , and that brings him round comfortable , and then John and him and me we all fall a crying for joy . '
Parsing [sent. 19147 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 19148 len. 14]: They cry for joy , my darling , ' her husband struck in .
Parsing [sent. 19149 len. 4]: ` You understand ?
Parsing [sent. 19150 len. 18]: These two , whom I come to life to disappoint and dispossess , cry for joy ! '
Parsing [sent. 19151 len. 16]: Bella looked at him confusedly , and looked again at Mrs Boffin 's radiant face .
Parsing [sent. 19152 len. 24]: ` That 's right , my dear , do n't you mind him , ' said Mrs Boffin , ` stick to me .
Parsing [sent. 19153 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19154 len. 14]: Then we sits down , gradually gets cool , and holds a confabulation .
Parsing [sent. 19155 len. 69]: John , he tells us how he is despairing in his mind on accounts of a certain fair young person , and how , if I had n't found him out , he was going away to seek his fortune far and wide , and had fully meant never to come to life , but to leave the property as our wrongful inheritance for ever and a day .
Parsing [sent. 19156 len. 14]: At which you never see a man so frightened as my Noddy was .
Parsing [sent. 19157 len. 40]: For to think that he should have come into the property wrongful , however innocent , and -- more than that -- might have gone on keeping it to his dying day , turned him whiter than chalk . '
Parsing [sent. 19158 len. 10]: ` And you too , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19159 len. 22]: ` Do n't you mind him , neither , my deary , ' resumed Mrs Boffin ; ` stick to me .
Parsing [sent. 19160 len. 27]: This brings up a confabulation regarding the certain fair young person ; when Noddy he gives it as his opinion that she is a deary creetur .
Parsing [sent. 19161 len. 51]: `` She may be a leetle spoilt , and nat ` rally spoilt , '' he says , `` by circumstances , but that 's only the surface , and I lay my life , '' he says , `` that she 's the true golden gold at heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 19162 len. 10]: ` So did you , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19163 len. 24]: ` Do n't you mind him a single morsel , my dear , ' proceeded Mrs Boffin , ` but stick to me .
Parsing [sent. 19164 len. 13]: Then says John , O , if he could but prove so !
Parsing [sent. 19165 len. 18]: Then we both of us ups and says , that minute , `` Prove so ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 19166 len. 13]: With a start , Bella directed a hurried glance towards Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19167 len. 31]: But , he was sitting thoughtfully smiling at that broad brown hand of his , and either did n't see it , or would take no notice of it . '
Parsing [sent. 19168 len. 7]: `` Prove it , John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19169 len. 9]: we says , ' repeated Mrs Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 19170 len. 30]: `` Prove it and overcome your doubts with triumph , and be happy for the first time in your life , and for the rest of your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 19171 len. 11]: This puts John in a state , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 19172 len. 10]: Then we says , `` What will content you ?
Parsing [sent. 19173 len. 58]: If she was to stand up for you when you was slighted , if she was to show herself of a generous mind when you was oppressed , if she was to be truest to you when you was poorest and friendliest , and all this against her own seeming interest , how would that do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19174 len. 4]: `` Do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19175 len. 13]: says John , `` it would raise me to the skies . ''
Parsing [sent. 19176 len. 30]: `` Then , '' says my Noddy , `` make your preparations for the ascent , John , it being my firm belief that up you go ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 19177 len. 29]: Bella caught Mr Boffin 's twinkling eye for half an instant ; but he got it away from her , and restored it to his broad brown hand .
Parsing [sent. 19178 len. 25]: ` From the first , you was always a special favourite of Noddy 's , ' said Mrs Boffin , shaking her head . '
Parsing [sent. 19179 len. 4]: O you were !
Parsing [sent. 19180 len. 23]: And if I had been inclined to be jealous , I do n't know what I might n't have done to you .
Parsing [sent. 19181 len. 32]: But as I was n't -- why , my beauty , ' with a hearty laugh and an embrace , ' I made you a special favourite of my own too .
Parsing [sent. 19182 len. 9]: But the horses is coming round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 19183 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19184 len. 53]: Then says my Noddy , shaking his sides till he was fit to make 'em ache again : `` Look out for being slighted and oppressed , John , for if ever a man had a hard master , you shall find me from this present time to be such to you .
Parsing [sent. 19185 len. 6]: And then he began ! '
Parsing [sent. 19186 len. 10]: cried Mrs Boffin , in an ecstacy of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 19187 len. 9]: ` Lord bless you , then he began !
Parsing [sent. 19188 len. 11]: And how he DID begin ; did n't he ! '
Parsing [sent. 19189 len. 10]: Bella looked half frightened , and yet half laughed .
Parsing [sent. 19190 len. 28]: ` But , bless you , ' pursued Mrs Boffin , ` if you could have seen him of a night , at that time of it !
Parsing [sent. 19191 len. 10]: The way he 'd sit and chuckle over himself !
Parsing [sent. 19192 len. 35]: The way he 'd say `` I 've been a regular brown bear to-day , '' and take himself in his arms and hug himself at the thoughts of the brute he had pretended .
Parsing [sent. 19193 len. 16]: But every night he says to me : `` Better and better , old lady .
Parsing [sent. 19194 len. 7]: What did we say of her ?
Parsing [sent. 19195 len. 11]: She 'll come through it , the true golden gold .
Parsing [sent. 19196 len. 13]: This 'll be the happiest piece of work we ever done . ''
Parsing [sent. 19197 len. 17]: And then he 'd say , `` I 'll be a grislier old growler tomorrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19198 len. 31]: and laugh , he would , till John and me was often forced to slap his back , and bring it out of his windpipes with a little water . '
Parsing [sent. 19199 len. 33]: Mr Boffin , with his face bent over his heavy hand , made no sound , but rolled his shoulders when thus referred to , as if he were vastly enjoying himself .
Parsing [sent. 19200 len. 50]: ` And so , my good and pretty , ' pursued Mrs Boffin , ` you was married , and there was we hid up in the church-organ by this husband of yours ; for he would n't let us out with it then , as was first meant .
Parsing [sent. 19201 len. 25]: `` No , '' he says , `` she 's so unselfish and contented , that I ca n't afford to be rich yet .
Parsing [sent. 19202 len. 8]: I must wait a little longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 19203 len. 29]: Then , when baby was expected , he says , `` She is such a cheerful , glorious housewife that I ca n't afford to be rich yet .
Parsing [sent. 19204 len. 8]: I must wait a little longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 19205 len. 30]: Then when baby was born , he says , `` She is so much better than she ever was , that I ca n't afford to be rich yet .
Parsing [sent. 19206 len. 8]: I must wait a little longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 19207 len. 50]: And so he goes on and on , till I says outright , `` Now , John , if you do n't fix a time for setting her up in her own house and home , and letting us walk out of it , I 'll turn Informer . ''
Parsing [sent. 19208 len. 59]: Then he says he 'll only wait to triumph beyond what we ever thought possible , and to show her to us better than even we ever supposed ; and he says , `` She shall see me under suspicion of having murdered myself , and YOU shall see how trusting and how true she 'll be . ''
Parsing [sent. 19209 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19210 len. 43]: Noddy and me agreed to that , and he was right , and here you are , and the horses is in , and the story is done , and God bless you my Beauty , and God bless us all ! '
Parsing [sent. 19211 len. 36]: The pile of hands dispersed , and Bella and Mrs Boffin took a good long hug of one another : to the apparent peril of the inexhaustible baby , lying staring in Bella 's lap .
Parsing [sent. 19212 len. 8]: ` But IS the story done ? '
Parsing [sent. 19213 len. 5]: said Bella , pondering .
Parsing [sent. 19214 len. 9]: ` Is there no more of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 19215 len. 12]: ` What more of it should there be , deary ? '
Parsing [sent. 19216 len. 8]: returned Mrs Boffin , full of glee .
Parsing [sent. 19217 len. 13]: ` Are you sure you have left nothing out of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 19218 len. 4]: asked Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 19219 len. 14]: I do n't think I have , ' said Mrs Boffin , archly .
Parsing [sent. 19220 len. 22]: ` John dear , ' said Bella , ` you 're a good nurse ; will you please hold baby ? '
Parsing [sent. 19221 len. 85]: Having deposited the Inexhaustible in his arms with those words , Bella looked hard at Mr Boffin , who had moved to a table where he was leaning his head upon his hand with his face turned away , and , quietly settling herself on her knees at his side , and drawing one arm over his shoulder , said : ` Please I beg your pardon , and I made a small mistake of a word when I took leave of you last .
Parsing [sent. 19222 len. 40]: Please I think you are better -LRB- not worse -RRB- than Hopkins , better -LRB- not worse -RRB- than Dancer , better -LRB- not worse -RRB- than Blackberry Jones , better -LRB- not worse -RRB- than any of them !
Parsing [sent. 19223 len. 5]: Please something more ! '
Parsing [sent. 19224 len. 24]: cried Bella , with an exultant ringing laugh as she struggled with him and forced him to turn his delighted face to hers .
Parsing [sent. 19225 len. 11]: ` Please I have found out something not yet mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 19226 len. 28]: Please I do n't believe you are a hard-hearted miser at all , and please I do n't believe you ever for one single minute were ! '
Parsing [sent. 19227 len. 40]: At this , Mrs Boffin fairly screamed with rapture , and sat beating her feet upon the floor , clapping her hands , and bobbing herself backwards and forwards , like a demented member of some Mandarin 's family .
Parsing [sent. 19228 len. 11]: ` O , I understand you now , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 19229 len. 4]: cried Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 19230 len. 17]: I want neither you nor any one else to tell me the rest of the story .
Parsing [sent. 19231 len. 18]: I can tell it to YOU , now , if you would like to hear it . '
Parsing [sent. 19232 len. 8]: ` Can you , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 19233 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19234 len. 6]: ` Tell it then . '
Parsing [sent. 19235 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 19236 len. 13]: cried Bella , holding him prisoner by the coat with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 19237 len. 41]: ` When you saw what a greedy little wretch you were the patron of , you determined to show her how much misused and misprized riches could do , and often had done , to spoil people ; did you ?
Parsing [sent. 19238 len. 18]: Not caring what she thought of you -LRB- and Goodness knows THAT was of no consequence ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19239 len. 65]: you showed her , in yourself , the most detestable sides of wealth , saying in your own mind , `` This shallow creature would never work the truth out of her own weak soul , if she had a hundred years to do it in ; but a glaring instance kept before her may open even her eyes and set her thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 19240 len. 15]: That was what you said to yourself , was it , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19241 len. 20]: I never said anything of the sort , ' Mr Boffin declared in a state of the highest enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 19242 len. 33]: ` Then you ought to have said it , sir , ' returned Bella , giving him two pulls and one kiss , ` for you must have thought and meant it .
Parsing [sent. 19243 len. 61]: You saw that good fortune was turning my stupid head and hardening my silly heart -- was making me grasping , calculating , insolent , insufferable -- and you took the pains to be the dearest and kindest fingerpost that ever was set up anywhere , pointing out the road that I was taking and the end it led to .
Parsing [sent. 19244 len. 4]: Confess instantly ! '
Parsing [sent. 19245 len. 30]: ` John , ' said Mr Boffin , one broad piece of sunshine from head to foot , ' I wish you 'd help me out of this . '
Parsing [sent. 19246 len. 15]: ` You ca n't be heard by counsel , sir , ' returned Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19247 len. 7]: ` You must speak for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 19248 len. 4]: Confess instantly ! '
Parsing [sent. 19249 len. 59]: ` Well , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin , ` the truth is , that when we did go in for the little scheme that my old lady has pinted out , I did put it to John , what did he think of going in for some such general scheme as YOU have pinted out ?
Parsing [sent. 19250 len. 22]: But I did n't in any way so word it , because I did n't in any way so mean it .
Parsing [sent. 19251 len. 41]: I only said to John , would n't it be more consistent , me going in for being a reg ` lar brown bear respecting him , to go in as a reg ` lar brown bear all round ? '
Parsing [sent. 19252 len. 23]: ` Confess this minute , sir , ' said Bella , ` that you did it to correct and amend me ! '
Parsing [sent. 19253 len. 29]: ` Certainly , my dear child , ' said Mr Boffin , ' I did n't do it to harm you ; you may be sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 19254 len. 11]: And I did hope it might just hint a caution .
Parsing [sent. 19255 len. 43]: Still , it ought to be mentioned that no sooner had my old lady found out John , than John made known to her and me that he had had his eye upon a thankless person by the name of Silas Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19256 len. 69]: Partly for the punishment of which Wegg , by leading him on in a very unhandsome and underhanded game that he was playing , them books that you and me bought so many of together -LRB- and , by-the-by , my dear , he was n't Blackberry Jones , but Blewberry -RRB- was read aloud to me by that person of the name of Silas Wegg aforesaid . '
Parsing [sent. 19257 len. 41]: Bella , who was still on her knees at Mr Boffin 's feet , gradually sank down into a sitting posture on the ground , as she meditated more and more thoughtfully , with her eyes upon his beaming face .
Parsing [sent. 19258 len. 23]: ` Still , ' said Bella , after this meditative pause , ` there remain two things that I can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 19259 len. 19]: Mrs Boffin never supposed any part of the change in Mr Boffin to be real ; did she ?
Parsing [sent. 19260 len. 9]: -- You never did ; did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19261 len. 7]: asked Bella , turning to her .
Parsing [sent. 19262 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 19263 len. 12]: returned Mrs Boffin , with a most rotund and glowing negative .
Parsing [sent. 19264 len. 16]: ` And yet you took it very much to heart , ' said Bella . '
Parsing [sent. 19265 len. 11]: I remember its making you very uneasy , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 19266 len. 15]: ` Ecod , you see Mrs John has a sharp eye , John ! '
Parsing [sent. 19267 len. 12]: cried Mr Boffin , shaking his head with an admiring air .
Parsing [sent. 19268 len. 8]: ` You 're right , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 19269 len. 15]: The old lady nearly blowed us into shivers and smithers , many times . '
Parsing [sent. 19270 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 19271 len. 3]: asked Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19272 len. 14]: ` How did that happen , when she was in your secret ? '
Parsing [sent. 19273 len. 40]: ` Why , it was a weakness in the old lady , ' said Mr Boffin ; ` and yet , to tell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth , I 'm rather proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 19274 len. 31]: My dear , the old lady thinks so high of me that she could n't abear to see and hear me coming out as a reg ` lar brown one .
Parsing [sent. 19275 len. 10]: Could n't abear to make-believe as I meant it !
Parsing [sent. 19276 len. 14]: In consequence of which , we was everlastingly in danger with her . '
Parsing [sent. 19277 len. 29]: Mrs Boffin laughed heartily at herself ; but a certain glistening in her honest eyes revealed that she was by no means cured of that dangerous propensity . '
Parsing [sent. 19278 len. 108]: I assure you , my dear , ' said Mr Boffin , ` that on the celebrated day when I made what has since been agreed upon to be my grandest demonstration -- I allude to Mew says the cat , Quack quack says the duck , and Bow-wow-wow says the dog -- I assure you , my dear , that on that celebrated day , them flinty and unbeliving words hit my old lady so hard on my account , that I had to hold her , to prevent her running out after you , and defending me by saying I was playing a part . '
Parsing [sent. 19279 len. 51]: Mrs Boffin laughed heartily again , and her eyes glistened again , and it then appeared , not only that in that burst of sarcastic eloquence Mr Boffin was considered by his two fellowconspirators to have outdone himself , but that in his own opinion it was a remarkable achievement .
Parsing [sent. 19280 len. 13]: ` Never thought of it afore the moment , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 19281 len. 5]: he observed to Bella .
Parsing [sent. 19282 len. 41]: ` When John said , if he had been so happy as to win your affections and possess your heart , it come into my head to turn round upon him with `` Win her affections and possess her heart !
Parsing [sent. 19283 len. 18]: Mew says the cat , Quack quack says the duck , and Bow-wow-wow says the dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 19284 len. 34]: I could n't tell you how it come into my head or where from , but it had so much the sound of a rasper that I own to you it astonished myself .
Parsing [sent. 19285 len. 17]: I was awful nigh bursting out a laughing though , when it made John stare ! '
Parsing [sent. 19286 len. 27]: ` You said , my pretty , ' Mrs Boffin reminded Bella , ` that there was one other thing you could n't understand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19287 len. 4]: O yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 19288 len. 26]: cried Bella , covering her face with her hands ; ` but that I never shall be able to understand as long as I live .
Parsing [sent. 19289 len. 58]: It is , how John could love me so when I so little deserved it , and how you , Mr and Mrs Boffin , could be so forgetful of yourselves , and take such pains and trouble , to make me a little better , and after all to help him to so unworthy a wife .
Parsing [sent. 19290 len. 8]: But I am very very grateful . '
Parsing [sent. 19291 len. 61]: It was John Harmon 's turn then -- John Harmon now for good , and John Rokesmith for nevermore -- to plead with her -LRB- quite unnecessarily -RRB- in behalf of his deception , and to tell her , over and over again , that it had been prolonged by her own winning graces in her supposed station of life .
Parsing [sent. 19292 len. 94]: This led on to many interchanges of endearment and enjoyment on all sides , in the midst of which the Inexhaustible being observed staring , in a most imbecile manner , on Mrs Boffin 's breast , was pronounced to be supernaturally intelligent as to the whole transaction , and was made to declare to the ladies and gemplemorums , with a wave of the speckled fist -LRB- with difficulty detached from an exceedingly short waist -RRB- , ' I have already informed my venerable Ma that I know all about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 19293 len. 16]: Then , said John Harmon , would Mrs John Harmon come and see her house ?
Parsing [sent. 19294 len. 44]: And a dainty house it was , and a tastefully beautiful ; and they went through it in procession ; the Inexhaustible on Mrs Boffin 's bosom -LRB- still staring -RRB- occupying the middle station , and Mr Boffin bringing up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 19295 len. 67]: And on Bella 's exquisite toilette table was an ivory casket , and in the casket were jewels the like of which she had never dreamed of , and aloft on an upper floor was a nursery garnished as with rainbows ; ` though we were hard put to it , ' said John Harmon , ` to get it done in so short a time .
Parsing [sent. 19296 len. 47]: The house inspected , emissaries removed the Inexhaustible , who was shortly afterwards heard screaming among the rainbows ; whereupon Bella withdrew herself from the presence and knowledge of gemplemorums , and the screaming ceased , and smiling Peace associated herself with that young olive branch .
Parsing [sent. 19297 len. 9]: ` Come and look in , Noddy ! '
Parsing [sent. 19298 len. 7]: said Mrs Boffin to Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19299 len. 65]: Mr Boffin , submitting to be led on tiptoe to the nursery door , looked in with immense satisfaction , although there was nothing to see but Bella in a musing state of happiness , seated in a little low chair upon the hearth , with her child in her fair young arms , and her soft eyelashes shading her eyes from the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19300 len. 21]: ` It looks as if the old man 's spirit had found rest at last ; do n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 19301 len. 4]: said Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19302 len. 7]: ` Yes , old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 19303 len. 33]: ` And as if his money had turned bright again , after a long long rust in the dark , and was at last a beginning to sparkle in the sunlight ? '
Parsing [sent. 19304 len. 7]: ` Yes , old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 19305 len. 16]: ` And it makes a pretty and a promising picter ; do n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 19306 len. 7]: ` Yes , old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 19307 len. 34]: But , aware at the instant of a fine opening for a point , Mr Boffin quenched that observation in this -- delivered in the grisliest growling of the regular brown bear . '
Parsing [sent. 19308 len. 7]: A pretty and a hopeful picter ?
Parsing [sent. 19309 len. 8]: Mew , Quack quack , Bow-wow ! '
Parsing [sent. 19310 len. 17]: And then trotted silently downstairs , with his shoulders in a state of the liveliest commotion .
Parsing [sent. 19311 len. 54]: Chapter 14 CHECKMATE TO THE FRIENDLY MOVE Mr and Mrs John Harmon had so timed their taking possession of their rightful name and their London house , that the event befel on the very day when the last waggon-load of the last Mound was driven out at the gates of Boffin 's Bower .
Parsing [sent. 19312 len. 37]: As it jolted away , Mr Wegg felt that the last load was correspondingly removed from his mind , and hailed the auspicious season when that black sheep , Boffin , was to be closely sheared .
Parsing [sent. 19313 len. 18]: Over the whole slow process of levelling the Mounds , Silas had kept watch with rapacious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19314 len. 29]: But , eyes no less rapacious had watched the growth of the Mounds in years bygone , and had vigilantly sifted the dust of which they were composed .
Parsing [sent. 19315 len. 5]: No valuables turned up .
Parsing [sent. 19316 len. 27]: How should there be any , seeing that the old hard jailer of Harmony Jail had coined every waif and stray into money , long before ?
Parsing [sent. 19317 len. 27]: Though disappointed by this bare result , Mr Wegg felt too sensibly relieved by the close of the labour , to grumble to any great extent .
Parsing [sent. 19318 len. 22]: A foreman-representative of the dust contractors , purchasers of the Mounds , had worn Mr Wegg down to skin and bone .
Parsing [sent. 19319 len. 40]: This supervisor of the proceedings , asserting his employers ' rights to cart off by daylight , nightlight , torchlight , when they would , must have been the death of Silas if the work had lasted much longer .
Parsing [sent. 19320 len. 37]: Seeming never to need sleep himself , he would reappear , with a tied-up broken head , in fantail hat and velveteen smalls , like an accursed goblin , at the most unholy and untimely hours .
Parsing [sent. 19321 len. 58]: Tired out by keeping close ward over a long day 's work in fog and rain , Silas would have just crawled to bed and be dozing , when a horrid shake and rumble under his pillow would announce an approaching train of carts , escorted by this Demon of Unrest , to fall to work again .
Parsing [sent. 19322 len. 36]: At another time , he would be rumbled up out of his soundest sleep , in the dead of the night ; at another , would be kept at his post eight-and-forty hours on end .
Parsing [sent. 19323 len. 41]: The more his persecutor besought him not to trouble himself to turn out , the more suspicious was the crafty Wegg that indications had been observed of something hidden somewhere , and that attempts were on foot to circumvent him .
Parsing [sent. 19324 len. 44]: So continually broken was his rest through these means , that he led the life of having wagered to keep ten thousand dog-watches in ten thousand hours , and looked piteously upon himself as always getting up and yet never going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 19325 len. 40]: So gaunt and haggard had he grown at last , that his wooden leg showed disproportionate , and presented a thriving appearance in contrast with the rest of his plagued body , which might almost have been termed chubby .
Parsing [sent. 19326 len. 25]: However , Wegg 's comfort was , that all his disagreeables were now over , and that he was immediately coming into his property .
Parsing [sent. 19327 len. 32]: Of late , the grindstone did undoubtedly appear to have been whirling at his own nose rather than Boffin 's , but Boffin 's nose was now to be sharpened fine .
Parsing [sent. 19328 len. 34]: Thus far , Mr Wegg had let his dusty friend off lightly , having been baulked in that amiable design of frequently dining with him , by the machinations of the sleepless dustman .
Parsing [sent. 19329 len. 30]: He had been constrained to depute Mr Venus to keep their dusty friend , Boffin , under inspection , while he himself turned lank and lean at the Bower .
Parsing [sent. 19330 len. 18]: To Mr Venus 's museum Mr Wegg repaired when at length the Mounds were down and gone .
Parsing [sent. 19331 len. 35]: It being evening , he found that gentleman , as he expected , seated over his fire ; but did not find him , as he expected , floating his powerful mind in tea .
Parsing [sent. 19332 len. 10]: ` Why , you smell rather comfortable here ! '
Parsing [sent. 19333 len. 18]: said Wegg , seeming to take it ill , and stopping and sniffing as he entered . '
Parsing [sent. 19334 len. 11]: I AM rather comfortable , sir , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 19335 len. 14]: ` You do n't use lemon in your business , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19336 len. 6]: asked Wegg , sniffing again .
Parsing [sent. 19337 len. 10]: ` No , Mr Wegg , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 19338 len. 18]: ` When I use it at all , I mostly use it in cobblers ' punch . '
Parsing [sent. 19339 len. 10]: ` What do you call cobblers ' punch ? '
Parsing [sent. 19340 len. 10]: demanded Wegg , in a worse humour than before .
Parsing [sent. 19341 len. 49]: ` It 's difficult to impart the receipt for it , sir , ' returned Venus , ` because , however particular you may be in allotting your materials , so much will still depend upon the individual gifts , and there being a feeling thrown into it .
Parsing [sent. 19342 len. 7]: But the groundwork is gin . '
Parsing [sent. 19343 len. 7]: ` In a Dutch bottle ? '
Parsing [sent. 19344 len. 10]: said Wegg gloomily , as he sat himself down .
Parsing [sent. 19345 len. 10]: ` Very good , sir , very good ! '
Parsing [sent. 19346 len. 3]: cried Venus .
Parsing [sent. 19347 len. 8]: ` Will you partake , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 19348 len. 6]: ` Will I partake ? '
Parsing [sent. 19349 len. 5]: returned Wegg very surlily .
Parsing [sent. 19350 len. 8]: ` Why , of course I will !
Parsing [sent. 19351 len. 24]: WILL a man partake , as has been tormented out of his five senses by an everlasting dustman with his head tied up !
Parsing [sent. 19352 len. 5]: WILL he , too !
Parsing [sent. 19353 len. 7]: As if he would n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 19354 len. 12]: ` Do n't let it put you out , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19355 len. 10]: You do n't seem in your usual spirits . '
Parsing [sent. 19356 len. 20]: ` If you come to that , you do n't seem in your usual spirits , ' growled Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19357 len. 11]: ` You seem to be setting up for lively . '
Parsing [sent. 19358 len. 18]: This circumstance appeared , in his then state of mind , to give Mr Wegg uncommon offence .
Parsing [sent. 19359 len. 11]: ` And you 've been having your hair cut ! '
Parsing [sent. 19360 len. 9]: said Wegg , missing the usual dusty shock .
Parsing [sent. 19361 len. 6]: ` Yes , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19362 len. 12]: But do n't let that put you out , either . '
Parsing [sent. 19363 len. 13]: ` And I am blest if you ai n't getting fat ! '
Parsing [sent. 19364 len. 7]: said Wegg , with culminating discontent .
Parsing [sent. 19365 len. 10]: ` What are you going to do next ? '
Parsing [sent. 19366 len. 33]: ` Well , Mr Wegg , ' said Venus , smiling in a sprightly manner , ' I suspect you could hardly guess what I am going to do next . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19367 len. 11]: I do n't want to guess , ' retorted Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19368 len. 27]: ` All I 've got to say is , that it 's well for you that the diwision of labour has been what it has been .
Parsing [sent. 19369 len. 23]: It 's well for you to have had so light a part in this business , when mine has been so heavy .
Parsing [sent. 19370 len. 14]: You have n't had YOUR rest broke , I 'll be bound . '
Parsing [sent. 19371 len. 11]: ` Not at all , sir , ' said Venus .
Parsing [sent. 19372 len. 15]: ` Never rested so well in all my life , I thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 19373 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 19374 len. 10]: grumbled Wegg , ` you should have been me .
Parsing [sent. 19375 len. 47]: If you had been me , and had been fretted out of your bed , and your sleep , and your meals , and your mind , for a stretch of months together , you 'd have been out of condition and out of sorts . '
Parsing [sent. 19376 len. 25]: ` Certainly , it has trained you down , Mr Wegg , ' said Venus , contemplating his figure with an artist 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 19377 len. 10]: ` Trained you down very low , it has !
Parsing [sent. 19378 len. 36]: So weazen and yellow is the kivering upon your bones , that one might almost fancy you had come to give a look-in upon the French gentleman in the corner , instead of me . '
Parsing [sent. 19379 len. 53]: Mr Wegg , glancing in great dudgeon towards the French gentleman 's corner , seemed to notice something new there , which induced him to glance at the opposite corner , and then to put on his glasses and stare at all the nooks and corners of the dim shop in succession .
Parsing [sent. 19380 len. 13]: ` Why , you 've been having the place cleaned up ! '
Parsing [sent. 19381 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 19382 len. 6]: ` Yes , Mr Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19383 len. 8]: By the hand of adorable woman . '
Parsing [sent. 19384 len. 19]: ` Then what you 're going to do next , I suppose , is to get married ? '
Parsing [sent. 19385 len. 8]: ` That 's it , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19386 len. 40]: Silas took off his glasses again -- finding himself too intensely disgusted by the sprightly appearance of his friend and partner to bear a magnified view of him and made the inquiry : ` To the old party ? '
Parsing [sent. 19387 len. 5]: ` Mr Wegg ! '
Parsing [sent. 19388 len. 10]: said Venus , with a sudden flush of wrath .
Parsing [sent. 19389 len. 13]: ` The lady in question is not a old party . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19390 len. 18]: I meant , ' exclaimed Wegg , testily , ` to the party as formerly objected ? '
Parsing [sent. 19391 len. 27]: ` Mr Wegg , ' said Venus , ` in a case of so much delicacy , I must trouble you to say what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 19392 len. 10]: There are strings that must not be played upon .
Parsing [sent. 19393 len. 3]: No sir !
Parsing [sent. 19394 len. 12]: Not sounded , unless in the most respectful and tuneful manner .
Parsing [sent. 19395 len. 11]: Of such melodious strings is Miss Pleasant Riderhood formed . '
Parsing [sent. 19396 len. 11]: ` Then it IS the lady as formerly objected ? '
Parsing [sent. 19397 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19398 len. 16]: ` Sir , ' returned Venus with dignity , ' I accept the altered phrase .
Parsing [sent. 19399 len. 9]: It is the lady as formerly objected . '
Parsing [sent. 19400 len. 9]: ` When is it to come off ? '
Parsing [sent. 19401 len. 3]: asked Silas .
Parsing [sent. 19402 len. 13]: ` Mr Wegg , ' said Venus , with another flush . '
Parsing [sent. 19403 len. 15]: I can not permit it to be put in the form of a Fight .
Parsing [sent. 19404 len. 17]: I must temperately but firmly call upon you , sir , to amend that question . '
Parsing [sent. 19405 len. 44]: ` When is the lady , ' Wegg reluctantly demanded , constraining his ill temper in remembrance of the partnership and its stock in trade , ' a going to give her ` and where she has already given her ` art ? '
Parsing [sent. 19406 len. 19]: ` Sir , ' returned Venus , ' I again accept the altered phrase , and with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 19407 len. 23]: The lady is a going to give her ` and where she has already given her ` art , next Monday . '
Parsing [sent. 19408 len. 11]: ` Then the lady 's objection has been met ? '
Parsing [sent. 19409 len. 3]: said Silas .
Parsing [sent. 19410 len. 41]: ` Mr Wegg , ' said Venus , ` as I did name to you , I think , on a former occasion , if not on former occasions -- ' ` On former occasions , ' interrupted Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 19411 len. 68]: -- What , ' pursued Venus , ` what the nature of the lady 's objection was , I may impart , without violating any of the tender confidences since sprung up between the lady and myself , how it has been met , through the kind interference of two good friends of mine : one , previously acquainted with the lady : and one , not .
Parsing [sent. 19412 len. 100]: The pint was thrown out , sir , by those two friends when they did me the great service of waiting on the lady to try if a union betwixt the lady and me could not be brought to bear -- the pint , I say , was thrown out by them , sir , whether if , after marriage , I confined myself to the articulation of men , children , and the lower animals , it might not relieve the lady 's mind of her feeling respecting being as a lady -- regarded in a bony light .
Parsing [sent. 19413 len. 14]: It was a happy thought , sir , and it took root . '
Parsing [sent. 19414 len. 27]: ` It would seem , Mr Venus , ' observed Wegg , with a touch of distrust , ` that you are flush of friends ? '
Parsing [sent. 19415 len. 18]: ` Pretty well , sir , ' that gentleman answered , in a tone of placid mystery .
Parsing [sent. 19416 len. 5]: ` So-so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19417 len. 4]: Pretty well . '
Parsing [sent. 19418 len. 22]: ` However , ' said Wegg , after eyeing him with another touch of distrust , ' I wish you joy .
Parsing [sent. 19419 len. 14]: One man spends his fortune in one way , and another in another .
Parsing [sent. 19420 len. 7]: You are going to try matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 19421 len. 7]: I mean to try travelling . '
Parsing [sent. 19422 len. 7]: ` Indeed , Mr Wegg ? '
Parsing [sent. 19423 len. 39]: ` Change of air , sea-scenery , and my natural rest , I hope may bring me round after the persecutions I have undergone from the dustman with his head tied up , which I just now mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 19424 len. 21]: The tough job being ended and the Mounds laid low , the hour is come for Boffin to stump up .
Parsing [sent. 19425 len. 20]: Would ten to-morrow morning suit you , partner , for finally bringing Boffin 's nose to the grindstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 19426 len. 13]: Ten to-morrow morning would quite suit Mr Venus for that excellent purpose .
Parsing [sent. 19427 len. 13]: ` You have had him well under inspection , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 19428 len. 3]: said Silas .
Parsing [sent. 19429 len. 12]: Mr Venus had had him under inspection pretty well every day .
Parsing [sent. 19430 len. 55]: ` Suppose you was just to step round to-night then , and give him orders from me -- I say from me , because he knows I wo n't be played with -- to be ready with his papers , his accounts , and his cash , at that time in the morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 19431 len. 3]: said Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19432 len. 55]: ` And as a matter of form , which will be agreeable to your own feelings , before we go out -LRB- for I 'll walk with you part of the way , though my leg gives under me with weariness -RRB- , let 's have a look at the stock in trade . '
Parsing [sent. 19433 len. 39]: Mr Venus produced it , and it was perfectly correct ; Mr Venus undertook to produce it again in the morning , and to keep tryst with Mr Wegg on Boffin 's doorstep as the clock struck ten .
Parsing [sent. 19434 len. 38]: At a certain point of the road between Clerkenwell and Boffin 's house -LRB- Mr Wegg expressly insisted that there should be no prefix to the Golden Dustman 's name -RRB- the partners separated for the night .
Parsing [sent. 19435 len. 15]: It was a very bad night ; to which succeeded a very bad morning .
Parsing [sent. 19436 len. 54]: The streets were so unusually slushy , muddy , and miserable , in the morning , that Wegg rode to the scene of action ; arguing that a man who was , as it were , going to the Bank to draw out a handsome property , could well afford that trifling expense .
Parsing [sent. 19437 len. 18]: Venus was punctual , and Wegg undertook to knock at the door , and conduct the conference .
Parsing [sent. 19438 len. 4]: Door knocked at .
Parsing [sent. 19439 len. 3]: Door opened .
Parsing [sent. 19440 len. 6]: ` Boffin at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 19441 len. 10]: The servant replied that MR Boffin was at home .
Parsing [sent. 19442 len. 20]: ` He 'll do , ' said Wegg , ` though it ai n't what I call him . '
Parsing [sent. 19443 len. 9]: The servant inquired if they had any appointment ?
Parsing [sent. 19444 len. 22]: ` Now , I tell you what , young fellow , ' said Wegg , ' I wo n't have it .
Parsing [sent. 19445 len. 7]: This wo n't do for me .
Parsing [sent. 19446 len. 6]: I do n't want menials .
Parsing [sent. 19447 len. 5]: I want Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 19448 len. 38]: They were shown into a waiting-room , where the all-powerful Wegg wore his hat , and whistled , and with his forefinger stirred up a clock that stood upon the chimneypiece , until he made it strike .
Parsing [sent. 19449 len. 43]: In a few minutes they were shown upstairs into what used to be Boffin 's room ; which , besides the door of entrance , had foldingdoors in it , to make it one of a suite of rooms when occasion required .
Parsing [sent. 19450 len. 38]: Here , Boffin was seated at a library-table , and here Mr Wegg , having imperiously motioned the servant to withdraw , drew up a chair and seated himself , in his hat , close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 19451 len. 35]: Here , also , Mr Wegg instantly underwent the remarkable experience of having his hat twitched off his head and thrown out of a window , which was opened and shut for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 19452 len. 36]: ` Be careful what insolent liberties you take in that gentleman 's presence , ' said the owner of the hand which had done this , ` or I will throw you after it . '
Parsing [sent. 19453 len. 16]: Wegg involuntarily clapped his hand to his bare head , and stared at the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 19454 len. 22]: For , it was he addressed him with a severe countenance , and who had come in quietly by the folding-doors .
Parsing [sent. 19455 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 19456 len. 14]: said Wegg , as soon as he recovered his suspended power of speech .
Parsing [sent. 19457 len. 4]: ` Very good !
Parsing [sent. 19458 len. 9]: I gave directions for YOU to be dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 19459 len. 10]: And you ai n't gone , ai n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 19460 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 19461 len. 7]: We 'll look into this presently .
Parsing [sent. 19462 len. 4]: Very good ! '
Parsing [sent. 19463 len. 14]: ` No , nor I ai n't gone , ' said another voice .
Parsing [sent. 19464 len. 10]: Somebody else had come in quietly by the folding-doors .
Parsing [sent. 19465 len. 22]: Turning his head , Wegg beheld his persecutor , the ever-wakeful dustman , accoutred with fantail hat and velveteen smalls complete .
Parsing [sent. 19466 len. 23]: Who , untying his tied-up broken head , revealed a head that was whole , and a face that was Sloppy 's .
Parsing [sent. 19467 len. 10]: ` Ha , ha , ha , gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 19468 len. 13]: roared Sloppy in a peal of laughter , and with immeasureable relish .
Parsing [sent. 19469 len. 21]: ` He never thought as I could sleep standing , and often done it when I turned for Mrs Higden !
Parsing [sent. 19470 len. 16]: He never thought as I used to give Mrs Higden the Police-news in different voices !
Parsing [sent. 19471 len. 22]: But I did lead him a life all through it , gentlemen , I hope I really and truly DID ! '
Parsing [sent. 19472 len. 26]: Here , Mr Sloppy opening his mouth to a quite alarming extent , and throwing back his head to peal again , revealed incalculable buttons .
Parsing [sent. 19473 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 19474 len. 24]: said Wegg , slightly discomfited , but not much as yet : ` one and one is two not dismissed , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 19475 len. 4]: Bof -- fin !
Parsing [sent. 19476 len. 7]: Just let me ask a question .
Parsing [sent. 19477 len. 15]: Who set this chap on , in this dress , when the carting began ?
Parsing [sent. 19478 len. 7]: Who employed this fellow ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19479 len. 4]: I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 19480 len. 8]: remonstrated Sloppy , jerking his head forward .
Parsing [sent. 19481 len. 14]: ` No fellows , or I 'll throw you out of winder ! '
Parsing [sent. 19482 len. 22]: Mr Boffin appeased him with a wave of his hand , and said : ' I employed him , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 19483 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 19484 len. 6]: You employed him , Boffin ?
Parsing [sent. 19485 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 19486 len. 19]: Mr Venus , we raise our terms , and we ca n't do better than proceed to business .
Parsing [sent. 19487 len. 4]: Bof -- fin !
Parsing [sent. 19488 len. 11]: I want the room cleared of these two scum . '
Parsing [sent. 19489 len. 37]: ` That 's not going to be done , Wegg , ' replied Mr Boffin , sitting composedly on the library-table , at one end , while the Secretary sat composedly on it at the other .
Parsing [sent. 19490 len. 5]: ` Bof -- fin !
Parsing [sent. 19491 len. 7]: Not going to be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 19492 len. 3]: repeated Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19493 len. 7]: ` Not at your peril ? '
Parsing [sent. 19494 len. 15]: ` No , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin , shaking his head good-humouredly .
Parsing [sent. 19495 len. 14]: ` Not at my peril , and not on any other terms . '
Parsing [sent. 19496 len. 27]: Wegg reflected a moment , and then said : ` Mr Venus , will you be so good as hand me over that same dockyment ? '
Parsing [sent. 19497 len. 17]: ` Certainly , sir , ' replied Venus , handing it to him with much politeness .
Parsing [sent. 19498 len. 5]: ` There it is .
Parsing [sent. 19499 len. 44]: Having now , sir , parted with it , I wish to make a small observation : not so much because it is anyways necessary , or expresses any new doctrine or discovery , as because it is a comfort to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 19500 len. 11]: Silas Wegg , you are a precious old rascal . '
Parsing [sent. 19501 len. 35]: Mr Wegg , who , as if anticipating a compliment , had been beating time with the paper to the other 's politeness until this unexpected conclusion came upon him , stopped rather abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 19502 len. 38]: ` Silas Wegg , ' said Venus , ` know that I took the liberty of taking Mr Boffin into our concern as a sleeping partner , at a very early period of our firm 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 19503 len. 38]: ` Quite true , ' added Mr Boffin ; ` and I tested Venus by making him a pretended proposal or two ; and I found him on the whole a very honest man , Wegg . '
Parsing [sent. 19504 len. 45]: ` So Mr Boffin , in his indulgence , is pleased to say , ' Venus remarked : ` though in the beginning of this dirt , my hands were not , for a few hours , quite as clean as I could wish .
Parsing [sent. 19505 len. 11]: But I hope I made early and full amends . '
Parsing [sent. 19506 len. 11]: ` Venus , you did , ' said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19507 len. 8]: ` Certainly , certainly , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 19508 len. 9]: Venus inclined his head with respect and gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 19509 len. 6]: ` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19510 len. 12]: I am much obliged to you , sir , for all .
Parsing [sent. 19511 len. 49]: For your good opinion now , for your way of receiving and encouraging me when I first put myself in communication with you , and for the influence since so kindly brought to bear upon a certain lady , both by yourself and by Mr John Harmon . '
Parsing [sent. 19512 len. 14]: To whom , when thus making mention of him , he also bowed .
Parsing [sent. 19513 len. 36]: Wegg followed the name with sharp ears , and the action with sharp eyes , and a certain cringing air was infusing itself into his bullying air , when his attention was re-claimed by Venus .
Parsing [sent. 19514 len. 35]: ` Everything else between you and me , Mr Wegg , ' said Venus , ` now explains itself , and you can now make out , sir , without further words from me .
Parsing [sent. 19515 len. 59]: But totally to prevent any unpleasantness or mistake that might arise on what I consider an important point , to be made quite clear at the close of our acquaintance , I beg the leave of Mr Boffin and Mr John Harmon to repeat an observation which I have already had the pleasure of bringing under your notice .
Parsing [sent. 19516 len. 8]: You are a precious old rascal ! '
Parsing [sent. 19517 len. 41]: ` You are a fool , ' said Wegg , with a snap of his fingers , ` and I 'd have got rid of you before now , if I could have struck out any way of doing it .
Parsing [sent. 19518 len. 11]: I have thought it over , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 19519 len. 7]: You may go , and welcome .
Parsing [sent. 19520 len. 7]: You leave the more for me .
Parsing [sent. 19521 len. 34]: Because , you know , ' said Wegg , dividing his next observation between Mr Boffin and Mr Harmon , ' I am worth my price , and I mean to have it .
Parsing [sent. 19522 len. 39]: This getting off is all very well in its way , and it tells with such an anatomical Pump as this one , ' pointing out Mr Venus , ` but it wo n't do with a Man .
Parsing [sent. 19523 len. 15]: I am here to be bought off , and I have named my figure .
Parsing [sent. 19524 len. 10]: Now , buy me , or leave me . '
Parsing [sent. 19525 len. 23]: ` I 'll leave you , Wegg , said Mr Boffin , laughing , ` as far as I am concerned . '
Parsing [sent. 19526 len. 6]: ` Bof -- fin ! '
Parsing [sent. 19527 len. 18]: replied Wegg , turning upon him with a severe air , ' I understand YOUR new-born boldness .
Parsing [sent. 19528 len. 9]: I see the brass underneath YOUR silver plating .
Parsing [sent. 19529 len. 9]: YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint .
Parsing [sent. 19530 len. 17]: Knowing that you 've nothing at stake , you can afford to come the independent game .
Parsing [sent. 19531 len. 16]: Why , you 're just so much smeary glass to see through , you know !
Parsing [sent. 19532 len. 8]: But Mr Harmon is in another sitiwation .
Parsing [sent. 19533 len. 12]: What Mr Harmon risks , is quite another pair of shoes .
Parsing [sent. 19534 len. 45]: Now , I 've heerd something lately about this being Mr Harmon -- I make out now , some hints that I 've met on that subject in the newspaper -- and I drop you , Bof -- fin , as beneath my notice .
Parsing [sent. 19535 len. 18]: I ask Mr Harmon whether he has any idea of the contents of this present paper ? '
Parsing [sent. 19536 len. 68]: ` It is a will of my late father 's , of more recent date than the will proved by Mr Boffin -LRB- address whom again , as you have addressed him already , and I 'll knock you down -RRB- , leaving the whole of his property to the Crown , ' said John Harmon , with as much indifference as was compatible with extreme sternness .
Parsing [sent. 19537 len. 6]: ` Bight you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 19538 len. 3]: cried Wegg .
Parsing [sent. 19539 len. 49]: ` Then , ' screwing the weight of his body upon his wooden leg , and screwing his wooden head very much on one side , and screwing up one eye : ` then , I put the question to you , what 's this paper worth ? '
Parsing [sent. 19540 len. 8]: ` Nothing , ' said John Harmon .
Parsing [sent. 19541 len. 54]: Wegg had repeated the word with a sneer , and was entering on some sarcastic retort , when , to his boundless amazement , he found himself gripped by the cravat ; shaken until his teeth chattered ; shoved back , staggering , into a corner of the room ; and pinned there .
Parsing [sent. 19542 len. 5]: ` You scoundrel ! '
Parsing [sent. 19543 len. 14]: said John Harmon , whose seafaring hold was like that of a vice .
Parsing [sent. 19544 len. 16]: ` You 're knocking my head against the wall , ' urged Silas faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 19545 len. 44]: I mean to knock your head against the wall , ' neturned John Harmon , suiting his action to his words , with the heartiest good will ; ` and I 'd give a thousand pounds for leave to knock your brains out .
Parsing [sent. 19546 len. 13]: Listen , you scoundrel , and look at that Dutch bottle . '
Parsing [sent. 19547 len. 9]: Sloppy held it up , for his edification .
Parsing [sent. 19548 len. 22]: ` That Dutch bottle , scoundrel , contained the latest will of the many wills made by my unhappy self-tormenting father .
Parsing [sent. 19549 len. 36]: That will gives everything absolutely to my noble benefactor and yours , Mr Boffin , excluding and reviling me , and my sister -LRB- then already dead of a broken heart -RRB- , by name .
Parsing [sent. 19550 len. 21]: That Dutch bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours , after he entered on possession of the estate .
Parsing [sent. 19551 len. 42]: That Dutch bottle distressed him beyond measure , because , though I and my sister were both no more , it cast a slur upon our memory which he knew we had done nothing in our miserable youth , to deserve .
Parsing [sent. 19552 len. 40]: That Dutch bottle , therefore , he buried in the Mound belonging to him , and there it lay while you , you thankless wretch , were prodding and poking -- often very near it , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 19553 len. 41]: His intention was , that it should never see the light ; but he was afraid to destroy it , lest to destroy such a document , even with his great generous motive , might be an offence at law .
Parsing [sent. 19554 len. 42]: After the discovery was made here who I was , Mr Boffin , still restless on the subject , told me , upon certain conditions impossible for such a hound as you to appreciate , the secret of that Dutch bottle .
Parsing [sent. 19555 len. 21]: I urged upon him the necessity of its being dug up , and the paper being legally produced and established .
Parsing [sent. 19556 len. 19]: The first thing you saw him do , and the second thing has been done without your knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 19557 len. 43]: Consequently , the paper now rattling in your hand as I shake you -- and I should like to shake the life out of you -- is worth less than the rotten cork of the Dutch bottle , do you understand ? '
Parsing [sent. 19558 len. 24]: Judging from the fallen countenance of Silas as his head wagged backwards and forwards in a most uncomfortable manner , he did understand .
Parsing [sent. 19559 len. 46]: Now , scoundrel , ' said John Harmon , taking another sailor-like turn on his cravat and holding him in his corner at arms ' length , ' I shall make two more short speeches to you , because I hope they will torment you .
Parsing [sent. 19560 len. 23]: Your discovery was a genuine discovery -LRB- such as it was -RRB- , for nobody had thought of looking into that place .
Parsing [sent. 19561 len. 52]: Neither did we know you had made it , until Venus spoke to Mr Boffin , though I kept you under good observation from my first appearance here , and though Sloppy has long made it the chief occupation and delight of his life , to attend you like your shadow .
Parsing [sent. 19562 len. 45]: I tell you this , that you may know we knew enough of you to persuade Mr Boffin to let us lead you on , deluded , to the last possible moment , in order that your disappointment might be the heaviest possible disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 19563 len. 12]: That 's the first short speech , do you understand ? '
Parsing [sent. 19564 len. 11]: Here , John Harmon assisted his comprehension with another shake .
Parsing [sent. 19565 len. 16]: ` Now , scoundrel , ' he pursued , ' I am going to finish .
Parsing [sent. 19566 len. 16]: You supposed me just now , to be the possessor of my father 's property .
Parsing [sent. 19567 len. 5]: -- So I am .
Parsing [sent. 19568 len. 16]: But through any act of my father 's , or by any right I have ?
Parsing [sent. 19569 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 19570 len. 7]: Through the munificence of Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19571 len. 38]: The conditions that he made with me , before parting with the secret of the Dutch bottle , were , that I should take the fortune , and that he should take his Mound and no more .
Parsing [sent. 19572 len. 31]: I owe everything I possess , solely to the disinterestedness , uprightness , tenderness , goodness -LRB- there are no words to satisfy me -RRB- of Mr and Mrs Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19573 len. 70]: And when , knowing what I knew , I saw such a mud-worm as you presume to rise in this house against this noble soul , the wonder is , ' added John Harmon through his clenched teeth , and with a very ugly turn indeed on Wegg 's cravat , ` that I did n't try to twist your head off , and fling THAT out of window !
Parsing [sent. 19574 len. 2]: So .
Parsing [sent. 19575 len. 12]: That 's the last short speech , do you understand ? '
Parsing [sent. 19576 len. 28]: Silas , released , put his hand to his throat , cleared it , and looked as if he had a rather large fishbone in that region .
Parsing [sent. 19577 len. 59]: Simultaneously with this action on his part in his corner , a singular , and on the surface an incomprehensible , movement was made by Mr Sloppy : who began backing towards Mr Wegg along the wall , in the manner of a porter or heaver who is about to lift a sack of flour or coals . '
Parsing [sent. 19578 len. 40]: I am sorry , Wegg , ' said Mr Boffin , in his clemency , ` that my old lady and I ca n't have a better opinion of you than the bad one we are forced to entertain .
Parsing [sent. 19579 len. 24]: But I should n't like to leave you , after all said and done , worse off in life than I found you .
Parsing [sent. 19580 len. 23]: Therefore say in a word , before we part , what it 'll cost to set you up in another stall . '
Parsing [sent. 19581 len. 12]: ` And in another place , ' John Harmon struck in .
Parsing [sent. 19582 len. 10]: ` You do n't come outside these windows . '
Parsing [sent. 19583 len. 42]: ` Mr Boffin , ' returned Wegg in avaricious humiliation : ` when I first had the honour of making your acquaintance , I had got together a collection of ballads which was , I may say , above price . '
Parsing [sent. 19584 len. 27]: ` Then they ca n't be paid for , ' said John Harmon , ` and you had better not try , my dear sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19585 len. 47]: ` Pardon me , Mr Boffin , ' resumed Wegg , with a malignant glance in the last speaker 's direction , ' I was putting the case to you , who , if my senses did not deceive me , put the case to me .
Parsing [sent. 19586 len. 22]: I had a very choice collection of ballads , and there was a new stock of gingerbread in the tin box .
Parsing [sent. 19587 len. 14]: I say no more , but would rather leave it to you . '
Parsing [sent. 19588 len. 49]: ` But it 's difficult to name what 's right , ' said Mr Boffin uneasily , with his hand in his pocket , ` and I do n't want to go beyond what 's right , because you really have turned out such a very bad fellow .
Parsing [sent. 19589 len. 21]: So artful , and so ungrateful you have been , Wegg ; for when did I ever injure you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19590 len. 28]: ` There was also , ' Mr Wegg went on , in a meditative manner , ' a errand connection , in which I was much respected .
Parsing [sent. 19591 len. 23]: But I would not wish to be deemed covetous , and I would rather leave it to you , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 19592 len. 21]: ` Upon my word , I do n't know what to put it at , ' the Golden Dustman muttered .
Parsing [sent. 19593 len. 65]: ` There was likewise , ' resumed Wegg , ' a pair of trestles , for which alone a Irish person , who was deemed a judge of trestles , offered five and six -- a sum I would not hear of , for I should have lost by it-and there was a stool , a umbrella , a clothes-horse , and a tray .
Parsing [sent. 19594 len. 11]: But I leave it to you , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 19595 len. 22]: The Golden Dustman seeming to be engaged in some abstruse calculation , Mr Wegg assisted him with the following additional items .
Parsing [sent. 19596 len. 19]: ` There was , further , Miss Elizabeth , Master George , Aunt Jane , and Uncle Parker .
Parsing [sent. 19597 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19598 len. 42]: When a man thinks of the loss of such patronage as that ; when a man finds so fair a garden rooted up by pigs ; he finds it hard indeed , without going high , to work it into money .
Parsing [sent. 19599 len. 11]: But I leave it wholly to you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19600 len. 16]: Mr Sloppy still continued his singular , and on the surface his incomprehensible , movement .
Parsing [sent. 19601 len. 59]: ` Leading on has been mentioned , ' said Wegg with a melancholy air , ` and it 's not easy to say how far the tone of my mind may have been lowered by unwholesome reading on the subject of Misers , when you was leading me and others on to think you one yourself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19602 len. 19]: All I can say is , that I felt my tone of mind a lowering at the time .
Parsing [sent. 19603 len. 12]: And how can a man put a price upon his mind !
Parsing [sent. 19604 len. 8]: There was likewise a hat just now .
Parsing [sent. 19605 len. 12]: But I leave the ole to you , Mr Boffin . '
Parsing [sent. 19606 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 19607 len. 4]: said Mr Boffin .
Parsing [sent. 19608 len. 9]: ` Here 's a couple of pound . '
Parsing [sent. 19609 len. 15]: ` In justice to myself , I could n't take it , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19610 len. 57]: The words were but out of his mouth when John Harmon lifted his finger , and Sloppy , who was now close to Wegg , backed to Wegg 's back , stooped , grasped his coat collar behind with both hands , and deftly swung him up like the sack of flour or coals before mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 19611 len. 38]: A countenance of special discontent and amazement Mr Wegg exhibited in this position , with his buttons almost as prominently on view as Sloppy 's own , and with his wooden leg in a highly unaccommodating state .
Parsing [sent. 19612 len. 37]: But , not for many seconds was his countenance visible in the room ; for , Sloppy lightly trotted out with him and trotted down the staircase , Mr Venus attending to open the street door .
Parsing [sent. 19613 len. 57]: Mr Sloppy 's instructions had been to deposit his burden in the road ; but , a scavenger 's cart happening to stand unattended at the corner , with its little ladder planted against the wheel , Mr S. found it impossible to resist the temptation of shooting Mr Silas Wegg into the cart 's contents .
Parsing [sent. 19614 len. 16]: A somewhat difficult feat , achieved with great dexterity , and with a prodigious splash .
Parsing [sent. 19615 len. 53]: Chapter 15 WHAT WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAPS THAT WERE SET How Bradley Headstone had been racked and riven in his mind since the quiet evening when by the river-side he had risen , as it were , out of the ashes of the Bargeman , none but he could have told .
Parsing [sent. 19616 len. 15]: Not even he could have told , for such misery can only be felt .
Parsing [sent. 19617 len. 39]: First , he had to bear the combined weight of the knowledge of what he had done , of that haunting reproach that he might have done it so much better , and of the dread of discovery .
Parsing [sent. 19618 len. 17]: This was load enough to crush him , and he laboured under it day and night .
Parsing [sent. 19619 len. 18]: It was as heavy on him in his scanty sleep , as in his red-eyed waking hours .
Parsing [sent. 19620 len. 20]: It bore him down with a dread unchanging monotony , in which there was not a moment 's variety .
Parsing [sent. 19621 len. 41]: The overweighted beast of burden , or the overweighted slave , can for certain instants shift the physical load , and find some slight respite even in enforcing additional pain upon such a set of muscles or such a limb .
Parsing [sent. 19622 len. 27]: Not even that poor mockery of relief could the wretched man obtain , under the steady pressure of the infernal atmosphere into which he had entered .
Parsing [sent. 19623 len. 64]: Time went by , and no visible suspicion dogged him ; time went by , and in such public accounts of the attack as were renewed at intervals , he began to see Mr Lightwood -LRB- who acted as lawyer for the injured man -RRB- straying further from the fact , going wider of the issue , and evidently slackening in his zeal .
Parsing [sent. 19624 len. 18]: By degrees , a glimmering of the cause of this began to break on Bradley 's sight .
Parsing [sent. 19625 len. 60]: Then came the chance meeting with Mr Milvey at the railway station -LRB- where he often lingered in his leisure hours , as a place where any fresh news of his deed would be circulated , or any placard referring to it would be posted -RRB- , and then he saw in the light what he had brought about .
Parsing [sent. 19626 len. 27]: For , then he saw that through his desperate attempt to separate those two for ever , he had been made the means of uniting them .
Parsing [sent. 19627 len. 18]: That he had dipped his hands in blood , to mark himself a miserable fool and tool .
Parsing [sent. 19628 len. 23]: That Eugene Wrayburn , for his wife 's sake , set him aside and left him to crawl along his blasted course .
Parsing [sent. 19629 len. 44]: He thought of Fate , or Providence , or be the directing Power what it might , as having put a fraud upon him -- overreached him -- and in his impotent mad rage bit , and tore , and had his fit .
Parsing [sent. 19630 len. 51]: New assurance of the truth came upon him in the next few following days , when it was put forth how the wounded man had been married on his bed , and to whom , and how , though always in a dangerous condition , he was a shade better .
Parsing [sent. 19631 len. 27]: Bradley would far rather have been seized for his murder , than he would have read that passage , knowing himself spared , and knowing why .
Parsing [sent. 19632 len. 64]: But , not to be still further defrauded and overreached -- which he would be , if implicated by Riderhood , and punished by the law for his abject failure , as though it had been a success -- he kept close in his school during the day , ventured out warily at night , and went no more to the railway station .
Parsing [sent. 19633 len. 30]: He examined the advertisements in the newspapers for any sign that Riderhood acted on his hinted threat of so summoning him to renew their acquaintance , but found none .
Parsing [sent. 19634 len. 52]: Having paid him handsomely for the support and accommodation he had had at the Lock House , and knowing him to be a very ignorant man who could not write , he began to doubt whether he was to be feared at all , or whether they need ever meet again .
Parsing [sent. 19635 len. 44]: All this time , his mind was never off the rack , and his raging sense of having been made to fling himself across the chasm which divided those two , and bridge it over for their coming together , never cooled down .
Parsing [sent. 19636 len. 8]: This horrible condition brought on other fits .
Parsing [sent. 19637 len. 41]: He could not have said how many , or when ; but he saw in the faces of his pupils that they had seen him in that state , and that they were possessed by a dread of his relapsing .
Parsing [sent. 19638 len. 74]: One winter day when a slight fall of snow was feathering the sills and frames of the schoolroom windows , he stood at his black board , crayon in hand , about to commence with a class ; when , reading in the countenances of those boys that there was something wrong , and that they seemed in alarm for him , he turned his eyes to the door towards which they faced .
Parsing [sent. 19639 len. 31]: He then saw a slouching man of forbidding appearance standing in the midst of the school , with a bundle under his arm ; and saw that it was Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19640 len. 37]: He sat down on a stool which one of his boys put for him , and he had a passing knowledge that he was in danger of falling , and that his face was becoming distorted .
Parsing [sent. 19641 len. 21]: But , the fit went off for that time , and he wiped his mouth , and stood up again .
Parsing [sent. 19642 len. 7]: ` Beg your pardon , governor !
Parsing [sent. 19643 len. 5]: By your leave ! '
Parsing [sent. 19644 len. 14]: said Riderhood , knuckling his forehead , with a chuckle and a leer .
Parsing [sent. 19645 len. 8]: ` What place may this be ? '
Parsing [sent. 19646 len. 7]: ` This is a school . '
Parsing [sent. 19647 len. 10]: ` Where young folks learns wot 's right ? '
Parsing [sent. 19648 len. 6]: said Riderhood , gravely nodding .
Parsing [sent. 19649 len. 7]: ` Beg your pardon , governor !
Parsing [sent. 19650 len. 4]: By your leave !
Parsing [sent. 19651 len. 8]: But who teaches this school ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19652 len. 4]: I do . '
Parsing [sent. 19653 len. 13]: ` You 're the master , are you , learned governor ? '
Parsing [sent. 19654 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 19655 len. 6]: I am the master . '
Parsing [sent. 19656 len. 35]: ` And a lovely thing it must be , ' said Riderhood , ` fur to learn young folks wot 's right , and fur to know wot THEY know wot you do it .
Parsing [sent. 19657 len. 7]: Beg your pardon , learned governor !
Parsing [sent. 19658 len. 4]: By your leave !
Parsing [sent. 19659 len. 12]: -- That there black board ; wot 's it for ? '
Parsing [sent. 19660 len. 12]: ` It is for drawing on , or writing on . '
Parsing [sent. 19661 len. 6]: ` Is it though ! '
Parsing [sent. 19662 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19663 len. 13]: ` Who 'd have thought it , from the looks on it !
Parsing [sent. 19664 len. 16]: WOULD you be so kind as write your name upon it , learned governor ? '
Parsing [sent. 19665 len. 7]: -LRB- In a wheedling tone . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19666 len. 19]: Bradley hesitated for a moment ; but placed his usual signature , enlarged , upon the board . '
Parsing [sent. 19667 len. 25]: I ai n't a learned character myself , ' said Riderhood , surveying the class , ` but I do admire learning in others .
Parsing [sent. 19668 len. 21]: I should dearly like to hear these here young folks read that there name off , from the writing . '
Parsing [sent. 19669 len. 8]: The arms of the class went up .
Parsing [sent. 19670 len. 17]: At the miserable master 's nod , the shrill chorus arose : ` Bradley Headstone ! '
Parsing [sent. 19671 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 19672 len. 3]: cried Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19673 len. 7]: ` You do n't mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 19674 len. 2]: Headstone !
Parsing [sent. 19675 len. 8]: Why , that 's in a churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 19676 len. 6]: Hooroar for another turn ! '
Parsing [sent. 19677 len. 18]: Another tossing of arms , another nod , and another shrill chorus : ` Bradley Headstone ! '
Parsing [sent. 19678 len. 8]: ` I 've got it now ! '
Parsing [sent. 19679 len. 14]: said Riderhood , after attentively listening , and internally repeating : ` Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 19680 len. 3]: I see .
Parsing [sent. 19681 len. 16]: Chris ` en name , Bradley sim ` lar to Roger which is my own .
Parsing [sent. 19682 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 19683 len. 17]: Fam ` ly name , Headstone , sim ` lar to Riderhood which is my own .
Parsing [sent. 19684 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 19685 len. 3]: Shrill chorus .
Parsing [sent. 19686 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 19687 len. 49]: ` Might you be acquainted , learned governor , ' said Riderhood , ` with a person of about your own heighth and breadth , and wot ` ud pull down in a scale about your own weight , answering to a name sounding summat like Totherest ? '
Parsing [sent. 19688 len. 59]: With a desperation in him that made him perfectly quiet , though his jaw was heavily squared ; with his eyes upon Riderhood ; and with traces of quickened breathing in his nostrils ; the schoolmaster replied , in a suppressed voice , after a pause : ' I think I know the man you mean . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19689 len. 12]: I thought you knowed the man I mean , learned governor .
Parsing [sent. 19690 len. 6]: I want the man . '
Parsing [sent. 19691 len. 22]: With a half glance around him at his pupils , Bradley returned : ` Do you suppose he is here ? '
Parsing [sent. 19692 len. 52]: ` Begging your pardon , learned governor , and by your leave , ' said Riderhood , with a laugh , ` how could I suppose he 's here , when there 's nobody here but you , and me , and these young lambs wot you 're a learning on ?
Parsing [sent. 19693 len. 28]: But he is most excellent company , that man , and I want him to come and see me at my Lock , up the river . '
Parsing [sent. 19694 len. 8]: ` I 'll tell him so . '
Parsing [sent. 19695 len. 9]: 'D ` ye think he 'll come ? '
Parsing [sent. 19696 len. 4]: asked Riderhood . '
Parsing [sent. 19697 len. 7]: I am sure he will . '
Parsing [sent. 19698 len. 19]: ` Having got your word for him , ' said Riderhood , ' I shall count upon him .
Parsing [sent. 19699 len. 30]: P'raps you 'd so fur obleege me , learned governor , as tell him that if he do n't come precious soon , I 'll look him up . '
Parsing [sent. 19700 len. 7]: ` He shall know it . '
Parsing [sent. 19701 len. 3]: ` Thankee .
Parsing [sent. 19702 len. 44]: As I says a while ago , ' pursued Riderhood , changing his hoarse tone and leering round upon the class again , ` though not a learned character my own self , I do admire learning in others , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 19703 len. 31]: Being here and having met with your kind attention , Master , might I , afore I go , ask a question of these here young lambs of yourn ? '
Parsing [sent. 19704 len. 35]: ` If it is in the way of school , ' said Bradley , always sustaining his dark look at the other , and speaking in his suppressed voice , ` you may . '
Parsing [sent. 19705 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 19706 len. 9]: It 's in the way of school ! '
Parsing [sent. 19707 len. 3]: cried Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19708 len. 16]: ` I 'll pound it , Master , to be in the way of school .
Parsing [sent. 19709 len. 10]: Wot 's the diwisions of water , my lambs ?
Parsing [sent. 19710 len. 11]: Wot sorts of water is there on the land ? '
Parsing [sent. 19711 len. 14]: Shrill chorus : ` Seas , rivers , lakes , and ponds . '
Parsing [sent. 19712 len. 14]: ` Seas , rivers , lakes , and ponds , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19713 len. 10]: ` They 've got all the lot , Master !
Parsing [sent. 19714 len. 21]: Blowed if I should n't have left out lakes , never having clapped eyes upon one , to my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 19715 len. 9]: Seas , rivers , lakes , and ponds .
Parsing [sent. 19716 len. 20]: Wot is it , lambs , as they ketches in seas , rivers , lakes , and ponds ? '
Parsing [sent. 19717 len. 18]: Shrill chorus -LRB- with some contempt for the ease of the question -RRB- : ` Fish ! '
Parsing [sent. 19718 len. 5]: ` Good a-gin ! '
Parsing [sent. 19719 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19720 len. 18]: ` But wot else is it , my lambs , as they sometimes ketches in rivers ? '
Parsing [sent. 19721 len. 5]: Chorus at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 19722 len. 8]: One shrill voice : ` Weed ! '
Parsing [sent. 19723 len. 5]: ` Good agin ! '
Parsing [sent. 19724 len. 3]: cried Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19725 len. 8]: ` But it ai n't weed neither .
Parsing [sent. 19726 len. 8]: You 'll never guess , my dears .
Parsing [sent. 19727 len. 14]: Wot is it , besides fish , as they sometimes ketches in rivers ?
Parsing [sent. 19728 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19729 len. 5]: I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 19730 len. 8]: It 's suits o ' clothes . '
Parsing [sent. 19731 len. 5]: Bradley 's face changed .
Parsing [sent. 19732 len. 32]: ` Leastways , lambs , ' said Riderhood , observing him out of the corners of his eyes , ` that 's wot I my own self sometimes ketches in rivers .
Parsing [sent. 19733 len. 24]: For strike me blind , my lambs , if I did n't ketch in a river the wery bundle under my arm ! '
Parsing [sent. 19734 len. 20]: The class looked at the master , as if appealing from the irregular entrapment of this mode of examination .
Parsing [sent. 19735 len. 18]: The master looked at the examiner , as if he would have torn him to pieces . '
Parsing [sent. 19736 len. 36]: I ask your pardon , learned governor , ' said Riderhood , smearing his sleeve across his mouth as he laughed with a relish , ` tai n't fair to the lambs , I know .
Parsing [sent. 19737 len. 9]: It wos a bit of fun of mine .
Parsing [sent. 19738 len. 14]: But upon my soul I drawed this here bundle out of a river !
Parsing [sent. 19739 len. 9]: It 's a Bargeman 's suit of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 19740 len. 22]: You see , it had been sunk there by the man as wore it , and I got it up . '
Parsing [sent. 19741 len. 16]: ` How do you know it was sunk by the man who wore it ? '
Parsing [sent. 19742 len. 3]: asked Bradley .
Parsing [sent. 19743 len. 11]: 'Cause I see him do it , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19744 len. 6]: They looked at each other .
Parsing [sent. 19745 len. 22]: Bradley , slowly withdrawing his eyes , turned his face to the black board and slowly wiped his name out . '
Parsing [sent. 19746 len. 45]: A heap of thanks , Master , ' said Riderhood , ` for bestowing so much of your time , and of the lambses ' time , upon a man as has n't got no other recommendation to you than being a honest man .
Parsing [sent. 19747 len. 40]: Wishing to see at my Lock up the river , the person as we 've spoke of , and as you 've answered for , I takes my leave of the lambs and of their learned governor both . '
Parsing [sent. 19748 len. 47]: With those words , he slouched out of the school , leaving the master to get through his weary work as he might , and leaving the whispering pupils to observe the master 's face until he fell into the fit which had been long impending .
Parsing [sent. 19749 len. 12]: The next day but one was Saturday , and a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 19750 len. 15]: Bradley rose early , and set out on foot for Plashwater Weir Mill Lock .
Parsing [sent. 19751 len. 16]: He rose so early that it was not yet light when he began his journey .
Parsing [sent. 19752 len. 42]: Before extinguishing the candle by which he had dressed himself , he made a little parcel of his decent silver watch and its decent guard , and wrote inside the paper : ` Kindly take care of these for me . '
Parsing [sent. 19753 len. 26]: He then addressed the parcel to Miss Peecher , and left it on the most protected corner of the little seat in her little porch .
Parsing [sent. 19754 len. 17]: It was a cold hard easterly morning when he latched the garden gate and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 19755 len. 30]: The light snowfall which had feathered his schoolroom windows on the Thursday , still lingered in the air , and was falling white , while the wind blew black .
Parsing [sent. 19756 len. 28]: The tardy day did not appear until he had been on foot two hours , and had traversed a greater part of London from east to west .
Parsing [sent. 19757 len. 25]: Such breakfast as he had , he took at the comfortless public-house where he had parted from Riderhood on the occasion of their night-walk .
Parsing [sent. 19758 len. 26]: He took it , standing at the littered bar , and looked loweringly at a man who stood where Riderhood had stood that early morning .
Parsing [sent. 19759 len. 24]: He outwalked the short day , and was on the towing-path by the river , somewhat footsore , when the night closed in .
Parsing [sent. 19760 len. 21]: Still two or three miles short of the Lock , he slackened his pace then , but went steadily on .
Parsing [sent. 19761 len. 39]: The ground was now covered with snow , though thinly , and there were floating lumps of ice in the more exposed parts of the river , and broken sheets of ice under the shelter of the banks .
Parsing [sent. 19762 len. 33]: He took heed of nothing but the ice , the snow , and the distance , until he saw a light ahead , which he knew gleamed from the Lock House window .
Parsing [sent. 19763 len. 11]: It arrested his steps , and he looked all around .
Parsing [sent. 19764 len. 23]: The ice , and the snow , and he , and the one light , had absolute possession of the dreary scene .
Parsing [sent. 19765 len. 31]: In the distance before him , lay the place where he had struck the worse than useless blows that mocked him with Lizzie 's presence there as Eugene 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 19766 len. 29]: In the distance behind him , lay the place where the children with pointing arms had seemed to devote him to the demons in crying out his name .
Parsing [sent. 19767 len. 23]: Within there , where the light was , was the man who as to both distances could give him up to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 19768 len. 8]: To these limits had his world shrunk .
Parsing [sent. 19769 len. 25]: He mended his pace , keeping his eyes upon the light with a strange intensity , as if he were taking aim at it .
Parsing [sent. 19770 len. 25]: When he approached it so nearly as that it parted into rays , they seemed to fasten themselves to him and draw him on .
Parsing [sent. 19771 len. 31]: When he struck the door with his hand , his foot followed so quickly on his hand , that he was in the room before he was bidden to enter .
Parsing [sent. 19772 len. 13]: The light was the joint product of a fire and a candle .
Parsing [sent. 19773 len. 19]: Between the two , with his feet on the iron fender , sat Riderhood , pipe in mouth .
Parsing [sent. 19774 len. 13]: He looked up with a surly nod when his visitor came in .
Parsing [sent. 19775 len. 9]: His visitor looked down with a surly nod .
Parsing [sent. 19776 len. 19]: His outer clothing removed , the visitor then took a seat on the opposite side of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19777 len. 9]: ` Not a smoker , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 19778 len. 12]: said Riderhood , pushing a bottle to him across the table .
Parsing [sent. 19779 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 19780 len. 13]: They both lapsed into silence , with their eyes upon the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19781 len. 18]: ` You do n't need to be told I am here , ' said Bradley at length .
Parsing [sent. 19782 len. 7]: ` Who is to begin ? '
Parsing [sent. 19783 len. 20]: ` I 'll begin , ' said Riderhood , ` when I 've smoked this here pipe out . '
Parsing [sent. 19784 len. 20]: He finished it with great deliberation , knocked out the ashes on the hob , and put it by .
Parsing [sent. 19785 len. 22]: ` I 'll begin , ' he then repeated , ` Bradley Headstone , Master , if you wish it . '
Parsing [sent. 19786 len. 4]: ` Wish it ?
Parsing [sent. 19787 len. 11]: I wish to know what you want with me . '
Parsing [sent. 19788 len. 7]: ` And so you shall . '
Parsing [sent. 19789 len. 25]: Riderhood had looked hard at his hands and his pockets , apparently as a precautionary measure lest he should have any weapon about him .
Parsing [sent. 19790 len. 31]: But , he now leaned forward , turning the collar of his waistcoat with an inquisitive finger , and asked , ` Why , where 's your watch ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19791 len. 8]: I have left it behind . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19792 len. 4]: I want it .
Parsing [sent. 19793 len. 6]: But it can be fetched .
Parsing [sent. 19794 len. 9]: I 've took a fancy to it . '
Parsing [sent. 19795 len. 8]: Bradley answered with a contemptuous laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 19796 len. 22]: I want it , ' repeated Riderhood , in a louder voice , ` and I mean to have it . '
Parsing [sent. 19797 len. 13]: ` That is what you want of me , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 19798 len. 24]: ` No , ' said Riderhood , still louder ; ` it 's on ' y part of what I want of you .
Parsing [sent. 19799 len. 7]: I want money of you . '
Parsing [sent. 19800 len. 5]: ` Anything else ? '
Parsing [sent. 19801 len. 5]: ` Everythink else ! '
Parsing [sent. 19802 len. 11]: roared Riderhood , in a very loud and furious way .
Parsing [sent. 19803 len. 17]: ` Answer me like that , and I wo n't talk to you at all . '
Parsing [sent. 19804 len. 5]: Bradley looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 19805 len. 26]: ` Do n't so much as look at me like that , or I wo n't talk to you at all , ' vociferated Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19806 len. 35]: ` But , instead of talking , I 'll bring my hand down upon you with all its weight , ' heavily smiting the table with great force , ` and smash you ! '
Parsing [sent. 19807 len. 13]: ` Go on , ' said Bradley , after moistening his lips .
Parsing [sent. 19808 len. 3]: ` O !
Parsing [sent. 19809 len. 6]: I 'm a going on .
Parsing [sent. 19810 len. 24]: Do n't you fear but I 'll go on full-fast enough for you , and fur enough for you , without your telling .
Parsing [sent. 19811 len. 8]: Look here , Bradley Headstone , Master .
Parsing [sent. 19812 len. 33]: You might have split the T'other governor to chips and wedges , without my caring , except that I might have come upon you for a glass or so now and then .
Parsing [sent. 19813 len. 10]: Else why have to do with you at all ?
Parsing [sent. 19814 len. 41]: But when you copied my clothes , and when you copied my neckhankercher , and when you shook blood upon me after you had done the trick , you did wot I 'll be paid for and paid heavy for .
Parsing [sent. 19815 len. 24]: If it come to be throw 'd upon you , you was to be ready to throw it upon me , was you ?
Parsing [sent. 19816 len. 17]: Where else but in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a man dressed according as described ?
Parsing [sent. 19817 len. 24]: Where else but in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a man as had had words with him coming through in his boat ?
Parsing [sent. 19818 len. 35]: Look at the Lock-keeper in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock , in them same answering clothes and with that same answering red neckhankercher , and see whether his clothes happens to be bloody or not .
Parsing [sent. 19819 len. 9]: Yes , they do happen to be bloody .
Parsing [sent. 19820 len. 7]: Ah , you sly devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 19821 len. 12]: Bradley , very white , sat looking at him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 19822 len. 58]: ` But two could play at your game , ' said Riderhood , snapping his fingers at him half a dozen times , ` and I played it long ago ; long afore you tried your clumsy hand at it ; in days when you had n't begun croaking your lecters or what not in your school .
Parsing [sent. 19823 len. 10]: I know to a figure how you done it .
Parsing [sent. 19824 len. 19]: Where you stole away , I could steal away arter you , and do it knowinger than you .
Parsing [sent. 19825 len. 25]: I know how you come away from London in your own clothes , and where you changed your clothes , and hid your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 19826 len. 41]: I see you with my own eyes take your own clothes from their hiding-place among them felled trees , and take a dip in the river to account for your dressing yourself , to any one as might come by .
Parsing [sent. 19827 len. 16]: I see you rise up Bradley Headstone , Master , where you sat down Bargeman .
Parsing [sent. 19828 len. 12]: I see you pitch your Bargeman 's bundle into the river .
Parsing [sent. 19829 len. 11]: I hooked your Bargeman 's bundle out of the river .
Parsing [sent. 19830 len. 35]: I 've got your Bargeman 's clothes , tore this way and that way with the scuffle , stained green with the grass , and spattered all over with what bust from the blows .
Parsing [sent. 19831 len. 11]: I 've got them , and I 've got you .
Parsing [sent. 19832 len. 26]: I do n't care a curse for the T'other governor , alive or dead , but I care a many curses for my own self .
Parsing [sent. 19833 len. 45]: And as you laid your plots agin me and was a sly devil agin me , I 'll be paid for it -- I 'll be paid for it -- I 'll be paid for it -- till I 've drained you dry ! '
Parsing [sent. 19834 len. 18]: Bradley looked at the fire , with a working face , and was silent for a while .
Parsing [sent. 19835 len. 31]: At last he said , with what seemed an inconsistent composure of voice and feature : ` You ca n't get blood out of a stone , Riderhood . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19836 len. 11]: I can get money out of a schoolmaster though . '
Parsing [sent. 19837 len. 14]: ` You ca n't get out of me what is not in me .
Parsing [sent. 19838 len. 12]: You ca n't wrest from me what I have not got .
Parsing [sent. 19839 len. 7]: Mine is but a poor calling .
Parsing [sent. 19840 len. 12]: You have had more than two guineas from me , already .
Parsing [sent. 19841 len. 26]: Do you know how long it has taken me -LRB- allowing for a long and arduous training -RRB- to earn such a sum ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19842 len. 11]: I do n't know , nor I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 19843 len. 7]: Yours is a ` spectable calling .
Parsing [sent. 19844 len. 40]: To save your ` spectability , it 's worth your while to pawn every article of clothes you 've got , sell every stick in your house , and beg and borrow every penny you can get trusted with .
Parsing [sent. 19845 len. 14]: When you 've done that and handed over , I 'll leave you .
Parsing [sent. 19846 len. 4]: Not afore . '
Parsing [sent. 19847 len. 13]: ` How do you mean , you 'll leave me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19848 len. 20]: I mean as I 'll keep you company , wherever you go , when you go away from here .
Parsing [sent. 19849 len. 8]: Let the Lock take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 19850 len. 14]: I 'll take care of you , once I 've got you . '
Parsing [sent. 19851 len. 7]: Bradley again looked at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19852 len. 20]: Eyeing him aside , Riderhood took up his pipe , refilled it , lighted it , and sat smoking .
Parsing [sent. 19853 len. 26]: Bradley leaned his elbows on his knees , and his head upon his hands , and looked at the fire with a most intent abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 19854 len. 30]: ` Riderhood , ' he said , raising himself in his chair , after a long silence , and drawing out his purse and putting it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 19855 len. 44]: ` Say I part with this , which is all the money I have ; say I let you have my watch ; say that every quarter , when I draw my salary , I pay you a certain portion of it . '
Parsing [sent. 19856 len. 18]: ` Say nothink of the sort , ' retorted Riderhood , shaking his head as he smoked .
Parsing [sent. 19857 len. 16]: ` You 've got away once , and I wo n't run the chance agin .
Parsing [sent. 19858 len. 37]: I 've had trouble enough to find you , and should n't have found you , if I had n't seen you slipping along the street overnight , and watched you till you was safe housed .
Parsing [sent. 19859 len. 13]: I 'll have one settlement with you for good and all . '
Parsing [sent. 19860 len. 14]: ` Riderhood , I am a man who has lived a retired life .
Parsing [sent. 19861 len. 7]: I have no resources beyond myself .
Parsing [sent. 19862 len. 7]: I have absolutely no friends . '
Parsing [sent. 19863 len. 10]: ` That 's a lie , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19864 len. 28]: ` You 've got one friend as I knows of ; one as is good for a Savings-Bank book , or I 'm a blue monkey ! '
Parsing [sent. 19865 len. 33]: Bradley 's face darkened , and his hand slowly closed on the purse and drew it back , as he sat listening for what the other should go on to say . '
Parsing [sent. 19866 len. 16]: I went into the wrong shop , fust , last Thursday , ' said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19867 len. 11]: ` Found myself among the young ladies , by George !
Parsing [sent. 19868 len. 10]: Over the young ladies , I see a Missis .
Parsing [sent. 19869 len. 24]: That Missis is sweet enough upon you , Master , to sell herself up , slap , to get you out of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 19870 len. 7]: Make her do it then . '
Parsing [sent. 19871 len. 42]: Bradley stared at him so very suddenly that Riderhood , not quite knowing how to take it , affected to be occupied with the encircling smoke from his pipe ; fanning it away with his hand , and blowing it off .
Parsing [sent. 19872 len. 11]: ` You spoke to the mistress , did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19873 len. 20]: inquired Bradley , with that former composure of voice and feature that seemed inconsistent , and with averted eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19874 len. 3]: ` Poof !
Parsing [sent. 19875 len. 14]: Yes , ' said Riderhood , withdrawing his attention from the smoke . '
Parsing [sent. 19876 len. 5]: I spoke to her .
Parsing [sent. 19877 len. 8]: I did n't say much to her .
Parsing [sent. 19878 len. 42]: She was put in a fluster by my dropping in among the young ladies -LRB- I never did set up for a lady 's man -RRB- , and she took me into her parlour to hope as there was nothink wrong .
Parsing [sent. 19879 len. 11]: I tells her , `` O no , nothink wrong .
Parsing [sent. 19880 len. 9]: The master 's my wery good friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 19881 len. 16]: But I see how the land laid , and that she was comfortable off . '
Parsing [sent. 19882 len. 24]: Bradley put the purse in his pocket , grasped his left wrist with his right hand , and sat rigidly contemplating the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19883 len. 47]: ` She could n't live more handy to you than she does , ' said Riderhood , ` and when I goes home with you -LRB- as of course I am a going -RRB- , I recommend you to clean her out without loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 19884 len. 15]: You can marry her , arter you and me have come to a settlement .
Parsing [sent. 19885 len. 28]: She 's nice-looking , and I know you ca n't be keeping company with no one else , having been so lately disapinted in another quarter . '
Parsing [sent. 19886 len. 11]: Not one other word did Bradley utter all that night .
Parsing [sent. 19887 len. 16]: Not once did he change his attitude , or loosen his hold upon his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 19888 len. 64]: Rigid before the fire , as if it were a charmed flame that was turning him old , he sat , with the dark lines deepening in his face , its stare becoming more and more haggard , its surface turning whiter and whiter as if it were being overspread with ashes , and the very texture and colour of his hair degenerating .
Parsing [sent. 19889 len. 16]: Not until the late daylight made the window transparent , did this decaying statue move .
Parsing [sent. 19890 len. 13]: Then it slowly arose , and sat in the window looking out .
Parsing [sent. 19891 len. 8]: Riderhood had kept his chair all night .
Parsing [sent. 19892 len. 55]: In the earlier part of the night he had muttered twice or thrice that it was bitter cold ; or that the fire burnt fast , when he got up to mend it ; but , as he could elicit from his companion neither sound nor movement , he had afterwards held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 19893 len. 24]: He was making some disorderly preparations for coffee , when Bradley came from the window and put on his outer coat and hat .
Parsing [sent. 19894 len. 16]: ` Had n't us better have a bit o ' breakfast afore we start ? '
Parsing [sent. 19895 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19896 len. 14]: ` It ai n't good to freeze a empty stomach , Master . '
Parsing [sent. 19897 len. 17]: Without a sign to show that he heard , Bradley walked out of the Lock House .
Parsing [sent. 19898 len. 25]: Catching up from the table a piece of bread , and taking his Bargeman 's bundle under his arm , Riderhood immediately followed him .
Parsing [sent. 19899 len. 5]: Bradley turned towards London .
Parsing [sent. 19900 len. 11]: Riderhood caught him up , and walked at his side .
Parsing [sent. 19901 len. 17]: The two men trudged on , side by side , in silence , full three miles .
Parsing [sent. 19902 len. 9]: Suddenly , Bradley turned to retrace his course .
Parsing [sent. 19903 len. 14]: Instantly , Riderhood turned likewise , and they went back side by side .
Parsing [sent. 19904 len. 6]: Bradley re-entered the Lock House .
Parsing [sent. 19905 len. 4]: So did Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19906 len. 7]: Bradley sat down in the window .
Parsing [sent. 19907 len. 7]: Riderhood warmed himself at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19908 len. 25]: After an hour or more , Bradley abruptly got up again , and again went out , but this time turned the other way .
Parsing [sent. 19909 len. 20]: Riderhood was close after him , caught him up in a few paces , and walked at his side .
Parsing [sent. 19910 len. 22]: This time , as before , when he found his attendant not to be shaken off , Bradley suddenly turned back .
Parsing [sent. 19911 len. 13]: This time , as before , Riderhood turned back along with him .
Parsing [sent. 19912 len. 40]: But , not this time , as before , did they go into the Lock House , for Bradley came to a stand on the snowcovered turf by the Lock , looking up the river and down the river .
Parsing [sent. 19913 len. 18]: Navigation was impeded by the frost , and the scene was a mere white and yellow desert .
Parsing [sent. 19914 len. 15]: ` Come , come , Master , ' urged Riderhood , at his side .
Parsing [sent. 19915 len. 7]: ` This is a dry game .
Parsing [sent. 19916 len. 8]: And where 's the good of it ?
Parsing [sent. 19917 len. 15]: You ca n't get rid of me , except by coming to a settlement .
Parsing [sent. 19918 len. 12]: I am a going along with you wherever you go . '
Parsing [sent. 19919 len. 20]: Without a word of reply , Bradley passed quickly from him over the wooden bridge on the lock gates .
Parsing [sent. 19920 len. 22]: ` Why , there 's even less sense in this move than t ` other , ' said Riderhood , following .
Parsing [sent. 19921 len. 18]: ` The Weir 's there , and you 'll have to come back , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 19922 len. 28]: Without taking the least notice , Bradley leaned his body against a post , in a resting attitude , and there rested with his eyes cast down .
Parsing [sent. 19923 len. 25]: ` Being brought here , ' said Riderhood , gruffly , ` I 'll turn it to some use by changing my gates . '
Parsing [sent. 19924 len. 25]: With a rattle and a rush of water , he then swung-to the lock gates that were standing open , before opening the others .
Parsing [sent. 19925 len. 14]: So , both sets of gates were , for the moment , closed .
Parsing [sent. 19926 len. 38]: ` You 'd better by far be reasonable , Bradley Headstone , Master , ' said Riderhood , passing him , ` or I 'll drain you all the dryer for it , when we do settle .
Parsing [sent. 19927 len. 3]: -- Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19928 len. 4]: Would you ! '
Parsing [sent. 19929 len. 8]: Bradley had caught him round the body .
Parsing [sent. 19930 len. 10]: He seemed to be girdled with an iron ring .
Parsing [sent. 19931 len. 18]: They were on the brink of the Lock , about midway between the two sets of gates .
Parsing [sent. 19932 len. 5]: ` Let go ! '
Parsing [sent. 19933 len. 20]: said Riderhood , ` or I 'll get my knife out and slash you wherever I can cut you .
Parsing [sent. 19934 len. 4]: Let go ! '
Parsing [sent. 19935 len. 7]: Bradley was drawing to the Lock-edge .
Parsing [sent. 19936 len. 7]: Riderhood was drawing away from it .
Parsing [sent. 19937 len. 15]: It was a strong grapple , and a fierce struggle , arm and leg .
Parsing [sent. 19938 len. 18]: Bradley got him round , with his back to the Lock , and still worked him backward .
Parsing [sent. 19939 len. 5]: ` Let go ! '
Parsing [sent. 19940 len. 3]: said Riderhood .
Parsing [sent. 19941 len. 3]: ` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 19942 len. 6]: What are you trying at ?
Parsing [sent. 19943 len. 6]: You ca n't drown Me .
Parsing [sent. 19944 len. 18]: Ai n't I told you that the man as has come through drowning can never be drowned ?
Parsing [sent. 19945 len. 8]: I ca n't be drowned . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19946 len. 5]: I can be ! '
Parsing [sent. 19947 len. 11]: returned Bradley , in a desperate , clenched voice . '
Parsing [sent. 19948 len. 6]: I am resolved to be .
Parsing [sent. 19949 len. 13]: I 'll hold you living , and I 'll hold you dead .
Parsing [sent. 19950 len. 4]: Come down ! '
Parsing [sent. 19951 len. 16]: Riderhood went over into the smooth pit , backward , and Bradley Headstone upon him .
Parsing [sent. 19952 len. 36]: When the two were found , lying under the ooze and scum behind one of the rotting gates , Riderhood 's hold had relaxed , probably in falling , and his eyes were staring upward .
Parsing [sent. 19953 len. 22]: But , he was girdled still with Bradley 's iron ring , and the rivets of the iron ring held tight .
Parsing [sent. 19954 len. 56]: Chapter 16 PERSONS AND THINGS IN GENERAL Mr and Mrs John Harmon 's first delightful occupation was , to set all matters right that had strayed in any way wrong , or that might , could , would , or should , have strayed in any way wrong , while their name was in abeyance .
Parsing [sent. 19955 len. 75]: In tracing out affairs for which John 's fictitious death was to be considered in any way responsible , they used a very broad and free construction ; regarding , for instance , the dolls ' dressmaker as having a claim on their protection , because of her association with Mrs Eugene Wrayburn , and because of Mrs Eugene 's old association , in her turn , with the dark side of the story .
Parsing [sent. 19956 len. 24]: It followed that the old man , Riah , as a good and serviceable friend to both , was not to be disclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 19957 len. 18]: Nor even Mr Inspector , as having been trepanned into an industrious hunt on a false scent .
Parsing [sent. 19958 len. 95]: It may be remarked , in connexion with that worthy officer , that a rumour shortly afterwards pervaded the Force , to the effect that he had confided to Miss Abbey Potterson , over a jug of mellow flip in the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters , that he ` did n't stand to lose a farthing ' through Mr Harmon 's coming to life , but was quite as well satisfied as if that gentleman had been barbarously murdered , and he -LRB- Mr Inspector -RRB- had pocketed the government reward .
Parsing [sent. 19959 len. 82]: In all their arrangements of such nature , Mr and Mrs John Harmon derived much assistance from their eminent solicitor , Mr Mortimer Lightwood ; who laid about him professionally with such unwonted despatch and intention , that a piece of work was vigorously pursued as soon as cut out ; whereby Young Blight was acted on as by that transatlantic dram which is poetically named An EyeOpener , and found himself staring at real clients instead of out of window .
Parsing [sent. 19960 len. 74]: The accessibility of Riah proving very useful as to a few hints towards the disentanglement of Eugene 's affairs , Lightwood applied himself with infinite zest to attacking and harassing Mr Fledgeby : who , discovering himself in danger of being blown into the air by certain explosive transactions in which he had been engaged , and having been sufficiently flayed under his beating , came to a parley and asked for quarter .
Parsing [sent. 19961 len. 16]: The harmless Twemlow profited by the conditions entered into , though he little thought it .
Parsing [sent. 19962 len. 70]: Mr Riah unaccountably melted ; waited in person on him over the stable yard in Duke Street , St James 's , no longer ravening but mild , to inform him that payment of interest as heretofore , but henceforth at Mr Lightwood 's offices , would appease his Jewish rancour ; and departed with the secret that Mr John Harmon had advanced the money and become the creditor .
Parsing [sent. 19963 len. 44]: Thus , was the sublime Snigsworth 's wrath averted , and thus did he snort no larger amount of moral grandeur at the Corinthian column in the print over the fireplace , than was normally in his -LRB- and the British -RRB- constitution .
Parsing [sent. 19964 len. 22]: Mrs Wilfer 's first visit to the Mendicant 's bride at the new abode of Mendicancy , was a grand event .
Parsing [sent. 19965 len. 49]: Pa had been sent for into the City , on the very day of taking possession , and had been stunned with astonishment , and brought-to , and led about the house by one ear , to behold its various treasures , and had been enraptured and enchanted .
Parsing [sent. 19966 len. 30]: Pa had also been appointed Secretary , and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to Chicksey , Veneering , and Stobbles , for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 19967 len. 16]: But Ma came later , and came , as was her due , in state .
Parsing [sent. 19968 len. 37]: The carriage was sent for Ma , who entered it with a bearing worthy of the occasion , accompanied , rather than supported , by Miss Lavinia , who altogether declined to recognize the maternal majesty .
Parsing [sent. 19969 len. 6]: Mr George Sampson meekly followed .
Parsing [sent. 19970 len. 37]: He was received in the vehicle , by Mrs Wilfer , as if admitted to the honour of assisting at a funeral in the family , and she then issued the order , ` Onward ! '
Parsing [sent. 19971 len. 7]: to the Mendicant 's menial . '
Parsing [sent. 19972 len. 32]: I wish to goodness , Ma , ' said Lavvy , throwing herself back among the cushions , with her arms crossed , ` that you 'd loll a little . '
Parsing [sent. 19973 len. 4]: ` How ! '
Parsing [sent. 19974 len. 4]: repeated Mrs Wilfer .
Parsing [sent. 19975 len. 4]: ` Loll ! '
Parsing [sent. 19976 len. 7]: ` Yes , Ma . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19977 len. 18]: I hope , ' said the impressive lady , ' I am incapable of it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19978 len. 9]: I am sure you look so , Ma .
Parsing [sent. 19979 len. 31]: But why one should go out to dine with one 's own daughter or sister , as if one 's under-petticoat was a blackboard , I do NOT understand . '
Parsing [sent. 19980 len. 33]: ` Neither do I understand , ' retorted Mrs Wilfer , with deep scorn , ` how a young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have indulged .
Parsing [sent. 19981 len. 6]: I blush for you . '
Parsing [sent. 19982 len. 34]: ` Thank you , Ma , ' said Lavvy , yawning , ` but I can do it for myself , I am obliged to you , when there 's any occasion . '
Parsing [sent. 19983 len. 44]: Here , Mr Sampson , with the view of establishing harmony , which he never under any circumstances succeeded in doing , said with an agreeable smile : ` After all , you know , ma'am , we know it 's there . '
Parsing [sent. 19984 len. 9]: And immediately felt that he had committed himself .
Parsing [sent. 19985 len. 8]: ` We know it 's there ! '
Parsing [sent. 19986 len. 6]: said Mrs Wilfer , glaring .
Parsing [sent. 19987 len. 36]: ` Really , George , ' remonstrated Miss Lavinia , ' I must say that I do n't understand your allusions , and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal . '
Parsing [sent. 19988 len. 5]: ` Go it ! '
Parsing [sent. 19989 len. 16]: cried Mr Sampson , becoming , on the shortest notice , a prey to despair .
Parsing [sent. 19990 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 19991 len. 8]: Go it , Miss Lavinia Wilfer ! '
Parsing [sent. 19992 len. 21]: ` What you may mean , George Sampson , by your omnibus-driving expressions , I can not pretend to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 19993 len. 18]: Neither , ' said Miss Lavinia , ` Mr George Sampson , do I wish to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 19994 len. 46]: It is enough for me to know in my own heart that I am not going to -- ' having imprudently got into a sentence without providing a way out of it , Miss Lavinia was constrained to close with ` going to it ' .
Parsing [sent. 19995 len. 15]: A weak conclusion which , however , derived some appearance of strength from disdain .
Parsing [sent. 19996 len. 5]: ` Oh yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 19997 len. 7]: cried Mr Sampson , with bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 19998 len. 6]: ` Thus it ever is .
Parsing [sent. 19999 len. 45]: I never -- ' ` If you mean to say , ' Miss Lavvy cut him short , that you never brought up a young gazelle , you may save yourself the trouble , because nobody in this carriage supposes that you ever did .
Parsing [sent. 20000 len. 6]: We know you better . '
Parsing [sent. 20001 len. 9]: -LRB- As if this were a home-thrust . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20002 len. 21]: ` Lavinia , ' returned Mr Sampson , in a dismal vein , I did not mean to say so .
Parsing [sent. 20003 len. 30]: What I did mean to say , was , that I never expected to retain my favoured place in this family , after Fortune shed her beams upon it .
Parsing [sent. 20004 len. 32]: Why do you take me , ' said Mr Sampson , ` to the glittering halls with which I can never compete , and then taunt me with my moderate salary ?
Parsing [sent. 20005 len. 4]: Is it generous ?
Parsing [sent. 20006 len. 5]: Is it kind ? '
Parsing [sent. 20007 len. 25]: The stately lady , Mrs Wilfer , perceiving her opportunity of delivering a few remarks from the throne , here took up the altercation .
Parsing [sent. 20008 len. 25]: ` Mr Sampson , ' she began , ' I can not permit you to misrepresent the intentions of a child of mine . '
Parsing [sent. 20009 len. 14]: ` Let him alone , Ma , ' Miss Lavvy interposed with haughtiness .
Parsing [sent. 20010 len. 13]: ` It is indifferent to me what he says or does . '
Parsing [sent. 20011 len. 19]: ` Nay , Lavinia , ' quoth Mrs Wilfer , ` this touches the blood of the family .
Parsing [sent. 20012 len. 51]: If Mr George Sampson attributes , even to my youngest daughter -- ' -LRB- ' I do n't see why you should use the word `` even '' , Ma , ' Miss Lavvy interposed , ` because I am quite as important as any of the others . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20013 len. 4]: ` Peace ! '
Parsing [sent. 20014 len. 7]: said Mrs Wilfer , solemnly . '
Parsing [sent. 20015 len. 29]: I repeat , if Mr George Sampson attributes , to my youngest daughter , grovelling motives , he attributes them equally to the mother of my youngest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 20016 len. 23]: That mother repudiates them , and demands of Mr George Sampson , as a youth of honour , what he WOULD have ?
Parsing [sent. 20017 len. 37]: I may be mistaken -- nothing is more likely -- but Mr George Sampson , ' proceeded Mrs Wilfer , majestically waving her gloves , ` appears to me to be seated in a first-class equipage .
Parsing [sent. 20018 len. 26]: Mr George Sampson appears to me to be on his way , by his own admission , to a residence that may be termed Palatial .
Parsing [sent. 20019 len. 38]: Mr George Sampson appears to me to be invited to participate in the -- shall I say the -- Elevation which has descended on the family with which he is ambitious , shall I say to Mingle ?
Parsing [sent. 20020 len. 13]: Whence , then , this tone on Mr Sampson 's part ? '
Parsing [sent. 20021 len. 33]: ` It is only , ma'am , ' Mr Sampson explained , in exceedingly low spirits , ` because , in a pecuniary sense , I am painfully conscious of my unworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 20022 len. 6]: Lavinia is now highly connected .
Parsing [sent. 20023 len. 15]: Can I hope that she will still remain the same Lavinia as of old ?
Parsing [sent. 20024 len. 25]: And is it not pardonable if I feel sensitive , when I see a disposition on her part to take me up short ? '
Parsing [sent. 20025 len. 42]: ` If you are not satisfied with your position , sir , ' observed Miss Lavinia , with much politeness , ` we can set you down at any turning you may please to indicate to my sister 's coachman . '
Parsing [sent. 20026 len. 17]: ` Dearest Lavinia , ' urged Mr Sampson , pathetically , ' I adore you . '
Parsing [sent. 20027 len. 29]: ` Then if you ca n't do it in a more agreeable manner , ' returned the young lady , ' I wish you would n't . ' '
Parsing [sent. 20028 len. 38]: I also , ' pursued Mr Sampson , ` respect you , ma'am , to an extent which must ever be below your merits , I am well aware , but still up to an uncommon mark .
Parsing [sent. 20029 len. 51]: Bear with a wretch , Lavinia , bear with a wretch , ma'am , who feels the noble sacrifices you make for him , but is goaded almost to madness , ' Mr Sampson slapped his forehead , ` when he thinks of competing with the rich and influential . '
Parsing [sent. 20030 len. 30]: ` When you have to compete with the rich and influential , it will probably be mentioned to you , ' said Miss Lavvy , ` in good time .
Parsing [sent. 20031 len. 13]: At least , it will if the case is MY case . '
Parsing [sent. 20032 len. 28]: Mr Sampson immediately expressed his fervent Opinion that this was ` more than human ' , and was brought upon his knees at Miss Lavinia 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 20033 len. 58]: It was the crowning addition indispensable to the full enjoyment of both mother and daughter , to bear Mr Sampson , a grateful captive , into the glittering halls he had mentioned , and to parade him through the same , at once a living witness of their glory , and a bright instance of their condescension .
Parsing [sent. 20034 len. 34]: Ascending the staircase , Miss Lavinia permitted him to walk at her side , with the air of saying : ` Notwithstanding all these surroundings , I am yours as yet , George .
Parsing [sent. 20035 len. 17]: How long it may last is another question , but I am yours as yet . '
Parsing [sent. 20036 len. 53]: She also benignantly intimated to him , aloud , the nature of the objects upon which he looked , and to which he was unaccustomed : as , ` Exotics , George , ' ` An aviary , George , ' ` An ormolu clock , George , ' and the like .
Parsing [sent. 20037 len. 37]: While , through the whole of the decorations , Mrs Wilfer led the way with the bearing of a Savage Chief , who would feel himself compromised by manifesting the slightest token of surprise or admiration .
Parsing [sent. 20038 len. 24]: Indeed , the bearing of this impressive woman , throughout the day , was a pattern to all impressive women under similar circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 20039 len. 39]: She renewed the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin , as if Mr and Mrs Boffin had said of her what she had said of them , and as if Time alone could quite wear her injury out .
Parsing [sent. 20040 len. 36]: She regarded every servant who approached her , as her sworn enemy , expressly intending to offer her affronts with the dishes , and to pour forth outrages on her moral feelings from the decanters .
Parsing [sent. 20041 len. 36]: She sat erect at table , on the right hand of her son-in-law , as half suspecting poison in the viands , and as bearing up with native force of character against other deadly ambushes .
Parsing [sent. 20042 len. 27]: Her carriage towards Bella was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position , whom she had met in society a few years ago .
Parsing [sent. 20043 len. 80]: Even when , slightly thawing under the influence of sparkling champagne , she related to her son-in-law some passages of domestic interest concerning her papa , she infused into the narrative such Arctic suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to mankind , since her papa 's days , and also of that gentleman 's having been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race , as struck cold to the very soles of the feet of the hearers .
Parsing [sent. 20044 len. 30]: The Inexhaustible being produced , staring , and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly , no sooner beheld her , than it was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable .
Parsing [sent. 20045 len. 40]: When she took her leave at last , it would have been hard to say whether it was with the air of going to the scaffold herself , or of leaving the inmates of the house for immediate execution .
Parsing [sent. 20046 len. 67]: Yet , John Harmon enjoyed it all merrily , and told his wife , when he and she were alone , that her natural ways had never seemed so dearly natural as beside this foil , and that although he did not dispute her being her father 's daughter , he should ever remain stedfast in the faith that she could not be her mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 20047 len. 13]: This visit was , as has been said , a grand event .
Parsing [sent. 20048 len. 35]: Another event , not grand but deemed in the house a special one , occurred at about the same period ; and this was , the first interview between Mr Sloppy and Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20049 len. 36]: The dolls ' dressmaker , being at work for the Inexhaustible upon a full-dressed doll some two sizes larger than that young person , Mr Sloppy undertook to call for it , and did so .
Parsing [sent. 20050 len. 18]: ` Come in , sir , ' said Miss Wren , who was working at her bench .
Parsing [sent. 20051 len. 8]: ` And who may you be ? '
Parsing [sent. 20052 len. 9]: Mr Sloppy introduced himself by name and buttons .
Parsing [sent. 20053 len. 5]: ` Oh indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 20054 len. 3]: cried Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 20055 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 20056 len. 9]: I have been looking forward to knowing you .
Parsing [sent. 20057 len. 8]: I heard of your distinguishing yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 20058 len. 7]: ` Did you , Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 20059 len. 4]: grinned Sloppy . '
Parsing [sent. 20060 len. 18]: I am sure I am glad to hear it , but I do n't know how . '
Parsing [sent. 20061 len. 12]: ` Pitching somebody into a mud-cart , ' said Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20062 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 20063 len. 4]: That way ! '
Parsing [sent. 20064 len. 3]: cried Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 20065 len. 13]: ` Yes , Miss. ' And threw back his head and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 20066 len. 5]: ` Bless us ! '
Parsing [sent. 20067 len. 8]: exclaimed Miss Wren , with a start .
Parsing [sent. 20068 len. 28]: ` Do n't open your mouth as wide as that , young man , or it 'll catch so , and not shut again some day . '
Parsing [sent. 20069 len. 20]: Mr Sloppy opened it , if possible , wider , and kept it open until his laugh was out .
Parsing [sent. 20070 len. 32]: ` Why , you 're like the giant , ' said Miss Wren , ` when he came home in the land of Beanstalk , and wanted Jack for supper . '
Parsing [sent. 20071 len. 8]: ` Was he good-looking , Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 20072 len. 3]: asked Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 20073 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20074 len. 4]: ` Ugly . '
Parsing [sent. 20075 len. 48]: Her visitor glanced round the room -- which had many comforts in it now , that had not been in it before -- and said : ` This is a pretty place , Miss. ' ` Glad you think so , sir , ' returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20076 len. 10]: ` And what do you think of Me ? '
Parsing [sent. 20077 len. 22]: The honesty of Mr Sloppy being severely taxed by the question , he twisted a button , grinned , and faltered .
Parsing [sent. 20078 len. 6]: ` Out with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 20079 len. 9]: said Miss Wren , with an arch look .
Parsing [sent. 20080 len. 12]: ` Do n't you think me a queer little comicality ? '
Parsing [sent. 20081 len. 17]: In shaking her head at him after asking the question , she shook her hair down .
Parsing [sent. 20082 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 20083 len. 9]: cried Sloppy , in a burst of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 20084 len. 11]: ` What a lot , and what a colour ! '
Parsing [sent. 20085 len. 15]: Miss Wren , with her usual expressive hitch , went on with her work .
Parsing [sent. 20086 len. 18]: But , left her hair as it was ; not displeased by the effect it had made .
Parsing [sent. 20087 len. 14]: ` You do n't live here alone ; do you , Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 20088 len. 3]: asked Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 20089 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Miss Wren , with a chop .
Parsing [sent. 20090 len. 9]: ` Live here with my fairy godmother . '
Parsing [sent. 20091 len. 22]: ` With ; ' Mr Sloppy could n't make it out ; ` with who did you say , Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 20092 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 20093 len. 7]: replied Miss Wren , more seriously .
Parsing [sent. 20094 len. 6]: ` With my second father .
Parsing [sent. 20095 len. 10]: Or with my first , for that matter . '
Parsing [sent. 20096 len. 11]: And she shook her head , and drew a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 20097 len. 25]: ` If you had known a poor child I used to have here , ' she added , ` you 'd have understood me .
Parsing [sent. 20098 len. 10]: But you did n't , and you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 20099 len. 5]: All the better ! '
Parsing [sent. 20100 len. 42]: ` You must have been taught a long time , ' said Sloppy , glancing at the array of dolls in hand , ` before you came to work so neatly , Miss , and with such a pretty taste . '
Parsing [sent. 20101 len. 11]: ` Never was taught a stitch , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 20102 len. 8]: returned the dress-maker , tossing her head .
Parsing [sent. 20103 len. 15]: ` Just gobbled and gobbled , till I found out how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 20104 len. 10]: Badly enough at first , but better now . '
Parsing [sent. 20105 len. 43]: ` And here have I , ' said Sloppy , in something of a self-reproachful tone , ` been a learning and a learning , and here has Mr Boffin been a paying and a paying , ever so long ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 20106 len. 19]: I have heard what your trade is , ' observed Miss Wren ; ` it 's cabinet-making . '
Parsing [sent. 20107 len. 4]: Mr Sloppy nodded .
Parsing [sent. 20108 len. 12]: ` Now that the Mounds is done with , it is .
Parsing [sent. 20109 len. 8]: I 'll tell you what , Miss. .
Parsing [sent. 20110 len. 9]: I should like to make you something . '
Parsing [sent. 20111 len. 4]: ` Much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 20112 len. 5]: But what ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 20113 len. 29]: I could make you , ' said Sloppy , surveying the room , ' I could make you a handy set of nests to lay the dolls in .
Parsing [sent. 20114 len. 22]: Or I could make you a handy little set of drawers , to keep your silks and threads and scraps in .
Parsing [sent. 20115 len. 23]: Or I could turn you a rare handle for that crutch-stick , if it belongs to him you call your father . '
Parsing [sent. 20116 len. 23]: ` It belongs to me , ' returned the little creature , with a quick flush of her face and neck . '
Parsing [sent. 20117 len. 5]: I am lame . '
Parsing [sent. 20118 len. 23]: Poor Sloppy flushed too , for there was an instinctive delicacy behind his buttons , and his own hand had struck it .
Parsing [sent. 20119 len. 19]: He said , perhaps , the best thing in the way of amends that could be said . '
Parsing [sent. 20120 len. 22]: I am very glad it 's yours , because I 'd rather ornament it for you than for any one else .
Parsing [sent. 20121 len. 8]: Please may I look at it ? '
Parsing [sent. 20122 len. 19]: Miss Wren was in the act of handing it to him over her bench , when she paused .
Parsing [sent. 20123 len. 16]: ` But you had better see me use it , ' she said , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 20124 len. 6]: ` This is the way .
Parsing [sent. 20125 len. 6]: Hoppetty , Kicketty , Pep-peg-peg .
Parsing [sent. 20126 len. 7]: Not pretty ; is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 20127 len. 17]: ` It seems to me that you hardly want it at all , ' said Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 20128 len. 33]: The little dressmaker sat down again , and gave it into his hand , saying , with that better look upon her , and with a smile : ` Thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 20129 len. 44]: ` And as concerning the nests and the drawers , ' said Sloppy , after measuring the handle on his sleeve , and softly standing the stick aside against the wall , ` why , it would be a real pleasure to me .
Parsing [sent. 20130 len. 54]: I 've heerd tell that you can sing most beautiful ; and I should be better paid with a song than with any money , for I always loved the likes of that , and often giv ' Mrs Higden and Johnny a comic song myself , with `` Spoken '' in it .
Parsing [sent. 20131 len. 12]: Though that 's not your sort , I 'll wager . '
Parsing [sent. 20132 len. 21]: ` You are a very kind young man , ' returned the dressmaker ; ' a really kind young man .
Parsing [sent. 20133 len. 5]: I accept your offer .
Parsing [sent. 20134 len. 29]: -- I suppose He wo n't mind , ' she added as an afterthought , shrugging her shoulders ; ` and if he does , he may ! '
Parsing [sent. 20135 len. 15]: ` Meaning him that you call your father , Miss , ' asked Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 20136 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' replied Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20137 len. 8]: ` Him , Him , Him ! '
Parsing [sent. 20138 len. 8]: ` Him , him , him ? '
Parsing [sent. 20139 len. 11]: repeated Sloppy ; staring about , as if for Him .
Parsing [sent. 20140 len. 16]: ` Him who is coming to court and marry me , ' returned Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20141 len. 10]: ` Dear me , how slow you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 20142 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 20143 len. 3]: HIM ! '
Parsing [sent. 20144 len. 3]: said Sloppy .
Parsing [sent. 20145 len. 11]: And seemed to turn thoughtful and a little troubled . '
Parsing [sent. 20146 len. 6]: I never thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 20147 len. 8]: When is he coming , Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 20148 len. 6]: ` What a question ! '
Parsing [sent. 20149 len. 4]: cried Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20150 len. 7]: ` How should I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 20151 len. 10]: ` Where is he coming from , Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 20152 len. 11]: ` Why , good gracious , how can I tell !
Parsing [sent. 20153 len. 23]: He is coming from somewhere or other , I suppose , and he is coming some day or other , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 20154 len. 13]: I do n't know any more about him , at present . '
Parsing [sent. 20155 len. 22]: This tickled Mr Sloppy as an extraordinarily good joke , and he threw back his head and laughed with measureless enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 20156 len. 20]: At the sight of him laughing in that absurd way , the dolls ' dressmaker laughed very heartily indeed .
Parsing [sent. 20157 len. 10]: So they both laughed , till they were tired .
Parsing [sent. 20158 len. 8]: ` There , there , there ! '
Parsing [sent. 20159 len. 4]: said Miss Wren .
Parsing [sent. 20160 len. 23]: ` For goodness ' sake , stop , Giant , or I shall be swallowed up alive , before I know it .
Parsing [sent. 20161 len. 16]: And to this minute you have n't said what you 've come for . ' '
Parsing [sent. 20162 len. 14]: I have come for little Miss Harmonses doll , ' said Sloppy . '
Parsing [sent. 20163 len. 22]: I thought as much , ' remarked Miss Wren , ` and here is little Miss Harmonses doll waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 20164 len. 25]: She 's folded up in silver paper , you see , as if she was wrapped from head to foot in new Bank notes .
Parsing [sent. 20165 len. 17]: Take care of her , and there 's my hand , and thank you again . '
Parsing [sent. 20166 len. 39]: ` I 'll take more care of her than if she was a gold image , ' said Sloppy , ` and there 's both MY hands , Miss , and I 'll soon come back again . '
Parsing [sent. 20167 len. 29]: But , the greatest event of all , in the new life of Mr and Mrs John Harmon , was a visit from Mr and Mrs Eugene Wrayburn .
Parsing [sent. 20168 len. 26]: Sadly wan and worn was the once gallant Eugene , and walked resting on his wife 's arm , and leaning heavily upon a stick .
Parsing [sent. 20169 len. 27]: But , he was daily growing stronger and better , and it was declared by the medical attendants that he might not be much disfigured by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 20170 len. 56]: It was a grand event , indeed , when Mr and Mrs Eugene Wrayburn came to stay at Mr and Mrs John Harmon 's house : where , by the way , Mr and Mrs Boffin -LRB- exquisitely happy , and daily cruising about , to look at shops , -RRB- were likewise staying indefinitely .
Parsing [sent. 20171 len. 31]: To Mr Eugene Wrayburn , in confidence , did Mrs John Harmon impart what she had known of the state of his wife 's affections , in his reckless time .
Parsing [sent. 20172 len. 30]: And to Mrs John Harmon , in confidence , did Mr Eugene Wrayburn impart that , please God , she should see how his wife had changed him ! '
Parsing [sent. 20173 len. 18]: I make no protestations , ' said Eugene ; ' -- who does , who means them !
Parsing [sent. 20174 len. 8]: -- I have made a resolution . '
Parsing [sent. 20175 len. 57]: ` But would you believe , Bella , ' interposed his wife , coming to resume her nurse 's place at his side , for he never got on well without her : ` that on our wedding day he told me he almost thought the best thing he could do , was to die ? '
Parsing [sent. 20176 len. 29]: ` As I did n't do it , Lizzie , ' said Eugene , ` I 'll do that better thing you suggested -- for your sake . '
Parsing [sent. 20177 len. 32]: That same afternoon , Eugene lying on his couch in his own room upstairs , Lightwood came to chat with him , while Bella took his wife out for a ride .
Parsing [sent. 20178 len. 22]: ` Nothing short of force will make her go , Eugene had said ; so , Bella had playfully forced her .
Parsing [sent. 20179 len. 40]: ` Dear old fellow , ' Eugene began with Lightwood , reaching up his hand , ` you could n't have come at a better time , for my mind is full , and I want to empty it .
Parsing [sent. 20180 len. 13]: First , of my present , before I touch upon my future .
Parsing [sent. 20181 len. 63]: M. R. F. , who is a much younger cavalier than I , and a professed admirer of beauty , was so affable as to remark the other day -LRB- he paid us a visit of two days up the river there , and much objected to the accommodation of the hotel -RRB- , that Lizzie ought to have her portrait painted .
Parsing [sent. 20182 len. 18]: Which , coming from M. R. F. , may be considered equivalent to a melodramatic blessing . '
Parsing [sent. 20183 len. 14]: ` You are getting well , ' said Mortimer , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 20184 len. 12]: ` Really , ' said Eugene , ' I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 20185 len. 46]: When M. R. F. said that , and followed it up by rolling the claret -LRB- for which he called , and I paid -RRB- , in his mouth , and saying , `` My dear son , why do you drink this trash ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20186 len. 21]: it was tantamount in him -- to a paternal benediction on our union , accompanied with a gush of tears .
Parsing [sent. 20187 len. 16]: The coolness of M. R. F. is not to be measured by ordinary standards . '
Parsing [sent. 20188 len. 8]: ` True enough , ' said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 20189 len. 39]: ` That 's all , ' pursued Eugene , ` that I shall ever hear from M. R. F. on the subject , and he will continue to saunter through the world with his hat on one side .
Parsing [sent. 20190 len. 20]: My marriage being thus solemnly recognized at the family altar , I have no further trouble on that score .
Parsing [sent. 20191 len. 69]: Next , you really have done wonders for me , Mortimer , in easing my money-perplexities , and with such a guardian and steward beside me , as the preserver of my life -LRB- I am hardly strong yet , you see , for I am not man enough to refer to her without a trembling voice -- she is so inexpressibly dear to me , Mortimer ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20192 len. 18]: , the little that I can call my own will be more than it ever has been .
Parsing [sent. 20193 len. 17]: It need be more , for you know what it always has been in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 20194 len. 3]: Nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 20195 len. 10]: ` Worse than nothing , I fancy , Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 20196 len. 23]: My own small income -LRB- I devoutly wish that my grandfather had left it to the Ocean rather than to me ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20197 len. 18]: has been an effective Something , in the way of preventing me from turning to at Anything .
Parsing [sent. 20198 len. 11]: And I think yours has been much the same . '
Parsing [sent. 20199 len. 12]: ` There spake the voice of wisdom , ' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 20200 len. 6]: ` We are shepherds both .
Parsing [sent. 20201 len. 12]: In turning to at last , we turn to in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 20202 len. 15]: Let us say no more of that , for a few years to come .
Parsing [sent. 20203 len. 31]: Now , I have had an idea , Mortimer , of taking myself and my wife to one of the colonies , and working at my vocation there . ' '
Parsing [sent. 20204 len. 16]: I should be lost without you , Eugene ; but you may be right . '
Parsing [sent. 20205 len. 9]: ` No , ' said Eugene , emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 20206 len. 4]: ` Not right .
Parsing [sent. 20207 len. 3]: Wrong ! '
Parsing [sent. 20208 len. 20]: He said it with such a lively -- almost angry -- flash , that Mortimer showed himself greatly surprised .
Parsing [sent. 20209 len. 12]: ` You think this thumped head of mine is excited ? '
Parsing [sent. 20210 len. 16]: Eugene went on , with a high look ; ` not so , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 20211 len. 18]: I can say to you of the healthful music of my pulse what Hamlet said of his .
Parsing [sent. 20212 len. 15]: My blood is up , but wholesomely up , when I think of it .
Parsing [sent. 20213 len. 3]: Tell me !
Parsing [sent. 20214 len. 21]: Shall I turn coward to Lizzie , and sneak away with her , as if I were ashamed of her !
Parsing [sent. 20215 len. 28]: Where would your friend 's part in this world be , Mortimer , if she had turned coward to him , and on immeasurably better occasion ? '
Parsing [sent. 20216 len. 9]: ` Honourable and stanch , ' said Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 20217 len. 15]: ` And yet , Eugene -- ' ` And yet what , Mortimer ? '
Parsing [sent. 20218 len. 36]: ` And yet , are you sure that you might not feel -LRB- for her sake , I say for her sake -RRB- any slight coldness towards her on the part of -- Society ? '
Parsing [sent. 20219 len. 3]: ` O !
Parsing [sent. 20220 len. 16]: You and I may well stumble at the word , ' returned Eugene , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 20221 len. 8]: ` Do we mean our Tippins ? '
Parsing [sent. 20222 len. 12]: ` Perhaps we do , ' said Mortimer , laughing also .
Parsing [sent. 20223 len. 7]: ` Faith , we DO ! '
Parsing [sent. 20224 len. 7]: returned Eugene , with great animation .
Parsing [sent. 20225 len. 16]: ` We may hide behind the bush and beat about it , but we DO !
Parsing [sent. 20226 len. 44]: Now , my wife is something nearer to my heart , Mortimer , than Tippins is , and I owe her a little more than I owe to Tippins , and I am rather prouder of her than I ever was of Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 20227 len. 25]: Therefore , I will fight it out to the last gasp , with her and for her , here , in the open field .
Parsing [sent. 20228 len. 72]: When I hide her , or strike for her , faint-heartedly , in a hole or a corner , do you whom I love next best upon earth , tell me what I shall most righteously deserve to be told : -- that she would have done well to turn me over with her foot that night when I lay bleeding to death , and spat in my dastard face . '
Parsing [sent. 20229 len. 32]: The glow that shone upon him as he spoke the words , so irradiated his features that he looked , for the time , as though he had never been mutilated .
Parsing [sent. 20230 len. 22]: His friend responded as Eugene would have had him respond , and they discoursed of the future until Lizzie came back .
Parsing [sent. 20231 len. 40]: After resuming her place at his side , and tenderly touching his hands and his head , she said : ` Eugene , dear , you made me go out , but I ought to have stayed with you .
Parsing [sent. 20232 len. 12]: You are more flushed than you have been for many days .
Parsing [sent. 20233 len. 7]: What have you been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 20234 len. 17]: ` Nothing , ' replied Eugene , ` but looking forward to your coming back . '
Parsing [sent. 20235 len. 18]: ` And talking to Mr Lightwood , ' said Lizzie , turning to him with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 20236 len. 13]: ` But it can not have been Society that disturbed you . '
Parsing [sent. 20237 len. 8]: ` Faith , my dear love ! '
Parsing [sent. 20238 len. 26]: retorted Eugene , in his old airy manner , as he laughed and kissed her , ' I rather think it WAS Society though ! '
Parsing [sent. 20239 len. 40]: The word ran so much in Mortimer Lightwood 's thoughts as he went home to the Temple that night , that he resolved to take a look at Society , which he had not seen for a considerable period .
Parsing [sent. 20240 len. 42]: Chapter 17 THE VOICE OF SOCIETY Behoves Mortimer Lightwood , therefore , to answer a dinner card from Mr and Mrs Veneering requesting the honour , and to signify that Mr Mortimer Lightwood will be happy to have the other honour .
Parsing [sent. 20241 len. 50]: The Veneerings have been , as usual , indefatigably dealing dinner cards to Society , and whoever desires to take a hand had best be quick about it , for it is written in the Books of the Insolvent Fates that Veneering shall make a resounding smash next week .
Parsing [sent. 20242 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 20243 len. 146]: Having found out the clue to that great mystery how people can contrive to live beyond their means , and having over-jobbed his jobberies as legislator deputed to the Universe by the pure electors of Pocket-Breaches , it shall come to pass next week that Veneering will accept the Chiltern Hundreds , that the legal gentleman in Britannia 's confidence will again accept the PocketBreaches Thousands , and that the Veneerings will retire to Calais , there to live on Mrs Veneering 's diamonds -LRB- in which Mr Veneering , as a good husband , has from time to time invested considerable sums -RRB- , and to relate to Neptune and others , how that , before Veneering retired from Parliament , the House of Commons was composed of himself and the six hundred and fifty-seven dearest and oldest friends he had in the world .
Parsing [sent. 20244 len. 66]: It shall likewise come to pass , at as nearly as possible the same period , that Society will discover that it always did despise Veneering , and distrust Veneering , and that when it went to Veneering 's to dinner it always had misgivings -- though very secretly at the time , it would seem , and in a perfectly private and confidential manner .
Parsing [sent. 20245 len. 44]: The next week 's books of the Insolvent Fates , however , being not yet opened , there is the usual rush to the Veneerings , of the people who go to their house to dine with one another and not with them .
Parsing [sent. 20246 len. 5]: There is Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 20247 len. 10]: There are Podsnap the Great , and Mrs Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 20248 len. 4]: There is Twemlow .
Parsing [sent. 20249 len. 9]: There are Buffer , Boots , and Brewer .
Parsing [sent. 20250 len. 14]: There is the Contractor , who is Providence to five hundred thousand men .
Parsing [sent. 20251 len. 12]: There is the Chairman , travelling three thousand miles per week .
Parsing [sent. 20252 len. 29]: There is the brilliant genius who turned the shares into that remarkably exact sum of three hundred and seventy five thousand pounds , no shillings , and nopence .
Parsing [sent. 20253 len. 40]: To whom , add Mortimer Lightwood , coming in among them with a reassumption of his old languid air , founded on Eugene , and belonging to the days when he told the story of the man from Somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 20254 len. 16]: That fresh fairy , Tippins , all but screams at sight of her false swain .
Parsing [sent. 20255 len. 24]: She summons the deserter to her with her fan ; but the deserter , predetermined not to come , talks Britain with Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 20256 len. 30]: Podsnap always talks Britain , and talks as if he were a sort of Private Watchman employed , in the British interests , against the rest of the world .
Parsing [sent. 20257 len. 35]: ` We know what Russia means , sir , ' says Podsnap ; ` we know what France wants ; we see what America is up to ; but we know what England is .
Parsing [sent. 20258 len. 7]: That 's enough for us . '
Parsing [sent. 20259 len. 27]: However , when dinner is served , and Lightwood drops into his old place over against Lady Tippins , she can be fended off no longer .
Parsing [sent. 20260 len. 23]: ` Long banished Robinson Crusoe , ' says the charmer , exchanging salutations , ` how did you leave the Island ? '
Parsing [sent. 20261 len. 8]: ` Thank you , ' says Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 20262 len. 12]: ` It made no complaint of being in pain anywhere . '
Parsing [sent. 20263 len. 11]: ` Say , how did you leave the savages ? '
Parsing [sent. 20264 len. 4]: asks Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 20265 len. 15]: ` They were becoming civilized when I left Juan Fernandez , ' says Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 20266 len. 15]: ` At least they were eating one another , which looked like it . '
Parsing [sent. 20267 len. 4]: ` Tormentor ! '
Parsing [sent. 20268 len. 6]: returns the dear young creature .
Parsing [sent. 20269 len. 14]: ` You know what I mean , and you trifle with my impatience .
Parsing [sent. 20270 len. 11]: Tell me something , immediately , about the married pair .
Parsing [sent. 20271 len. 7]: You were at the wedding . '
Parsing [sent. 20272 len. 7]: ` Was I , by-the-by ? '
Parsing [sent. 20273 len. 10]: Mortimer pretends , at great leisure , to consider .
Parsing [sent. 20274 len. 6]: ` So I was ! '
Parsing [sent. 20275 len. 7]: ` How was the bride dressed ?
Parsing [sent. 20276 len. 5]: In rowing costume ? '
Parsing [sent. 20277 len. 10]: Mortimer looks gloomy , and declines to answer . '
Parsing [sent. 20278 len. 30]: I hope she steered herself , skiffed herself , paddled herself , larboarded and starboarded herself , or whatever the technical term may be , to the ceremony ? '
Parsing [sent. 20279 len. 5]: proceeds the playful Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 20280 len. 15]: ` However she got to it , she graced it , ' says Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 20281 len. 13]: Lady Tippins with a skittish little scream , attracts the general attention .
Parsing [sent. 20282 len. 4]: ` Graced it !
Parsing [sent. 20283 len. 10]: Take care of me if I faint , Veneering .
Parsing [sent. 20284 len. 15]: He means to tell us , that a horrid female waterman is graceful ! '
Parsing [sent. 20285 len. 4]: ` Pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 20286 len. 14]: I mean to tell you nothing , Lady Tippins , ' replies Lightwood .
Parsing [sent. 20287 len. 16]: And keeps his word by eating his dinner with a show of the utmost indifference .
Parsing [sent. 20288 len. 19]: ` You shall not escape me in this way , you morose backwoodsman , ' retorts Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 20289 len. 22]: ` You shall not evade the question , to screen your friend Eugene , who has made this exhibition of himself .
Parsing [sent. 20290 len. 21]: The knowledge shall be brought home to you that such a ridiculous affair is condemned by the voice of Society .
Parsing [sent. 20291 len. 22]: My dear Mrs Veneering , do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole House on the subject . '
Parsing [sent. 20292 len. 12]: Mrs Veneering , always charmed by this rattling sylph , cries .
Parsing [sent. 20293 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 20294 len. 13]: Do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole House !
Parsing [sent. 20295 len. 4]: So delicious ! '
Parsing [sent. 20296 len. 26]: Veneering says , ` As many as are of that opinion , say Aye , -- contrary , No -- the Ayes have it . '
Parsing [sent. 20297 len. 10]: But nobody takes the slightest notice of his joke .
Parsing [sent. 20298 len. 10]: ` Now , I am Chairwoman of Committees ! '
Parsing [sent. 20299 len. 4]: cries Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 20300 len. 8]: -LRB- ` What spirits she has ! '
Parsing [sent. 20301 len. 11]: exclaims Mrs Veneering ; to whom likewise nobody attends . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20302 len. 31]: ` And this , ' pursues the sprightly one , ` is a Committee of the whole House to what-you-may-call-it -- elicit , I suppose -- the voice of Society .
Parsing [sent. 20303 len. 43]: The question before the Committee is , whether a young man of very fair family , good appearance , and some talent , makes a fool or a wise man of himself in marrying a female waterman , turned factory girl . '
Parsing [sent. 20304 len. 15]: ` Hardly so , I think , ' the stubborn Mortimer strikes in . '
Parsing [sent. 20305 len. 77]: I take the question to be , whether such a man as you describe , Lady Tippins , does right or wrong in marrying a brave woman -LRB- I say nothing of her beauty -RRB- , who has saved his life , with a wonderful energy and address ; whom he knows to be virtuous , and possessed of remarkable qualities ; whom he has long admired , and who is deeply attached to him . '
Parsing [sent. 20306 len. 31]: ` But , excuse me , ' says Podsnap , with his temper and his shirt-collar about equally rumpled ; ` was this young woman ever a female waterman ? '
Parsing [sent. 20307 len. 3]: ` Never .
Parsing [sent. 20308 len. 15]: But she sometimes rowed in a boat with her father , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 20309 len. 7]: General sensation against the young woman .
Parsing [sent. 20310 len. 5]: Brewer shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 20311 len. 5]: Boots shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 20312 len. 5]: Buffer shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 20313 len. 32]: ` And now , Mr Lightwood , was she ever , ' pursues Podsnap , with his indignation rising high into those hair-brushes of his , ' a factory girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 20314 len. 3]: ` Never .
Parsing [sent. 20315 len. 14]: But she had some employment in a paper mill , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 20316 len. 4]: General sensation repeated .
Parsing [sent. 20317 len. 8]: Brewer says , ` Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 20318 len. 8]: Boots says , ` Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 20319 len. 8]: Buffer says , ` Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 20320 len. 9]: All , in a rumbling tone of protest .
Parsing [sent. 20321 len. 57]: ` Then all I have to say is , ' returns Podsnap , putting the thing away with his right arm , ` that my gorge rises against such a marriage -- that it offends and disgusts me -- that it makes me sick -- and that I desire to know no more about it . '
Parsing [sent. 20322 len. 23]: -LRB- ` Now I wonder , ' thinks Mortimer , amused , ` whether YOU are the Voice of Society ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20323 len. 8]: ` Hear , hear , hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 20324 len. 4]: cries Lady Tippins .
Parsing [sent. 20325 len. 20]: ` Your opinion of this MESALLIANCE , honourable colleagues of the honourable member who has just sat down ? '
Parsing [sent. 20326 len. 55]: Mrs Podsnap is of opinion that in these matters there should be an equality of station and fortune , and that a man accustomed to Society should look out for a woman accustomed to Society and capable of bearing her part in it with -- an ease and elegance of carriage -- that . '
Parsing [sent. 20327 len. 29]: Mrs Podsnap stops there , delicately intimating that every such man should look out for a fine woman as nearly resembling herself as he may hope to discover .
Parsing [sent. 20328 len. 19]: -LRB- ` Now I wonder , ' thinks Mortimer , ` whether you are the Voice ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20329 len. 13]: Lady Tippins next canvasses the Contractor , of five hundred thousand power .
Parsing [sent. 20330 len. 39]: It appears to this potentate , that what the man in question should have done , would have been , to buy the young woman a boat and a small annuity , and set her up for herself .
Parsing [sent. 20331 len. 10]: These things are a question of beefsteaks and porter .
Parsing [sent. 20332 len. 8]: You buy the young woman a boat .
Parsing [sent. 20333 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 20334 len. 13]: You buy her , at the same time , a small annuity .
Parsing [sent. 20335 len. 26]: You speak of that annuity in pounds sterling , but it is in reality so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of porter .
Parsing [sent. 20336 len. 12]: On the one hand , the young woman has the boat .
Parsing [sent. 20337 len. 19]: On the other hand , she consumes so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of porter .
Parsing [sent. 20338 len. 15]: Those beefsteaks and that porter are the fuel to that young woman 's engine .
Parsing [sent. 20339 len. 40]: She derives therefrom a certain amount of power to row the boat ; that power will produce so much money ; you add that to the small annuity ; and thus you get at the young woman 's income .
Parsing [sent. 20340 len. 16]: That -LRB- it seems to the Contractor -RRB- is the way of looking at it .
Parsing [sent. 20341 len. 22]: The fair enslaver having fallen into one of her gentle sleeps during the last exposition , nobody likes to wake her .
Parsing [sent. 20342 len. 17]: Fortunately , she comes awake of herself , and puts the question to the Wandering Chairman .
Parsing [sent. 20343 len. 15]: The Wanderer can only speak of the case as if it were his own .
Parsing [sent. 20344 len. 53]: If such a young woman as the young woman described , had saved his own life , he would have been very much obliged to her , would n't have married her , and would have got her a berth in an Electric Telegraph Office , where young women answer very well .
Parsing [sent. 20345 len. 21]: What does the Genius of the three hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds , no shillings , and nopence , think ?
Parsing [sent. 20346 len. 18]: He ca n't say what he thinks , without asking : Had the young woman any money ?
Parsing [sent. 20347 len. 17]: ` No , ' says Lightwood , in an uncompromising voice ; ` no money . '
Parsing [sent. 20348 len. 16]: ` Madness and moonshine , ' is then the compressed verdict of the Genius . '
Parsing [sent. 20349 len. 10]: A man may do anything lawful , for money .
Parsing [sent. 20350 len. 5]: But for no money !
Parsing [sent. 20351 len. 4]: -- Bosh ! '
Parsing [sent. 20352 len. 5]: What does Boots say ?
Parsing [sent. 20353 len. 13]: Boots says he would n't have done it under twenty thousand pound .
Parsing [sent. 20354 len. 5]: What does Brewer say ?
Parsing [sent. 20355 len. 6]: Brewer says what Boots says .
Parsing [sent. 20356 len. 5]: What does Buffer say ?
Parsing [sent. 20357 len. 14]: Buffer says he knows a man who married a bathing-woman , and bolted .
Parsing [sent. 20358 len. 45]: Lady Tippins fancies she has collected the suffrages of the whole Committee -LRB- nobody dreaming of asking the Veneerings for their opinion -RRB- , when , looking round the table through her eyeglass , she perceives Mr Twemlow with his hand to his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 20359 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 20360 len. 4]: My Twemlow forgotten !
Parsing [sent. 20361 len. 3]: My dearest !
Parsing [sent. 20362 len. 3]: My own !
Parsing [sent. 20363 len. 5]: What is his vote ?
Parsing [sent. 20364 len. 22]: Twemlow has the air of being ill at ease , as he takes his hand from his forehead and replies . '
Parsing [sent. 20365 len. 25]: I am disposed to think , ' says he , ` that this is a question of the feelings of a gentleman . ' '
Parsing [sent. 20366 len. 16]: A gentleman can have no feelings who contracts such a marriage , ' flushes Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 20367 len. 24]: ` Pardon me , sir , ' says Twemlow , rather less mildly than usual , ' I do n't agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 20368 len. 37]: If this gentleman 's feelings of gratitude , of respect , of admiration , and affection , induced him -LRB- as I presume they did -RRB- to marry this lady -- ' ` This lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 20369 len. 3]: echoes Podsnap .
Parsing [sent. 20370 len. 25]: ` Sir , ' returns Twemlow , with his wristbands bristling a little , ` YOU repeat the word ; I repeat the word .
Parsing [sent. 20371 len. 3]: This lady .
Parsing [sent. 20372 len. 14]: What else would you call her , if the gentleman were present ? '
Parsing [sent. 20373 len. 23]: This being something in the nature of a poser for Podsnap , he merely waves it away with a speechless wave . '
Parsing [sent. 20374 len. 44]: I say , ' resumes Twemlow , ` if such feelings on the part of this gentleman , induced this gentleman to marry this lady , I think he is the greater gentleman for the action , and makes her the greater lady .
Parsing [sent. 20375 len. 31]: I beg to say , that when I use the word , gentleman , I use it in the sense in which the degree may be attained by any man .
Parsing [sent. 20376 len. 30]: The feelings of a gentleman I hold sacred , and I confess I am not comfortable when they are made the subject of sport or general discussion . ' '
Parsing [sent. 20377 len. 22]: I should like to know , ' sneers Podsnap , ` whether your noble relation would be of your opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 20378 len. 12]: ` Mr Podsnap , ' retorts Twemlow , ` permit me .
Parsing [sent. 20379 len. 10]: He might be , or he might not be .
Parsing [sent. 20380 len. 5]: I can not say .
Parsing [sent. 20381 len. 27]: But , I could not allow even him to dictate to me on a point of great delicacy , on which I feel very strongly . '
Parsing [sent. 20382 len. 30]: Somehow , a canopy of wet blanket seems to descend upon the company , and Lady Tippins was never known to turn so very greedy or so very cross .
Parsing [sent. 20383 len. 5]: Mortimer Lightwood alone brightens .
Parsing [sent. 20384 len. 27]: He has been asking himself , as to every other member of the Committee in turn , ' I wonder whether you are the Voice ! '
Parsing [sent. 20385 len. 26]: But he does not ask himself the question after Twemlow has spoken , and he glances in Twemlow 's direction as if he were grateful .
Parsing [sent. 20386 len. 61]: When the company disperse -- by which time Mr and Mrs Veneering have had quite as much as they want of the honour , and the guests have had quite as much as THEY want of the other honour -- Mortimer sees Twemlow home , shakes hands with him cordially at parting , and fares to the Temple , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 20387 len. 60]: POSTSCRIPT IN LIEU OF PREFACE When I devised this story , I foresaw the likelihood that a class of readers and commentators would suppose that I was at great pains to conceal exactly what I was at great pains to suggest : namely , that Mr John Harmon was not slain , and that Mr John Rokesmith was he .
Parsing [sent. 20388 len. 76]: Pleasing myself with the idea that the supposition might in part arise out of some ingenuity in the story , and thinking it worth while , in the interests of art , to hint to an audience that an artist -LRB- of whatever denomination -RRB- may perhaps be trusted to know what he is about in his vocation , if they will concede him a little patience , I was not alarmed by the anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 20389 len. 49]: To keep for a long time unsuspected , yet always working itself out , another purpose originating in that leading incident , and turning it to a pleasant and useful account at last , was at once the most interesting and the most difficult part of my design .
Parsing [sent. 20390 len. 71]: Its difficulty was much enhanced by the mode of publication ; for , it would be very unreasonable to expect that many readers , pursuing a story in portions from month to month through nineteen months , will , until they have it before them complete , perceive the relations of its finer threads to the whole pattern which is always before the eyes of the story-weaver at his loom .
Parsing [sent. 20391 len. 41]: Yet , that I hold the advantages of the mode of publication to outweigh its disadvantages , may be easily believed of one who revived it in the Pickwick Papers after long disuse , and has pursued it ever since .
Parsing [sent. 20392 len. 24]: There is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction , what are the commonest experiences in fact .
Parsing [sent. 20393 len. 88]: Therefore , I note here , though it may not be at all necessary , that there are hundreds of Will Cases -LRB- as they are called -RRB- , far more remarkable than that fancied in this book ; and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made , changed , contradicted , hidden , forgotten , left cancelled , and left uncancelled , each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr Harmon of Harmony Jail .
Parsing [sent. 20394 len. 38]: In my social experiences since Mrs Betty Higden came upon the scene and left it , I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the Poor Law .
Parsing [sent. 20395 len. 37]: Mr friend Mr Bounderby could never see any difference between leaving the Coketown ` hands ' exactly as they were , and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons .
Parsing [sent. 20396 len. 36]: Idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance , and I have been called upon to admit that I would give Poor Law relief to anybody , anywhere , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 20397 len. 76]: Putting this nonsense aside , I have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties ; the one , contending that there are no deserving Poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather , to the mercies of some Relieving Officers and some Union Houses ; the other , admitting that there are such Poor , but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do .
Parsing [sent. 20398 len. 31]: The records in our newspapers , the late exposure by THE LANCET , and the common sense and senses of common people , furnish too abundant evidence against both defences .
Parsing [sent. 20399 len. 21]: But , that my view of the Poor Law may not be mistaken or misrepresented , I will state it .
Parsing [sent. 20400 len. 35]: I believe there has been in England , since the days of the STUARTS , no law so often infamously administered , no law so often openly violated , no law habitually so ill-supervised .
Parsing [sent. 20401 len. 43]: In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution , that shock the Public and disgrace the country , the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity -- and known language could say no more of their lawlessness .
Parsing [sent. 20402 len. 44]: On Friday the Ninth of June in the present year , Mr and Mrs Boffin -LRB- in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr and Mrs Lammle at breakfast -RRB- were on the South Eastern Railway with me , in a terribly destructive accident .
Parsing [sent. 20403 len. 37]: When I had done what I could to help others , I climbed back into my carriage -- nearly turned over a viaduct , and caught aslant upon the turn -- to extricate the worthy couple .
Parsing [sent. 20404 len. 9]: They were much soiled , but otherwise unhurt .
Parsing [sent. 20405 len. 27]: The same happy result attended Miss Bella Wilfer on her wedding day , and Mr Riderhood inspecting Bradley Headstone 's red neckerchief as he lay asleep .
Parsing [sent. 20406 len. 47]: I remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever , than I was then , until there shall be written against my life , the two words with which I have this day closed this book .
