Parsing [sent. 1 len. 27]: Hard Times by Charles Dickens Book the First -- Sowing Chapter I -- The One Thing Needful ` NOW , what I want is , Facts .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 9]: Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 7]: Facts alone are wanted in life .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 10]: Plant nothing else , and root out everything else .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 23]: You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts : nothing else will ever be of any service to them .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 26]: This is the principle on which I bring up my own children , and this is the principle on which I bring up these children .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: Stick to Facts , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 36]: The scene was a plain , bare , monotonous vault of a school-room , and the speaker 's square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence with a line on the schoolmaster 's sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 38]: The emphasis was helped by the speaker 's square wall of a forehead , which had his eyebrows for its base , while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves , overshadowed by the wall .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 20]: The emphasis was helped by the speaker 's mouth , which was wide , thin , and hard set .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 19]: The emphasis was helped by the speaker 's voice , which was inflexible , dry , and dictatorial .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 60]: The emphasis was helped by the speaker 's hair , which bristled on the skirts of his bald head , a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface , all covered with knobs , like the crust of a plum pie , as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 49]: The speaker 's obstinate carriage , square coat , square legs , square shoulders , -- nay , his very neckcloth , trained to take him by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp , like a stubborn fact , as it was , -- all helped the emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 18]: ` In this life , we want nothing but Facts , sir ; nothing but Facts ! '
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 55]: The speaker , and the schoolmaster , and the third grown person present , all backed a little , and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of little vessels then and there arranged in order , ready to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 11]: Chapter II -- Murdering the Innocents THOMAS GRADGRIND , sir .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 5]: A man of realities .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 7]: A man of facts and calculations .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 31]: A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four , and nothing over , and who is not to be talked into allowing for anything over .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 11]: Thomas Gradgrind , sir -- peremptorily Thomas -- Thomas Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 40]: With a rule and a pair of scales , and the multiplication table always in his pocket , sir , ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature , and tell you exactly what it comes to .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 14]: It is a mere question of figures , a case of simple arithmetic .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 47]: You might hope to get some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind , or Augustus Gradgrind , or John Gradgrind , or Joseph Gradgrind -LRB- all supposititious , non-existent persons -RRB- , but into the head of Thomas Gradgrind -- no , sir !
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 25]: In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself , whether to his private circle of acquaintance , or to the public in general .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 44]: In such terms , no doubt , substituting the words ` boys and girls , ' for ` sir , ' Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him , who were to be filled so full of facts .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 43]: Indeed , as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned , he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts , and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 26]: He seemed a galvanizing apparatus , too , charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 25]: ` Girl number twenty , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , squarely pointing with his square forefinger , ' I do n't know that girl .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 6]: Who is that girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 19]: ` Sissy Jupe , sir , ' explained number twenty , blushing , standing up , and curtseying .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 12]: ` Sissy is not a name , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 7]: ` Do n't call yourself Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 5]: Call yourself Cecilia . '
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 26]: ` It 's father as calls me Sissy , sir , ' returned the young girl in a trembling voice , and with another curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 15]: ` Then he has no business to do it , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 7]: ` Tell him he must n't .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 3]: Cecilia Jupe .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 6]: What is your father ? '
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 14]: ` He belongs to the horse-riding , if you please , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 14]: Mr. Gradgrind frowned , and waved off the objectionable calling with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 13]: ` We do n't want to know anything about that , here .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 10]: You must n't tell us about that , here .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 10]: Your father breaks horses , do n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 26]: ` If you please , sir , when they can get any to break , they do break horses in the ring , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 12]: ` You must n't tell us about the ring , here .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 5]: Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 7]: Describe your father as a horsebreaker .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 10]: He doctors sick horses , I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 7]: ` Oh yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 6]: ` Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 12]: He is a veterinary surgeon , a farrier , and horsebreaker .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 9]: Give me your definition of a horse . '
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 13]: -LRB- Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 11]: ` Girl number twenty unable to define a horse ! '
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 14]: said Mr. Gradgrind , for the general behoof of all the little pitchers .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 19]: ` Girl number twenty possessed of no facts , in reference to one of the commonest of animals !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 8]: Some boy 's definition of a horse .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 5]: Bitzer , yours . '
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 45]: The square finger , moving here and there , lighted suddenly on Bitzer , perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which , darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room , irradiated Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 78]: For , the boys and girls sat on the face of the inclined plane in two compact bodies , divided up the centre by a narrow interval ; and Sissy , being at the corner of a row on the sunny side , came in for the beginning of a sunbeam , of which Bitzer , being at the corner of a row on the other side , a few rows in advance , caught the end .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 56]: But , whereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired , that she seemed to receive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun , when it shone upon her , the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same rays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 34]: His cold eyes would hardly have been eyes , but for the short ends of lashes which , by bringing them into immediate contrast with something paler than themselves , expressed their form .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 19]: His short-cropped hair might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead and face .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 27]: His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge , that he looked as though , if he were cut , he would bleed white .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 8]: ` Bitzer , ' said Thomas Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 8]: ` Your definition of a horse . '
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 3]: ` Quadruped .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 2]: Graminivorous .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 14]: Forty teeth , namely twenty-four grinders , four eye-teeth , and twelve incisive .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 15]: Sheds coat in the spring ; in marshy countries , sheds hoofs , too .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 11]: Hoofs hard , but requiring to be shod with iron .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 8]: Age known by marks in mouth . '
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 8]: Thus -LRB- and much more -RRB- Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 11]: ` Now girl number twenty , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 9]: ` You know what a horse is . '
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 24]: She curtseyed again , and would have blushed deeper , if she could have blushed deeper than she had blushed all this time .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 48]: Bitzer , after rapidly blinking at Thomas Gradgrind with both eyes at once , and so catching the light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennae of busy insects , put his knuckles to his freckled forehead , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 7]: The third gentleman now stepped forth .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 69]: A mighty man at cutting and drying , he was ; a government officer ; in his way -LRB- and in most other people 's too -RRB- , a professed pugilist ; always in training , always with a system to force down the general throat like a bolus , always to be heard of at the bar of his little Public-office , ready to fight all England .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 30]: To continue in fistic phraseology , he had a genius for coming up to the scratch , wherever and whatever it was , and proving himself an ugly customer .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 45]: He would go in and damage any subject whatever with his right , follow up with his left , stop , exchange , counter , bore his opponent -LRB- he always fought All England -RRB- to the ropes , and fall upon him neatly .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 24]: He was certain to knock the wind out of common sense , and render that unlucky adversary deaf to the call of time .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 24]: And he had it in charge from high authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium , when Commissioners should reign upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 17]: ` Very well , ' said this gentleman , briskly smiling , and folding his arms .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 6]: ` That 's a horse .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 21]: Now , let me ask you girls and boys , Would you paper a room with representations of horses ? '
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 19]: After a pause , one half of the children cried in chorus , ` Yes , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 28]: Upon which the other half , seeing in the gentleman 's face that Yes was wrong , cried out in chorus , ` No , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 10]: -- as the custom is , in these examinations .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 6]: ` Of course , No .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 6]: Why would n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 3]: A pause .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 31]: One corpulent slow boy , with a wheezy manner of breathing , ventured the answer , Because he would n't paper a room at all , but would paint it .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 14]: ` You must paper it , ' said the gentleman , rather warmly .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 19]: ` You must paper it , ' said Thomas Gradgrind , ` whether you like it or not .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 10]: Do n't tell us you would n't paper it .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 8]: What do you mean , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 34]: ` I 'll explain to you , then , ' said the gentleman , after another and a dismal pause , ` why you would n't paper a room with representations of horses .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 19]: Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality -- in fact ?
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 4]: Do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 4]: from one half .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: ` No , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 4]: from the other .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 19]: ` Of course no , ' said the gentleman , with an indignant look at the wrong half .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 35]: ` Why , then , you are not to see anywhere , what you do n't see in fact ; you are not to have anywhere , what you do n't have in fact .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 13]: What is called Taste , is only another name for Fact . '
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 6]: Thomas Gradgrind nodded his approbation .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 19]: ` This is a new principle , a discovery , a great discovery , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 9]: ` Now , I 'll try you again .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 9]: Suppose you were going to carpet a room .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 14]: Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it ? '
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 15]: There being a general conviction by this time that ` No , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 17]: was always the right answer to this gentleman , the chorus of NO was very strong .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 13]: Only a few feeble stragglers said Yes : among them Sissy Jupe .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 18]: ` Girl number twenty , ' said the gentleman , smiling in the calm strength of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 7]: Sissy blushed , and stood up .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 35]: ` So you would carpet your room -- or your husband 's room , if you were a grown woman , and had a husband -- with representations of flowers , would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 6]: ` Why would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 19]: ` If you please , sir , I am very fond of flowers , ' returned the girl .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 25]: ` And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them , and have people walking over them with heavy boots ? '
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 9]: ` It would n't hurt them , sir .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 13]: They would n't crush and wither , if you please , sir .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 26]: They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant , and I would fancy -- ' ` Ay , ay , ay !
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 21]: But you must n't fancy , ' cried the gentleman , quite elated by coming so happily to his point .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 5]: ` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 7]: You are never to fancy . '
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 23]: ` You are not , Cecilia Jupe , ' Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated , ` to do anything of that kind . '
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 8]: ` Fact , fact , fact ! '
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 9]: And ` Fact , fact , fact ! '
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 4]: repeated Thomas Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 21]: ` You are to be in all things regulated and governed , ' said the gentleman , ` by fact .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 37]: We hope to have , before long , a board of fact , composed of commissioners of fact , who will force the people to be a people of fact , and of nothing but fact .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 8]: You must discard the word Fancy altogether .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 8]: You have nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 22]: You are not to have , in any object of use or ornament , what would be a contradiction in fact .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 21]: You do n't walk upon flowers in fact ; you can not be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 31]: You do n't find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery ; you can not be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 20]: You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls ; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 34]: You must use , ' said the gentleman , ` for all these purposes , combinations and modifications -LRB- in primary colours -RRB- of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 6]: This is the new discovery .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 4]: This is fact .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 5]: This is taste . '
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 8]: The girl curtseyed , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 21]: She was very young , and she looked as if she were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 42]: ` Now , if Mr. M'Choakumchild , ' said the gentleman , ` will proceed to give his first lesson here , Mr. Gradgrind , I shall be happy , at your request , to observe his mode of procedure . '
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 6]: Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: ` Mr. M'Choakumchild , we only wait for you . '
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 10]: So , Mr. M'Choakumchild began in his best manner .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 35]: He and some one hundred and forty other schoolmasters , had been lately turned at the same time , in the same factory , on the same principles , like so many pianoforte legs .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 19]: He had been put through an immense variety of paces , and had answered volumes of head-breaking questions .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 50]: Orthography , etymology , syntax , and prosody , biography , astronomy , geography , and general cosmography , the sciences of compound proportion , algebra , land-surveying and levelling , vocal music , and drawing from models , were all at the ends of his ten chilled fingers .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 42]: He had worked his stony way into Her Majesty 's most Honourable Privy Council 's Schedule B , and had taken the bloom off the higher branches of mathematics and physical science , French , German , Latin , and Greek .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 68]: He knew all about all the Water Sheds of all the world -LRB- whatever they are -RRB- , and all the histories of all the peoples , and all the names of all the rivers and mountains , and all the productions , manners , and customs of all the countries , and all their boundaries and bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 7]: Ah , rather overdone , M'Choakumchild .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 19]: If he had only learnt a little less , how infinitely better he might have taught much more !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 36]: He went to work in this preparatory lesson , not unlike Morgiana in the Forty Thieves : looking into all the vessels ranged before him , one after another , to see what they contained .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 5]: Say , good M'Choakumchild .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 39]: When from thy boiling store , thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by , dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy lurking within -- or sometimes only maim him and distort him !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 20]: Chapter III -- A Loophole MR. GRADGRIND walked homeward from the school , in a state of considerable satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 14]: It was his school , and he intended it to be a model .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 20]: He intended every child in it to be a model -- just as the young Gradgrinds were all models .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 13]: There were five young Gradgrinds , and they were models every one .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 17]: They had been lectured at , from their tenderest years ; coursed , like little hares .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 19]: Almost as soon as they could run alone , they had been made to run to the lecture-room .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 34]: The first object with which they had an association , or of which they had a remembrance , was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 17]: Not that they knew , by name or nature , anything about an Ogre Fact forbid !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 39]: I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle , with Heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one , taking childhood captive , and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 24]: No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon ; it was up in the moon before it could speak distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 24]: No little Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle , Twinkle , twinkle , little star ; how I wonder what you are !
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 38]: No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject , each little Gradgrind having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a Professor Owen , and driven Charles 's Wain like a locomotive engine-driver .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 73]: No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field with that famous cow with the crumpled horn who tossed the dog who worried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt , or with that yet more famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb : it had never heard of those celebrities , and had only been introduced to a cow as a graminivorous ruminating quadruped with several stomachs .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 17]: To his matter-of-fact home , which was called Stone Lodge , Mr. Gradgrind directed his steps .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 32]: He had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware trade before he built Stone Lodge , and was now looking about for a suitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 25]: Stone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great town -- called Coketown in the present faithful guide-book .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 15]: A very regular feature on the face of the country , Stone Lodge was .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 16]: Not the least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 24]: A great square house , with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows , as its master 's heavy brows overshadowed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 12]: A calculated , cast up , balanced , and proved house .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 39]: Six windows on this side of the door , six on that side ; a total of twelve in this wing , a total of twelve in the other wing ; four-and-twenty carried over to the back wings .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 17]: A lawn and garden and an infant avenue , all ruled straight like a botanical account-book .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 14]: Gas and ventilation , drainage and water-service , all of the primest quality .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 30]: Iron clamps and girders , fire-proof from top to bottom ; mechanical lifts for the housemaids , with all their brushes and brooms ; everything that heart could desire .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 2]: Everything ?
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 6]: Well , I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 12]: The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in various departments of science too .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 106]: They had a little conchological cabinet , and a little metallurgical cabinet , and a little mineralogical cabinet ; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled , and the bits of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names ; and , to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper , who had never found his way into their nursery , If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this , what was it for good gracious goodness ' sake , that the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped it !
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 13]: Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 40]: He was an affectionate father , after his manner ; but he would probably have described himself -LRB- if he had been put , like Sissy Jupe , upon a definition -RRB- as ` an eminently practical ' father .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 22]: He had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical , which was considered to have a special application to him .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 33]: Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown , and whatsoever the subject of such meeting , some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 8]: This always pleased the eminently practical friend .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 14]: He knew it to be his due , but his due was acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 37]: He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town , which was neither town nor country , and yet was either spoiled , when his ears were invaded by the sound of music .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 28]: The clashing and banging band attached to the horse-riding establishment , which had there set up its rest in a wooden pavilion , was in full bray .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 27]: A flag , floating from the summit of the temple , proclaimed to mankind that it was ` Sleary 's Horse-riding ' which claimed their suffrages .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 27]: Sleary himself , a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow , in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture , took the money .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 29]: Miss Josephine Sleary , as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced , was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 37]: Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed , Signor Jupe was that afternoon to ` elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog Merrylegs . '
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 60]: He was also to exhibit ` his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head , thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air , a feat never before attempted in this or any other country , and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it can not be withdrawn . '
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 23]: The same Signor Jupe was to ` enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts . '
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 40]: Lastly , he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button , of Tooley Street , in ` the highly novel and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor 's Journey to Brentford . '
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 41]: Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course , but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on , either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts , or consigning them to the House of Correction .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 48]: But , the turning of the road took him by the back of the booth , and at the back of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of stealthy attitudes , striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the place .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 7]: This brought him to a stop .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 24]: ` Now , to think of these vagabonds , ' said he , ` attracting the young rabble from a model school . '
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 39]: A space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young rabble , he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child he knew by name , and might order off .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 53]: Phenomenon almost incredible though distinctly seen , what did he then behold but his own metallurgical Louisa , peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board , and his own mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a hoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 41]: Dumb with amazement , Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family was thus disgraced , laid his hand upon each erring child , and said : ` Louisa !! Thomas !! ' Both rose , red and disconcerted .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 14]: But , Louisa looked at her father with more boldness than Thomas did .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 21]: Indeed , Thomas did not look at him , but gave himself up to be taken home like a machine .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 13]: ` In the name of wonder , idleness , and folly ! '
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 19]: said Mr. Gradgrind , leading each away by a hand ; ` what do you do here ? '
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 15]: ` Wanted to see what it was like , ' returned Louisa , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 7]: ` What it was like ? '
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 6]: ` Yes , father . '
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 58]: There was an air of jaded sullenness in them both , and particularly in the girl : yet , struggling through the dissatisfaction of her face , there was a light with nothing to rest upon , a fire with nothing to burn , a starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow , which brightened its expression .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 37]: Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth , but with uncertain , eager , doubtful flashes , which had something painful in them , analogous to the changes on a blind face groping its way .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 26]: She was a child now , of fifteen or sixteen ; but at no distant day would seem to become a woman all at once .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 10]: Her father thought so as he looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 4]: She was pretty .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 18]: Would have been self-willed -LRB- he thought in his eminently practical way -RRB- but for her bringing-up .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 39]: ` Thomas , though I have the fact before me , I find it difficult to believe that you , with your education and resources , should have brought your sister to a scene like this . ' '
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 13]: I brought him , father , ' said Louisa , quickly . '
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 8]: I asked him to come . ' '
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 7]: I am sorry to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 9]: I am very sorry indeed to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 15]: It makes Thomas no better , and it makes you worse , Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 15]: She looked at her father again , but no tear fell down her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 3]: ` You !
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 47]: Thomas and you , to whom the circle of the sciences is open ; Thomas and you , who may be said to be replete with facts ; Thomas and you , who have been trained to mathematical exactness ; Thomas and you , here ! '
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 4]: cried Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 6]: ` In this degraded position !
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 6]: I am amazed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 6]: I was tired , father .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 12]: I have been tired a long time , ' said Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 3]: ` Tired ?
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 4]: Of what ? '
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 6]: asked the astonished father . '
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 14]: I do n't know of what -- of everything , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 11]: ` Say not another word , ' returned Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 5]: ` You are childish .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 7]: I will hear no more . '
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 31]: He did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence , when he gravely broke out with : ` What would your best friends say , Louisa ?
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 10]: Do you attach no value to their good opinion ?
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 7]: What would Mr. Bounderby say ? '
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 23]: At the mention of this name , his daughter stole a look at him , remarkable for its intense and searching character .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 21]: He saw nothing of it , for before he looked at her , she had again cast down her eyes !
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 15]: ` What , ' he repeated presently , ` would Mr. Bounderby say ? '
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 30]: All the way to Stone Lodge , as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home , he repeated at intervals ` What would Mr. Bounderby say ? '
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 10]: -- as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 15]: Chapter IV -- Mr. Bounderby NOT being Mrs. Grundy , who was Mr. Bounderby ?
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 34]: Why , Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind 's bosom friend , as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 19]: So near was Mr. Bounderby -- or , if the reader should prefer it , so far off .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 16]: He was a rich man : banker , merchant , manufacturer , and what not .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 15]: A big , loud man , with a stare , and a metallic laugh .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 22]: A man made out of a coarse material , which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 39]: A man with a great puffed head and forehead , swelled veins in his temples , and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open , and lift his eyebrows up .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 20]: A man with a pervading appearance on him of being inflated like a balloon , and ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 12]: A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 25]: A man who was always proclaiming , through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his , his old ignorance and his old poverty .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 9]: A man who was the Bully of humility .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 38]: A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend , Mr. Bounderby looked older ; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again , without surprising anybody .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 6]: He had not much hair .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 36]: One might have fancied he had talked it off ; and that what was left , all standing up in disorder , was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 36]: In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge , standing on the hearthrug , warming himself before the fire , Mr. Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his birthday .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 55]: He stood before the fire , partly because it was a cool spring afternoon , though the sun shone ; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar ; partly because he thus took up a commanding position , from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind . '
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 9]: I had n't a shoe to my foot .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 15]: As to a stocking , I did n't know such a thing by name .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 15]: I passed the day in a ditch , and the night in a pigsty .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 10]: That 's the way I spent my tenth birthday .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 18]: Not that a ditch was new to me , for I was born in a ditch . '
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 67]: Mrs. Gradgrind , a little , thin , white , pink-eyed bundle of shawls , of surpassing feebleness , mental and bodily ; who was always taking physic without any effect , and who , whenever she showed a symptom of coming to life , was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on her ; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch ?
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 6]: As wet as a sop .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 12]: A foot of water in it , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 13]: ` Enough to give a baby cold , ' Mrs. Gradgrind considered .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 3]: ` Cold ?
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 28]: I was born with inflammation of the lungs , and of everything else , I believe , that was capable of inflammation , ' returned Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 18]: ` For years , ma'am , I was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 13]: I was so sickly , that I was always moaning and groaning .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 21]: I was so ragged and dirty , that you would n't have touched me with a pair of tongs . '
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 20]: Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs , as the most appropriate thing her imbecility could think of doing .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 17]: ` How I fought through it , I do n't know , ' said Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 7]: I was determined , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 17]: I have been a determined character in later life , and I suppose I was then .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 22]: Here I am , Mrs. Gradgrind , anyhow , and nobody to thank for my being here , but myself . '
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 14]: Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother -- ` My mother ?
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 5]: Bolted , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 3]: said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 13]: Mrs. Gradgrind , stunned as usual , collapsed and gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 38]: ` My mother left me to my grandmother , ' said Bounderby ; ` and , according to the best of my remembrance , my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 23]: If I got a little pair of shoes by any chance , she would take 'em off and sell 'em for drink .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 24]: Why , I have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses of liquor before breakfast ! '
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 38]: Mrs. Gradgrind , weakly smiling , and giving no other sign of vitality , looked -LRB- as she always did -RRB- like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure , without enough light behind it .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 20]: ` She kept a chandler 's shop , ' pursued Bounderby , ` and kept me in an egg-box .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 12]: That was the cot of my infancy ; an old egg-box .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 17]: As soon as I was big enough to run away , of course I ran away .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 31]: Then I became a young vagabond ; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me , everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 13]: They were right ; they had no business to do anything else .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 12]: I was a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 7]: I know that very well . '
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 43]: His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest , was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast . '
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 13]: I was to pull through it , I suppose , Mrs. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 15]: Whether I was to do it or not , ma'am , I did it .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 13]: I pulled through it , though nobody threw me out a rope .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 23]: Vagabond , errand-boy , vagabond , labourer , porter , clerk , chief manager , small partner , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 9]: Those are the antecedents , and the culmination .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 61]: Josiah Bounderby of Coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops , Mrs. Gradgrind , and was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate , from studying the steeple clock of St. Giles 's Church , London , under the direction of a drunken cripple , who was a convicted thief , and an incorrigible vagrant .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 107]: Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , of your district schools and your model schools , and your training schools , and your whole kettle-of-fish of schools ; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , tells you plainly , all right , all correct -- he had n't such advantages -- but let us have hard-headed , solid-fisted people -- the education that made him wo n't do for everybody , he knows well -- such and such his education was , however , and you may force him to swallow boiling fat , but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life . '
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 15]: Being heated when he arrived at this climax , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 21]: He stopped just as his eminently practical friend , still accompanied by the two young culprits , entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 28]: His eminently practical friend , on seeing him , stopped also , and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said , ` Behold your Bounderby ! '
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 10]: blustered Mr. Bounderby , ` what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 10]: What is young Thomas in the dumps about ? '
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 12]: He spoke of young Thomas , but he looked at Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 27]: ` We were peeping at the circus , ' muttered Louisa , haughtily , without lifting up her eyes , ` and father caught us . '
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 30]: ` And , Mrs. Gradgrind , ' said her husband in a lofty manner , ' I should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry . '
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 9]: ` Dear me , ' whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 9]: ` How can you , Louisa and Thomas !
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 5]: I wonder at you .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 17]: I declare you 're enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 13]: I have a great mind to say I wish I had n't .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 14]: Then what would you have done , I should like to know ? '
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 12]: Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 4]: He frowned impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 35]: ` As if , with my head in its present throbbing state , you could n't go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you , instead of circuses ! '
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 4]: said Mrs. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 29]: ` You know , as well as I do , no young people have circus masters , or keep circuses in cabinets , or attend lectures about circuses .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 11]: What can you possibly want to know of circuses then ?
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 16]: I am sure you have enough to do , if that 's what you want .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 27]: With my head in its present state , I could n't remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to . '
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: ` That 's the reason ! '
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 3]: pouted Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 25]: ` Do n't tell me that 's the reason , because it ca n't be nothing of the sort , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 8]: ` Go and be somethingological directly . '
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 25]: Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character , and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 34]: In truth , Mrs. Gradgrind 's stock of facts in general was woefully defective ; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position , had been influenced by two reasons .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 25]: Firstly , she was most satisfactory as a question of figures ; and , secondly , she had ` no nonsense ' about her .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 39]: By nonsense he meant fancy ; and truly it is probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature , as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot , ever was .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 31]: The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby , was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 13]: So , she once more died away , and nobody minded her .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 49]: ` Bounderby , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , drawing a chair to the fireside , ` you are always so interested in my young people -- particularly in Louisa -- that I make no apology for saying to you , I am very much vexed by this discovery .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 20]: I have systematically devoted myself -LRB- as you know -RRB- to the education of the reason of my family .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 18]: The reason is -LRB- as you know -RRB- the only faculty to which education should be addressed .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 78]: ` And yet , Bounderby , it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day , though in itself a trifling one , as if something had crept into Thomas 's and Louisa 's minds which is -- or rather , which is not -- I do n't know that I can express myself better than by saying -- which has never been intended to be developed , and in which their reason has no part . '
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 20]: ` There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds , ' returned Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 21]: ` When I was a vagabond myself , nobody looked with any interest at me ; I know that . '
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 30]: ` Then comes the question ; said the eminently practical father , with his eyes on the fire , ` in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise ? '
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 8]: ` I 'll tell you in what .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: In idle imagination . ' '
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 28]: I hope not , ' said the eminently practical ; ' I confess , however , that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home . '
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 12]: ` In idle imagination , Gradgrind , ' repeated Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 18]: A very bad thing for anybody , but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 24]: I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind 's pardon for strong expressions , but that she knows very well I am not a refined character .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 9]: Whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 9]: I had n't a refined bringing up . '
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 34]: ` Whether , ' said Gradgrind , pondering with his hands in his pockets , and his cavernous eyes on the fire , ` whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 10]: Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 18]: Whether , in spite of all precautions , any idle story-book can have got into the house ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 28]: Because , in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line , from the cradle upwards , this is so curious , so incomprehensible . '
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 6]: ` Stop a bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 30]: cried Bounderby , who all this time had been standing , as before , on the hearth , bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 14]: ` You have one of those strollers ' children in the school . '
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 22]: ` Cecilia Jupe , by name , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , with something of a stricken look at his friend .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 8]: ` Now , stop a bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 4]: cried Bounderby again .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 8]: ` How did she come there ? '
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 22]: ` Why , the fact is , I saw the girl myself , for the first time , only just now .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 34]: She specially applied here at the house to be admitted , as not regularly belonging to our town , and -- yes , you are right , Bounderby , you are right . '
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 8]: ` Now , stop a bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 6]: cried Bounderby , once more .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 9]: ` Louisa saw her when she came ? '
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 15]: ` Louisa certainly did see her , for she mentioned the application to me .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 17]: But Louisa saw her , I have no doubt , in Mrs. Gradgrind 's presence . '
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 15]: ` Pray , Mrs. Gradgrind , ' said Bounderby , ` what passed ? '
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 8]: ` Oh , my poor health ! '
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 4]: returned Mrs. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 58]: ` The girl wanted to come to the school , and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school , and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come , and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come , and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact ! '
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: ` Now I tell you what , Gradgrind ! '
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 4]: said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 19]: ` Turn this girl to the right about , and there 's an end of it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 8]: I am much of your opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 20]: ` Do it at once , ' said Bounderby , ` has always been my motto from a child .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 20]: When I thought I would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother , I did it at once .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 5]: Do you the same .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 6]: Do this at once ! '
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 6]: ` Are you walking ? '
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 5]: asked his friend . '
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 7]: I have the father 's address .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 12]: Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 24]: ` Not the least in the world , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` as long as you do it at once ! '
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 54]: So , Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat -- he always threw it on , as expressing a man who had been far too busily employed in making himself , to acquire any fashion of wearing his hat -- and with his hands in his pockets , sauntered out into the hall . '
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 14]: I never wear gloves , ' it was his custom to say . '
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 10]: I did n't climb up the ladder in them .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 13]: -- Should n't be so high up , if I had . '
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 67]: Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind went up-stairs for the address , he opened the door of the children 's study and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment , which , notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical appliances , had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to hair-cutting .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 24]: Louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out , without looking at anything , while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 43]: Adam Smith and Malthus , two younger Gradgrinds , were out at lecture in custody ; and little Jane , after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with slate-pencil and tears , had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 31]: ` It 's all right now , Louisa : it 's all right , young Thomas , ' said Mr. Bounderby ; ` you wo n't do so any more .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 12]: I 'll answer for it 's being all over with father .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 15]: Well , Louisa , that 's worth a kiss , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 40]: ` You can take one , Mr. Bounderby , ' returned Louisa , when she had coldly paused , and slowly walked across the room , and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him , with her face turned away .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 12]: ` Always my pet ; ai n't you , Louisa ? '
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 4]: said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 6]: ` Good-bye , Louisa ! '
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 30]: He went his way , but she stood on the same spot , rubbing the cheek he had kissed , with her handkerchief , until it was burning red .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 10]: She was still doing this , five minutes afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 9]: ` What are you about , Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 5]: her brother sulkily remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 11]: ` You 'll rub a hole in your face . '
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 16]: ` You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 6]: I would n't cry ! '
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 36]: Chapter V -- The Keynote COKETOWN , to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked , was a triumph of fact ; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 13]: Let us strike the key-note , Coketown , before pursuing our tune .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 47]: It was a town of red brick , or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it ; but as matters stood , it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 29]: It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys , out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever , and never got uncoiled .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 64]: It had a black canal in it , and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye , and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long , and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down , like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 80]: It contained several large streets all very like one another , and many small streets still more like one another , inhabited by people equally like one another , who all went in and out at the same hours , with the same sound upon the same pavements , to do the same work , and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to-morrow , and every year the counterpart of the last and the next .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 66]: These attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work by which it was sustained ; against them were to be set off , comforts of life which found their way all over the world , and elegancies of life which made , we will not ask how much of the fine lady , who could scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 13]: The rest of its features were voluntary , and they were these .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 11]: You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 55]: If the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there -- as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done -- they made it a pious warehouse of red brick , with sometimes -LRB- but this is only in highly ornamental examples -RRB- a bell in a birdcage on the top of it .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 29]: The solitary exception was the New Church ; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door , terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 19]: All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike , in severe characters of black and white .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 44]: The jail might have been the infirmary , the infirmary might have been the jail , the town-hall might have been either , or both , or anything else , for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 26]: Fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the material aspect of the town ; fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the immaterial .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 77]: The M'Choakumchild school was all fact , and the school of design was all fact , and the relations between master and man were all fact , and everything was fact between the lying-in hospital and the cemetery , and what you could n't state in figures , or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest , was not , and never should be , world without end , Amen .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 20]: A town so sacred to fact , and so triumphant in its assertion , of course got on well ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: Why no , not quite well .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 2]: No ?
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 21]: Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces , in all respects like gold that had stood the fire .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 17]: First , the perplexing mystery of the place was , Who belonged to the eighteen denominations ?
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 11]: Because , whoever did , the labouring people did not .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 82]: It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning , and note how few of them the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad , called away from their own quarter , from their own close rooms , from the corners of their own streets , where they lounged listlessly , gazing at all the church and chapel going , as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 51]: Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this , because there was a native organization in Coketown itself , whose members were to be heard of in the House of Commons every session , indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 56]: Then came the Teetotal Society , who complained that these same people would get drunk , and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk , and proved at tea parties that no inducement , human or Divine -LRB- except a medal -RRB- , would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 25]: Then came the chemist and druggist , with other tabular statements , showing that when they did n't get drunk , they took opium .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 111]: Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail , with more tabular statements , outdoing all the previous tabular statements , and showing that the same people would resort to low haunts , hidden from the public eye , where they heard low singing and saw low dancing , and mayhap joined in it ; and where A. B. , aged twenty-four next birthday , and committed for eighteen months ' solitary , had himself said -LRB- not that he had ever shown himself particularly worthy of belief -RRB- his ruin began , as he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip-top moral specimen .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 148]: Then came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby , the two gentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown , and both eminently practical , who could , on occasion , furnish more tabular statements derived from their own personal experience , and illustrated by cases they had known and seen , from which it clearly appeared -- in short , it was the only clear thing in the case -- that these same people were a bad lot altogether , gentlemen ; that do what you would for them they were never thankful for it , gentlemen ; that they were restless , gentlemen ; that they never knew what they wanted ; that they lived upon the best , and bought fresh butter ; and insisted on Mocha coffee , and rejected all but prime parts of meat , and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 25]: In short , it was the moral of the old nursery fable : There was an old woman , and what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 29]: She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink ; Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet , And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 27]: Is it possible , I wonder , that there was any analogy between the case of the Coketown population and the case of the little Gradgrinds ?
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 49]: Surely , none of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures , are to be told at this time of day , that one of the foremost elements in the existence of the Coketown working-people had been for scores of years , deliberately set at nought ?
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 21]: That there was any Fancy in them demanding to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in convulsions ?
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 95]: That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and monotonously , the craving grew within them for some physical relief -- some relaxation , encouraging good humour and good spirits , and giving them a vent -- some recognized holiday , though it were but for an honest dance to a stirring band of music -- some occasional light pie in which even M'Choakumchild had no finger -- which craving must and would be satisfied aright , or must and would inevitably go wrong , until the laws of the Creation were repealed ?
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 24]: ` This man lives at Pod 's End , and I do n't quite know Pod 's End , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 8]: ` Which is it , Bounderby ? '
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 16]: Mr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town , but knew no more respecting it .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 10]: So they stopped for a moment , looking about .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 32]: Almost as they did so , there came running round the corner of the street at a quick pace and with a frightened look , a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind recognized .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 3]: ` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 5]: Where are you going !
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 3]: Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 14]: Girl number twenty stopped then , palpitating , and made him a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 22]: ` Why are you tearing about the streets , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` in this improper manner ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 24]: I was -- I was run after , sir , ' the girl panted , ` and I wanted to get away . '
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 5]: ` Run after ? '
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 8]: ` Who would run after you ? '
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 52]: The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her , by the colourless boy , Bitzer , who came round the corner with such blind speed and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement , that he brought himself up against Mr. Gradgrind 's waistcoat and rebounded into the road .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 9]: ` What do you mean , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 4]: said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 6]: ` What are you doing ?
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 13]: How dare you dash against -- everybody -- in this manner ? '
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 28]: Bitzer picked up his cap , which the concussion had knocked off ; and backing , and knuckling his forehead , pleaded that it was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 11]: ` Was this boy running after you , Jupe ? '
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 4]: asked Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 11]: ` Yes , sir , ' said the girl reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 10]: ` No , I was n't , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 3]: cried Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 9]: ` Not till she run away from me .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 17]: But the horse-riders never mind what they say , sir ; they 're famous for it .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 17]: You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say , ' addressing Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 27]: ` It 's as well known in the town as -- please , sir , as the multiplication table is n't known to the horse-riders . '
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 7]: Bitzer tried Mr. Bounderby with this .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 18]: ` He frightened me so , ' said the girl , ` with his cruel faces ! '
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 3]: cried Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 8]: A n't you one of the rest !
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 6]: A n't you a horse-rider !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 8]: I never looked at her , sir .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 46]: I asked her if she would know how to define a horse to-morrow , and offered to tell her again , and she ran away , and I ran after her , sir , that she might know how to answer when she was asked .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 18]: You would n't have thought of saying such mischief if you had n't been a horse-rider ? '
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 17]: ` Her calling seems to be pretty well known among 'em , ' observed Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 18]: ` You 'd have had the whole school peeping in a row , in a week . '
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 12]: ` Truly , I think so , ' returned his friend .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 11]: ` Bitzer , turn you about and take yourself home .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 7]: Jupe , stay here a moment .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 27]: Let me hear of your running in this manner any more , boy , and you will hear of me through the master of the school .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 6]: You understand what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 4]: Go along . '
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 23]: The boy stopped in his rapid blinking , knuckled his forehead again , glanced at Sissy , turned about , and retreated .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 26]: ` Now , girl , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` take this gentleman and me to your father 's ; we are going there .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 12]: What have you got in that bottle you are carrying ? '
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 8]: ` Gin , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 7]: ` Dear , no , sir !
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 7]: It 's the nine oils . '
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 5]: ` The what ? '
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 4]: cried Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 13]: ` The nine oils , sir , to rub father with . '
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 29]: ` Then , ' said Mr. Bounderby , with a loud short laugh , ` what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for ? '
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 39]: ` It 's what our people aways use , sir , when they get any hurts in the ring , ' replied the girl , looking over her shoulder , to assure herself that her pursuer was gone .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 9]: ` They bruise themselves very bad sometimes . '
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 16]: ` Serve 'em right , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` for being idle . '
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 13]: She glanced up at his face , with mingled astonishment and dread .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 5]: ` By George ! '
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 37]: said Mr. Bounderby , ` when I was four or five years younger than you , I had worse bruises upon me than ten oils , twenty oils , forty oils , would have rubbed off .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 14]: I did n't get 'em by posture-making , but by being banged about .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 21]: There was no rope-dancing for me ; I danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope . '
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 19]: Mr. Gradgrind , though hard enough , was by no means so rough a man as Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 38]: His character was not unkind , all things considered ; it might have been a very kind one indeed , if he had only made some round mistake in the arithmetic that balanced it , years ago .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 34]: He said , in what he meant for a reassuring tone , as they turned down a narrow road , ` And this is Pod 's End ; is it , Jupe ? '
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 23]: ` This is it , sir , and -- if you would n't mind , sir -- this is the house . '
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 22]: She stopped , at twilight , at the door of a mean little public-house , with dim red lights in it .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 39]: As haggard and as shabby , as if , for want of custom , it had itself taken to drinking , and had gone the way all drunkards go , and was very near the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 33]: ` It 's only crossing the bar , sir , and up the stairs , if you would n't mind , and waiting there for a moment till I get a candle .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 20]: If you should hear a dog , sir , it 's only Merrylegs , and he only barks . '
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 9]: ` Merrylegs and nine oils , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 11]: said Mr. Bounderby , entering last with his metallic laugh .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 11]: ` Pretty well this , for a self-made man ! '
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 17]: Chapter VI -- Sleary 's Horsemanship THE name of the public-house was the Pegasus 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 32]: The Pegasus 's legs might have been more to the purpose ; but , underneath the winged horse upon the sign-board , the Pegasus 's Arms was inscribed in Roman letters .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 52]: Beneath that inscription again , in a flowing scroll , the painter had touched off the lines : Good malt makes good beer , Walk in , and they 'll draw it here ; Good wine makes good brandy , Give us a call , and you 'll find it handy .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 46]: Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar , was another Pegasus -- a theatrical one -- with real gauze let in for his wings , golden stars stuck on all over him , and his ethereal harness made of red silk .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 39]: As it had grown too dusky without , to see the sign , and as it had not grown light enough within to see the picture , Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no offence from these idealities .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 26]: They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one , and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 28]: They expected every moment to hear Merrylegs give tongue , but the highly trained performing dog had not barked when the girl and the candle appeared together .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 21]: ` Father is not in our room , sir , ' she said , with a face of great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 16]: ` If you would n't mind walking in , I 'll find him directly . '
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 22]: They walked in ; and Sissy , having set two chairs for them , sped away with a quick light step .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 15]: It was a mean , shabbily furnished room , with a bed in it .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 64]: The white night-cap , embellished with two peacock 's feathers and a pigtail bolt upright , in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon enlivened the varied performances with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts , hung upon a nail ; but no other portion of his wardrobe , or other token of himself or his pursuits , was to be seen anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 46]: As to Merrylegs , that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who went aboard the ark , might have been accidentally shut out of it , for any sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the Pegasus 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 32]: They heard the doors of rooms above , opening and shutting as Sissy went from one to another in quest of her father ; and presently they heard voices expressing surprise .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 37]: She came bounding down again in a great hurry , opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk , found it empty , and looked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 12]: ` Father must have gone down to the Booth , sir .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 25]: I do n't know why he should go there , but he must be there ; I 'll bring him in a minute ! '
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 21]: She was gone directly , without her bonnet ; with her long , dark , childish hair streaming behind her .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: ` What does she mean ! '
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 4]: said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 6]: ` Back in a minute ?
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 9]: It 's more than a mile off . '
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 29]: Before Mr. Bounderby could reply , a young man appeared at the door , and introducing himself with the words , ` By your leaves , gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 9]: walked in with his hands in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 35]: His face , close-shaven , thin , and sallow , was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair , brushed into a roll all round his head , and parted up the centre .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 17]: His legs were very robust , but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 17]: His chest and back were as much too broad , as his legs were too short .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 50]: He was dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers ; wore a shawl round his neck ; smelt of lamp-oil , straw , orange-peel , horses ' provender , and sawdust ; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur , compounded of the stable and the play-house .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 18]: Where the one began , and the other ended , nobody could have told with any precision .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 112]: This gentleman was mentioned in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers , so justly celebrated for his daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American Prairies ; in which popular performance , a diminutive boy with an old face , who now accompanied him , assisted as his infant son : being carried upside down over his father 's shoulder , by one foot , and held by the crown of his head , heels upwards , in the palm of his father 's hand , according to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be observed to fondle their offspring .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 65]: Made up with curls , wreaths , wings , white bismuth , and carmine , this hopeful young person soared into so pleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part of the spectators ; but in private , where his characteristics were a precocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice , he became of the Turf , turfy .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 20]: ` By your leaves , gentlemen , ' said Mr. E. W. B. Childers , glancing round the room .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 16]: ` It was you , I believe , that were wishing to see Jupe ! '
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 9]: ` It was , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 32]: ` His daughter has gone to fetch him , but I ca n't wait ; therefore , if you please , I will leave a message for him with you . '
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 45]: ` You see , my friend , ' Mr. Bounderby put in , ` we are the kind of people who know the value of time , and you are the kind of people who do n't know the value of time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 58]: I have not , ' retorted Mr. Childers , after surveying him from head to foot , ` the honour of knowing you , -- but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than I can of mine , I should judge from your appearance , that you are about right . '
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 22]: ` And when you have made it , you can keep it too , I should think , ' said Cupid .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 7]: ` Kidderminster , stow that ! '
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 4]: said Mr. Childers .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 10]: -LRB- Master Kidderminster was Cupid 's mortal name . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 13]: ` What does he come here cheeking us for , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 10]: cried Master Kidderminster , showing a very irascible temperament .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 20]: ` If you want to cheek us , pay your ochre at the doors and take it out . '
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 16]: ` Kidderminster , ' said Mr. Childers , raising his voice , ` stow that !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 16]: -- Sir , ' to Mr. Gradgrind , ' I was addressing myself to you .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 33]: You may or you may not be aware -LRB- for perhaps you have not been much in the audience -RRB- , that Jupe has missed his tip very often , lately . '
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 9]: ` Has -- what has he missed ? '
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 12]: asked Mr. Gradgrind , glancing at the potent Bounderby for assistance .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 6]: ` Missed his tip . '
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 21]: ` Offered at the Garters four times last night , and never done 'em once , ' said Master Kidderminster .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 18]: ` Missed his tip at the banners , too , and was loose in his ponging . '
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 10]: ` Did n't do what he ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 16]: Was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling , ' Mr. Childers interpreted .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 13]: said Mr. Gradgrind , ` that is tip , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 19]: ` In a general way that 's missing his tip , ' Mr. E. W. B. Childers answered .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 19]: ` Nine oils , Merrylegs , missing tips , garters , banners , and Ponging , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 9]: ejaculated Bounderby , with his laugh of laughs .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 17]: ` Queer sort of company , too , for a man who has raised himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 10]: ` Lower yourself , then , ' retorted Cupid .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 4]: ` Oh Lord !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 20]: if you 've raised yourself so high as all that comes to , let yourself down a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 9]: ` This is a very obtrusive lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 13]: said Mr. Gradgrind , turning , and knitting his brows on him .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 28]: ` We 'd have had a young gentleman to meet you , if we had known you were coming , ' retorted Master Kidderminster , nothing abashed .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 16]: ` It 's a pity you do n't have a bespeak , being so particular .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 13]: You 're on the Tight -- Jeff , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 28]: ` What does this unmannerly boy mean , ' asked Mr. Gradgrind , eyeing him in a sort of desperation , ` by Tight -- Jeff ? '
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 7]: Get out , get out ! '
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 18]: said Mr. Childers , thrusting his young friend from the room , rather in the prairie manner .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 22]: ` Tight -- Jeff or Slack -- Jeff , it do n't much signify : it 's only tight-rope and slack-rope .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 12]: You were going to give me a message for Jupe ? '
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 7]: ` Yes , I was . '
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 21]: ` Then , ' continued Mr. Childers , quickly , ` my opinion is , he will never receive it .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 9]: Do you know much of him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 11]: I never saw the man in my life . ' '
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 10]: I doubt if you ever will see him now .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 12]: It 's pretty plain to me , he 's off . '
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 12]: ` Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 3]: ` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 18]: I mean , ' said Mr. Childers , with a nod , ` that he has cut .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 19]: He was goosed last night , he was goosed the night before last , he was goosed to-day .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 20]: He has lately got in the way of being always goosed , and he ca n't stand it . '
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 13]: ` Why has he been -- so very much -- Goosed ? '
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 17]: asked Mr. Gradgrind , forcing the word out of himself , with great solemnity and reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 18]: ` His joints are turning stiff , and he is getting used up , ' said Childers .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 23]: ` He has his points as a Cackler still , but he ca n't get a living out of them . ' '
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 4]: A Cackler ! '
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 3]: Bounderby repeated .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 8]: ` Here we go again ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 43]: A speaker , if the gentleman likes it better , ' said Mr. E. W. B. Childers , superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder , and accompanying it with a shake of his long hair -- which all shook at once .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 37]: ` Now , it 's a remarkable fact , sir , that it cut that man deeper , to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed , than to go through with it . '
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 4]: interrupted Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 7]: ` This is good , Gradgrind !
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 15]: A man so fond of his daughter , that he runs away from her !
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 5]: This is devilish good !
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 11]: Now , I 'll tell you what , young man .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: I have n't always occupied my present station of life .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 7]: I know what these things are .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 18]: You may be astonished to hear it , but my mother -- ran away from me . '
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 18]: E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly , that he was not at all astonished to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 9]: ` Very well , ' said Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 15]: I was born in a ditch , and my mother ran away from me .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 7]: Do I excuse her for it ?
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 8]: Have I ever excused her for it ?
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 3]: Not I .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 8]: What do I call her for it ?
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 20]: I call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world , except my drunken grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 17]: There 's no family pride about me , there 's no imaginative sentimental humbug about me .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 42]: I call a spade a spade ; and I call the mother of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , without any fear or any favour , what I should call her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 6]: So , with this man .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 19]: He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond , that 's what he is , in English . '
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 37]: ` It 's all the same to me what he is or what he is not , whether in English or whether in French , ' retorted Mr. E. W. B. Childers , facing about . '
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 28]: I am telling your friend what 's the fact ; if you do n't like to hear it , you can avail yourself of the open air .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 29]: You give it mouth enough , you do ; but give it mouth in your own building at least , ' remonstrated E. W. B. with stern irony .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 16]: ` Do n't give it mouth in this building , till you 're called upon .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 15]: You have got some building of your own I dare say , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 15]: ` Perhaps so , ' replied Mr. Bounderby , rattling his money and laughing .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 18]: ` Then give it mouth in your own building , will you , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 3]: said Childers .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 20]: ` Because this is n't a strong building , and too much of you might bring it down ! '
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 26]: Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again , he turned from him , as from a man finally disposed of , to Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 42]: ` Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago , and then was seen to slip out himself , with his hat over his eyes , and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 18]: She will never believe it of him , but he has cut away and left her . '
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 19]: ` Pray , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` why will she never believe it of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 7]: ` Because those two were one .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 6]: Because they were never asunder .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 30]: Because , up to this time , he seemed to dote upon her , ' said Childers , taking a step or two to look into the empty trunk .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 37]: Both Mr. Childers and Master Kidderminster walked in a curious manner ; with their legs wider apart than the general run of men , and with a very knowing assumption of being stiff in the knees .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 27]: This walk was common to all the male members of Sleary 's company , and was understood to express , that they were always on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 4]: ` Poor Sissy !
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 26]: He had better have apprenticed her , ' said Childers , giving his hair another shake , as he looked up from the empty box .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 13]: ` Now , he leaves her without anything to take to . '
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 26]: ` It is creditable to you , who have never been apprenticed , to express that opinion , ' returned Mr. Gradgrind , approvingly . '
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 4]: I never apprenticed ?
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 11]: I was apprenticed when I was seven year old . '
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 3]: Indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 17]: said Mr. Gradgrind , rather resentfully , as having been defrauded of his good opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 29]: I was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to -- ' ` Idleness , ' Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 8]: ` No , by the Lord Harry !
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 4]: Nor I ! '
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 34]: ` Her father always had it in his head , ' resumed Childers , feigning unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby 's existence , ` that she was to be taught the deuce-and-all of education .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: How it got into his head , I ca n't say ; I can only say that it never got out .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 40]: He has been picking up a bit of reading for her , here -- and a bit of writing for her , there -- and a bit of ciphering for her , somewhere else -- these seven years . '
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 39]: Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets , stroked his face and chin , and looked , with a good deal of doubt and a little hope , at Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 19]: From the first he had sought to conciliate that gentleman , for the sake of the deserted girl .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 22]: ` When Sissy got into the school here , ' he pursued , ` her father was as pleased as Punch .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 24]: I could n't altogether make out why , myself , as we were not stationary here , being but comers and goers anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 25]: I suppose , however , he had this move in his mind -- he was always half-cracked -- and then considered her provided for .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 57]: If you should happen to have looked in to-night , for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service , ' said Mr. Childers , stroking his face again , and repeating his look , ` it would be very fortunate and well-timed ; very fortunate and well-timed . '
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 11]: ` On the contrary , ' returned Mr. Gradgrind . '
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 26]: I came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school , and that she must not attend any more .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 28]: Still , if her father really has left her , without any connivance on her part -- Bounderby , let me have a word with you . '
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 32]: Upon this , Mr. Childers politely betook himself , with his equestrian walk , to the landing outside the door , and there stood stroking his face , and softly whistling .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 17]: While thus engaged , he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby 's voice as ` No .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 4]: I say no .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: I advise you not .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 7]: I say by no means . '
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 45]: While , from Mr. Gradgrind , he heard in his much lower tone the words , ` But even as an example to Louisa , of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity , leads to and ends in .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 13]: Think of it , Bounderby , in that point of view . '
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 49]: Meanwhile , the various members of Sleary 's company gradually gathered together from the upper regions , where they were quartered , and , from standing about , talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers , gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 41]: There were two or three handsome young women among them , with their two or three husbands , and their two or three mothers , and their eight or nine little children , who did the fairy business when required .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 90]: The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the families on the top of a great pole ; the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those fathers , with Master Kidderminster for the apex , and himself for the base ; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks , stand upon bottles , catch knives and balls , twirl hand-basins , ride upon anything , jump over everything , and stick at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 62]: All the mothers could -LRB- and did -RRB- dance , upon the slack wire and the tight-rope , and perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds ; none of them were at all particular in respect of showing their legs ; and one of them , alone in a Greek chariot , drove six in hand into every town they came to .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 50]: They all assumed to be mighty rakish and knowing , they were not very tidy in their private dresses , they were not at all orderly in their domestic arrangements , and the combined literature of the whole company would have produced but a poor letter on any subject .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 61]: Yet there was a remarkable gentleness and childishness about these people , a special inaptitude for any kind of sharp practice , and an untiring readiness to help and pity one another , deserving often of as much respect , and always of as much generous construction , as the every-day virtues of any class of people in the world .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 61]: Last of all appeared Mr. Sleary : a stout man as already mentioned , with one fixed eye , and one loose eye , a voice -LRB- if it can be called so -RRB- like the efforts of a broken old pair of bellows , a flabby surface , and a muddled head which was never sober and never drunk .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: ` Thquire ! '
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 28]: said Mr. Sleary , who was troubled with asthma , and whose breath came far too thick and heavy for the letter s , ` Your thervant !
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 11]: Thith ith a bad piethe of bithnith , thith ith .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 16]: You 've heard of my Clown and hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed ? '
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 11]: He addressed Mr. Gradgrind , who answered ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 30]: ` Well , Thquire , ' he returned , taking off his hat , and rubbing the lining with his pocket-handkerchief , which he kept inside for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 17]: ` Ith it your intenthion to do anything for the poor girl , Thquire ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 18]: I shall have something to propose to her when she comes back , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 8]: ` Glad to hear it , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 22]: Not that I want to get rid of the child , any more than I want to thtand in her way .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 15]: I 'm willing to take her prentith , though at her age ith late .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 69]: My voithe ith a little huthky , Thquire , and not eathy heard by them ath do n't know me ; but if you 'd been chilled and heated , heated and chilled , chilled and heated in the ring when you wath young , ath often ath I have been , your voithe would n't have lathted out , Thquire , no more than mine . ' '
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 10]: I dare say not , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 12]: ` What thall it be , Thquire , while you wait ?
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 5]: Thall it be Therry ?
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: Give it a name , Thquire ! '
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 8]: said Mr. Sleary , with hospitable ease .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 14]: ` Nothing for me , I thank you , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 8]: ` Do n't thay nothing , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 6]: What doth your friend thay ?
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 16]: If you have n't took your feed yet , have a glath of bitterth . '
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 64]: Here his daughter Josephine -- a pretty fair-haired girl of eighteen , who had been tied on a horse at two years old , and had made a will at twelve , which she always carried about with her , expressive of her dying desire to be drawn to the grave by the two piebald ponies -- cried , ` Father , hush !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 6]: she has come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 17]: Then came Sissy Jupe , running into the room as she had run out of it .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 62]: And when she saw them all assembled , and saw their looks , and saw no father there , she broke into a most deplorable cry , and took refuge on the bosom of the most accomplished tight-rope lady -LRB- herself in the family-way -RRB- , who knelt down on the floor to nurse her , and to weep over her .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 17]: ` Ith an internal thame , upon my thoul it ith , ' said Sleary . '
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 15]: O my dear father , my good kind father , where are you gone ?
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 14]: You are gone to try to do me some good , I know !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 12]: You are gone away for my sake , I am sure !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 22]: And how miserable and helpless you will be without me , poor , poor father , until you come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 58]: It was so pathetic to hear her saying many things of this kind , with her face turned upward , and her arms stretched out as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it , that no one spoke a word until Mr. Bounderby -LRB- growing impatient -RRB- took the case in hand .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 19]: ` Now , good people all , ' said he , ` this is wanton waste of time .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 7]: Let the girl understand the fact .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 20]: Let her take it from me , if you like , who have been run away from , myself .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 7]: Here , what 's your name !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 24]: Your father has absconded -- deserted you -- and you must n't expect to see him again as long as you live . '
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 43]: They cared so little for plain Fact , these people , and were in that advanced state of degeneracy on the subject , that instead of being impressed by the speaker 's strong common sense , they took it in extraordinary dudgeon .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 7]: The men muttered ` Shame ! '
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 7]: and the women ` Brute ! '
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 18]: and Sleary , in some haste , communicated the following hint , apart to Mr. Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 7]: I tell you what , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 21]: To thpeak plain to you , my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort , and drop it .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 51]: They 're a very good natur 'd people , my people , but they 're accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh ; and if you do n't act upon my advithe , I 'm damned if I do n't believe they 'll pith you out o ' winder . '
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 23]: Mr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion , Mr. Gradgrind found an opening for his eminently practical exposition of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 28]: ` It is of no moment , ' said he , ` whether this person is to be expected back at any time , or the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 15]: He is gone away , and there is no present expectation of his return .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 12]: That , I believe , is agreed on all hands . '
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 6]: ` Thath agreed , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 5]: Thick to that ! '
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 3]: From Sleary .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 4]: ` Well then .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 66]: I , who came here to inform the father of the poor girl , Jupe , that she could not be received at the school any more , in consequence of there being practical objections , into which I need not enter , to the reception there of the children of persons so employed , am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 21]: I am willing to take charge of you , Jupe , and to educate you , and provide for you .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 31]: The only condition -LRB- over and above your good behaviour -RRB- I make is , that you decide now , at once , whether to accompany me or remain here .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 27]: Also , that if you accompany me now , it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: These observations comprise the whole of the case . '
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 32]: ` At the thame time , ' said Sleary , ' I mutht put in my word , Thquire , tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 23]: If you like , Thethilia , to be prentitht , you know the natur of the work and you know your companionth .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 31]: Emma Gordon , in whothe lap you 're a lying at prethent , would be a mother to you , and Joth ` phine would be a thithter to you .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 44]: I do n't pretend to be of the angel breed myself , and I do n't thay but what , when you mith 'd your tip , you 'd find me cut up rough , and thwear an oath or two at you .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 53]: But what I thay , Thquire , ith , that good tempered or bad tempered , I never did a horthe a injury yet , no more than thwearing at him went , and that I do n't expect I thall begin otherwithe at my time of life , with a rider .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 18]: I never wath much of a Cackler , Thquire , and I have thed my thay . '
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 88]: The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind , who received it with a grave inclination of his head , and then remarked : ` The only observation I will make to you , Jupe , in the way of influencing your decision , is , that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education , and that even your father himself -LRB- from what I understand -RRB- appears , on your behalf , to have known and felt that much . '
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 10]: The last words had a visible effect upon her .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 24]: She stopped in her wild crying , a little detached herself from Emma Gordon , and turned her face full upon her patron .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 27]: The whole company perceived the force of the change , and drew a long breath together , that plainly said , ` she will go ! '
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 23]: ` Be sure you know your own mind , Jupe , ' Mr. Gradgrind cautioned her ; ' I say no more .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 9]: Be sure you know your own mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 34]: ` When father comes back , ' cried the girl , bursting into tears again after a minute 's silence , ` how will he ever find me if I go away ! '
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 39]: ` You may be quite at ease , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , calmly ; he worked out the whole matter like a sum : ` you may be quite at ease , Jupe , on that score .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 20]: In such a case , your father , I apprehend , must find out Mr. -- ' ` Thleary .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 6]: Thath my name , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 5]: Not athamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 12]: Known all over England , and alwayth paythe ith way . '
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 17]: ` Must find out Mr. Sleary , who would then let him know where you went .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 31]: I should have no power of keeping you against his wish , and he would have no difficulty , at any time , in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 6]: I am well known . '
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 14]: ` Well known , ' assented Mr. Sleary , rolling his loose eye .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 22]: ` You 're one of the thort , Thquire , that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 8]: But never mind that at prethent . '
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 43]: There was another silence ; and then she exclaimed , sobbing with her hands before her face , ` Oh , give me my clothes , give me my clothes , and let me go away before I break my heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 36]: The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together -- it was soon done , for they were not many -- and to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with them .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 17]: Sissy sat all the time upon the ground , still sobbing , and covering her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 17]: Mr. Gradgrind and his friend Bounderby stood near the door , ready to take her away .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 39]: Mr. Sleary stood in the middle of the room , with the male members of the company about him , exactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his daughter Josephine 's performance .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 7]: He wanted nothing but his whip .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 24]: The basket packed in silence , they brought her bonnet to her , and smoothed her disordered hair , and put it on .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 43]: Then they pressed about her , and bent over her in very natural attitudes , kissing and embracing her : and brought the children to take leave of her ; and were a tender-hearted , simple , foolish set of women altogether .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 10]: ` Now , Jupe , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 10]: ` If you are quite determined , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 81]: But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet , and every one of them had to unfold his arms -LRB- for they all assumed the professional attitude when they found themselves near Sleary -RRB- , and give her a parting kiss -- Master Kidderminster excepted , in whose young nature there was an original flavour of the misanthrope , who was also known to have harboured matrimonial views , and who moodily withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 8]: Mr. Sleary was reserved until the last .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 53]: Opening his arms wide he took her by both her hands , and would have sprung her up and down , after the riding-master manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid act ; but there was no rebound in Sissy , and she only stood before him crying .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 7]: ` Good-bye , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 3]: said Sleary .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 26]: ` You 'll make your fortun , I hope , and none of our poor folkth will ever trouble you , I 'll pound it .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 24]: I with your father had n't taken hith dog with him ; ith a ill-conwenienth to have the dog out of the billth .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 23]: But on thecond thoughth , he would n't have performed without hith mathter , tho ith ath broad ath ith long ! '
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 37]: With that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye , surveyed his company with his loose one , kissed her , shook his head , and handed her to Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 35]: ` There the ith , Thquire , ' he said , sweeping her with a professional glance as if she were being adjusted in her seat , ` and the 'll do you juthtithe .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 5]: Good-bye , Thethilia ! '
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 6]: ` Good-bye , Cecilia ! '
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 6]: ` Good-bye , Sissy ! '
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 8]: ` God bless you , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 10]: In a variety of voices from all the room .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 44]: But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her bosom , and he now interposed with ` Leave the bottle , my dear ; ith large to carry ; it will be of no uthe to you now .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 6]: Give it to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 9]: she said , in another burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 5]: ` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 12]: Pray let me keep it for father till he comes back !
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 9]: He will want it when he comes back .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 15]: He had never thought of going away , when he sent me for it .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 12]: I must keep it for him , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 8]: ` Tho be it , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 10]: -LRB- You thee how it ith , Thquire ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 4]: Farewell , Thethilia !
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 26]: My latht wordth to you ith thith , Thtick to the termth of your engagement , be obedient to the Thquire , and forget uth .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 50]: But if , when you 're grown up and married and well off , you come upon any horthe-riding ever , do n't be hard upon it , do n't be croth with it , give it a Bethpeak if you can , and think you might do wurth .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 43]: People mutht be amuthed , Thquire , thomehow , ' continued Sleary , rendered more pursy than ever , by so much talking ; ` they ca n't be alwayth a working , nor yet they ca n't be alwayth a learning .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 10]: Make the betht of uth ; not the wurtht .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 47]: I 've got my living out of the horthe-riding all my life , I know ; but I conthider that I lay down the philothophy of the thubject when I thay to you , Thquire , make the betht of uth : not the wurtht ! '
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 38]: The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the fixed eye of Philosophy -- and its rolling eye , too -- soon lost the three figures and the basket in the darkness of the street .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 27]: Chapter VII -- Mrs. Sparsit Mr. Bounderby being a bachelor , an elderly lady presided over his establishment , in consideration of a certain annual stipend .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 35]: Mrs. Sparsit was this lady 's name ; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby 's car , as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 16]: For , Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days , but was highly connected .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 14]: She had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady Scadgers .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 29]: Mr. Sparsit , deceased , of whom she was the relict , had been by the mother 's side what Mrs. Sparsit still called ' a Powler . '
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 41]: Strangers of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not to know what a Powler was , and even to appear uncertain whether it might be a business , or a political party , or a profession of faith .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 65]: The better class of minds , however , did not need to be informed that the Powlers were an ancient stock , who could trace themselves so exceedingly far back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost themselves -- which they had rather frequently done , as respected horse-flesh , blind-hookey , Hebrew monetary transactions , and the Insolvent Debtors ' Court .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 27]: The late Mr. Sparsit , being by the mother 's side a Powler , married this lady , being by the father 's side a Scadgers .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 73]: Lady Scadgers -LRB- an immensely fat old woman , with an inordinate appetite for butcher 's meat , and a mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen years -RRB- contrived the marriage , at a period when Sparsit was just of age , and chiefly noticeable for a slender body , weakly supported on two long slim props , and surmounted by no head worth mentioning .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 27]: He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle , but owed it all before he came into it , and spent it twice over immediately afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 46]: Thus , when he died , at twenty-four -LRB- the scene of his decease , Calais , and the cause , brandy -RRB- , he did not leave his widow , from whom he had been separated soon after the honeymoon , in affluent circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 43]: That bereaved lady , fifteen years older than he , fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative , Lady Scadgers ; and , partly to spite her ladyship , and partly to maintain herself , went out at a salary .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 38]: And here she was now , in her elderly days , with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit , making Mr. Bounderby 's tea as he took his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 39]: If Bounderby had been a Conqueror , and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he took about as a feature in his state-processions , he could not have made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 24]: Just as it belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction , so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit 's .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 46]: In the measure that he would not allow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable circumstance , he brightened Mrs. Sparsit 's juvenile career with every possible advantage , and showered waggon-loads of early roses all over that lady 's path .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 20]: ` And yet , sir , ' he would say , ` how does it turn out after all ?
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 35]: Why here she is at a hundred a year -LRB- I give her a hundred , which she is pleased to term handsome -RRB- , keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ! '
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 30]: Nay , he made this foil of his so very widely known , that third parties took it up , and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 27]: It was one of the most exasperating attributes of Bounderby , that he not only sang his own praises but stimulated other men to sing them .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 10]: There was a moral infection of clap-trap in him .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 25]: Strangers , modest enough elsewhere , started up at dinners in Coketown , and boasted , in quite a rampant way , of Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 51]: They made him out to be the Royal arms , the Union -- Jack , Magna Charta , John Bull , Habeas Corpus , the Bill of Rights , An Englishman 's house is his castle , Church and State , and God save the Queen , all put together .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 66]: And as often -LRB- and it was very often -RRB- as an orator of this kind brought into his peroration , ` Princes and lords may flourish or may fade , A breath can make them , as a breath has made , ' -- it was , for certain , more or less understood among the company that he had heard of Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 24]: ` Mr. Bounderby , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` you are unusually slow , sir , with your breakfast this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 67]: ` Why , ma'am , ' he returned , ' I am thinking about Tom Gradgrind 's whim ; ' Tom Gradgrind , for a bluff independent manner of speaking -- as if somebody were always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to say Thomas , and he would n't ; ` Tom Gradgrind 's whim , ma'am , of bringing up the tumbling-girl . '
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 32]: ` The girl is now waiting to know , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` whether she is to go straight to the school , or up to the Lodge . '
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 16]: ` She must wait , ma'am , ' answered Bounderby , 'till I know myself .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 12]: We shall have Tom Gradgrind down here presently , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 22]: If he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer , of course she can , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 15]: ` Of course she can if you wish it , Mr. Bounderby . ' '
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 35]: I told him I would give her a shake-down here , last night , in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 6]: ` Indeed , Mr. Bounderby ?
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 6]: Very thoughtful of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 26]: Mrs. Sparsit 's Coriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils , and her black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 27]: ` It 's tolerably clear to me , ' said Bounderby , ` that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship . '
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 13]: ` Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind , Mr. Bounderby ? '
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 12]: ` Yes , ma'am , I 'm speaking of Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 39]: ` Your observation being limited to `` little puss , '' ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` and there being two little girls in question , I did not know which might be indicated by that expression . '
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: ` Louisa , ' repeated Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 6]: ` Louisa , Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 12]: ` You are quite another father to Louisa , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 35]: Mrs. Sparsit took a little more tea ; and , as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup , rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking the infernal gods .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 32]: ` If you had said I was another father to Tom -- young Tom , I mean , not my friend Tom Gradgrind -- you might have been nearer the mark .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 11]: I am going to take young Tom into my office .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 11]: Going to have him under my wing , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 3]: ` Indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 12]: Rather young for that , is he not , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 31]: Mrs. Spirit 's ` sir , ' in addressing Mr. Bounderby , was a word of ceremony , rather exacting consideration for herself in the use , than honouring him .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 25]: ` I 'm not going to take him at once ; he is to finish his educational cramming before then , ' said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 17]: ` By the Lord Harry , he 'll have enough of it , first and last !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 29]: He 'd open his eyes , that boy would , if he knew how empty of learning my young maw was , at his time of life . '
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 20]: Which , by the by , he probably did know , for he had heard of it often enough .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 24]: ` But it 's extraordinary the difficulty I have on scores of such subjects , in speaking to any one on equal terms .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 16]: Here , for example , I have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 9]: Why , what do you know about tumblers ?
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 40]: At the time when , to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets , would have been a godsend to me , a prize in the lottery to me , you were at the Italian Opera .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 38]: You were coming out of the Italian Opera , ma'am , in white satin and jewels , a blaze of splendour , when I had n't a penny to buy a link to light you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 30]: I certainly , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a dignity serenely mournful , ` was familiar with the Italian Opera at a very early age . '
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 22]: ` Egad , ma'am , so was I , ' said Bounderby , ' -- with the wrong side of it .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 16]: A hard bed the pavement of its Arcade used to make , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 28]: People like you , ma'am , accustomed from infancy to lie on Down feathers , have no idea how hard a paving-stone is , without trying it .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 16]: No , no , it 's of no use my talking to you about tumblers .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 27]: I should speak of foreign dancers , and the West End of London , and May Fair , and lords and ladies and honourables . ' '
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 28]: I trust , sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , with decent resignation , ` it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 15]: I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 38]: If I have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences , and can scarcely hear enough of them , I claim no merit for that , since I believe it is a general sentiment . '
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 43]: ` Well , ma'am , ' said her patron , ` perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear , in his own unpolished way , what Josiah Bounderby , of Coketown , has gone through .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 16]: But you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury , yourself .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 17]: Come , ma'am , you know you were born in the lap of luxury . ' '
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 22]: I do not , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit with a shake of her head , ` deny it . '
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 32]: Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table , and stand with his back to the fire , looking at her ; she was such an enhancement of his position .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 8]: ` And you were in crack society .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 12]: Devilish high society , ' he said , warming his legs .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 32]: ` It is true , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , with an affectation of humility the very opposite of his , and therefore in no danger of jostling it .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 20]: ` You were in the tiptop fashion , and all the rest of it , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 19]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a kind of social widowhood upon her .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 7]: ` It is unquestionably true . '
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 21]: Mr. Bounderby , bending himself at the knees , literally embraced his legs in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 26]: Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced , he received the former with a shake of the hand , and the latter with a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 10]: ` Can Jupe be sent here , Bounderby ? '
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 4]: asked Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 6]: So Jupe was sent there .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 31]: On coming in , she curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby , and to his friend Tom Gradgrind , and also to Louisa ; but in her confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 24]: Observing this , the blustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make : ` Now , I tell you what , my girl .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 13]: The name of that lady by the teapot , is Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 17]: That lady acts as mistress of this house , and she is a highly connected lady .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 36]: Consequently , if ever you come again into any room in this house , you will make a short stay in it if you do n't behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 23]: Now , I do n't care a button what you do to me , because I do n't affect to be anybody .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 23]: So far from having high connections I have no connections at all , and I come of the scum of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 31]: But towards that lady , I do care what you do ; and you shall do what is deferential and respectful , or you shall not come here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 24]: I hope , Bounderby , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , in a conciliatory voice , ` that this was merely an oversight . '
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 22]: ` My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests , Mrs. Sparsit , ' said Bounderby , ` that this was merely an oversight .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 3]: Very likely .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 20]: However , as you are aware , ma'am , I do n't allow of even oversights towards you . '
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 22]: ` You are very good indeed , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , shaking her head with her State humility .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 9]: ` It is not worth speaking of . '
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 31]: Sissy , who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in her eyes , was now waved over by the master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 66]: She stood looking intently at him , and Louisa stood coldly by , with her eyes upon the ground , while he proceeded thus : ` Jupe , I have made up my mind to take you into my house ; and , when you are not in attendance at the school , to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind , who is rather an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 47]: I have explained to Miss Louisa -- this is Miss Louisa -- the miserable but natural end of your late career ; and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past , and is not to be referred to any more .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 8]: From this time you begin your history .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 12]: You are , at present , ignorant , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 14]: ` Yes , sir , very , ' she answered , curtseying . '
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 39]: I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated ; and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you , of the advantages of the training you will receive .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 7]: You will be reclaimed and formed .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 26]: You have been in the habit now of reading to your father , and those people I found you among , I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 19]: said Mr. Gradgrind , beckoning her nearer to him before he said so , and dropping his voice .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 9]: ` Only to father and Merrylegs , sir .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 14]: At least I mean to father , when Merrylegs was always there . '
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 18]: ` Never mind Merrylegs , Jupe , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , with a passing frown . '
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 7]: I do n't ask about him .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 16]: I understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father ? '
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 11]: ` O , yes , sir , thousands of times .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 19]: They were the happiest -- O , of all the happy times we had together , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 16]: It was only now when her sorrow broke out , that Louisa looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 26]: ` And what , ' asked Mr. Gradgrind , in a still lower voice , ` did you read to your father , Jupe ? '
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 33]: ` About the Fairies , sir , and the Dwarf , and the Hunchback , and the Genies , ' she sobbed out ; ` and about -- ' ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 9]: said Mr. Gradgrind , ` that is enough .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: Never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 19]: Bounderby , this is a case for rigid training , and I shall observe it with interest . '
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 26]: ` Well , ' returned Mr. Bounderby , ' I have given you my opinion already , and I should n't do as you do .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 8]: But , very well , very well .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 11]: Since you are bent upon it , very well ! '
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 31]: So , Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to Stone Lodge , and on the way Louisa never spoke one word , good or bad .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 9]: And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 20]: And Mrs. Sparsit got behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat , all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 17]: Chapter VIII -- Never Wonder LET us strike the key-note again , before pursuing the tune .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 58]: When she was half a dozen years younger , Louisa had been overheard to begin a conversation with her brother one day , by saying ` Tom , I wonder ' -- upon which Mr. Gradgrind , who was the person overhearing , stepped forth into the light and said , ` Louisa , never wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 25]: Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and affections .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 3]: Never wonder .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 20]: By means of addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , settle everything somehow , and never wonder .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 24]: Bring to me , says M'Choakumchild , yonder baby just able to walk , and I will engage that it shall never wonder .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 44]: Now , besides very many babies just able to walk , there happened to be in Coketown a considerable population of babies who had been walking against time towards the infinite world , twenty , thirty , forty , fifty years and more .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 65]: These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any human society , the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one another 's faces and pulled one another 's hair by way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement -- which they never did ; a surprising circumstance , when the happy adaptation of the means to the end is considered .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 35]: Still , although they differed in every other particular , conceivable and inconceivable -LRB- especially inconceivable -RRB- , they were pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were never to wonder .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 12]: Body number one , said they must take everything on trust .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 13]: Body number two , said they must take everything on political economy .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 32]: Body number three , wrote leaden little books for them , showing how the good grown-up baby invariably got to the Savings-bank , and the bad grown-up baby invariably got transported .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 44]: Body number four , under dreary pretences of being droll -LRB- when it was very melancholy indeed -RRB- , made the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge , into which it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 13]: But , all the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 14]: There was a library in Coketown , to which general access was easy .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 47]: Mr. Gradgrind greatly tormented his mind about what the people read in this library : a point whereon little rivers of tabular statements periodically flowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements , which no diver ever got to any depth in and came up sane .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 19]: It was a disheartening circumstance , but a melancholy fact , that even these readers persisted in wondering .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 38]: They wondered about human nature , human passions , human hopes and fears , the struggles , triumphs and defeats , the cares and joys and sorrows , the lives and deaths of common men and women !
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 37]: They sometimes , after fifteen hours ' work , sat down to read mere fables about men and women , more or less like themselves , and about children , more or less like their own .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 27]: They took De Foe to their bosoms , instead of Euclid , and seemed to be on the whole more comforted by Goldsmith than by Cocker .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 33]: Mr. Gradgrind was for ever working , in print and out of print , at this eccentric sum , and he never could make out how it yielded this unaccountable product . '
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 9]: I am sick of my life , Loo .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 27]: I , hate it altogether , and I hate everybody except you , ' said the unnatural young Thomas Gradgrind in the hair-cutting chamber at twilight .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 11]: ` You do n't hate Sissy , Tom ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 10]: I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 11]: And she hates me , ' said Tom , moodily .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: ` No , she does not , Tom , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 8]: ` She must , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 13]: ` She must just hate and detest the whole set-out of us .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 17]: They 'll bother her head off , I think , before they have done with her .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 18]: Already she 's getting as pale as wax , and as heavy as -- I am . '
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 29]: Young Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting astride of a chair before the fire , with his arms on the back , and his sulky face on his arms .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 29]: His sister sat in the darker corner by the fireside , now looking at him , now looking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 33]: ` As to me , ' said Tom , tumbling his hair all manner of ways with his sulky hands , ' I am a Donkey , that 's what I am .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 32]: I am as obstinate as one , I am more stupid than one , I get as much pleasure as one , and I should like to kick like one . '
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 10]: ` Not me , I hope , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 11]: ` No , Loo ; I would n't hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 9]: I made an exception of you at first .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 54]: I do n't know what this -- jolly old -- Jaundiced Jail , ' Tom had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof , and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of this one , ` would be without you . '
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 5]: ` Indeed , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 9]: Do you really and truly say so ? '
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: ` Why , of course I do .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 10]: What 's the use of talking about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 26]: returned Tom , chafing his face on his coat-sleeve , as if to mortify his flesh , and have it in unison with his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 58]: ` Because , Tom , ' said his sister , after silently watching the sparks awhile , ` as I get older , and nearer growing up , I often sit wondering here , and think how unfortunate it is for me that I ca n't reconcile you to home better than I am able to do .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 9]: I do n't know what other girls know .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 12]: I ca n't play to you , or sing to you .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 46]: I ca n't talk to you so as to lighten your mind , for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about , when you are tired . '
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 29]: ` Well , no more do I. I am as bad as you in that respect ; and I am a Mule too , which you 're not .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 34]: If father was determined to make me either a Prig or a Mule , and I am not a Prig , why , it stands to reason , I must be a Mule .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 11]: And so I am , ' said Tom , desperately .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 33]: ` It 's a great pity , ' said Louisa , after another pause , and speaking thoughtfully out of her dark corner : ` it 's a great pity , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 10]: It 's very unfortunate for both of us . '
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 27]: You , ' said Tom ; ` you are a girl , Loo , and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 8]: I do n't miss anything in you .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 26]: You are the only pleasure I have -- you can brighten even this place -- and you can always lead me as you like . '
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 28]: ` You are a dear brother , Tom ; and while you think I can do such things , I do n't so much mind knowing better .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 16]: Though I do know better , Tom , and am very sorry for it . '
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 15]: She came and kissed him , and went back into her corner again . '
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 59]: I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much about , ' said Tom , spitefully setting his teeth , ` and all the Figures , and all the people who found them out : and I wish I could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them , and blow them all up together !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 18]: However , when I go to live with old Bounderby , I 'll have my revenge . '
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 8]: ` Your revenge , Tom ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 21]: I mean , I 'll enjoy myself a little , and go about and see something , and hear something .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 16]: I 'll recompense myself for the way in which I have been brought up . '
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 10]: ` But do n't disappoint yourself beforehand , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 21]: Mr. Bounderby thinks as father thinks , and is a great deal rougher , and not half so kind . '
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 12]: said Tom , laughing ; ' I do n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 14]: I shall very well know how to manage and smooth old Bounderby ! '
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 42]: Their shadows were defined upon the wall , but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling , as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 36]: Or , a fanciful imagination -- if such treason could have been there -- might have made it out to be the shadow of their subject , and of its lowering association with their future .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 13]: ` What is your great mode of smoothing and managing , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 6]: Is it a secret ? '
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 16]: said Tom , ` if it is a secret , it 's not far off .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 4]: It 's you .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 18]: You are his little pet , you are his favourite ; he 'll do anything for you .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 30]: When he says to me what I do n't like , I shall say to him , `` My sister Loo will be hurt and disappointed , Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 19]: She always used to tell me she was sure you would be easier with me than this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 11]: That 'll bring him about , or nothing will . '
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 59]: After waiting for some answering remark , and getting none , Tom wearily relapsed into the present time , and twined himself yawning round and about the rails of his chair , and rumpled his head more and more , until he suddenly looked up , and asked : ` Have you gone to sleep , Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 5]: ` No , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 8]: I am looking at the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 21]: ` You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 15]: ` Another of the advantages , I suppose , of being a girl . '
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 54]: ` Tom , ' enquired his sister , slowly , and in a curious tone , as if she were reading what she asked in the fire , and it was not quite plainly written there , ` do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr. Bounderby 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 37]: ` Why , there 's one thing to be said of it , ' returned Tom , pushing his chair from him , and standing up ; ` it will be getting away from home . '
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 29]: ` There is one thing to be said of it , ' Louisa repeated in her former curious tone ; ` it will be getting away from home .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 23]: ` Not but what I shall be very unwilling , both to leave you , Loo , and to leave you here .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 40]: But I must go , you know , whether I like it or not ; and I had better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence , than where I should lose it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 6]: Do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 6]: ` Yes , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 52]: The answer was so long in coming , though there was no indecision in it , that Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair , to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her , from her point of view , and see what he could make of it .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 26]: ` Except that it is a fire , ' said Tom , ` it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 7]: What do you see in it ?
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: Not a circus ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 12]: I do n't see anything in it , Tom , particularly .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 22]: But since I have been looking at it , I have been wondering about you and me , grown up . '
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 5]: ` Wondering again ! '
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 18]: I have such unmanageable thoughts , ' returned his sister , ` that they will wonder . '
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 53]: ` Then I beg of you , Louisa , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind , who had opened the door without being heard , ` to do nothing of that description , for goodness ' sake , you inconsiderate girl , or I shall never hear the last of it from your father .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 63]: And , Thomas , it is really shameful , with my poor head continually wearing me out , that a boy brought up as you have been , and whose education has cost what yours has , should be found encouraging his sister to wonder , when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 55]: Louisa denied Tom 's participation in the offence ; but her mother stopped her with the conclusive answer , ` Louisa , do n't tell me , in my state of health ; for unless you had been encouraged , it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 26]: I was encouraged by nothing , mother , but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire , and whitening and dying .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 27]: It made me think , after all , how short my life would be , and how little I could hope to do in it . '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 8]: said Mrs. Gradgrind , rendered almost energetic .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 3]: ` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 41]: Do n't stand there and tell me such stuff , Louisa , to my face , when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father 's ears I should never hear the last of it .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 11]: After all the trouble that has been taken with you !
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 14]: After the lectures you have attended , and the experiments you have seen !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 61]: After I have heard you myself , when the whole of my right side has been benumbed , going on with your master about combustion , and calcination , and calorification , and I may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted , to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 56]: I wish , ' whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind , taking a chair , and discharging her strongest point before succumbing under these mere shadows of facts , ` yes , I really do wish that I had never had a family , and then you would have known what it was to do without me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 42]: Chapter IX -- Sissy 's Progress SISSY JUPE had not an easy time of it , between Mr. M'Choakumchild and Mrs. Gradgrind , and was not without strong impulses , in the first months of her probation , to run away .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 39]: It hailed facts all day long so very hard , and life in general was opened to her as such a closely ruled ciphering-book , that assuredly she would have run away , but for only one restraint .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 45]: It is lamentable to think of ; but this restraint was the result of no arithmetical process , was self-imposed in defiance of all calculation , and went dead against any table of probabilities that any Actuary would have drawn up from the premises .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 40]: The girl believed that her father had not deserted her ; she lived in the hope that he would come back , and in the faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she was .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 38]: The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation , rejecting the superior comfort of knowing , on a sound arithmetical basis , that her father was an unnatural vagabond , filled Mr. Gradgrind with pity .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 8]: Yet , what was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 147]: M'Choakumchild reported that she had a very dense head for figures ; that , once possessed with a general idea of the globe , she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact measurements ; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates , unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith ; that she would burst into tears on being required -LRB- by the mental process -RRB- immediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps at fourteen-pence halfpenny ; that she was as low down , in the school , as low could be ; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of Political Economy , she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler three feet high , for returning to the question , ` What is the first principle of this science ? '
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 20]: the absurd answer , ` To do unto others as I would that they should do unto me . '
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 58]: Mr. Gradgrind observed , shaking his head , that all this was very bad ; that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of knowledge , as per system , schedule , blue book , report , and tabular statements A to Z ; and that Jupe ` must be kept to it . '
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 15]: So Jupe was kept to it , and became low-spirited , but no wiser .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 15]: ` It would be a fine thing to be you , Miss Louisa ! '
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 22]: she said , one night , when Louisa had endeavoured to make her perplexities for next day something clearer to her .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 8]: ` Do you think so ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 9]: I should know so much , Miss Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 15]: All that is difficult to me now , would be so easy then . '
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 13]: ` You might not be the better for it , Sissy . '
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 20]: Sissy submitted , after a little hesitation , ' I should not be the worse , Miss Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 14]: To which Miss Louisa answered , ' I do n't know that . '
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 48]: There had been so little communication between these two -- both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference , and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy 's past career -- that they were still almost strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 24]: Sissy , with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa 's face , was uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 24]: ` You are more useful to my mother , and more pleasant with her than I can ever be , ' Louisa resumed .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 14]: ` You are pleasanter to yourself , than I am to myself . '
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 23]: ` But , if you please , Miss Louisa , ' Sissy pleaded , ' I am -- O so stupid ! '
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 17]: Louisa , with a brighter laugh than usual , told her she would be wiser by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 21]: ` You do n't know , ' said Sissy , half crying , ` what a stupid girl I am .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 8]: All through school hours I make mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 18]: Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild call me up , over and over again , regularly to make mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 6]: I ca n't help them .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 9]: They seem to come natural to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 18]: ` Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves , I suppose , Sissy ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 4]: O no ! '
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 4]: she eagerly returned .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 6]: ` They know everything . '
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 10]: ` Tell me some of your mistakes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 12]: I am almost ashamed , ' said Sissy , with reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 18]: ` But to-day , for instance , Mr. M'Choakumchild was explaining to us about Natural Prosperity . '
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 14]: ` National , I think it must have been , ' observed Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 6]: ` Yes , it was .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 9]: -- But is n't it the same ? '
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 4]: she timidly asked .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 22]: ` You had better say , National , as he said so , ' returned Louisa , with her dry reserve .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 4]: ` National Prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 12]: And he said , Now , this schoolroom is a Nation .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 12]: And in this nation , there are fifty millions of money .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 7]: Is n't this a prosperous nation ?
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 22]: Girl number twenty , is n't this a prosperous nation , and a 'n' t you in a thriving state ? '
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: ` What did you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 3]: asked Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 11]: ` Miss Louisa , I said I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 43]: I thought I could n't know whether it was a prosperous nation or not , and whether I was in a thriving state or not , unless I knew who had got the money , and whether any of it was mine .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 9]: But that had nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 17]: It was not in the figures at all , ' said Sissy , wiping her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 13]: ` That was a great mistake of yours , ' observed Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 13]: ` Yes , Miss Louisa , I know it was , now .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 10]: Then Mr. M'Choakumchild said he would try me again .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 39]: And he said , This schoolroom is an immense town , and in it there are a million of inhabitants , and only five-and-twenty are starved to death in the streets , in the course of a year .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 8]: What is your remark on that proportion ?
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 42]: And my remark was -- for I could n't think of a better one -- that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved , whether the others were a million , or a million million .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 8]: And that was wrong , too . '
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 7]: ` Of course it was . '
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 12]: ` Then Mr. M'Choakumchild said he would try me once more .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 17]: And he said , Here are the stutterings -- ' ` Statistics , ' said Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 27]: ` Yes , Miss Louisa -- they always remind me of stutterings , and that 's another of my mistakes -- of accidents upon the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 37]: And I find -LRB- Mr. M'Choakumchild said -RRB- that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages , and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 5]: What is the percentage ?
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 29]: And I said , Miss ; ' here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest error ; ' I said it was nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 6]: ` Nothing , Sissy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 17]: ` Nothing , Miss -- to the relations and friends of the people who were killed .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: I shall never learn , ' said Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 45]: ` And the worst of all is , that although my poor father wished me so much to learn , and although I am so anxious to learn , because he wished me to , I am afraid I do n't like it . '
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 27]: Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head , as it drooped abashed before her , until it was raised again to glance at her face .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 26]: Then she asked : ` Did your father know so much himself , that he wished you to be well taught too , Sissy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 50]: Sissy hesitated before replying , and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground , that Louisa added , ` No one hears us ; and if any one did , I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question . '
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 25]: ` No , Miss Louisa , ' answered Sissy , upon this encouragement , shaking her head ; ` father knows very little indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 26]: It 's as much as he can do to write ; and it 's more than people in general can do to read his writing .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 8]: Though it 's plain to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 5]: ` Your mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 9]: ` Father says she was quite a scholar .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 7]: She died when I was born .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 18]: She was ; ' Sissy made the terrible communication nervously ; ` she was a dancer . '
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 8]: ` Did your father love her ? '
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 32]: Louisa asked these questions with a strong , wild , wandering interest peculiar to her ; an interest gone astray like a banished creature , and hiding in solitary places . '
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 3]: O yes !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 7]: As dearly as he loves me .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 10]: Father loved me , first , for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 13]: He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 10]: We have never been asunder from that time . '
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 10]: ` Yet he leaves you now , Sissy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 6]: ` Only for my good .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 14]: Nobody understands him as I do ; nobody knows him as I do .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 28]: When he left me for my good -- he never would have left me for his own -- I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 16]: He will not be happy for a single minute , till he comes back . '
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 19]: ` Tell me more about him , ' said Louisa , ' I will never ask you again .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 6]: Where did you live ? '
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 16]: ` We travelled about the country , and had no fixed place to live in .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 16]: Father 's a ; ' Sissy whispered the awful word , ' a clown . '
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 8]: ` To make the people laugh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 9]: said Louisa , with a nod of intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 12]: But they would n't laugh sometimes , and then father cried .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 17]: Lately , they very often would n't laugh , and he used to come home despairing .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 6]: Father 's not like most .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 31]: Those who did n't know him as well as I do , and did n't love him as dearly as I do , might believe he was not quite right .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 27]: Sometimes they played tricks upon him ; but they never knew how he felt them , and shrunk up , when he was alone with me .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 11]: He was far , far timider than they thought ! '
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 10]: ` And you were his comfort through everything ? '
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 12]: She nodded , with the tears rolling down her face . '
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 10]: I hope so , and father said I was .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 53]: It was because he grew so scared and trembling , and because he felt himself to be a poor , weak , ignorant , helpless man -LRB- those used to be his words -RRB- , that he wanted me so much to know a great deal , and be different from him .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 19]: I used to read to him to cheer his courage , and he was very fond of that .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 27]: They were wrong books -- I am never to speak of them here -- but we did n't know there was any harm in them . '
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 7]: ` And he liked them ? '
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 14]: said Louisa , with a searching gaze on Sissy all this time . '
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 4]: O very much !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 14]: They kept him , many times , from what did him real harm .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 43]: And often and often of a night , he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story , or would have her head cut off before it was finished . '
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 8]: ` And your father was always kind ?
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 5]: To the last ? '
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 12]: asked Louisa contravening the great principle , and wondering very much .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 6]: ` Always , always ! '
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 7]: returned Sissy , clasping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 9]: ` Kinder and kinder than I can tell .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 17]: He was angry only one night , and that was not to me , but Merrylegs .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 16]: Merrylegs ; ' she whispered the awful fact ; ` is his performing dog . '
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 10]: ` Why was he angry with the dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 3]: Louisa demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 35]: ` Father , soon after they came home from performing , told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them -- which is one of his tricks .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 13]: He looked at father , and did n't do it at once .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 20]: Everything of father 's had gone wrong that night , and he had n't pleased the public at all .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 19]: He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing , and had no compassion on him .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 19]: Then he beat the dog , and I was frightened , and said , `` Father , father !
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 13]: Pray do n't hurt the creature who is so fond of you !
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 10]: O Heaven forgive you , father , stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 33]: And he stopped , and the dog was bloody , and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms , and the dog licked his face . '
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 25]: Louisa saw that she was sobbing ; and going to her , kissed her , took her hand , and sat down beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 13]: ` Finish by telling me how your father left you , Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 14]: Now that I have asked you so much , tell me the end .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 16]: The blame , if there is any blame , is mine , not yours . '
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 40]: ` Dear Miss Louisa , ' said Sissy , covering her eyes , and sobbing yet ; ' I came home from the school that afternoon , and found poor father just come home too , from the booth .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 16]: And he sat rocking himself over the fire , as if he was in pain .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 13]: And I said , `` Have you hurt yourself , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 24]: -LRB- as he did sometimes , like they all did -RRB- , and he said , `` A little , my darling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 21]: And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face , I saw that he was crying .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 38]: The more I spoke to him , the more he hid his face ; and at first he shook all over , and said nothing but `` My darling ; '' and `` My love ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 33]: Here Tom came lounging in , and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself , and not much of that at present . '
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 15]: I am asking Sissy a few questions , Tom , ' observed his sister .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 22]: ` You have no occasion to go away ; but do n't interrupt us for a moment , Tom dear . '
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 4]: very well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 3]: returned Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 19]: ` Only father has brought old Bounderby home , and I want you to come into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 30]: Because if you come , there 's a good chance of old Bounderby 's asking me to dinner ; and if you do n't , there 's none . '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 7]: ` I 'll come directly . '
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 17]: ` I 'll wait for you , ' said Tom , ` to make sure . '
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 7]: Sissy resumed in a lower voice .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 42]: ` At last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again , and never did give any satisfaction now , and that he was a shame and disgrace , and I should have done better without him all along .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 43]: I said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart , and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him , and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 25]: When I had no more left to tell , he put his arms round my neck , and kissed me a great many times .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 54]: Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used , for the little hurt he had had , and to get it at the best place , which was at the other end of town from there ; and then , after kissing me again , he let me go .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 42]: When I had gone down-stairs , I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet , and looked in at the door , and said , `` Father dear , shall I take Merrylegs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 36]: Father shook his head and said , `` No , Sissy , no ; take nothing that 's known to be mine , my darling ; '' and I left him sitting by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 14]: Then the thought must have come upon him , poor , poor father !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 22]: of going away to try something for my sake ; for when I came back , he was gone . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 9]: Look sharp for old Bounderby , Loo ! '
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 3]: Tom remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 11]: ` There 's no more to tell , Miss Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 17]: I keep the nine oils ready for him , and I know he will come back .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 34]: Every letter that I see in Mr. Gradgrind 's hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes , for I think it comes from father , or from Mr. Sleary about father .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 26]: Mr. Sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of , and I trust to him to keep his word . '
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 11]: ` Do look sharp for old Bounderby , Loo ! '
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 8]: said Tom , with an impatient whistle .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 13]: ` He 'll be off if you do n't look sharp ! '
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 49]: After this , whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the presence of his family , and said in a faltering way , ' I beg your pardon , sir , for being troublesome -- but -- have you had any letter yet about me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 24]: Louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment , whatever it was , and look for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 44]: And when Mr. Gradgrind regularly answered , ` No , Jupe , nothing of the sort , ' the trembling of Sissy 's lip would be repeated in Louisa 's face , and her eyes would follow Sissy with compassion to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 41]: Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these occasions by remarking , when she was gone , that if Jupe had been properly trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 30]: Yet it did seem -LRB- though not to him , for he saw nothing of it -RRB- as if fantastic hope could take as strong a hold as Fact .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 10]: This observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 22]: As to Tom , he was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is usually at work on number one .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 65]: As to Mrs. Gradgrind , if she said anything on the subject , she would come a little way out of her wrappers , like a feminine dormouse , and say : ` Good gracious bless me , how my poor head is vexed and worried by that girl Jupe 's so perseveringly asking , over and over again , about her tiresome letters !
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 34]: Upon my word and honour I seem to be fated , and destined , and ordained , to live in the midst of things that I am never to hear the last of .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 23]: It really is a most extraordinary circumstance that it appears as if I never was to hear the last of anything ! '
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 31]: At about this point , Mr. Gradgrind 's eye would fall upon her ; and under the influence of that wintry piece of fact , she would become torpid again .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 26]: Chapter X -- Stephen Blackpool I ENTERTAIN a weak idea that the English people are as hard-worked as any people upon whom the sun shines .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 20]: I acknowledge to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy , as a reason why I would give them a little more play .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 212]: In the hardest working part of Coketown ; in the innermost fortifications of that ugly citadel , where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in ; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts , and close streets upon streets , which had come into existence piecemeal , every piece in a violent hurry for some one man 's purpose , and the whole an unnatural family , shouldering , and trampling , and pressing one another to death ; in the last close nook of this great exhausted receiver , where the chimneys , for want of air to make a draught , were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked shapes , as though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be expected to be born in it ; among the multitude of Coketown , generically called ` the Hands , ' -- a race who would have found more favour with some people , if Providence had seen fit to make them only hands , or , like the lower creatures of the seashore , only hands and stomachs -- lived a certain Stephen Blackpool , forty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 12]: Stephen looked older , but he had had a hard life .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 57]: It is said that every life has its roses and thorns ; there seemed , however , to have been a misadventure or mistake in Stephen 's case , whereby somebody else had become possessed of his roses , and he had become possessed of the same somebody else 's thorns in addition to his own .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 14]: He had known , to use his words , a peck of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: He was usually called Old Stephen , in a kind of rough homage to the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 47]: A rather stooping man , with a knitted brow , a pondering expression of face , and a hard-looking head sufficiently capacious , on which his iron-grey hair lay long and thin , Old Stephen might have passed for a particularly intelligent man in his condition .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 5]: Yet he was not .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 38]: He took no place among those remarkable ` Hands , ' who , piecing together their broken intervals of leisure through many years , had mastered difficult sciences , and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely things .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 16]: He held no station among the Hands who could make speeches and carry on debates .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 15]: Thousands of his compeers could talk much better than he , at any time .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 14]: He was a good power-loom weaver , and a man of perfect integrity .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 22]: What more he was , or what else he had in him , if anything , let him show for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 64]: The lights in the great factories , which looked , when they were illuminated , like Fairy palaces -- or the travellers by express-train said so -- were all extinguished ; and the bells had rung for knocking off for the night , and had ceased again ; and the Hands , men and women , boy and girl , were clattering home .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 36]: Old Stephen was standing in the street , with the old sensation upon him which the stoppage of the machinery always produced -- the sensation of its having worked and stopped in his own head .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 11]: ` Yet I do n't see Rachael , still ! '
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 35]: It was a wet night , and many groups of young women passed him , with their shawls drawn over their bare heads and held close under their chins to keep the rain out .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 25]: He knew Rachael well , for a glance at any one of these groups was sufficient to show him that she was not there .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 34]: At last , there were no more to come ; and then he turned away , saying in a tone of disappointment , ` Why , then , ha ' missed her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 78]: But , he had not gone the length of three streets , when he saw another of the shawled figures in advance of him , at which he looked so keenly that perhaps its mere shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavement -- if he could have seen it without the figure itself moving along from lamp to lamp , brightening and fading as it went -- would have been enough to tell him who was there .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 35]: Making his pace at once much quicker and much softer , he darted on until he was very near this figure , then fell into his former walk , and called ` Rachael ! '
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 53]: She turned , being then in the brightness of a lamp ; and raising her hood a little , showed a quiet oval face , dark and rather delicate , irradiated by a pair of very gentle eyes , and further set off by the perfect order of her shining black hair .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 21]: It was not a face in its first bloom ; she was a woman five and thirty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 5]: ` Ah , lad !
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 5]: 'T is thou ? '
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 41]: When she had said this , with a smile which would have been quite expressed , though nothing of her had been seen but her pleasant eyes , she replaced her hood again , and they went on together . '
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 10]: I thought thou wast ahind me , Rachael ? '
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 10]: ` Early t ` night , lass ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 9]: Times I 'm a little early , Stephen !
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 6]: ` times a little late .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 12]: I 'm never to be counted on , going home . '
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 19]: ` Nor going t ` other way , neither , ' t seems to me , Rachael ? '
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 6]: ` No , Stephen . '
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 28]: He looked at her with some disappointment in his face , but with a respectful and patient conviction that she must be right in whatever she did .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 26]: The expression was not lost upon her ; she laid her hand lightly on his arm a moment as if to thank him for it .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 25]: ` We are such true friends , lad , and such old friends , and getting to be such old folk , now . '
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 16]: ` No , Rachael , thou ` rt as young as ever thou wast . '
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 64]: ` One of us would be puzzled how to get old , Stephen , without ' t other getting so too , both being alive , ' she answered , laughing ; ` but , anyways , we 're such old friends , and t ' hide a word of honest truth fro ' one another would be a sin and a pity .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 10]: 'T is better not to walk too much together .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 5]: ` Times , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 31]: ` Twould be hard , indeed , if 't was not to be at all , ' she said , with a cheerfulness she sought to communicate to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 8]: Tis hard , anyways , Rachael . '
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 13]: ` Try to think not ; and ` twill seem better . '
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 16]: ` I 've tried a long time , and ` ta ` nt got better .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 17]: But thou ` rt right ; ' t might mak fok talk , even of thee .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 40]: Thou hast been that to me , Rachael , through so many year : thou hast done me so much good , and heartened of me in that cheering way , that thy word is a law to me .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 10]: Ah , lass , and a bright good law !
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 7]: Better than some real ones . '
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 23]: ` Never fret about them , Stephen , ' she answered quickly , and not without an anxious glance at his face .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 7]: ` Let the laws be . '
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 14]: ` Yes , ' he said , with a slow nod or two .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 5]: ` Let 'em be .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 4]: Let everything be .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 5]: Let all sorts alone .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 11]: 'T is a muddle , and that 's aw . '
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: ` Always a muddle ? '
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 38]: said Rachael , with another gentle touch upon his arm , as if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness , in which he was biting the long ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 7]: The touch had its instantaneous effect .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 34]: He let them fall , turned a smiling face upon her , and said , as he broke into a good-humoured laugh , ` Ay , Rachael , lass , awlus a muddle .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: That 's where I stick .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 18]: I come to the muddle many times and agen , and I never get beyond it . '
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 13]: They had walked some distance , and were near their own homes .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 8]: The woman 's was the first reached .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 63]: It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker -LRB- who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood -RRB- kept a black ladder , in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might slide out of this working world by the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 18]: She stopped at the corner , and putting her hand in his , wished him good night .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 11]: ` Good night , dear lass ; good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 34]: She went , with her neat figure and her sober womanly step , down the dark street , and he stood looking after her until she turned into one of the small houses .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 37]: There was not a flutter of her coarse shawl , perhaps , but had its interest in this man 's eyes ; not a tone of her voice but had its echo in his innermost heart .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 30]: When she was lost to his view , he pursued his homeward way , glancing up sometimes at the sky , where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 50]: But , they were broken now , and the rain had ceased , and the moon shone , -- looking down the high chimneys of Coketown on the deep furnaces below , and casting Titanic shadows of the steam-engines at rest , upon the walls where they were lodged .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 15]: The man seemed to have brightened with the night , as he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 23]: His home , in such another street as the first , saving that it was narrower , was over a little shop .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 48]: How it came to pass that any people found it worth their while to sell or buy the wretched little toys , mixed up in its window with cheap newspapers and pork -LRB- there was a leg to be raffled for to-morrow-night -RRB- , matters not here .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 43]: He took his end of candle from a shelf , lighted it at another end of candle on the counter , without disturbing the mistress of the shop who was asleep in her little room , and went upstairs into his lodging .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 29]: It was a room , not unacquainted with the black ladder under various tenants ; but as neat , at present , as such a room could be .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 34]: A few books and writings were on an old bureau in a corner , the furniture was decent and sufficient , and , though the atmosphere was tainted , the room was clean .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 22]: Going to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round three-legged table standing there , he stumbled against something .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 24]: As he recoiled , looking down at it , it raised itself up into the form of a woman in a sitting attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 8]: ` Heaven 's mercy , woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 10]: he cried , falling farther off from the figure .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 8]: ` Hast thou come back again ! '
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 4]: Such a woman !
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 55]: A disabled , drunken creature , barely able to preserve her sitting posture by steadying herself with one begrimed hand on the floor , while the other was so purposeless in trying to push away her tangled hair from her face , that it only blinded her the more with the dirt upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 38]: A creature so foul to look at , in her tatters , stains and splashes , but so much fouler than that in her moral infamy , that it was a shameful thing even to see her .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 38]: After an impatient oath or two , and some stupid clawing of herself with the hand not necessary to her support , she got her hair away from her eyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 38]: Then she sat swaying her body to and fro , and making gestures with her unnerved arm , which seemed intended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter , though her face was stolid and drowsy .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 5]: ` Eigh , lad ?
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: What , yo ' r there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 24]: Some hoarse sounds meant for this , came mockingly out of her at last ; and her head dropped forward on her breast .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 5]: ` Back agen ? '
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 16]: she screeched , after some minutes , as if he had that moment said it .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 4]: And back agen .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 8]: Back agen ever and ever so often .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 2]: Back ?
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 4]: Yes , back .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 4]: Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 49]: Roused by the unmeaning violence with which she cried it out , she scrambled up , and stood supporting herself with her shoulders against the wall ; dangling in one hand by the string , a dunghill-fragment of a bonnet , and trying to look scornfully at him .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 28]: ` I 'll sell thee off again , and I 'll sell thee off again , and I 'll sell thee off a score of times ! '
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 17]: she cried , with something between a furious menace and an effort at a defiant dance .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 10]: ` Come awa ' from th ' bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 17]: He was sitting on the side of it , with his face hidden in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 4]: ` Come awa !
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 17]: from ` t. 'T is mine , and I 've a right to t ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 29]: As she staggered to it , he avoided her with a shudder , and passed -- his face still hidden -- to the opposite end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 14]: She threw herself upon the bed heavily , and soon was snoring hard .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 14]: He sunk into a chair , and moved but once all that night .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 25]: It was to throw a covering over her ; as if his hands were not enough to hide her , even in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 27]: Chapter XI -- No Way Out THE Fairy palaces burst into illumination , before pale morning showed the monstrous serpents of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 38]: A clattering of clogs upon the pavement ; a rapid ringing of bells ; and all the melancholy mad elephants , polished and oiled up for the day 's monotony , were at their heavy exercise again .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 13]: Stephen bent over his loom , quiet , watchful , and steady .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 32]: A special contrast , as every man was in the forest of looms where Stephen worked , to the crashing , smashing , tearing piece of mechanism at which he laboured .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 20]: Never fear , good people of an anxious turn of mind , that Art will consign Nature to oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 42]: Set anywhere , side by side , the work of GOD and the work of man ; and the former , even though it be a troop of Hands of very small account , will gain in dignity from the comparison .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 15]: So many hundred Hands in this Mill ; so many hundred horse Steam Power .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 85]: It is known , to the force of a single pound weight , what the engine will do ; but , not all the calculators of the National Debt can tell me the capacity for good or evil , for love or hatred , for patriotism or discontent , for the decomposition of virtue into vice , or the reverse , at any single moment in the soul of one of these its quiet servants , with the composed faces and the regulated actions .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 21]: There is no mystery in it ; there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them , for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 23]: -- Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects , and to govern these awful unknown quantities by other means !
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 17]: The day grew strong , and showed itself outside , even against the flaming lights within .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 12]: The lights were turned out , and the work went on .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 23]: The rain fell , and the Smoke-serpents , submissive to the curse of all that tribe , trailed themselves upon the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 40]: In the waste-yard outside , the steam from the escape pipe , the litter of barrels and old iron , the shining heaps of coals , the ashes everywhere , were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 10]: The work went on , until the noon-bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 6]: More clattering upon the pavements .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 16]: The looms , and wheels , and Hands all out of gear for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 20]: Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets , haggard and worn .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 81]: He turned from his own class and his own quarter , taking nothing but a little bread as he walked along , towards the hill on which his principal employer lived , in a red house with black outside shutters , green inside blinds , a black street door , up two white steps , BOUNDERBY -LRB- in letters very like himself -RRB- upon a brazen plate , and a round brazen door-handle underneath it , like a brazen full-stop .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 7]: Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 5]: So Stephen had expected .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 16]: Would his servant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him ?
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 10]: Message in return , requiring name of such Hand .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 3]: Stephen Blackpool .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 15]: There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool ; yes , he might come in .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: Stephen Blackpool in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 18]: Mr. Bounderby -LRB- whom he just knew by sight -RRB- , at lunch on chop and sherry .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 20]: Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside , in a side-saddle attitude , with one foot in a cotton stirrup .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 19]: It was a part , at once of Mrs. Sparsit 's dignity and service , not to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 20]: She supervised the meal officially , but implied that in her own stately person she considered lunch a weakness .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 19]: ` Now , Stephen , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` what 's the matter with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 5]: Stephen made a bow .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 12]: Not a servile one -- these Hands will never do that !
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 23]: Lord bless you , sir , you 'll never catch them at that , if they have been with you twenty years !
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 19]: -- and , as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit , tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 36]: ` Now , you know , ' said Mr. Bounderby , taking some sherry , ` we have never had any difficulty with you , and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 38]: You do n't expect to be set up in a coach and six , and to be fed on turtle soup and venison , with a gold spoon , as a good many of 'em do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 41]: Mr. Bounderby always represented this to be the sole , immediate , and direct object of any Hand who was not entirely satisfied ; ` and therefore I know already that you have not come here to make a complaint .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 14]: Now , you know , I am certain of that , beforehand . '
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 20]: ` No , sir , sure I ha ' not coom for nowt o ' th ' kind . '
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 12]: Mr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised , notwithstanding his previous strong conviction .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 8]: ` Very well , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 13]: ` You 're a steady Hand , and I was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 11]: Now , let me hear what it 's all about .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 13]: As it 's not that , let me hear what it is .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 7]: What have you got to say ?
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 7]: Out with it , lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 9]: Stephen happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit . '
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 30]: I can go , Mr. Bounderby , if you wish it , ' said that self-sacrificing lady , making a feint of taking her foot out of the stirrup .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 24]: Mr. Bounderby stayed her , by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension before swallowing it , and putting out his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 34]: Then , withdrawing his hand and swallowing his mouthful of chop , he said to Stephen : ` Now you know , this good lady is a born lady , a high lady .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 34]: You are not to suppose because she keeps my house for me , that she has n't been very high up the tree -- ah , up at the top of the tree !
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 26]: Now , if you have got anything to say that ca n't be said before a born lady , this lady will leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 24]: If what you have got to say can be said before a born lady , this lady will stay where she is . '
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 40]: ` Sir , I hope I never had nowt to say , not fitten for a born lady to year , sin ' I were born mysen ' , ' was the reply , accompanied with a slight flush .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 18]: ` Very well , ' said Mr. Bounderby , pushing away his plate , and leaning back .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 6]: ` Fire away ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 29]: I ha ' coom , ' Stephen began , raising his eyes from the floor , after a moment 's consideration , ` to ask yo yor advice .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 6]: I need ' t overmuch .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 16]: I were married on Eas ' r Monday nineteen year sin , long and dree .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 16]: She were a young lass -- pretty enow -- wi ' good accounts of herseln .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 6]: She went bad -- soon .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 5]: Not along of me .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 12]: Gonnows I were not a unkind husband to her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 12]: I have heard all this before , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 25]: ` She took to drinking , left off working , sold the furniture , pawned the clothes , and played old Gooseberry . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 8]: I were patient wi ' her . '
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 23]: -LRB- ` The more fool you , I think , ' said Mr. Bounderby , in confidence to his wine-glass . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 8]: I were very patient wi ' her .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 13]: I tried to wean her fra ' t ower and ower agen .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 14]: I tried this , I tried that , I tried t ` other .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 36]: I ha ' gone home , many 's the time , and found all vanished as I had in the world , and her without a sense left to bless herseln lying on bare ground .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 16]: I ha ' dun ' t not once , not twice -- twenty time ! '
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 24]: Every line in his face deepened as he said it , and put in its affecting evidence of the suffering he had undergone .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 11]: ` From bad to worse , from worse to worsen .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 4]: She left me .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 9]: She disgraced herseln everyways , bitter and bad .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 12]: She coom back , she coom back , she coom back .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 9]: What could I do t ' hinder her ?
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 16]: I ha ' walked the streets nights long , ere ever I 'd go home .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 24]: I ha ' gone t ' th ' brigg , minded to fling myseln ower , and ha ' no more o n't .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 17]: I ha ' bore that much , that I were owd when I were young . '
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 36]: Mrs. Sparsit , easily ambling along with her netting-needles , raised the Coriolanian eyebrows and shook her head , as much as to say , ` The great know trouble as well as the small .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 12]: Please to turn your humble eye in My direction . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 13]: I ha ' paid her to keep awa ' fra ' me .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: These five year I ha ' paid her .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 10]: I ha ' gotten decent fewtrils about me agen .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 23]: I ha ' lived hard and sad , but not ashamed and fearfo ' a ' the minnits o ' my life .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 7]: Last night , I went home .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: There she lay upon my har-stone !
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 5]: There she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 24]: In the strength of his misfortune , and the energy of his distress , he fired for the moment like a proud man .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 109]: In another moment , he stood as he had stood all the time -- his usual stoop upon him ; his pondering face addressed to Mr. Bounderby , with a curious expression on it , half shrewd , half perplexed , as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very difficult ; his hat held tight in his left hand , which rested on his hip ; his right arm , with a rugged propriety and force of action , very earnestly emphasizing what he said : not least so when it always paused , a little bent , but not withdrawn , as he paused . '
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 24]: I was acquainted with all this , you know , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` except the last clause , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 12]: It 's a bad job ; that 's what it is .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 16]: You had better have been satisfied as you were , and not have got married .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 11]: However , it 's too late to say that . '
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 15]: ` Was it an unequal marriage , sir , in point of years ? '
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 8]: ` You hear what this lady asks .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 17]: Was it an unequal marriage in point of years , this unlucky job of yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 4]: said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 7]: ` Not e ` en so .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 11]: I were one-and-twenty myseln ; she were twenty nighbut . '
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 6]: ` Indeed , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 12]: said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief , with great placidity . '
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 24]: I inferred , from its being so miserable a marriage , that it was probably an unequal one in point of years . '
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 21]: Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that had an odd sheepishness about it .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 9]: He fortified himself with a little more sherry .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 3]: ` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 8]: Why do n't you go on ? '
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 12]: he then asked , turning rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool . '
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 22]: I ha ' coom to ask yo , sir , how I am to be ridded o ' this woman . '
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 15]: Stephen infused a yet deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his attentive face .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 14]: Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation , as having received a moral shock .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 13]: said Bounderby , getting up to lean his back against the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 7]: ` What are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 10]: You took her for better for worse . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: I mun ' be ridden o ' her .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 8]: I can not bear ' t nommore .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 32]: I ha ' lived under ' t so long , for that I ha ' had 'n the pity and comforting words o ' th ' best lass living or dead .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 15]: Haply , but for her , I should ha ' gone battering mad . '
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 40]: ` He wishes to be free , to marry the female of whom he speaks , I fear , sir , ' observed Mrs. Sparsit in an undertone , and much dejected by the immorality of the people . '
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 7]: The lady says what 's right .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 26]: I were a coming to ` t. I ha ' read i ' th ' papers that great folk -LRB- fair faw 'em a ' !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 7]: I wishes 'em no hurt ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 30]: are not bonded together for better for worst so fast , but that they can be set free fro ' their misfortnet marriages , an ' marry ower agen .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 36]: When they dunnot agree , for that their tempers is ill-sorted , they has rooms o ' one kind an ' another in their houses , above a bit , and they can live asunders .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 13]: We fok ha ' only one room , and we ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 41]: When that wo n't do , they ha ' gowd an ' other cash , an ' they can say `` This for yo ' an ' that for me , '' an ' they can go their separate ways .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 4]: We ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 17]: Spite o ' all that , they can be set free for smaller wrongs than mine .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 20]: So , I mun be ridden o ' this woman , and I want t ' know how ? '
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 9]: ` No how , ' returned Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 19]: ` If I do her any hurt , sir , there 's a law to punish me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 7]: ` Of course there is . '
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 16]: ` If I flee from her , there 's a law to punish me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 7]: ` Of course there is . '
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 19]: ` If I marry t ` oother dear lass , there 's a law to punish me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 7]: ` Of course there is . '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 52]: ` If I was to live wi ' her an ' not marry her -- saying such a thing could be , which it never could or would , an ' her so good -- there 's a law to punish me , in every innocent child belonging to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 7]: ` Of course there is . '
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 24]: ` Now , a ' God 's name , ' said Stephen Blackpool , ` show me the law to help me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 3]: ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 27]: There 's a sanctity in this relation of life , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` and -- and -- it must be kept up . '
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 10]: ` No no , dunnot say that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 9]: ` Ta n't kep ' up that way .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 4]: Not that way .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 8]: 'T is kep ' down that way .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 33]: I 'm a weaver , I were in a fact ` ry when a chilt , but I ha ' gotten een to see wi ' and eern to year wi ' .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 22]: I read in th ' papers every ` Sizes , every Sessions -- and you read too -- I know it !
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 47]: -- with dismay -- how th ' supposed unpossibility o ' ever getting unchained from one another , at any price , on any terms , brings blood upon this land , and brings many common married fok to battle , murder , and sudden death .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 9]: Let us ha ' this , right understood .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 28]: Mine 's a grievous case , an ' I want -- if yo will be so good -- t ' know the law that helps me . '
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 9]: ` Now , I tell you what ! '
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 11]: said Mr. Bounderby , putting his hands in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 8]: ` There is such a law . '
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 19]: Stephen , subsiding into his quiet manner , and never wandering in his attention , gave a nod .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 10]: ` But it 's not for you at all .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 4]: It costs money .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 8]: It costs a mint of money . '
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 8]: ` How much might that be ? '
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 4]: Stephen calmly asked .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 96]: ` Why , you 'd have to go to Doctors ' Commons with a suit , and you 'd have to go to a court of Common Law with a suit , and you 'd have to go to the House of Lords with a suit , and you 'd have to get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again , and it would cost you -LRB- if it was a case of very plain sailing -RRB- , I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 7]: ` Perhaps twice the money . '
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 8]: ` There 's no other law ? '
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 5]: ` Certainly not . '
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 37]: ` Why then , sir , ' said Stephen , turning white , and motioning with that right hand of his , as if he gave everything to the four winds , '' tis a muddle .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 21]: 'T is just a muddle a ` toogether , an ' the sooner I am dead , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 13]: -LRB- Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 5]: ` Pooh , pooh !
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 51]: Do n't you talk nonsense , my good fellow , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` about things you do n't understand ; and do n't you call the Institutions of your country a muddle , or you 'll get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 27]: The institutions of your country are not your piece-work , and the only thing you have got to do , is , to mind your piece-work .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 18]: You did n't take your wife for fast and for loose ; but for better for worse .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 26]: If she has turned out worse -- why , all we have got to say is , she might have turned out better . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 19]: Tis a muddle , ' said Stephen , shaking his head as he moved to the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 7]: Tis a ' a muddle ! '
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 10]: ` Now , I 'll tell you what ! '
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: Mr. Bounderby resumed , as a valedictory address .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 66]: ` With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions , you have been quite shocking this lady : who , as I have already told you , is a born lady , and who , as I have not already told you , has had her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds -- tens of Thousands of Pounds ! '
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 9]: -LRB- he repeated it with great relish -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 33]: ` Now , you have always been a steady Hand hitherto ; but my opinion is , and so I tell you plainly , that you are turning into the wrong road .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 31]: You have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other -- they 're always about -- and the best thing you can do is , to come out of that .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 47]: Now you know ; ' here his countenance expressed marvellous acuteness ; ' I can see as far into a grindstone as another man ; farther than a good many , perhaps , because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 17]: I see traces of the turtle soup , and venison , and gold spoon in this .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 6]: Yes , I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 11]: cried Mr. Bounderby , shaking his head with obstinate cunning .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 10]: ` By the Lord Harry , I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 28]: With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh , Stephen said , ` Thank you , sir , I wish you good day . '
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 47]: So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall , as if he were going to explode himself into it ; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup , looking quite cast down by the popular vices .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 53]: Chapter XII -- The Old Woman OLD STEPHEN descended the two white steps , shutting the black door with the brazen door-plate , by the aid of the brazen full-stop , to which he gave a parting polish with the sleeve of his coat , observing that his hot hand clouded it .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 28]: He crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the ground , and thus was walking sorrowfully away , when he felt a touch upon his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 52]: It was not the touch he needed most at such a moment -- the touch that could calm the wild waters of his soul , as the uplifted hand of the sublimest love and patience could abate the raging of the sea -- yet it was a woman 's hand too .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 27]: It was an old woman , tall and shapely still , though withered by time , on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 23]: She was very cleanly and plainly dressed , had country mud upon her shoes , and was newly come from a journey .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 69]: The flutter of her manner , in the unwonted noise of the streets ; the spare shawl , carried unfolded on her arm ; the heavy umbrella , and little basket ; the loose long-fingered gloves , to which her hands were unused ; all bespoke an old woman from the country , in her plain holiday clothes , come into Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 78]: Remarking this at a glance , with the quick observation of his class , Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face -- his face , which , like the faces of many of his order , by dint of long working with eyes and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise , had acquired the concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the deaf -- the better to hear what she asked him .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 26]: ` Pray , sir , ' said the old woman , ` did n't I see you come out of that gentleman 's house ? '
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 8]: pointing back to Mr. Bounderby 's . '
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 21]: I believe it was you , unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following ? '
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 15]: ` Yes , missus , ' returned Stephen , ` it were me . '
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 20]: ` Have you -- you 'll excuse an old woman 's curiosity -- have you seen the gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 6]: ` Yes , missus . '
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 9]: ` And how did he look , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 12]: Was he portly , bold , outspoken , and hearty ? '
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 41]: As she straightened her own figure , and held up her head in adapting her action to her words , the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old woman before , and had not quite liked her . '
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 19]: O yes , ' he returned , observing her more attentively , ` he were all that . '
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 17]: ` And healthy , ' said the old woman , ` as the fresh wind ? '
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' returned Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 18]: ` He were ett 'n and drinking -- as large and as loud as a Hummobee . '
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 5]: ` Thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 9]: said the old woman , with infinite content .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 5]: ` Thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 10]: He certainly never had seen this old woman before .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 25]: Yet there was a vague remembrance in his mind , as if he had more than once dreamed of some old woman like her .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 28]: She walked along at his side , and , gently accommodating himself to her humour , he said Coketown was a busy place , was it not ?
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 8]: To which she answered ` Eigh sure !
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 4]: Dreadful busy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 13]: Then he said , she came from the country , he saw ?
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 8]: To which she answered in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: ` By Parliamentary , this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 21]: I came forty mile by Parliamentary this morning , and I 'm going back the same forty mile this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 33]: I walked nine mile to the station this morning , and if I find nobody on the road to give me a lift , I shall walk the nine mile back to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 12]: That 's pretty well , sir , at my age ! '
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 13]: said the chatty old woman , her eye brightening with exultation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 4]: Deed 't is .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 11]: Do n't do ' t too often , missus . '
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 13]: Once a year , ' she answered , shaking her head . '
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 10]: I spend my savings so , once every year .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 16]: I come regular , to tramp about the streets , and see the gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 7]: ` Only to see 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 3]: returned Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 20]: ` That 's enough for me , ' she replied , with great earnestness and interest of manner . '
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 5]: I ask no more !
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 33]: I have been standing about , on this side of the way , to see that gentleman , ' turning her head back towards Mr. Bounderby 's again , ` come out .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 15]: But , he 's late this year , and I have not seen him .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 5]: You came out instead .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 23]: Now , if I am obliged to go back without a glimpse of him -- I only want a glimpse -- well !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 19]: I have seen you , and you have seen him , and I must make that do . '
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 29]: Saying this , she looked at Stephen as if to fix his features in her mind , and her eye was not so bright as it had been .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 39]: With a large allowance for difference of tastes , and with all submission to the patricians of Coketown , this seemed so extraordinary a source of interest to take so much trouble about , that it perplexed him .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 21]: But they were passing the church now , and as his eye caught the clock , he quickened his pace .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 7]: He was going to his work ?
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 13]: the old woman said , quickening hers , too , quite easily .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 7]: Yes , time was nearly out .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 20]: On his telling her where he worked , the old woman became a more singular old woman than before .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 7]: ` A n't you happy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 4]: she asked him .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 15]: ` Why -- there 's awmost nobbody but has their troubles , missus . '
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 32]: He answered evasively , because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he would be very happy indeed , and he had not the heart to disappoint her .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 45]: He knew that there was trouble enough in the world ; and if the old woman had lived so long , and could count upon his having so little , why so much the better for her , and none the worse for him .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 5]: ` Ay , ay !
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 11]: You have your troubles at home , you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 3]: ` Times .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 11]: Just now and then , ' he answered , slightly .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 19]: ` But , working under such a gentleman , they do n't follow you to the Factory ? '
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 14]: No , no ; they did n't follow him there , said Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 4]: All correct there .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 4]: Everything accordant there .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 39]: -LRB- He did not go so far as to say , for her pleasure , that there was a sort of Divine Right there ; but , I have heard claims almost as magnificent of late years . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 18]: They were now in the black by-road near the place , and the Hands were crowding in .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 22]: The bell was ringing , and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils , and the Elephant was getting ready .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 11]: The strange old woman was delighted with the very bell .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 17]: It was the beautifullest bell she had ever heard , she said , and sounded grand !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 25]: She asked him , when he stopped good-naturedly to shake hands with her before going in , how long he had worked there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 10]: A dozen year , ' he told her . '
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 24]: I must kiss the hand , ' said she , ` that has worked in this fine factory for a dozen year ! '
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 19]: And she lifted it , though he would have prevented her , and put it to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 60]: What harmony , besides her age and her simplicity , surrounded her , he did not know , but even in this fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place : a something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious , or done with such a natural and touching air .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 57]: He had been at his loom full half an hour , thinking about this old woman , when , having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment , he glanced through a window which was in his corner , and saw her still looking up at the pile of building , lost in admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 39]: Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet , and of her two long journeys , she was gazing at it , as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to her .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 55]: She was gone by and by , and the day went after her , and the lights sprung up again , and the Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over the arches near : little felt amid the jarring of the machinery , and scarcely heard above its crash and rattle .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 33]: Long before then his thoughts had gone back to the dreary room above the little shop , and to the shameful figure heavy on the bed , but heavier on his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 12]: Machinery slackened ; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse ; stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 37]: The bell again ; the glare of light and heat dispelled ; the factories , looming heavy in the black wet night -- their tall chimneys rising up into the air like competing Towers of Babel .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 90]: He had spoken to Rachael only last night , it was true , and had walked with her a little way ; but he had his new misfortune on him , in which no one else could give him a moment 's relief , and , for the sake of it , and because he knew himself to want that softening of his anger which no voice but hers could effect , he felt he might so far disregard what she had said as to wait for her again .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 9]: He waited , but she had eluded him .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 4]: She was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 17]: On no other night in the year could he so ill have spared her patient face .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 29]: Better to have no home in which to lay his head , than to have a home and dread to go to it , through such a cause .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 36]: He ate and drank , for he was exhausted -- but he little knew or cared what ; and he wandered about in the chill rain , thinking and thinking , and brooding and brooding .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 63]: No word of a new marriage had ever passed between them ; but Rachael had taken great pity on him years ago , and to her alone he had opened his closed heart all this time , on the subject of his miseries ; and he knew very well that if he were free to ask her , she would take him .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 54]: He thought of the home he might at that moment have been seeking with pleasure and pride ; of the different man he might have been that night ; of the lightness then in his now heavy-laden breast ; of the then restored honour , self-respect , and tranquillity all torn to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 54]: He thought of the waste of the best part of his life , of the change it made in his character for the worse every day , of the dreadful nature of his existence , bound hand and foot , to a dead woman , and tormented by a demon in her shape .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 27]: He thought of Rachael , how young when they were first brought together in these circumstances , how mature now , how soon to grow old .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 66]: He thought of the number of girls and women she had seen marry , how many homes with children in them she had seen grow up around her , how she had contentedly pursued her own lone quiet path -- for him -- and how he had sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed face , that smote him with remorse and despair .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 47]: He set the picture of her up , beside the infamous image of last night ; and thought , Could it be , that the whole earthly course of one so gentle , good , and self-denying , was subjugate to such a wretch as that !
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 51]: Filled with these thoughts -- so filled that he had an unwholesome sense of growing larger , of being placed in some new and diseased relation towards the objects among which he passed , of seeing the iris round every misty light turn red -- he went home for shelter .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 80]: Chapter XIII -- Rachael A CANDLE faintly burned in the window , to which the black ladder had often been raised for the sliding away of all that was most precious in this world to a striving wife and a brood of hungry babies ; and Stephen added to his other thoughts the stern reflection , that of all the casualties of this existence upon earth , not one was dealt out with so unequal a hand as Death .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 9]: The inequality of Birth was nothing to it .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 53]: For , say that the child of a King and the child of a Weaver were born to-night in the same moment , what was that disparity , to the death of any human creature who was serviceable to , or beloved by , another , while this abandoned woman lived on !
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 22]: From the outside of his home he gloomily passed to the inside , with suspended breath and with a slow footstep .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 16]: He went up to his door , opened it , and so into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 6]: Quiet and peace were there .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 9]: Rachael was there , sitting by the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 20]: She turned her head , and the light of her face shone in upon the midnight of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: She sat by the bed , watching and tending his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 42]: That is to say , he saw that some one lay there , and he knew too well it must be she ; but Rachael 's hands had put a curtain up , so that she was screened from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 16]: Her disgraceful garments were removed , and some of Rachael 's were in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 28]: Everything was in its place and order as he had always kept it , the little fire was newly trimmed , and the hearth was freshly swept .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 20]: It appeared to him that he saw all this in Rachael 's face , and looked at nothing besides .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 43]: While looking at it , it was shut out from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes ; but not before he had seen how earnestly she looked at him , and how her own eyes were filled too .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 27]: She turned again towards the bed , and satisfying herself that all was quiet there , spoke in a low , calm , cheerful voice . '
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 11]: I am glad you have come at last , Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 7]: You are very late . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 12]: I ha ' been walking up an ' down . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 4]: I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 10]: But 't is too bad a night for that .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 13]: The rain falls very heavy , and the wind has risen . '
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 3]: The wind ?
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 2]: True .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 5]: It was blowing hard .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 13]: Hark to the thundering in the chimney , and the surging noise !
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 19]: To have been out in such a wind , and not to have known it was blowing ! '
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 11]: I have been here once before , to-day , Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 8]: Landlady came round for me at dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 13]: There was some one here that needed looking to , she said .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 7]: And ` deed she was right .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 7]: All wandering and lost , Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 7]: Wounded too , and bruised . '
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 17]: He slowly moved to a chair and sat down , drooping his head before her . '
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 55]: I came to do what little I could , Stephen ; first , for that she worked with me when we were girls both , and for that you courted her and married her when I was her friend -- ' He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand , with a low groan .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 40]: ` And next , for that I know your heart , and am right sure and certain that 't is far too merciful to let her die , or even so much as suffer , for want of aid .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 22]: Thou knowest who said , `` Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 8]: There have been plenty to do that .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 22]: Thou art not the man to cast the last stone , Stephen , when she is brought so low . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 6]: O Rachael , Rachael ! '
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 13]: ` Thou hast been a cruel sufferer , Heaven reward thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 8]: she said , in compassionate accents . '
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 14]: I am thy poor friend , with all my heart and mind . '
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 19]: The wounds of which she had spoken , seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 10]: She dressed them now , still without showing her .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 31]: She steeped a piece of linen in a basin , into which she poured some liquid from a bottle , and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 19]: The three-legged table had been drawn close to the bedside , and on it there were two bottles .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 4]: This was one .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 29]: It was not so far off , but that Stephen , following her hands with his eyes , could read what was printed on it in large letters .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 18]: He turned of a deadly hue , and a sudden horror seemed to fall upon him . '
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 22]: I will stay here , Stephen , ' said Rachael , quietly resuming her seat , 'till the bells go Three .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 19]: 'T is to be done again at three , and then she may be left till morning . '
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 14]: ` But thy rest agen to-morrow 's work , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 6]: I slept sound last night .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 13]: I can wake many nights , when I am put to it .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 15]: 'T is thou who art in need of rest -- so white and tired .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 12]: Try to sleep in the chair there , while I watch .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 12]: Thou hadst no sleep last night , I can well believe .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 13]: To-morrow 's work is far harder for thee than for me . '
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 30]: He heard the thundering and surging out of doors , and it seemed to him as if his late angry mood were going about trying to get at him .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 22]: She had cast it out ; she would keep it out ; he trusted to her to defend him from himself .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 16]: ` She do n't know me , Stephen ; she just drowsily mutters and stares .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 15]: I have spoken to her times and again , but she do n't notice !
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 6]: 'T is as well so .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 25]: When she comes to her right mind once more , I shall have done what I can , and she never the wiser . '
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 19]: ` How long , Rachael , is ' t looked for , that she 'll be so ? '
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 13]: ` Doctor said she would haply come to her mind to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 23]: His eyes fell again on the bottle , and a tremble passed over him , causing him to shiver in every limb .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 9]: She thought he was chilled with the wet .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 13]: ` No , ' he said , ` it was not that .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 8]: He had had a fright . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 4]: A fright ? '
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 5]: ` Ay , ay !
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 3]: coming in .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 5]: When I were walking .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: When I were thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 38]: When I -- ' It seized him again ; and he stood up , holding by the mantel-shelf , as he pressed his dank cold hair down with a hand that shook as if it were palsied .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 4]: ` Stephen ! '
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 16]: She was coming to him , but he stretched out his arm to stop her .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 8]: Do n't , please ; do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 9]: Let me see thee setten by the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 14]: Let me see thee , a ' so good , and so forgiving .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 13]: Let me see thee as I see thee when I coom in .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 9]: I can never see thee better than so .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 7]: Never , never , never ! '
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 15]: He had a violent fit of trembling , and then sunk into his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 29]: After a time he controlled himself , and , resting with an elbow on one knee , and his head upon that hand , could look towards Rachael .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 23]: Seen across the dim candle with his moistened eyes , she looked as if she had a glory shining round her head .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 7]: He could have believed she had .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 28]: He did believe it , as the noise without shook the window , rattled at the door below , and went about the house clamouring and lamenting .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 28]: ` When she gets better , Stephen , 't is to be hoped she 'll leave thee to thyself again , and do thee no more hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 7]: Anyways we will hope so now .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 15]: And now I shall keep silence , for I want thee to sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 68]: He closed his eyes , more to please her than to rest his weary head ; but , by slow degrees as he listened to the great noise of the wind , he ceased to hear it , or it changed into the working of his loom , or even into the voices of the day -LRB- his own included -RRB- saying what had been really said .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 18]: Even this imperfect consciousness faded away at last , and he dreamed a long , troubled dream .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 44]: He thought that he , and some one on whom his heart had long been set -- but she was not Rachael , and that surprised him , even in the midst of his imaginary happiness -- stood in the church being married .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 43]: While the ceremony was performing , and while he recognized among the witnesses some whom he knew to be living , and many whom he knew to be dead , darkness came on , succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 22]: It broke from one line in the table of commandments at the altar , and illuminated the building with the words .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 19]: They were sounded through the church , too , as if there were voices in the fiery letters .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 28]: Upon this , the whole appearance before him and around him changed , and nothing was left as it had been , but himself and the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 65]: They stood in the daylight before a crowd so vast , that if all the people in the world could have been brought together into one space , they could not have looked , he thought , more numerous ; and they all abhorred him , and there was not one pitying or friendly eye among the millions that were fastened on his face .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 41]: He stood on a raised stage , under his own loom ; and , looking up at the shape the loom took , and hearing the burial service distinctly read , he knew that he was there to suffer death .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 16]: In an instant what he stood on fell below him , and he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 75]: -- Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life , and to places that he knew , he was unable to consider ; but he was back in those places by some means , and with this condemnation upon him , that he was never , in this world or the next , through all the unimaginable ages of eternity , to look on Rachael 's face or hear her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 53]: Wandering to and fro , unceasingly , without hope , and in search of he knew not what -LRB- he only knew that he was doomed to seek it -RRB- , he was the subject of a nameless , horrible dread , a mortal fear of one particular shape which everything took .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 13]: Whatsoever he looked at , grew into that form sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 21]: The object of his miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by any one among the various people he encountered .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 3]: Hopeless labour !
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 63]: If he led them out of rooms where it was , if he shut up drawers and closets where it stood , if he drew the curious from places where he knew it to be secreted , and got them out into the streets , the very chimneys of the mills assumed that shape , and round them was the printed word .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 32]: The wind was blowing again , the rain was beating on the house-tops , and the larger spaces through which he had strayed contracted to the four walls of his room .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 18]: Saving that the fire had died out , it was as his eyes had closed upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 16]: Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze , in the chair by the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 10]: She sat wrapped in her shawl , perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 31]: The table stood in the same place , close by the bedside , and on it , in its real proportions and appearance , was the shape so often repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 8]: He thought he saw the curtain move .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 11]: He looked again , and he was sure it moved .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 12]: He saw a hand come forth and grope about a little .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 21]: Then the curtain moved more perceptibly , and the woman in the bed put it back , and sat up .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 33]: With her woful eyes , so haggard and wild , so heavy and large , she looked all round the room , and passed the corner where he slept in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 24]: Her eyes returned to that corner , and she put her hand over them as a shade , while she looked into it .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 21]: Again they went all round the room , scarcely heeding Rachael if at all , and returned to that corner .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 61]: He thought , as she once more shaded them -- not so much looking at him , as looking for him with a brutish instinct that he was there -- that no single trace was left in those debauched features , or in the mind that went along with them , of the woman he had married eighteen years before .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 23]: But that he had seen her come to this by inches , he never could have believed her to be the same .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 23]: All this time , as if a spell were on him , he was motionless and powerless , except to watch her .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 32]: Stupidly dozing , or communing with her incapable self about nothing , she sat for a little while with her hands at her ears , and her head resting on them .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 10]: Presently , she resumed her staring round the room .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 20]: And now , for the first time , her eyes stopped at the table with the bottles on it .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 30]: Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner , with the defiance of last night , and moving very cautiously and softly , stretched out her greedy hand .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 23]: She drew a mug into the bed , and sat for a while considering which of the two bottles she should choose .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 33]: Finally , she laid her insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death in it , and , before his eyes , pulled out the cork with her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 16]: Dream or reality , he had no voice , nor had he power to stir .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 20]: If this be real , and her allotted time be not yet come , wake , Rachael , wake !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 7]: She thought of that , too .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 17]: She looked at Rachael , and very slowly , very cautiously , poured out the contents .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 7]: The draught was at her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 24]: A moment and she would be past all help , let the whole world wake and come about her with its utmost power .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 12]: But in that moment Rachael started up with a suppressed cry .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 19]: The creature struggled , struck her , seized her by the hair ; but Rachael had the cup .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 7]: Stephen broke out of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 17]: ` Rachael , am I wakin ' or dreamin ' this dreadfo ' night ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 6]: Tis all well , Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 7]: I have been asleep , myself .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 5]: 'T is near three .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 6]: I hear the bells . '
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 13]: The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 8]: They listened , and it struck three .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 42]: Stephen looked at her , saw how pale she was , noted the disorder of her hair , and the red marks of fingers on her forehead , and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been awake .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 11]: She held the cup in her hand even now . '
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 29]: I thought it must be near three , ' she said , calmly pouring from the cup into the basin , and steeping the linen as before . '
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 6]: I am thankful I stayed !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 12]: 'T is done now , when I have put this on .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 7]: And now she 's quiet again .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 28]: The few drops in the basin I 'll pour away , for 't is bad stuff to leave about , though ever so little of it . '
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 23]: As she spoke , she drained the basin into the ashes of the fire , and broke the bottle on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 24]: She had nothing to do , then , but to cover herself with her shawl before going out into the wind and rain .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 17]: ` Thou ` lt let me walk wi ' thee at this hour , Rachael ? '
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 5]: ` No , Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 12]: 'T is but a minute , and I 'm home . '
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 35]: ` Thou ` rt not fearfo ' ; ' he said it in a low voice , as they went out at the door ; ` to leave me alone wi ' her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 12]: As she looked at him , saying , ` Stephen ? '
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 26]: he went down on his knee before her , on the poor mean stairs , and put an end of her shawl to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 6]: ` Thou art an Angel .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 8]: Bless thee , bless thee ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 15]: I am , as I have told thee , Stephen , thy poor friend .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 6]: Angels are not like me .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 19]: Between them , and a working woman fu ' of faults , there is a deep gulf set .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 13]: My little sister is among them , but she is changed . '
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 30]: She raised her eyes for a moment as she said the words ; and then they fell again , in all their gentleness and mildness , on his face .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: ` Thou changest me from bad to good .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 35]: Thou mak ` st me humbly wishfo ' to be more like thee , and fearfo ' to lose thee when this life is ower , and a ' the muddle cleared awa ' .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 18]: Thou ` rt an Angel ; it may be , thou hast saved my soul alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 38]: She looked at him , on his knee at her feet , with her shawl still in his hand , and the reproof on her lips died away when she saw the working of his face . '
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 7]: I coom home desp ` rate .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 28]: I coom home wi'out a hope , and mad wi ' thinking that when I said a word o ' complaint I was reckoned a unreasonable Hand .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 9]: I told thee I had had a fright .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 7]: It were the Poison-bottle on table .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 42]: I never hurt a livin ' creetur ; but happenin ' so suddenly upon ` t , I thowt , `` How can I say what I might ha ' done to myseln , or her , or both ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 22]: She put her two hands on his mouth , with a face of terror , to stop him from saying more .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 37]: He caught them in his unoccupied hand , and holding them , and still clasping the border of her shawl , said hurriedly : ` But I see thee , Rachael , setten by the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 10]: I ha ' seen thee , aw this night .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 14]: In my troublous sleep I ha ' known thee still to be there .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 7]: Evermore I will see thee there .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 18]: I nevermore will see her or think o ' her , but thou shalt be beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 31]: I nevermore will see or think o ' anything that angers me , but thou , so much better than me , shalt be by th ' side o n't .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 57]: And so I will try t ' look t ' th ' time , and so I will try t ' trust t ' th ' time , when thou and me at last shall walk together far awa ' , beyond the deep gulf , in th ' country where thy little sister is . '
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 14]: He kissed the border of her shawl again , and let her go .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 17]: She bade him good night in a broken voice , and went out into the street .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 18]: The wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon appear , and still blew strongly .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 24]: It had cleared the sky before it , and the rain had spent itself or travelled elsewhere , and the stars were bright .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 12]: He stood bare-headed in the road , watching her quick disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 33]: As the shining stars were to the heavy candle in the window , so was Rachael , in the rugged fancy of this man , to the common experiences of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 38]: Chapter XIV -- The Great Manufacturer TIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery : so much material wrought up , so much fuel consumed , so many powers worn out , so much money made .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 43]: But , less inexorable than iron , steal , and brass , it brought its varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick , and made the only stand that ever was made in the place against its direful uniformity .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 17]: ` Louisa is becoming , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` almost a young woman . '
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 37]: Time , with his innumerable horse-power , worked away , not minding what anybody said , and presently turned out young Thomas a foot taller than when his father had last taken particular notice of him .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 17]: ` Thomas is becoming , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` almost a young man . '
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 29]: Time passed Thomas on in the mill , while his father was thinking about it , and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 22]: ` Really , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` the period has arrived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 43]: Time , sticking to him , passed him on into Bounderby 's Bank , made him an inmate of Bounderby 's house , necessitated the purchase of his first razor , and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to number one .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 40]: The same great manufacturer , always with an immense variety of work on hand , in every stage of development , passed Sissy onward in his mill , and worked her up into a very pretty article indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 25]: I fear , Jupe , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` that your continuance at the school any longer would be useless . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 16]: I am afraid it would , sir , ' Sissy answered with a curtsey . '
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 35]: I can not disguise from you , Jupe , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , knitting his brow , ` that the result of your probation there has disappointed me ; has greatly disappointed me .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 23]: You have not acquired , under Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild , anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I looked for .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 8]: You are extremely deficient in your facts .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 8]: Your acquaintance with figures is very limited .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 12]: You are altogether backward , and below the mark . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 19]: I am sorry , sir , ' she returned ; ` but I know it is quite true .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 9]: Yet I have tried hard , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 34]: ` Yes , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` yes , I believe you have tried hard ; I have observed you , and I can find no fault in that respect . '
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 6]: ` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 65]: I have thought sometimes ; ' Sissy very timid here ; ` that perhaps I tried to learn too much , and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less , I might have -- ' ` No , Jupe , no , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , shaking his head in his profoundest and most eminently practical way .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 26]: The course you pursued , you pursued according to the system -- the system -- and there is no more to be said about it .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 29]: I can only suppose that the circumstances of your early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers , and that we began too late .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 14]: Still , as I have said already , I am disappointed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 35]: I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment , sir , of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you , and of your protection of her . '
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 11]: ` Do n't shed tears , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 6]: ` Do n't shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 7]: I do n't complain of you .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 21]: You are an affectionate , earnest , good young woman -- and -- and we must make that do . '
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 18]: ` Thank you , sir , very much , ' said Sissy , with a grateful curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 41]: ` You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind , and -LRB- in a generally pervading way -RRB- you are serviceable in the family also ; so I understand from Miss Louisa , and , indeed , so I have observed myself .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 22]: I therefore hope , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` that you can make yourself happy in those relations . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 30]: I should have nothing to wish , sir , if -- ' ' I understand you , ' said Mr. Gradgrind ; ` you still refer to your father .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 13]: I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 25]: If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful , you would have been wiser on these points .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 7]: I will say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 33]: He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her ; otherwise he held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 29]: Somehow or other , he had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 56]: Her capacity of definition might be easily stated at a very low figure , her mathematical knowledge at nothing ; yet he was not sure that if he had been required , for example , to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return , he would have quite known how to divide her .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 19]: In some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric , the processes of Time are very rapid .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 40]: Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage of their working up , these changes were effected in a year or two ; while Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course , and underwent no alteration .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 14]: Except one , which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 73]: Time hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery , in a by-comer , and made him Member of Parliament for Coketown : one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures , one of the representatives of the multiplication table , one of the deaf honourable gentlemen , dumb honourable gentlemen , blind honourable gentlemen , lame honourable gentlemen , dead honourable gentlemen , to every other consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 18]: Else wherefore live we in a Christian land , eighteen hundred and odd years after our Master ?
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 75]: All this while , Louisa had been passing on , so quiet and reserved , and so much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the grate , and became extinct , that from the period when her father had said she was almost a young woman -- which seemed but yesterday -- she had scarcely attracted his notice again , when he found her quite a young woman .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 13]: ` Quite a young woman , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , musing .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 23]: Soon after this discovery , he became more thoughtful than usual for several days , and seemed much engrossed by one subject .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 71]: On a certain night , when he was going out , and Louisa came to bid him good-bye before his departure -- as he was not to be home until late and she would not see him again until the morning -- he held her in his arms , looking at her in his kindest manner , and said : ` My dear Louisa , you are a woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 27]: She answered with the old , quick , searching look of the night when she was found at the Circus ; then cast down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 6]: ` Yes , father . '
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 19]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ' I must speak with you alone and seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 14]: Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 6]: ` Yes , father . '
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 9]: ` Your hands are rather cold , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 6]: Are you not well ? '
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 7]: ` Quite well , father . '
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 5]: ` And cheerful ? '
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 14]: She looked at him again , and smiled in her peculiar manner . '
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 18]: I am as cheerful , father , as I usually am , or usually have been . '
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 10]: ` That 's well , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 42]: So , he kissed her and went away ; and Louisa returned to the serene apartment of the haircutting character , and leaning her elbow on her hand , looked again at the short-lived sparks that so soon subsided into ashes .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 8]: ` Are you there , Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 10]: said her brother , looking in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 17]: He was quite a young gentleman of pleasure now , and not quite a prepossessing one .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 27]: ` Dear Tom , ' she answered , rising and embracing him , ` how long it is since you have been to see me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 29]: ` Why , I have been otherwise engaged , Loo , in the evenings ; and in the daytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at it rather .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 21]: But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong , and so we preserve an understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 14]: Has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday , Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 5]: ` No , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 16]: But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 10]: That 's what I mean , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 10]: ` Do you know where he is to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 7]: -- with a very deep expression .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 7]: ` Then I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 6]: He 's with old Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 12]: They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 9]: Why at the Bank , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 8]: Well , I 'll tell you again .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 16]: To keep Mrs. Sparsit 's ears as far off as possible , I expect . '
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 17]: With her hand upon her brother 's shoulder , Louisa still stood looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 27]: Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual , and , encircling her waist with his arm , drew her coaxingly to him .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 15]: ` You are very fond of me , a n't you , Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 23]: ` Indeed I am , Tom , though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me . '
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 23]: ` Well , sister of mine , ' said Tom , ` when you say that , you are near my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 12]: We might be so much oftener together -- might n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 9]: Always together , almost -- might n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 24]: It would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what , Loo .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 9]: It would be a splendid thing for me .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 7]: It would be uncommonly jolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 7]: Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 8]: He could make nothing of her face .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 12]: He pressed her in his arm , and kissed her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 13]: She returned the kiss , but still looked at the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 5]: I say , Loo !
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 32]: I thought I 'd come , and just hint to you what was going on : though I supposed you 'd most likely guess , even if you did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 14]: I ca n't stay , because I 'm engaged to some fellows to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 12]: You wo n't forget how fond you are of me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 12]: ` No , dear Tom , I wo n't forget . '
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 11]: ` That 's a capital girl , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 6]: ` Good-bye , Loo . '
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 30]: She gave him an affectionate good-night , and went out with him to the door , whence the fires of Coketown could be seen , making the distance lurid .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 16]: She stood there , looking steadfastly towards them , and listening to his departing steps .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 28]: They retreated quickly , as glad to get away from Stone Lodge ; and she stood there yet , when he was gone and all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 54]: It seemed as if , first in her own fire within the house , and then in the fiery haze without , she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time , that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all , would weave from the threads he had already spun into a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 19]: But his factory is a secret place , his work is noiseless , and his Hands are mutes .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 30]: Chapter XV -- Father and Daughter ALTHOUGH Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard , his room was quite a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 29]: Whatever they could prove -LRB- which is usually anything you like -RRB- , they proved there , in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 35]: In that charmed apartment , the most complicated social questions were cast up , got into exact totals , and finally settled -- if those concerned could only have been brought to know it .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 87]: As if an astronomical observatory should be made without any windows , and the astronomer within should arrange the starry universe solely by pen , ink , and paper , so Mr. Gradgrind , in his Observatory -LRB- and there are many like it -RRB- , had no need to cast an eye upon the teeming myriads of human beings around him , but could settle all their destinies on a slate , and wipe out all their tears with one dirty little bit of sponge .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 39]: To this Observatory , then : a stern room , with a deadly statistical clock in it , which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin-lid ; Louisa repaired on the appointed morning .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 35]: A window looked towards Coketown ; and when she sat down near her father 's table , she saw the high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy distance gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 33]: ` My dear Louisa , ' said her father , ' I prepared you last night to give me your serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have together .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 37]: You have been so well trained , and you do , I am happy to say , so much justice to the education you have received , that I have perfect confidence in your good sense .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 26]: You are not impulsive , you are not romantic , you are accustomed to view everything from the strong dispassionate ground of reason and calculation .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 20]: From that ground alone , I know you will view and consider what I am going to communicate . '
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 15]: He waited , as if he would have been glad that she said something .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 7]: But she said never a word .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 23]: ` Louisa , my dear , you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 12]: Again he waited , and again she answered not one word .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 24]: This so far surprised him , as to induce him gently to repeat , ' a proposal of marriage , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 18]: To which she returned , without any visible emotion whatever : ' I hear you , father .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 9]: I am attending , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 30]: said Mr. Gradgrind , breaking into a smile , after being for the moment at a loss , ` you are even more dispassionate than I expected , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 21]: Or , perhaps , you are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 13]: I can not say that , father , until I hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 13]: Prepared or unprepared , I wish to hear it all from you .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 13]: I wish to hear you state it to me , father . '
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 18]: Strange to relate , Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as his daughter was .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 39]: He took a paper-knife in his hand , turned it over , laid it down , took it up again , and even then had to look along the blade of it , considering how to go on .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 13]: ` What you say , my dear Louisa , is perfectly reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 52]: I have undertaken then to let you know that -- in short , that Mr. Bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure , and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 23]: That time , to which he has so long , and certainly with great constancy , looked forward , is now come .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 38]: Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me , and has entreated me to make it known to you , and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration . '
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 4]: Silence between them .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 7]: The deadly statistical clock very hollow .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 8]: The distant smoke very black and heavy .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 17]: ` Father , ' said Louisa , ` do you think I love Mr. Bounderby ? '
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 10]: Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 24]: ` Well , my child , ' he returned , ` I -- really -- can not take upon myself to say . '
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 25]: ` Father , ' pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before , ` do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby ? '
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 7]: ` My dear Louisa , no .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 5]: I ask nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 19]: ` Father , ' she still pursued , ` does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 33]: ` Really , my dear , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` it is difficult to answer your question -- ' ` Difficult to answer it , Yes or No , father ?
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 6]: ` Certainly , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 36]: Because ; ' here was something to demonstrate , and it set him up again ; ` because the reply depends so materially , Louisa , on the sense in which we use the expression .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 37]: Now , Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice , and does not do himself the injustice , of pretending to anything fanciful , fantastic , or -LRB- I am using synonymous terms -RRB- sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 46]: Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes , to very little purpose , if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense , not to say to his , as to address you from any such ground .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 24]: Therefore , perhaps the expression itself -- I merely suggest this to you , my dear -- may be a little misplaced . '
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 15]: ` What would you advise me to use in its stead , father ? '
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 52]: ` Why , my dear Louisa , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , completely recovered by this time , ' I would advise you -LRB- since you ask me -RRB- to consider this question , as you have been accustomed to consider every other question , simply as one of tangible Fact .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 43]: The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies , and other absurdities that have no existence , properly viewed -- really no existence -- but it is no compliment to you to say , that you know better .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 10]: Now , what are the Facts of this case ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 28]: You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; Mr. Bounderby is , we will say in round numbers , fifty .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 29]: There is some disparity in your respective years , but in your means and positions there is none ; on the contrary , there is a great suitability .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 20]: Then the question arises , Is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 32]: In considering this question , it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage , so far as they have yet been obtained , in England and Wales .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 47]: I find , on reference to the figures , that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages , and that the elder of these contracting parties is , in rather more than three-fourths of these instances , the bridegroom .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 53]: It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law , that among the natives of the British possessions in India , also in a considerable part of China , and among the Calmucks of Tartary , the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers , yield similar results .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 23]: The disparity I have mentioned , therefore , almost ceases to be disparity , and -LRB- virtually -RRB- all but disappears . '
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 38]: ` What do you recommend , father , ' asked Louisa , her reserved composure not in the least affected by these gratifying results , ` that I should substitute for the term I used just now ?
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 6]: For the misplaced expression ? '
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 19]: ` Louisa , ' returned her father , ` it appears to me that nothing can be plainer .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 25]: Confining yourself rigidly to Fact , the question of Fact you state to yourself is : Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him ?
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 5]: Yes , he does .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 12]: The sole remaining question then is : Shall I marry him ?
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 10]: I think nothing can be plainer than that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 7]: ` Shall I marry him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 7]: repeated Louisa , with great deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 3]: ` Precisely .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 48]: And it is satisfactory to me , as your father , my dear Louisa , to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind , and habits of life , that belong to many young women . '
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 16]: ` No , father , ' she returned , ' I do not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 15]: I now leave you to judge for yourself , ' said Mr. Gradgrind . '
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 35]: I have stated the case , as such cases are usually stated among practical minds ; I have stated it , as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 14]: The rest , my dear Louisa , is for you to decide . '
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 12]: From the beginning , she had sat looking at him fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 52]: As he now leaned back in his chair , and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn , perhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her , when she was impelled to throw herself upon his breast , and give him the pent-up confidences of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 56]: But , to see it , he must have overleaped at a bound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting , between himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 13]: The barriers were too many and too high for such a leap .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 39]: With his unbending , utilitarian , matter-of-fact face , he hardened her again ; and the moment shot away into the plumbless depths of the past , to mingle with all the lost opportunities that are drowned there .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 37]: Removing her eyes from him , she sat so long looking silently towards the town , that he said , at length : ` Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works , Louisa ? '
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 13]: ` There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 13]: Yet when the night comes , Fire bursts out , father ! '
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 6]: she answered , turning quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 9]: ` Of course I know that , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 11]: I do not see the application of the remark . '
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 11]: To do him justice he did not , at all .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 36]: She passed it away with a slight motion of her hand , and concentrating her attention upon him again , said , ` Father , I have often thought that life is very short . '
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 13]: -- This was so distinctly one of his subjects that he interposed .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 11]: ` It is short , no doubt , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 17]: Still , the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 26]: The calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices , among other figures which can not go wrong , have established the fact . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 11]: I speak of my own life , father . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 3]: O indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 33]: Still , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ' I need not point out to you , Louisa , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate . '
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 23]: ` While it lasts , I would wish to do the little I can , and the little I am fit for .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 6]: What does it matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 21]: Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words ; replying , ` How , matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 7]: What matter , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 26]: ` Mr. Bounderby , ' she went on in a steady , straight way , without regarding this , ` asks me to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 14]: The question I have to ask myself is , shall I marry him ?
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 10]: That is so , father , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 8]: You have told me so , father .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 5]: Have you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 7]: ` Certainly , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 6]: ` Let it be so .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 17]: Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus , I am satisfied to accept his proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 17]: Tell him , father , as soon as you please , that this was my answer .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 23]: Repeat it , word for word , if you can , because I should wish him to know what I said . '
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 20]: ` It is quite right , my dear , ' retorted her father approvingly , ` to be exact .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 8]: I will observe your very proper request .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 17]: Have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage , my child ? '
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 5]: ` None , father .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 6]: What does it matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 17]: Mr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her , and taken her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 18]: But , her repetition of these words seemed to strike with some little discord on his ear .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 45]: He paused to look at her , and , still holding her hand , said : ` Louisa , I have not considered it essential to ask you one question , because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 8]: But perhaps I ought to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 11]: You have never entertained in secret any other proposal ? '
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 21]: ` Father , ' she returned , almost scornfully , ` what other proposal can have been made to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 5]: Whom have I seen ?
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 5]: Where have I been ?
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 8]: What are my heart 's experiences ? '
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 14]: ` My dear Louisa , ' returned Mr. Gradgrind , reassured and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 6]: ` You correct me justly .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 9]: I merely wished to discharge my duty . '
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 44]: ` What do I know , father , ' said Louisa in her quiet manner , ` of tastes and fancies ; of aspirations and affections ; of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished ?
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 20]: What escape have I had from problems that could be demonstrated , and realities that could be grasped ? '
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 31]: As she said it , she unconsciously closed her hand , as if upon a solid object , and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or ash .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 19]: ` My dear , ' assented her eminently practical parent , ` quite true , quite true . '
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 18]: ` Why , father , ' she pursued , ` what a strange question to ask me !
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 23]: The baby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children , has never had its innocent resting-place in my breast .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 17]: You have been so careful of me , that I never had a child 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 16]: You have trained me so well , that I never dreamed a child 's dream .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 32]: You have dealt so wisely with me , father , from my cradle to this hour , that I never had a child 's belief or a child 's fear . '
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 16]: Mr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his success , and by this testimony to it .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 16]: ` My dear Louisa , ' said he , ` you abundantly repay my care .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 8]: Kiss me , my dear girl . '
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 7]: So , his daughter kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 35]: Detaining her in his embrace , he said , ' I may assure you now , my favourite child , that I am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 35]: Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man ; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you -- if any -- is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 36]: It has always been my object so to educate you , as that you might , while still in your early youth , be -LRB- if I may so express myself -RRB- almost any age .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 7]: Kiss me once more , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 11]: Now , let us go and find your mother . '
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 30]: Accordingly , they went down to the drawing-room , where the esteemed lady with no nonsense about her , was recumbent as usual , while Sissy worked beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 24]: She gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they entered , and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting attitude .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 33]: ` Mrs. Gradgrind , ' said her husband , who had waited for the achievement of this feat with some impatience , ` allow me to present to you Mrs. Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 11]: said Mrs. Gradgrind , ` so you have settled it !
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 62]: Well , I 'm sure I hope your health may be good , Louisa ; for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married , which was the case with mine , I can not consider that you are to be envied , though I have no doubt you think you are , as all girls do .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 31]: However , I give you joy , my dear -- and I hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account , I am sure I do !
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 30]: I must give you a kiss of congratulation , Louisa ; but do n't touch my right shoulder , for there 's something running down it all day long .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 42]: And now you see , ' whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind , adjusting her shawls after the affectionate ceremony , ' I shall be worrying myself , morning , noon , and night , to know what I am to call him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 18]: ` Mrs. Gradgrind , ' said her husband , solemnly , ` what do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 18]: ` Whatever I am to call him , Mr. Gradgrind , when he is married to Louisa !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 6]: I must call him something .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 31]: It 's impossible , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind , with a mingled sense of politeness and injury , ` to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 15]: I can not call him Josiah , for the name is insupportable to me .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 13]: You yourself would n't hear of Joe , you very well know .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 10]: Am I to call my own son-in-law , Mister !
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 26]: Not , I believe , unless the time has arrived when , as an invalid , I am to be trampled upon by my relations .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 10]: Then , what am I to call him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 77]: Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable emergency , Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being , after delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed : ` As to the wedding , all I ask , Louisa , is , -- and I ask it with a fluttering in my chest , which actually extends to the soles of my feet , -- that it may take place soon .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 19]: Otherwise , I know it is one of those subjects I shall never hear the last of . '
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 39]: When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby , Sissy had suddenly turned her head , and looked , in wonder , in pity , in sorrow , in doubt , in a multitude of emotions , towards Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 14]: Louisa had known it , and seen it , without looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 22]: From that moment she was impassive , proud and cold -- held Sissy at a distance -- changed to her altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 29]: Chapter XVI -- Husband and Wife Mr. Bounderby 's first disquietude on hearing of his happiness , was occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 22]: He could not make up his mind how to do that , or what the consequences of the step might be .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 55]: Whether she would instantly depart , bag and baggage , to Lady Scadgers , or would positively refuse to budge from the premises ; whether she would be plaintive or abusive , tearful or tearing ; whether she would break her heart , or break the looking-glass ; Mr. Bounderby could not all foresee .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 40]: However , as it must be done , he had no choice but to do it ; so , after attempting several letters , and failing in them all , he resolved to do it by word of mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 37]: On his way home , on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose , he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist 's shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 5]: ` By George ! '
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 28]: said Mr. Bounderby , ` if she takes it in the fainting way , I 'll have the skin off her nose , at all events ! '
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 43]: But , in spite of being thus forearmed , he entered his own house with anything but a courageous air ; and appeared before the object of his misgivings , like a dog who was conscious of coming direct from the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: ` Good evening , Mr. Bounderby ! '
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 10]: ` Good evening , ma'am , good evening . '
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 24]: He drew up his chair , and Mrs. Sparsit drew back hers , as who should say , ` Your fireside , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 5]: I freely admit it .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 15]: It is for you to occupy it all , if you think proper . '
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 12]: ` Do n't go to the North Pole , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 4]: said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 21]: ` Thank you , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , and returned , though short of her former position .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 37]: Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her , as , with the points of a stiff , sharp pair of scissors , she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental purpose , in a piece of cambric .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 35]: An operation which , taken in connexion with the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose , suggested with some liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little bird .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 34]: She was so steadfastly occupied , that many minutes elapsed before she looked up from her work ; when she did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her attention with a hitch of his head .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 65]: ` Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bounderby , putting his hands in his pockets , and assuring himself with his right hand that the cork of the little bottle was ready for use , ' I have no occasion to say to you , that you are not only a lady born and bred , but a devilish sensible woman . '
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 30]: ` Sir , ' returned the lady , ` this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 20]: ` Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ' I am going to astonish you . '
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 14]: returned Mrs. Sparsit , interrogatively , and in the most tranquil manner possible .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 19]: She generally wore mittens , and she now laid down her work , and smoothed those mittens . '
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 19]: I am going , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , ` to marry Tom Gradgrind 's daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 11]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit . '
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 10]: I hope you may be happy , Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 13]: Oh , indeed I hope you may be happy , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 77]: And she said it with such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for him , that Bounderby , -- far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her workbox at the mirror , or swooned on the hearthrug , -- corked up the smelling-salts tight in his pocket , and thought , ` Now confound this woman , who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 51]: I wish with all my heart , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , in a highly superior manner ; somehow she seemed , in a moment , to have established a right to pity him ever afterwards ; ` that you may be in all respects very happy . '
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 34]: ` Well , ma'am , ' returned Bounderby , with some resentment in his tone : which was clearly lowered , though in spite of himself , ' I am obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 7]: I hope I shall be . '
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 7]: ` Do you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 8]: said Mrs. Sparsit , with great affability .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 12]: ` But naturally you do ; of course you do . '
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 12]: A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby 's part , succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 24]: Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough , which sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 39]: ` Well , ma'am , ' resumed Bounderby , ` under these circumstances , I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here , though you would be very welcome here . '
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 18]: ` Oh , dear no , sir , I could on no account think of that ! '
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 41]: Mrs. Sparsit shook her head , still in her highly superior manner , and a little changed the small cough -- coughing now , as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her , but had better be coughed down .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 53]: ` However , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , ` there are apartments at the Bank , where a born and bred lady , as keeper of the place , would be rather a catch than otherwise ; and if the same terms -- ' ' I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 19]: You were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase , annual compliment . '
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: ` Well , ma'am , annual compliment .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 24]: If the same annual compliment would be acceptable there , why , I see nothing to part us , unless you do . '
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 8]: ` Sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 44]: ` The proposal is like yourself , and if the position I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale -- ' ` Why , of course it is , ' said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 31]: ` If it was not , ma'am , you do n't suppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 11]: Not that I care for such society , you know !
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 5]: But you do . '
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 10]: ` Mr. Bounderby , you are very considerate . '
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 66]: ` You 'll have your own private apartments , and you 'll have your coals and your candles , and all the rest of it , and you 'll have your maid to attend upon you , and you 'll have your light porter to protect you , and you 'll be what I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable , ' said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 13]: ` Sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ` say no more .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 60]: In yielding up my trust here , I shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence : ' she might have said the sweetbread , for that delicate article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper : ` and I would rather receive it from your hand , than from any other .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 19]: Therefore , sir , I accept your offer gratefully , and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 35]: And I hope , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , concluding in an impressively compassionate manner , ' I fondly hope that Miss Gradgrind may be all you desire , and deserve ! '
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 10]: Nothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 33]: It was in vain for Bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive ways ; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him , as a Victim .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 43]: She was polite , obliging , cheerful , hopeful ; but , the more polite , the more obliging , the more cheerful , the more hopeful , the more exemplary altogether , she ; the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim , he .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 27]: She had that tenderness for his melancholy fate , that his great red countenance used to break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 28]: Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks ' time , and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted wooer .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 28]: Love was made on these occasions in the form of bracelets ; and , on all occasions during the period of betrothal , took a manufacturing aspect .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 31]: Dresses were made , jewellery was made , cakes and gloves were made , settlements were made , and an extensive assortment of Facts did appropriate honour to the contract .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 11]: The business was all Fact , from first to last .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 40]: The Hours did not go through any of those rosy performances , which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times ; neither did the clocks go any faster , or any slower , than at other seasons .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 27]: The deadly statistical recorder in the Gradgrind observatory knocked every second on the head as it was born , and buried it with his accustomed regularity .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 65]: So the day came , as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason ; and when it came , there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs -- that popular order of architecture -- Josiah Bounderby Esquire of Coketown , to Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas Gradgrind Esquire of Stone Lodge , M.P. for that borough .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 19]: And when they were united in holy matrimony , they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 53]: There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion , who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of , and how it was imported or exported , and in what quantities , and in what bottoms , whether native or foreign , and all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 36]: The bridesmaids , down to little Jane Gradgrind , were , in an intellectual point of view , fit helpmates for the calculating boy ; and there was no nonsense about any of the company .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 24]: After breakfast , the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms : ` Ladies and gentlemen , I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 111]: Since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness , I suppose I must acknowledge the same ; though , as you all know me , and know what I am , and what my extraction was , you wo n't expect a speech from a man who , when he sees a Post , says `` that 's a Post , '' and when he sees a Pump , says `` that 's a Pump , '' and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump , or a Pump a Post , or either of them a Toothpick .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 30]: If you want a speech this morning , my friend and father-in-law , Tom Gradgrind , is a Member of Parliament , and you know where to get it .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 6]: I am not your man .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 63]: However , if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day , and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind 's daughter when I was a ragged street-boy , who never washed his face unless it was at a pump , and that not oftener than once a fortnight , I hope I may be excused .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 21]: So , I hope you like my feeling independent ; if you do n't , I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 5]: I do feel independent .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 22]: Now I have mentioned , and you have mentioned , that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 8]: I am very glad to be so .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 10]: It has long been my wish to be so .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 15]: I have watched her bringing-up , and I believe she is worthy of me .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 18]: At the same time -- not to deceive you -- I believe I am worthy of her .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 53]: So , I thank you , on both our parts , for the good-will you have shown towards us ; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company , is this : I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 18]: And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found . '
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 58]: Shortly after which oration , as they were going on a nuptial trip to Lyons , in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing how the Hands got on in those parts , and whether they , too , required to be fed with gold spoons ; the happy pair departed for the railroad .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 33]: The bride , in passing down-stairs , dressed for her journey , found Tom waiting for her -- flushed , either with his feelings , or the vinous part of the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 18]: ` What a game girl you are , to be such a first-rate sister , Loo ! '
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 3]: whispered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 31]: She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that day , and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 11]: ` Old Bounderby 's quite ready , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 5]: ` Time 's up .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 14]: I shall be on the look-out for you , when you come back .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 7]: I say , my dear Loo !
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 8]: A N'T it uncommonly jolly now ! '
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 22]: End of the First Book Book the Second -- Reaping Chapter I -- Effects in the Bank A SUNNY midsummer day .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 11]: There was such a thing sometimes , even in Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 27]: Seen from a distance in such weather , Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own , which appeared impervious to the sun 's rays .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 26]: You only knew the town was there , because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 85]: A blur of soot and smoke , now confusedly tending this way , now that way , now aspiring to the vault of Heaven , now murkily creeping along the earth , as the wind rose and fell , or changed its quarter : a dense formless jumble , with sheets of cross light in it , that showed nothing but masses of darkness : -- Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself , though not a brick of it could be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: The wonder was , it was there at all .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 19]: It had been ruined so often , that it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 18]: Surely there never was such fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were made .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 25]: Handle them never so lightly , and they fell to pieces with such ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 72]: They were ruined , when they were required to send labouring children to school ; they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works ; they were ruined , when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery ; they were utterly undone , when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 21]: Besides Mr. Bounderby 's gold spoon which was generally received in Coketown , another prevalent fiction was very popular there .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 8]: It took the form of a threat .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 62]: Whenever a Coketowner felt he was ill-used -- that is to say , whenever he was not left entirely alone , and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences of any of his acts -- he was sure to come out with the awful menace , that he would ` sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic . '
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 17]: This had terrified the Home Secretary within an inch of his life , on several occasions .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 40]: However , the Coketowners were so patriotic after all , that they never had pitched their property into the Atlantic yet , but , on the contrary , had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 16]: So there it was , in the haze yonder ; and it increased and multiplied .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 37]: The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day , and the sun was so bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown , and could not be looked at steadily .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 30]: Stokers emerged from low underground doorways into factory yards , and sat on steps , and posts , and palings , wiping their swarthy visages , and contemplating coals .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 10]: The whole town seemed to be frying in oil .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 10]: There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 27]: The steam-engines shone with it , the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it , the mills throughout their many stories oozed and trickled it .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 28]: The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom : and their inhabitants , wasting with heat , toiled languidly in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 14]: But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 28]: Their wearisome heads went up and down at the same rate , in hot weather and cold , wet weather and dry , fair weather and foul .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 60]: The measured motion of their shadows on the walls , was the substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods ; while , for the summer hum of insects , it could offer , all the year round , from the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday , the whirr of shafts and wheels .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 27]: Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny day , making the passenger more sleepy and more hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 33]: Sun-blinds , and sprinklings of water , a little cooled the main streets and the shops ; but the mills , and the courts and alleys , baked at a fierce heat .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 54]: Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye , some Coketown boys who were at large -- a rare sight there -- rowed a crazy boat , which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along , while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 36]: But the sun itself , however beneficent , generally , was less kind to Coketown than hard frost , and rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering more death than life .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 30]: So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil eye , when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the things it looks upon to bless .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 20]: Mrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank , on the shadier side of the frying street .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 32]: Office-hours were over : and at that period of the day , in warm weather , she usually embellished with her genteel presence , a managerial board-room over the public office .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 45]: Her own private sitting-room was a story higher , at the window of which post of observation she was ready , every morning , to greet Mr. Bounderby , as he came across the road , with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a Victim .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 22]: He had been married now a year ; and Mrs. Sparsit had never released him from her determined pity a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 13]: The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 35]: It was another red brick house , with black outside shutters , green inside blinds , a black street-door up two white steps , a brazen door-plate , and a brazen door-handle full stop .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 35]: It was a size larger than Mr. Bounderby 's house , as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller ; in all other particulars , it was strictly according to pattern .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 33]: Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide among the desks and writing implements , she shed a feminine , not to say also aristocratic , grace upon the office .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 34]: Seated , with her needlework or netting apparatus , at the window , she had a self-laudatory sense of correcting , by her ladylike deportment , the rude business aspect of the place .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 23]: With this impression of her interesting character upon her , Mrs. Sparsit considered herself , in some sort , the Bank Fairy .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 29]: The townspeople who , in their passing and repassing , saw her there , regarded her as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 14]: What those treasures were , Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 40]: Gold and silver coin , precious paper , secrets that if divulged would bring vague destruction upon vague persons -LRB- generally , however , people whom she disliked -RRB- , were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 55]: For the rest , she knew that after office-hours , she reigned supreme over all the office furniture , and over a locked-up iron room with three locks , against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head every night , on a truckle bed , that disappeared at cockcrow .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 69]: Further , she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement , sharply spiked off from communication with the predatory world ; and over the relics of the current day 's work , consisting of blots of ink , worn-out pens , fragments of wafers , and scraps of paper torn so small , that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit tried .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 79]: Lastly , she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and carbines , arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official chimney-pieces ; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated from a place of business claiming to be wealthy -- a row of fire-buckets -- vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any occasion , but observed to exercise a fine moral influence , almost equal to bullion , on most beholders .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 13]: A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit 's empire .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 44]: The deaf serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy ; and a saying had for years gone about among the lower orders of Coketown , that she would be murdered some night when the Bank was shut , for the sake of her money .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 45]: It was generally considered , indeed , that she had been due some time , and ought to have fallen long ago ; but she had kept her life , and her situation , with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much offence and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 49]: Mrs. Sparsit 's tea was just set for her on a pert little table , with its tripod of legs in an attitude , which she insinuated after office-hours , into the company of the stern , leathern-topped , long board-table that bestrode the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 18]: The light porter placed the tea-tray on it , knuckling his forehead as a form of homage .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 11]: ` Thank you , Bitzer , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 12]: ` Thank you , ma'am , ' returned the light porter .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 26]: He was a very light porter indeed ; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a horse , for girl number twenty .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 9]: ` All is shut up , Bitzer ? '
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 4]: said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 9]: ` All is shut up , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 22]: ` And what , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , pouring out her tea , ` is the news of the day ?
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 3]: Anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 16]: ` Well , ma'am , I ca n't say that I have heard anything particular .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 18]: Our people are a bad lot , ma'am ; but that is no news , unfortunately . '
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 10]: ` What are the restless wretches doing now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 11]: ` Merely going on in the old way , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 14]: Uniting , and leaguing , and engaging to stand by one another . '
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 42]: ` It is much to be regretted , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity , ` that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations . '
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 9]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' said Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 31]: ` Being united themselves , they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 23]: ` They have done that , ma'am , ' returned Bitzer ; ` but it rather fell through , ma'am . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 50]: I do not pretend to understand these things , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , with dignity , ` my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere ; and Mr. Sparsit , as a Powler , being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 25]: I only know that these people must be conquered , and that it 's high time it was done , once for all . '
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 22]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' returned Bitzer , with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit 's oracular authority .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 15]: ` You could n't put it clearer , I am sure , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 70]: As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit , and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something , he made a pretence of arranging the rulers , inkstands , and so forth , while that lady went on with her tea , glancing through the open window , down into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 11]: ` Has it been a busy day , Bitzer ? '
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 10]: ` Not a very busy day , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 6]: About an average day . '
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 28]: He now and then slided into my lady , instead of ma'am , as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs. Sparsit 's personal dignity and claims to reverence .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 36]: ` The clerks , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , carefully brushing an imperceptible crumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten , ` are trustworthy , punctual , and industrious , of course ? '
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 10]: ` Yes , ma'am , pretty fair , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 6]: With the usual exception . '
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 32]: He held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the establishment , for which volunteer service he received a present at Christmas , over and above his weekly wage .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 23]: He had grown into an extremely clear-headed , cautious , prudent young man , who was safe to rise in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 15]: His mind was so exactly regulated , that he had no affections or passions .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 42]: All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation ; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him , that he was a young man of the steadiest principle she had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 55]: Having satisfied himself , on his father 's death , that his mother had a right of settlement in Coketown , this excellent young economist had asserted that right for her with such a steadfast adherence to the principle of the case , that she had been shut up in the workhouse ever since .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 104]: It must be admitted that he allowed her half a pound of tea a year , which was weak in him : first , because all gifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the recipient , and secondly , because his only reasonable transaction in that commodity would have been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give , and sell it for as much as he could possibly get ; it having been clearly ascertained by philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of man -- not a part of man 's duty , but the whole .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 6]: ` Pretty fair , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 11]: With the usual exception , ma'am , ' repeated Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: ` Ah -- h ! '
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 17]: said Mrs. Sparsit , shaking her head over her tea-cup , and taking a long gulp .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 25]: ` Mr. Thomas , ma'am , I doubt Mr. Thomas very much , ma'am , I do n't like his ways at all . '
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 29]: ` Bitzer , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , in a very impressive manner , ` do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 7]: I beg your pardon , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 21]: It 's quite true that you did object to names being used , and they 're always best avoided . '
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 23]: ` Please to remember that I have a charge here , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , with her air of state . '
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 12]: I hold a trust here , Bitzer , under Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 38]: However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago , that he would ever become my patron , making me an annual compliment , I can not but regard him in that light .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 27]: From Mr. Bounderby I have received every acknowledgment of my social station , and every recognition of my family descent , that I could possibly expect .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 5]: More , far more .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 11]: Therefore , to my patron I will be scrupulously true .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 69]: And I do not consider , I will not consider , I can not consider , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality , ` that I should be scrupulously true , if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof , that are unfortunately -- most unfortunately -- no doubt of that -- connected with his . '
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 11]: Bitzer knuckled his forehead again , and again begged pardon .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 32]: ` No , Bitzer , ' continued Mrs. Sparsit , ` say an individual , and I will hear you ; say Mr. Thomas , and you must excuse me . '
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 21]: ` With the usual exception , ma'am , ' said Bitzer , trying back , ` of an individual . '
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 6]: ` Ah -- h ! '
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 35]: Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation , the shake of the head over her tea-cup , and the long gulp , as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 29]: ` An individual , ma'am , ' said Bitzer , ` has never been what he ought to have been , since he first came into the place .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 8]: He is a dissipated , extravagant idler .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: He is not worth his salt , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 21]: He would n't get it either , if he had n't a friend and relation at court , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: ` Ah -- h ! '
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 13]: said Mrs. Sparsit , with another melancholy shake of her head . '
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 27]: I only hope , ma'am , ' pursued Bitzer , ` that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 15]: Otherwise , ma'am , we know out of whose pocket that money comes . '
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 6]: ` Ah -- h ! '
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 13]: sighed Mrs. Sparsit again , with another melancholy shake of her head .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 9]: ` He is to be pitied , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 19]: The last party I have alluded to , is to be pitied , ma'am , ' said Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 11]: ` Yes , Bitzer , ' said Mrs. Sparsit . '
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 10]: I have always pitied the delusion , always . '
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 33]: ` As to an individual , ma'am , ' said Bitzer , dropping his voice and drawing nearer , ` he is as improvident as any of the people in this town .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 10]: And you know what their improvidence is , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 17]: No one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does . '
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 21]: ` They would do well , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ` to take example by you , Bitzer . '
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 6]: ` Thank you , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 16]: But , since you do refer to me , now look at me , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 11]: I have put by a little , ma'am , already .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 15]: That gratuity which I receive at Christmas , ma'am : I never touch it .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 19]: I do n't even go the length of my wages , though they 're not high , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 12]: Why ca n't they do as I have done , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 11]: What one person can do , another can do . '
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 11]: This , again , was among the fictions of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 50]: Any capitalist there , who had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence , always professed to wonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands did n't each make sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence , and more or less reproached them every one for not accomplishing the little feat .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 7]: What I did you can do .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 9]: Why do n't you go and do it ?
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 20]: ` As to their wanting recreations , ma'am , ' said Bitzer , ` it 's stuff and nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 6]: I do n't want recreations .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 15]: I never did , and I never shall ; I do n't like 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 45]: As to their combining together ; there are many of them , I have no doubt , that by watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now and then , whether in money or good will , and improve their livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 11]: Then , why do n't they improve it , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 20]: It 's the first consideration of a rational creature , and it 's what they pretend to want . '
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 5]: ` Pretend indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 5]: said Mrs. Sparsit . '
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 26]: I am sure we are constantly hearing , ma'am , till it becomes quite nauseous , concerning their wives and families , ' said Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 8]: ` Why look at me , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 9]: I do n't want a wife and family .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 5]: Why should they ? '
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 11]: ` Because they are improvident , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 16]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' returned Bitzer , ` that 's where it is .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 16]: If they were more provident and less perverse , ma'am , what would they do ?
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 53]: They would say , `` While my hat covers my family , '' or `` while my bonnet covers my family , '' -- as the case might be , ma'am -- `` I have only one to feed , and that 's the person I most like to feed . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 13]: ` To be sure , ' assented Mrs. Sparsit , eating muffin .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 27]: ` Thank you , ma'am , ' said Bitzer , knuckling his forehead again , in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit 's improving conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 24]: ` Would you wish a little more hot water , ma'am , or is there anything else that I could fetch you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 8]: ` Nothing just now , Bitzer . '
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 6]: ` Thank you , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 71]: I should n't wish to disturb you at your meals , ma'am , particularly tea , knowing your partiality for it , ' said Bitzer , craning a little to look over into the street from where he stood ; ` but there 's a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so , ma'am , and he has come across as if he was going to knock .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 11]: That is his knock , ma'am , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 26]: He stepped to the window ; and looking out , and drawing in his head again , confirmed himself with , ` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 14]: Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in , ma'am ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 23]: I do n't know who it can be , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens . '
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 8]: A stranger , ma'am , evidently . '
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 60]: ` What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening , unless he comes upon some business for which he is too late , I do n't know , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr. Bounderby , and I will never shrink from it .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 19]: If to see him is any part of the duty I have accepted , I will see him .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 8]: Use your own discretion , Bitzer . '
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 70]: Here the visitor , all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit 's magnanimous words , repeated his knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open the door ; while Mrs. Sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little table , with all its appliances upon it , in a cupboard , and then decamped up-stairs , that she might appear , if needful , with the greater dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 29]: ` If you please , ma'am , the gentleman would wish to see you , ' said Bitzer , with his light eye at Mrs. Sparsit 's keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 46]: So , Mrs. Sparsit , who had improved the interval by touching up her cap , took her classical features down-stairs again , and entered the board-room in the manner of a Roman matron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 30]: The visitor having strolled to the window , and being then engaged in looking carelessly out , was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man could possibly be .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 39]: He stood whistling to himself with all imaginable coolness , with his hat still on , and a certain air of exhaustion upon him , in part arising from excessive summer , and in part from excessive gentility .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 40]: For it was to be seen with half an eye that he was a thorough gentleman , made to the model of the time ; weary of everything , and putting no more faith in anything than Lucifer . '
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 19]: I believe , sir , ' quoth Mrs. Sparsit , ` you wished to see me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 21]: I beg your pardon , ' he said , turning and removing his hat ; ` pray excuse me . '
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 11]: thought Mrs. Sparsit , as she made a stately bend .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 28]: ` Five and thirty , good-looking , good figure , good teeth , good voice , good breeding , well-dressed , dark hair , bold eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 32]: All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in her womanly way -- like the Sultan who put his head in the pail of water -- merely in dipping down and coming up again .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 13]: ` Please to be seated , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 4]: Allow me . '
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 17]: He placed a chair for her , but remained himself carelessly lounging against the table . '
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 32]: I left my servant at the railway looking after the luggage -- very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the van -- and strolled on , looking about me .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 4]: Exceedingly odd place .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 17]: Will you allow me to ask you if it 's always as black as this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 16]: ` In general much blacker , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , in her uncompromising way .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 5]: ` Is it possible !
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 13]: Excuse me : you are not a native , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 10]: ` No , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 29]: ` It was once my good or ill fortune , as it may be -- before I became a widow -- to move in a very different sphere .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 7]: My husband was a Powler . '
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 8]: ` Beg your pardon , really ! '
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 4]: said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 5]: ` Was -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 9]: Mrs. Sparsit repeated , ' A Powler . '
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 15]: ` Powler Family , ' said the stranger , after reflecting a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 5]: Mrs. Sparsit signified assent .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 10]: The stranger seemed a little more fatigued than before .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 10]: ` You must be very much bored here ? '
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 10]: was the inference he drew from the communication . '
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 30]: I am the servant of circumstances , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` and I have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life . '
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 40]: ` Very philosophical , ' returned the stranger , ` and very exemplary and laudable , and -- ' It seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the sentence , so he played with his watch-chain wearily .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 35]: ` May I be permitted to ask , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` to what I am indebted for the favour of -- ' ` Assuredly , ' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: ` Much obliged to you for reminding me .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 16]: I am the bearer of a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby , the banker .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 60]: Walking through this extraordinarily black town , while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel , I asked a fellow whom I met ; one of the working people ; who appeared to have been taking a shower-bath of something fluffy , which I assume to be the raw material -- ' Mrs. Sparsit inclined her head . '
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 14]: -- Raw material -- where Mr. Bounderby , the banker , might reside .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 18]: Upon which , misled no doubt by the word Banker , he directed me to the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 29]: Fact being , I presume , that Mr. Bounderby the Banker does not reside in the edifice in which I have the honour of offering this explanation ? '
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 16]: ` No , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ` he does not . '
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 17]: I had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment , nor have I .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 69]: But strolling on to the Bank to kill time , and having the good fortune to observe at the window , ' towards which he languidly waved his hand , then slightly bowed , ' a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance , I considered that I could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker does live .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 14]: Which I accordingly venture , with all suitable apologies , to do . '
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 30]: The inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently relieved , to Mrs. Sparsit 's thinking , by a certain gallantry at ease , which offered her homage too .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 42]: Here he was , for instance , at this moment , all but sitting on the table , and yet lazily bending over her , as if he acknowledged an attraction in her that made her charming -- in her way .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 99]: ` Banks , I know , are always suspicious , and officially must be , ' said the stranger , whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant likewise ; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever contained -- which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this numerous sect , whosoever may have been that great man : ` therefore I may observe that my letter -- here it is -- is from the member for this place -- Gradgrind -- whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in London . '
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 30]: Mrs. Sparsit recognized the hand , intimated that such confirmation was quite unnecessary , and gave Mr. Bounderby 's address , with all needful clues and directions in aid .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 9]: ` Thousand thanks , ' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 10]: ` Of course you know the Banker well ? '
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 16]: ` In my dependent relation towards him , I have known him ten years . '
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 5]: ` Quite an eternity !
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 9]: I think he married Gradgrind 's daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 21]: ` Yes , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , suddenly compressing her mouth , ` he had that -- honour . '
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 13]: ` The lady is quite a philosopher , I am told ? '
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: ` Indeed , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 5]: ` Is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 35]: ` Excuse my impertinent curiosity , ' pursued the stranger , fluttering over Mrs. Sparsit 's eyebrows , with a propitiatory air , ` but you know the family , and know the world .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 17]: I am about to know the family , and may have much to do with them .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 7]: Is the lady so very alarming ?
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 19]: Her father gives her such a portentously hard-headed reputation , that I have a burning desire to know .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 5]: Is she absolutely unapproachable ?
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 5]: Repellently and stunningly clever ?
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 12]: I see , by your meaning smile , you think not .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 9]: You have poured balm into my anxious soul .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 6]: As to age , now .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 2]: Forty ?
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 5]: Five and thirty ? '
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 6]: Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright . '
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 7]: A chit , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 10]: ` Not twenty when she was married . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 32]: I give you my honour , Mrs. Powler , ' returned the stranger , detaching himself from the table , ` that I never was so astonished in my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 19]: It really did seem to impress him , to the utmost extent of his capacity of being impressed .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 27]: He looked at his informant for full a quarter of a minute , and appeared to have the surprise in his mind all the time . '
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 30]: I assure you , Mrs. Powler , ' he then said , much exhausted , ` that the father 's manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 17]: I am obliged to you , of all things , for correcting so absurd a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 5]: Pray excuse my intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 3]: Many thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 4]: Good day ! '
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 35]: He bowed himself out ; and Mrs. Sparsit , hiding in the window curtain , saw him languishing down the street on the shady side of the way , observed of all the town .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 12]: ` What do you think of the gentleman , Bitzer ? '
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 13]: she asked the light porter , when he came to take away .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 13]: ` Spends a deal of money on his dress , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 19]: ` It must be admitted , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` that it 's very tasteful . '
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 18]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' returned Bitzer , ` if that 's worth the money . '
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 28]: ` Besides which , ma'am , ' resumed Bitzer , while he was polishing the table , ` he looks to me as if he gamed . '
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: ` It 's immoral to game , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 21]: ` It 's ridiculous , ma'am , ' said Bitzer , ` because the chances are against the players . '
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 29]: Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working , or whether it was that her hand was out , she did no work that night .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 75]: She sat at the window , when the sun began to sink behind the smoke ; she sat there , when the smoke was burning red , when the colour faded from it , when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground , and creep upward , upward , up to the house-tops , up the church steeple , up to the summits of the factory chimneys , up to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 75]: Without a candle in the room , Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window , with her hands before her , not thinking much of the sounds of evening ; the whooping of boys , the barking of dogs , the rumbling of wheels , the steps and voices of passengers , the shrill street cries , the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by , the shutting-up of shop-shutters .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 43]: Not until the light porter announced that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready , did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself from her reverie , and convey her dense black eyebrows -- by that time creased with meditation , as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 7]: ` O , you Fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 12]: said Mrs. Sparsit , when she was alone at her supper .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 18]: Whom she meant , she did not say ; but she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 19]: Chapter II -- Mr. James Harthouse THE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 36]: They went about recruiting ; and where could they enlist recruits more hopefully , than among the fine gentlemen who , having found out everything to be worth nothing , were equally ready for anything ?
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 21]: Moreover , the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were attractive to many of the Gradgrind school .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 16]: They liked fine gentlemen ; they pretended that they did not , but they did .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 42]: They became exhausted in imitation of them ; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them ; and they served out , with an enervated air , the little mouldy rations of political economy , on which they regaled their disciples .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 17]: There never before was seen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 125]: Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school , there was one of a good family and a better appearance , with a happy turn of humour which had told immensely with the House of Commons on the occasion of his entertaining it with his -LRB- and the Board of Directors -RRB- view of a railway accident , in which the most careful officers ever known , employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of , assisted by the finest mechanical contrivances ever devised , the whole in action on the best line ever constructed , had killed five people and wounded thirty-two , by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole system would have been positively incomplete .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 19]: Among the slain was a cow , and among the scattered articles unowned , a widow 's cap .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 50]: And the honourable member had so tickled the House -LRB- which has a delicate sense of humour -RRB- by putting the cap on the cow , that it became impatient of any serious reference to the Coroner 's Inquest , and brought the railway off with Cheers and Laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 77]: Now , this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than himself , who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons , and found it a bore ; and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad , and found it a bore ; and had then strolled to Jerusalem , and got bored there ; and had then gone yachting about the world , and got bored everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 32]: To whom this honourable and jocular , member fraternally said one day , ` Jem , there 's a good opening among the hard Fact fellows , and they want men .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: I wonder you do n't go in for statistics . '
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 34]: Jem , rather taken by the novelty of the idea , and very hard up for a change , was as ready to ` go in ' for statistics as for anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 6]: So , he went in .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 62]: He coached himself up with a blue-book or two ; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows , and said , ` If you want to bring in , for any place , a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech , look after my brother Jem , for he 's your man . '
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 42]: After a few dashes in the public meeting way , Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem , and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown , to become known there and in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 33]: Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit , which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand ; superscribed , ` Josiah Bounderby , Esquire , Banker , Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 8]: Specially to introduce James Harthouse , Esquire .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 4]: Thomas Gradgrind . '
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 29]: Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse 's card , Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 33]: There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window , in a state of mind so disconsolate , that he was already half-disposed to ` go in ' for something else .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 20]: ` My name , sir , ' said his visitor , ` is Josiah Bounderby , of Coketown . '
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 23]: Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed -LRB- though he scarcely looked so -RRB- to have a pleasure he had long expected .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 27]: ` Coketown , sir , ' said Bounderby , obstinately taking a chair , ` is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 36]: Therefore , if you will allow me -- or whether you will or not , for I am a plain man -- I 'll tell you something about it before we go any further . '
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 6]: Mr. Harthouse would be charmed .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 14]: ` Do n't be too sure of that , ' said Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 6]: I do n't promise it .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 9]: First of all , you see our smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 8]: That 's meat and drink to us .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 18]: It 's the healthiest thing in the world in all respects , and particularly for the lungs .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 18]: If you are one of those who want us to consume it , I differ from you .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 33]: We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear 'em out now , for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland . '
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 34]: By way of ` going in ' to the fullest extent , Mr. Harthouse rejoined , ` Mr. Bounderby , I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 5]: On conviction . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 11]: I am glad to hear it , ' said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 20]: ` Now , you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 3]: You have ?
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 10]: I 'll state the fact of it to you .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 26]: It 's the pleasantest work there is , and it 's the lightest work there is , and it 's the best-paid work there is .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 22]: More than that , we could n't improve the mills themselves , unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 9]: Which we 're not a-going to do . '
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 8]: ` Mr. Bounderby , perfectly right . '
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 13]: ` Lastly , ' said Bounderby , ` as to our Hands .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 26]: There 's not a Hand in this town , sir , man , woman , or child , but has one ultimate object in life .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 17]: That object is , to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 25]: Now , they 're not a-going -- none of 'em -- ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 8]: And now you know the place . '
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 22]: Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and refreshed , by this condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 37]: ` Why , you see , ' replied Mr. Bounderby , ` it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man , particularly with a public man , when I make his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 44]: I have only one thing more to say to you , Mr. Harthouse , before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall respond , to the utmost of my poor ability , to my friend Tom Gradgrind 's letter of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 7]: You are a man of family .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 18]: Do n't you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 21]: I am a bit of dirty riff-raff , and a genuine scrap of tag , rag , and bobtail . '
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 20]: If anything could have exalted Jem 's interest in Mr. Bounderby , it would have been this very circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 7]: Or , so he told him .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 17]: ` So now , ' said Bounderby , ` we may shake hands on equal terms .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 42]: I say , equal terms , because although I know what I am , and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted myself out of , better than any man does , I am as proud as you are .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 9]: I am just as proud as you are .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 29]: Having now asserted my independence in a proper manner , I may come to how do you find yourself , and I hope you 're pretty well . '
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 21]: The better , Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as they shook hands , for the salubrious air of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 8]: Mr. Bounderby received the answer with favour .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 24]: ` Perhaps you know , ' said he , ` or perhaps you do n't know , I married Tom Gradgrind 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 29]: If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me , I shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind 's daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 16]: ` Mr. Bounderby , ' said Jem , ` you anticipate my dearest wishes . '
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 50]: They went out without further discourse ; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him , to the private red brick dwelling , with the black outside shutters , the green inside blinds , and the black street door up the two white steps .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 23]: In the drawing-room of which mansion , there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr. James Harthouse had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 63]: She was so constrained , and yet so careless ; so reserved , and yet so watchful ; so cold and proud , and yet so sensitively ashamed of her husband 's braggart humility -- from which she shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow ; that it was quite a new sensation to observe her .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 11]: In face she was no less remarkable than in manner .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 25]: Her features were handsome ; but their natural play was so locked up , that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine expression .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 56]: Utterly indifferent , perfectly self-reliant , never at a loss , and yet never at her ease , with her figure in company with them there , and her mind apparently quite alone -- it was of no use ` going in ' yet awhile to comprehend this girl , for she baffled all penetration .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 15]: From the mistress of the house , the visitor glanced to the house itself .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 12]: There was no mute sign of a woman in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 18]: No graceful little adornment , no fanciful little device , however trivial , anywhere expressed her influence .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 30]: Cheerless and comfortless , boastfully and doggedly rich , there the room stared at its present occupants , unsoftened and unrelieved by the least trace of any womanly occupation .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 35]: As Mr. Bounderby stood in the midst of his household gods , so those unrelenting divinities occupied their places around Mr. Bounderby , and they were worthy of one another , and well matched .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 23]: ` This , sir , ' said Bounderby , ` is my wife , Mrs. Bounderby : Tom Gradgrind 's eldest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 6]: Loo , Mr. James Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 9]: Mr. Harthouse has joined your father 's muster-roll .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 29]: If he is not Torn Gradgrind 's colleague before long , I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 13]: You observe , Mr. Harthouse , that my wife is my junior .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 31]: I do n't know what she saw in me to marry me , but she saw something in me , I suppose , or she would n't have married me .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 13]: She has lots of expensive knowledge , sir , political and otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 24]: If you want to cram for anything , I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 25]: To a more agreeable adviser , or one from whom he would be more likely to learn , Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 4]: said his host .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 23]: ` If you 're in the complimentary line , you 'll get on here , for you 'll meet with no competition .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 25]: I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself , and I do n't profess to understand the art of paying 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 6]: In fact , despise 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 18]: But , your bringing-up was different from mine ; mine was a real thing , by George !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 14]: You 're a gentleman , and I do n't pretend to be one .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 14]: I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , and that 's enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 17]: However , though I am not influenced by manners and station , Loo Bounderby may be .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 31]: She had n't my advantages -- disadvantages you would call 'em , but I call 'em advantages -- so you 'll not waste your power , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 41]: ` Mr. Bounderby , ' said Jem , turning with a smile to Louisa , ` is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state , quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works . '
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 13]: ` You respect Mr. Bounderby very much , ' she quietly returned .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 9]: ` It is natural that you should . '
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 32]: He was disgracefully thrown out , for a gentleman who had seen so much of the world , and thought , ` Now , how am I to take this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 25]: ` You are going to devote yourself , as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby has said , to the service of your country .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 53]: You have made up your mind , ' said Louisa , still standing before him where she had first stopped -- in all the singular contrariety of her self-possession , and her being obviously very ill at ease -- ` to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties . '
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 17]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , ' he returned , laughing , ` upon my honour , no .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 9]: I will make no such pretence to you .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 72]: I have seen a little , here and there , up and down ; I have found it all to be very worthless , as everybody has , and as some confess they have , and some do not ; and I am going in for your respected father 's opinions -- really because I have no choice of opinions , and may as well back them as anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 9]: ` Have you none of your own ? '
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 4]: asked Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 11]: I have not so much as the slightest predilection left .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 13]: I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 59]: The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone , is a conviction -LRB- unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject -RRB- , that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set , and just as much harm as any other set .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 11]: There 's an English family with a charming Italian motto .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 7]: What will be , will be .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 8]: It 's the only truth going ! '
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 34]: This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty -- a vice so dangerous , so deadly , and so common -- seemed , he observed , a little to impress her in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 71]: He followed up the advantage , by saying in his pleasantest manner : a manner to which she might attach as much or as little meaning as she pleased : ` The side that can prove anything in a line of units , tens , hundreds , and thousands , Mrs. Bounderby , seems to me to afford the most fun , and to give a man the best chance .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 14]: I am quite as much attached to it as if I believed it .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 20]: I am quite ready to go in for it , to the same extent as if I believed it .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 15]: And what more could I possibly do , if I did believe it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 11]: ` You are a singular politician , ' said Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 11]: ` Pardon me ; I have not even that merit .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 31]: We are the largest party in the state , I assure you , Mrs. Bounderby , if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together . '
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 52]: Mr. Bounderby , who had been in danger of bursting in silence , interposed here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six , and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 33]: The round of visits was made ; and Mr. James Harthouse , with a discreet use of his blue coaching , came off triumphantly , though with a considerable accession of boredom .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 19]: In the evening , he found the dinner-table laid for four , but they sat down only three .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 54]: It was an appropriate occasion for Mr. Bounderby to discuss the flavour of the hap ` orth of stewed eels he had purchased in the streets at eight years old ; and also of the inferior water , specially used for laying the dust , with which he had washed down that repast .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 36]: He likewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish , with the calculation that he -LRB- Bounderby -RRB- had eaten in his youth at least three horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 16]: These recitals , Jem , in a languid manner , received with ` charming ! '
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 31]: every now and then ; and they probably would have decided him to ` go in ' for Jerusalem again to-morrow morning , had he been less curious respecting Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 54]: ` Is there nothing , ' he thought , glancing at her as she sat at the head of the table , where her youthful figure , small and slight , but very graceful , looked as pretty as it looked misplaced ; ` is there nothing that will move that face ? '
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 17]: By Jupiter , there was something , and here it was , in an unexpected shape .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 3]: Tom appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 14]: She changed as the door opened , and broke into a beaming smile .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 4]: A beautiful smile .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 24]: Mr. James Harthouse might not have thought so much of it , but that he had wondered so long at her impassive face .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 32]: She put out her hand -- a pretty little soft hand ; and her fingers closed upon her brother 's , as if she would have carried them to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 6]: ` Ay , ay ? '
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 4]: thought the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 11]: ` This whelp is the only creature she cares for .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 5]: So , so ! '
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 10]: The whelp was presented , and took his chair .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 10]: The appellation was not flattering , but not unmerited .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 26]: ` When I was your age , young Tom , ' said Bounderby , ' I was punctual , or I got no dinner ! '
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 30]: ` When you were my age , ' resumed Tom , ` you had n't a wrong balance to get right , and had n't to dress afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 10]: ` Never mind that now , ' said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 9]: ` Well , then , ' grumbled Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 8]: ` Do n't begin with me . '
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 28]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , ' said Harthouse , perfectly hearing this under-strain as it went on ; ` your brother 's face is quite familiar to me .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 7]: Can I have seen him abroad ?
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 9]: Or at some public school , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 26]: ` No , ' she resumed , quite interested , ` he has never been abroad yet , and was educated here , at home .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 17]: Tom , love , I am telling Mr. Harthouse that he never saw you abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 11]: ` No such luck , sir , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 28]: There was little enough in him to brighten her face , for he was a sullen young fellow , and ungracious in his manner even to her .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 25]: So much the greater must have been the solitude of her heart , and her need of some one on whom to bestow it .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 29]: ` So much the more is this whelp the only creature she has ever cared for , ' thought Mr. James Harthouse , turning it over and over .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 6]: ` So much the more .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 6]: So much the more . '
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 51]: Both in his sister 's presence , and after she had left the room , the whelp took no pains to hide his contempt for Mr. Bounderby , whenever he could indulge it without the observation of that independent man , by making wry faces , or shutting one eye .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 27]: Without responding to these telegraphic communications , Mr. Harthouse encouraged him much in the course of the evening , and showed an unusual liking for him .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 44]: At last , when he rose to return to his hotel , and was a little doubtful whether he knew the way by night , the whelp immediately proffered his services as guide , and turned out with him to escort him thither .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 40]: Chapter III -- The Whelp IT was very remarkable that a young gentleman who had been brought up under one continuous system of unnatural restraint , should be a hypocrite ; but it was certainly the case with Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 38]: It was very strange that a young gentleman who had never been left to his own guidance for five consecutive minutes , should be incapable at last of governing himself ; but so it was with Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 43]: It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle , should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities ; but such a monster , beyond all doubt , was Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 6]: ` Do you smoke ? '
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 13]: asked Mr. James Harthouse , when they came to the hotel . '
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: I believe you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 20]: He could do no less than ask Tom up ; and Tom could do no less than go up .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 64]: What with a cooling drink adapted to the weather , but not so weak as cool ; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts ; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa , and more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 23]: Tom blew his smoke aside , after he had been smoking a little while , and took an observation of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 24]: ` He do n't seem to care about his dress , ' thought Tom , ` and yet how capitally he does it .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 8]: What an easy swell he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 27]: Mr. James Harthouse , happening to catch Tom 's eye , remarked that he drank nothing , and filled his glass with his own negligent hand .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 9]: ` Thank ` ee , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 5]: ` Thank ` ee .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 19]: Well , Mr. Harthouse , I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 22]: Tom said this with one eye shut up again , and looking over his glass knowingly , at his entertainer . '
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 7]: A very good fellow indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 5]: returned Mr. James Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 10]: ` You think so , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 7]: And shut up his eye again .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 56]: Mr. James Harthouse smiled ; and rising from his end of the sofa , and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece , so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked , in front of Tom and looking down at him , observed : ` What a comical brother-in-law you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 18]: ` What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is , I think you mean , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 16]: ` You are a piece of caustic , Tom , ' retorted Mr. James Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 55]: There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat ; in being called Tom , in such an intimate way , by such a voice ; in being on such off-hand terms so soon , with such a pair of whiskers ; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 18]: I do n't care for old Bounderby , ' said he , ` if you mean that .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 29]: I have always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked about him , and I have always thought of him in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 15]: I am not going to begin to be polite now , about old Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 10]: It would be rather late in the day . '
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 24]: ` Do n't mind me , ' returned James ; ` but take care when his wife is by , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 5]: ` His wife ? '
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 5]: ` My sister Loo ?
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 4]: O yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 14]: And he laughed , and took a little more of the cooling drink .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 59]: James Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude , smoking his cigar in his own easy way , and looking pleasantly at the whelp , as if he knew himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only to hover over him , and he must give up his whole soul if required .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 12]: It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 28]: He looked at his companion sneakingly , he looked at him admiringly , he looked at him boldly , and put up one leg on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 6]: ` My sister Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 9]: ` She never cared for old Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 26]: ` That 's the past tense , Tom , ' returned Mr. James Harthouse , striking the ash from his cigar with his little finger .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 11]: ` We are in the present tense , now . '
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: ` Verb neuter , not to care .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 6]: Indicative mood , present tense .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 31]: First person singular , I do not care ; second person singular , thou dost not care ; third person singular , she does not care , ' returned Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 3]: ` Good !
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 4]: Very quaint ! '
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 4]: said his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 9]: ` Though you do n't mean it . '
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 11]: ` But I do mean it , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 5]: ` Upon my honour !
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 25]: Why , you wo n't tell me , Mr. Harthouse , that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 31]: ` My dear fellow , ' returned the other , ` what am I bound to suppose , when I find two married people living in harmony and happiness ? '
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 13]: Tom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 31]: If his second leg had not been already there when he was called a dear fellow , he would have put it up at that great stage of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 65]: Feeling it necessary to do something then , he stretched himself out at greater length , and , reclining with the back of his head on the end of the sofa , and smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence , turned his common face , and not too sober eyes , towards the face looking down upon him so carelessly yet so potently .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 28]: ` You know our governor , Mr. Harthouse , ' said Tom , ` and therefore , you need n't be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 19]: She never had a lover , and the governor proposed old Bounderby , and she took him . '
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 14]: ` Very dutiful in your interesting sister , ' said Mr. James Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 37]: ` Yes , but she would n't have been as dutiful , and it would not have come off as easily , ' returned the whelp , ` if it had n't been for me . '
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 17]: The tempter merely lifted his eyebrows ; but the whelp was obliged to go on . '
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 16]: I persuaded her , ' he said , with an edifying air of superiority . '
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 49]: I was stuck into old Bounderby 's bank -LRB- where I never wanted to be -RRB- , and I knew I should get into scrapes there , if she put old Bounderby 's pipe out ; so I told her my wishes , and she came into them .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 7]: She would do anything for me .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 12]: It was very game of her , was n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 8]: ` It was charming , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 61]: ` Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me , ' continued Tom coolly , ` because my liberty and comfort , and perhaps my getting on , depended on it ; and she had no other lover , and staying at home was like staying in jail -- especially when I was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 25]: It was n't as if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby ; but still it was a good thing in her . '
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 4]: ` Perfectly delightful .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: And she gets on so placidly . '
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 18]: ` Oh , ' returned Tom , with contemptuous patronage , ` she 's a regular girl .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 7]: A girl can get on anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 14]: She has settled down to the life , and she do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 8]: It does just as well as another .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 17]: Besides , though Loo is a girl , she 's not a common sort of girl .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 31]: She can shut herself up within herself , and think -- as I have often known her sit and watch the fire -- for an hour at a stretch . '
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 5]: ` Ay , ay ?
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 13]: Has resources of her own , ' said Harthouse , smoking quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 31]: ` Not so much of that as you may suppose , ' returned Tom ; ` for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 6]: It 's his system . '
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 10]: ` Formed his daughter on his own model ? '
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 3]: suggested Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 4]: ` His daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 4]: and everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 9]: Why , he formed Me that way ! '
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 4]: ` Impossible ! '
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 15]: ` He did , though , ' said Tom , shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 42]: I mean to say , Mr. Harthouse , that when I first left home and went to old Bounderby 's , I was as flat as a warming-pan , and knew no more about life , than any oyster does . '
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 5]: ` Come , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 6]: I can hardly believe that .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 7]: A joke 's a joke . '
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 6]: ` Upon my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 5]: said the whelp . '
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 9]: I am serious ; I am indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 25]: He smoked with great gravity and dignity for a little while , and then added , in a highly complacent tone , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 8]: I have picked up a little since .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 6]: I do n't deny that .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 14]: But I have done it myself ; no thanks to the governor . '
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 7]: ` And your intelligent sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 10]: ` My intelligent sister is about where she was .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 37]: She used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon , that girls usually fall back upon ; and I do n't see how she is to have got over that since .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 17]: But she do n't mind , ' he sagaciously added , puffing at his cigar again .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 10]: ` Girls can always get on , somehow . '
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 52]: ` Calling at the Bank yesterday evening , for Mr. Bounderby 's address , I found an ancient lady there , who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister , ' observed Mr. James Harthouse , throwing away the last small remnant of the cigar he had now smoked out .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 5]: ` Mother Sparsit ! '
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 10]: you have seen her already , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 4]: His friend nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 37]: Tom took his cigar out of his mouth , to shut up his eye -LRB- which had grown rather unmanageable -RRB- with the greater expression , and to tap his nose several times with his finger .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 20]: ` Mother Sparsit 's feeling for Loo is more than admiration , I should think , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 6]: ` Say affection and devotion .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 14]: Mother Sparsit never set her cap at Bounderby when he was a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 4]: Oh no ! '
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 23]: These were the last words spoken by the whelp , before a giddy drowsiness came upon him , followed by complete oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 33]: He was roused from the latter state by an uneasy dream of being stirred up with a boot , and also of a voice saying : ` Come , it 's late .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 4]: Be off ! '
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 9]: he said , scrambling from the sofa . '
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 9]: I must take my leave of you though .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 3]: I say .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 6]: Yours is very good tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 7]: But it 's too mild . '
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 13]: ` Yes , it 's too mild , ' returned his entertainer .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 13]: ` It 's -- it 's ridiculously mild , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 6]: ` Where 's the door !
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 39]: ` He had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter through a mist , which , after giving him some trouble and difficulty , resolved itself into the main street , in which he stood alone .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 47]: He then walked home pretty easily , though not yet free from an impression of the presence and influence of his new friend -- as if he were lounging somewhere in the air , in the same negligent attitude , regarding him with the same look .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 10]: The whelp went home , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 73]: If he had had any sense of what he had done that night , and had been less of a whelp and more of a brother , he might have turned short on the road , might have gone down to the ill-smelling river that was dyed black , might have gone to bed in it for good and all , and have curtained his head for ever with its filthy waters .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 18]: Chapter IV -- Men and Brothers ` OH , my friends , the down-trodden operatives of Coketown !
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 17]: Oh , my friends and fellow-countrymen , the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism !
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 13]: Oh , my friends and fellow-sufferers , and fellow-workmen , and fellow-men !
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 79]: I tell you that the hour is come , when we must rally round one another as One united power , and crumble into dust the oppressors that too long have battened upon the plunder of our families , upon the sweat of our brows , upon the labour of our hands , upon the strength of our sinews , upon the God-created glorious rights of Humanity , and upon the holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood ! '
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 8]: ` Hear , hear , hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 4]: ` Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 45]: and other cries , arose in many voices from various parts of the densely crowded and suffocatingly close Hall , in which the orator , perched on a stage , delivered himself of this and what other froth and fume he had in him .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 18]: He had declaimed himself into a violent heat , and was as hoarse as he was hot .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 61]: By dint of roaring at the top of his voice under a flaring gaslight , clenching his fists , knitting his brows , setting his teeth , and pounding with his arms , he had taken so much out of himself by this time , that he was brought to a stop , and called for a glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 38]: As he stood there , trying to quench his fiery face with his drink of water , the comparison between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces turned towards him , was extremely to his disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 23]: Judging him by Nature 's evidence , he was above the mass in very little but the stage on which he stood .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 10]: In many great respects he was essentially below them .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 33]: He was not so honest , he was not so manly , he was not so good-humoured ; he substituted cunning for their simplicity , and passion for their safe solid sense .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 44]: An ill-made , high-shouldered man , with lowering brows , and his features crushed into an habitually sour expression , he contrasted most unfavourably , even in his mongrel dress , with the great body of his hearers in their plain working clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 93]: Strange as it always is to consider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the dreariness of some complacent person , lord or commoner , whom three-fourths of it could , by no human means , raise out of the slough of inanity to their own intellectual level , it was particularly strange , and it was even particularly affecting , to see this crowd of earnest faces , whose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could doubt , so agitated by such a leader .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 2]: Good !
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 4]: Hear , hear !
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 21]: The eagerness both of attention and intention , exhibited in all the countenances , made them a most impressive sight .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 33]: There was no carelessness , no languor , no idle curiosity ; none of the many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies , visible for one moment there .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 119]: That every man felt his condition to be , somehow or other , worse than it might be ; that every man considered it incumbent on him to join the rest , towards the making of it better ; that every man felt his only hope to be in his allying himself to the comrades by whom he was surrounded ; and that in this belief , right or wrong -LRB- unhappily wrong then -RRB- , the whole of that crowd were gravely , deeply , faithfully in earnest ; must have been as plain to any one who chose to see what was there , as the bare beams of the roof and the whitened brick walls .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 95]: Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his own breast , that these men , through their very delusions , showed great qualities , susceptible of being turned to the happiest and best account ; and that to pretend -LRB- on the strength of sweeping axioms , howsoever cut and dried -RRB- that they went astray wholly without cause , and of their own irrational wills , was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire , death without birth , harvest without seed , anything or everything produced from nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 40]: The orator having refreshed himself , wiped his corrugated forehead from left to right several times with his handkerchief folded into a pad , and concentrated all his revived forces , in a sneer of great disdain and bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 9]: ` But oh , my friends and brothers !
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 12]: Oh , men and Englishmen , the down-trodden operatives of Coketown !
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 197]: What shall we say of that man -- that working-man , that I should find it necessary so to libel the glorious name -- who , being practically and well acquainted with the grievances and wrongs of you , the injured pith and marrow of this land , and having heard you , with a noble and majestic unanimity that will make Tyrants tremble , resolve for to subscribe to the funds of the United Aggregate Tribunal , and to abide by the injunctions issued by that body for your benefit , whatever they may be -- what , I ask you , will you say of that working-man , since such I must acknowledge him to be , who , at such a time , deserts his post , and sells his flag ; who , at such a time , turns a traitor and a craven and a recreant , who , at such a time , is not ashamed to make to you the dastardly and humiliating avowal that he will hold himself aloof , and will not be one of those associated in the gallant stand for Freedom and for Right ? '
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 8]: The assembly was divided at this point .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 25]: There were some groans and hisses , but the general sense of honour was much too strong for the condemnation of a man unheard .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 10]: ` Be sure you 're right , Slackbridge ! '
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: ` Put him up ! '
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 7]: ` Let 's hear him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 8]: Such things were said on many sides .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 14]: Finally , one strong voice called out , ` Is the man heer ?
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 22]: If the man 's heer , Slackbridge , let 's hear the man himseln , ` stead o ' yo . '
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 9]: Which was received with a round of applause .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 48]: Slackbridge , the orator , looked about him with a withering smile ; and , holding out his right hand at arm 's length -LRB- as the manner of all Slackbridges is -RRB- , to still the thundering sea , waited until there was a profound silence .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 9]: ` Oh , my friends and fellow-men ! '
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 35]: said Slackbridge then , shaking his head with violent scorn , ' I do not wonder that you , the prostrate sons of labour , are incredulous of the existence of such a man .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 28]: But he who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage existed , and Judas Iscariot existed , and Castlereagh existed , and this man exists ! '
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 26]: Here , a brief press and confusion near the stage , ended in the man himself standing at the orator 's side before the concourse .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 35]: He was pale and a little moved in the face -- his lips especially showed it ; but he stood quiet , with his left hand at his chin , waiting to be heard .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 21]: There was a chairman to regulate the proceedings , and this functionary now took the case into his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 51]: ` My friends , ' said he , ` by virtue o ' my office as your president , I askes o ' our friend Slackbridge , who may be a little over hetter in this business , to take his seat , whiles this man Stephen Blackpool is heern .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 8]: You all know this man Stephen Blackpool .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 17]: You know him awlung o ' his misfort ` ns , and his good name . '
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 17]: With that , the chairman shook him frankly by the hand , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 22]: Slackbridge likewise sat down , wiping his hot forehead -- always from left to right , and never the reverse way .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 41]: ` My friends , ' Stephen began , in the midst of a dead calm ; ' I ha ' hed what 's been spok 'n o ' me , and 't is lickly that I sha n't mend it .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 39]: But I 'd liefer you 'd hearn the truth concernin myseln , fro my lips than fro onny other man 's , though I never cud 'n speak afore so monny , wi'out bein moydert and muddled . '
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 16]: Slackbridge shook his head as if he would shake it off , in his bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 35]: ` I 'm th ' one single Hand in Bounderby 's mill , o ' a ' the men theer , as do n't coom in wi ' th ' proposed reg ` lations .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 8]: I canna coom in wi ' 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 12]: My friends , I doubt their doin ' yo onny good .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 8]: Licker they 'll do yo hurt . '
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 11]: Slackbridge laughed , folded his arms , and frowned sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 14]: ` But ' t a n't sommuch for that as I stands out .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 15]: If that were aw , I 'd coom in wi ' th ' rest .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 31]: But I ha ' my reasons -- mine , yo see -- for being hindered ; not on ' y now , but awlus -- awlus -- life long ! '
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 12]: Slackbridge jumped up and stood beside him , gnashing and tearing .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 14]: ` Oh , my friends , what but this did I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 14]: Oh , my fellow-countrymen , what warning but this did I give you ?
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 20]: And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy ?
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 43]: Oh , you Englishmen , I ask you how does this subornation show in one of yourselves , who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours , and to your children 's and your children 's children 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 24]: There was some applause , and some crying of Shame upon the man ; but the greater part of the audience were quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 35]: They looked at Stephen 's worn face , rendered more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced ; and , in the kindness of their nature , they were more sorry than indignant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 31]: Tis this Delegate 's trade for t ' speak , ' said Stephen , ` an ' he 's paid for ` t , an ' he knows his work .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 20]: Let him keep to ` t. Let him give no heed to what I ha had 'n to bear .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 6]: That 's not for him .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 9]: That 's not for nobbody but me . '
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 24]: There was a propriety , not to say a dignity in these words , that made the hearers yet more quiet and attentive .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 22]: The same strong voice called out , ` Slackbridge , let the man be heern , and howd thee tongue ! '
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 7]: Then the place was wonderfully still .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 64]: ` My brothers , ' said Stephen , whose low voice was distinctly heard , ` and my fellow-workmen -- for that yo are to me , though not , as I knows on , to this delegate here -- I ha but a word to sen , and I could sen nommore if I was to speak till Strike o ' day .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 10]: I know weel , aw what 's afore me .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 25]: I know weel that yo aw resolve to ha nommore ado wi ' a man who is not wi ' yo in this matther .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 32]: I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i ' th ' road , yo 'd feel it right to pass me by , as a forrenner and stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 14]: What I ha getn , I mun mak th ' best on . '
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 18]: ` Stephen Blackpool , ' said the chairman , rising , ` think on ' t agen .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 20]: Think on ' t once agen , lad , afore thou ` rt shunned by aw owd friends . '
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 17]: There was an universal murmur to the same effect , though no man articulated a word .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 9]: Every eye was fixed on Stephen 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 17]: To repent of his determination , would be to take a load from all their minds .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 12]: He looked around him , and knew that it was so .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 33]: Not a grain of anger with them was in his heart ; he knew them , far below their surface weaknesses and misconceptions , as no one but their fellow-labourer could . '
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 13]: I ha thowt on ` t , above a bit , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 6]: I simply canna coom in .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 11]: I mun go th ' way as lays afore me .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 11]: I mun tak my leave o ' aw heer . '
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 33]: He made a sort of reverence to them by holding up his arms , and stood for the moment in that attitude ; not speaking until they slowly dropped at his sides .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 39]: ` Monny 's the pleasant word as soom heer has spok 'n wi ' me ; monny 's the face I see heer , as I first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart 'n than now .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 37]: I ha ' never had no fratch afore , sin ever I were born , wi ' any o ' my like ; Gonnows I ha ' none now that 's o ' my makin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 33]: Yo 'll ca ' me traitor and that -- yo I mean t ' say , ' addressing Slackbridge , ` but 't is easier to ca ' than mak ' out .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 5]: So let be . '
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 28]: He had moved away a pace or two to come down from the platform , when he remembered something he had not said , and returned again .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 63]: ` Haply , ' he said , turning his furrowed face slowly about , that he might as it were individually address the whole audience , those both near and distant ; ` haply , when this question has been tak 'n up and discoosed , there 'll be a threat to turn out if I 'm let to work among yo .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 43]: I hope I shall die ere ever such a time cooms , and I shall work solitary among yo unless it cooms -- truly , I mun do ` t , my friends ; not to brave yo , but to live .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 30]: I ha nobbut work to live by ; and wheerever can I go , I who ha worked sin I were no heighth at aw , in Coketown heer ?
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 34]: I mak ' no complaints o ' bein turned to the wa ' , o ' bein outcasten and overlooken fro this time forrard , but hope I shall be let to work .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 20]: If there is any right for me at aw , my friends , I think 't is that . '
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 6]: Not a word was spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 50]: Not a sound was audible in the building , but the slight rustle of men moving a little apart , all along the centre of the room , to open a means of passing out , to the man with whom they had all bound themselves to renounce companionship .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 37]: Looking at no one , and going his way with a lowly steadiness upon him that asserted nothing and sought nothing , Old Stephen , with all his troubles on his head , left the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 43]: Then Slackbridge , who had kept his oratorical arm extended during the going out , as if he were repressing with infinite solicitude and by a wonderful moral power the vehement passions of the multitude , applied himself to raising their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 46]: Had not the Roman Brutus , oh , my British countrymen , condemned his son to death ; and had not the Spartan mothers , oh my soon to be victorious friends , driven their flying children on the points of their enemies ' swords ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 52]: Then was it not the sacred duty of the men of Coketown , with forefathers before them , an admiring world in company with them , and a posterity to come after them , to hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a God-like cause ?
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 20]: The winds of heaven answered Yes ; and bore Yes , east , west , north , and south .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 10]: And consequently three cheers for the United Aggregate Tribunal !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 10]: Slackbridge acted as fugleman , and gave the time .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 20]: The multitude of doubtful faces -LRB- a little conscience-stricken -RRB- brightened at the sound , and took it up .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 9]: Private feeling must yield to the common cause .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 13]: The roof yet vibrated with the cheering , when the assembly dispersed .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 21]: Thus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the loneliest of lives , the life of solitude among a familiar crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 43]: The stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it , is in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten averted faces daily , that were once the countenances of friends .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 40]: Such experience was to be Stephen 's now , in every waking moment of his life ; at his work , on his way to it and from it , at his door , at his window , everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 32]: By general consent , they even avoided that side of the street on which he habitually walked ; and left it , of all the working men , to him only .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 28]: He had been for many years , a quiet silent man , associating but little with other men , and used to companionship with his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 46]: He had never known before the strength of the want in his heart for the frequent recognition of a nod , a look , a word ; or the immense amount of relief that had been poured into it by drops through such small means .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 32]: It was even harder than he could have believed possible , to separate in his own conscience his abandonment by all his fellows from a baseless sense of shame and disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 26]: The first four days of his endurance were days so long and heavy , that he began to be appalled by the prospect before him .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 84]: Not only did he see no Rachael all the time , but he avoided every chance of seeing her ; for , although he knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the women working in the factories , he found that some of them with whom he was acquainted were changed to him , and he feared to try others , and dreaded that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if she were seen in his company .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 44]: So , he had been quite alone during the four days , and had spoken to no one , when , as he was leaving his work at night , a young man of a very light complexion accosted him in the street .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 11]: ` Your name 's Blackpool , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 5]: said the young man .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 30]: Stephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his hand , in his gratitude for being spoken to , or in the suddenness of it , or both .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 16]: He made a feint of adjusting the lining , and said , ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 15]: ` You are the Hand they have sent to Coventry , I mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 11]: said Bitzer , the very light young man in question .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 9]: Stephen answered ` Yes , ' again . '
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: I supposed so , from their all appearing to keep away from you .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 8]: Mr. Bounderby wants to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 10]: You know his house , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 8]: Stephen said ` Yes , ' again .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 11]: ` Then go straight up there , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 3]: said Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 16]: ` You 're expected , and have only to tell the servant it 's you .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 32]: I belong to the Bank ; so , if you go straight up without me -LRB- I was sent to fetch you -RRB- , you 'll save me a walk . '
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 32]: Stephen , whose way had been in the contrary direction , turned about , and betook himself as in duty bound , to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 27]: Chapter V -- Men and Masters ` WELL , Stephen , ' said Bounderby , in his windy manner , ` what 's this I hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 12]: What have these pests of the earth been doing to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 8]: Come in , and speak up . '
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 11]: It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 27]: A tea-table was set out ; and Mr. Bounderby 's young wife , and her brother , and a great gentleman from London , were present .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 22]: To whom Stephen made his obeisance , closing the door and standing near it , with his hat in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 18]: ` This is the man I was telling you about , Harthouse , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 29]: The gentleman he addressed , who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa , got up , saying in an indolent way , ` Oh really ? '
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 10]: and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 12]: ` Now , ' said Bounderby , ` speak up ! '
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: After the four days he had passed , this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 26]: Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind , it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested deserter he had been called .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 23]: ` What were it , sir , ' said Stephen , ` as yo were pleased to want wi ' me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 12]: ` Why , I have told you , ' returned Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 23]: ` Speak up like a man , since you are a man , and tell us about yourself and this Combination . '
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 24]: ` Wi ' yor pardon , sir , ' said Stephen Blackpool , ' I ha ' nowt to sen about it . '
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 27]: Mr. Bounderby , who was always more or less like a Wind , finding something in his way here , began to blow at it directly .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 20]: ` Now , look here , Harthouse , ' said he , ` here 's a specimen of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 46]: When this man was here once before , I warned this man against the mischievous strangers who are always about -- and who ought to be hanged wherever they are found -- and I told this man that he was going in the wrong direction .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 39]: Now , would you believe it , that although they have put this mark upon him , he is such a slave to them still , that he 's afraid to open his lips about them ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 25]: I sed as I had nowt to sen , sir ; not as I was fearfo ' o ' openin ' my lips . '
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 4]: ` You said !
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 19]: I know what you said ; more than that , I know what you mean , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 11]: Not always the same thing , by the Lord Harry !
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 4]: Quite different things .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 46]: You had better tell us at once , that that fellow Slackbridge is not in the town , stirring up the people to mutiny ; and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people : that is , a most confounded scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 15]: You had better tell us so at once ; you ca n't deceive me .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 7]: You want to tell us so .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 6]: Why do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 26]: ` I 'm as sooary as yo , sir , when the people 's leaders is bad , ' said Stephen , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: ` They taks such as offers .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 19]: Haply 't is na ' the sma'est o ' their misfortuns when they can get no better . '
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 7]: The wind began to get boisterous .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 17]: ` Now , you 'll think this pretty well , Harthouse , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 8]: ` You 'll think this tolerably strong .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 28]: You 'll say , upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with ; but this is nothing , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 10]: You shall hear me ask this man a question .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 34]: Pray , Mr. Blackpool ' -- wind springing up very fast -- ` may I take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you refused to be in this Combination ? '
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 7]: ` How ' t happens ? '
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 35]: said Mr. Bounderby , with his thumbs in the arms of his coat , and jerking his head and shutting his eyes in confidence with the opposite wall : ` how it happens . '
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 35]: ` I 'd leefer not coom to ` t , sir ; but sin you put th ' question -- an ' not want 'n t ' be ill-manner 'n -- I 'll answer .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 7]: I ha passed a promess . '
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 12]: ` Not to me , you know , ' said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 7]: -LRB- Gusty weather with deceitful calms .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 6]: One now prevailing . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 5]: O no , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 5]: Not to yo . '
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 31]: ` As for me , any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it , ' said Bounderby , still in confidence with the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 24]: ` If only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown had been in question , you would have joined and made no bones about it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 6]: ` Why yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 5]: 'T is true . '
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 32]: ` Though he knows , ' said Mr. Bounderby , now blowing a gale , ` that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for !
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 16]: Now , Mr. Harthouse , you have been knocking about in the world some time .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 16]: Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country ? '
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 14]: And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for inspection , with an angry finger .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 33]: ` Nay , ma'am , ' said Stephen Blackpool , staunchly protesting against the words that had been used , and instinctively addressing himself to Louisa , after glancing at her face .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 8]: ` Not rebels , nor yet rascals .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 16]: Nowt o ' th ' kind , ma'am , nowt o ' th ' kind .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 16]: They 've not doon me a kindness , ma'am , as I know and feel .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 15]: But there 's not a dozen men amoong 'em , ma'am -- a dozen ?
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 19]: Not six -- but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by himseln .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 80]: God forbid as I , that ha ' known , and had 'n experience o ' these men aw my life -- I , that ha ' ett 'n an ' droonken wi ' 'em , an ' seet 'n wi ' 'em , and toil 'n wi ' 'em , and lov 'n 'em , should fail fur to stan by 'em wi ' the truth , let 'em ha ' doon to me what they may ! '
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 46]: He spoke with the rugged earnestness of his place and character -- deepened perhaps by a proud consciousness that he was faithful to his class under all their mistrust ; but he fully remembered where he was , and did not even raise his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 7]: ` No , ma'am , no .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 25]: They 're true to one another , faithfo ' to one another , ` fectionate to one another , e ` en to death .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 56]: Be poor amoong 'em , be sick amoong 'em , grieve amoong 'em for onny o ' th ' monny causes that carries grief to the poor man 's door , an ' they 'll be tender wi ' yo , gentle wi ' yo , comfortable wi ' yo , Chrisen wi ' yo .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 8]: Be sure o ' that , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 15]: They 'd be riven to bits , ere ever they 'd be different . '
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 26]: ` In short , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` it 's because they are so full of virtues that they have turned you adrift .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 10]: Go through with it while you are about it .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 5]: Out with it . '
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 50]: ` How 't is , ma'am , ' resumed Stephen , appearing still to find his natural refuge in Louisa 's face , ` that what is best in us fok , seems to turn us most to trouble an ' misfort 'n an ' mistake , I dunno .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 5]: But 't is so .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 17]: I know 't is , as I know the heavens is over me ahint the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 14]: We 're patient too , an ' wants in general to do right .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 14]: An ' I canna think the fawt is aw wi ' us . '
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 63]: ` Now , my friend , ' said Mr. Bounderby , whom he could not have exasperated more , quite unconscious of it though he was , than by seeming to appeal to any one else , ` if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute , I should like to have a word or two with you .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 16]: You said just now , that you had nothing to tell us about this business .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 13]: You are quite sure of that before we go any further . '
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 39]: ` Sir , I am sure on ` t. ' ` Here 's a gentleman from London present , ' Mr. Bounderby made a backhanded point at Mr. James Harthouse with his thumb , ' a Parliament gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 47]: I should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me , instead of taking the substance of it -- for I know precious well , beforehand , what it will be ; nobody knows better than I do , take notice !
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 12]: -- instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth . '
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 20]: Stephen bent his head to the gentleman from London , and showed a rather more troubled mind than usual .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 31]: He turned his eyes involuntarily to his former refuge , but at a look from that quarter -LRB- expressive though instantaneous -RRB- he settled them on Mr. Bounderby 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 10]: ` Now , what do you complain of ? '
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 5]: asked Mr. Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 18]: I ha ' not coom here , sir , ' Stephen reminded him , ` to complain .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 10]: I coom for that I were sent for . '
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 26]: ` What , ' repeated Mr. Bounderby , folding his arms , ` do you people , in a general way , complain of ? '
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 21]: Stephen looked at him with some little irresolution for a moment , and then seemed to make up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 35]: ` Sir , I were never good at showin o ` t , though I ha had 'n my share in feeling o ` t. ` Deed we are in a muddle , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 59]: Look round town -- so rich as 't is -- and see the numbers o ' people as has been broughten into bein heer , fur to weave , an ' to card , an ' to piece out a livin ' , aw the same one way , somehows , ` twixt their cradles and their graves .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 59]: Look how we live , an ' wheer we live , an ' in what numbers , an ' by what chances , and wi ' what sameness ; and look how the mills is awlus a goin , and how they never works us no nigher to ony dis ` ant object -- ceptin awlus , Death .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 61]: Look how you considers of us , and writes of us , and talks of us , and goes up wi ' yor deputations to Secretaries o ' State ` bout us , and how yo are awlus right , and how we are awlus wrong , and never had 'n no reason in us sin ever we were born .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 36]: Look how this ha growen an ' growen , sir , bigger an ' bigger , broader an ' broader , harder an ' harder , fro year to year , fro generation unto generation .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 21]: Who can look on ` t , sir , and fairly tell a man 't is not a muddle ? '
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 9]: ` Of course , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 31]: ` Now perhaps you 'll let the gentleman know , how you would set this muddle -LRB- as you 're so fond of calling it -RRB- to rights . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 5]: I donno , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 21]: I canna be expecten to ` t. 'T is not me as should be looken to for that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 17]: 'T is them as is put ower me , and ower aw the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 17]: What do they tak upon themseln , sir , if not to do ` t ? '
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 18]: ` I 'll tell you something towards it , at any rate , ' returned Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 12]: ` We will make an example of half a dozen Slackbridges .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 18]: We 'll indict the blackguards for felony , and get 'em shipped off to penal settlements . '
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 6]: Stephen gravely shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 33]: ` Do n't tell me we wo n't , man , ' said Mr. Bounderby , by this time blowing a hurricane , ` because we will , I tell you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 80]: ` Sir , ' returned Stephen , with the quiet confidence of absolute certainty , ` if yo was t ' tak a hundred Slackbridges -- aw as there is , and aw the number ten times towd -- an ' was t ' sew 'em up in separate sacks , an ' sink 'em in the deepest ocean as were made ere ever dry land coom to be , yo 'd leave the muddle just wheer 't is .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 4]: Mischeevous strangers ! '
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 34]: said Stephen , with an anxious smile ; ` when ha we not heern , I am sure , sin ever we can call to mind , o ' th ' mischeevous strangers !
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 12]: 'T is not by them the trouble 's made , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 10]: 'T is not wi ' them ' t commences .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 41]: I ha no favour for 'em -- I ha no reason to favour 'em -- but 't is hopeless and useless to dream o ' takin them fro their trade , ` stead o ' takin their trade fro them !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 25]: Aw that 's now about me in this room were heer afore I coom , an ' will be heer when I am gone .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 26]: Put that clock aboard a ship an ' pack it off to Norfolk Island , an ' the time will go on just the same .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 10]: So 't is wi ' Slackbridge every bit . '
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 21]: Reverting for a moment to his former refuge , he observed a cautionary movement of her eyes towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 11]: Stepping back , he put his hand upon the lock .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 41]: But he had not spoken out of his own will and desire ; and he felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious treatment to be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 10]: He stayed to finish what was in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 54]: ` Sir , I canna , wi ' my little learning an ' my common way , tell the genelman what will better aw this -- though some working men o ' this town could , above my powers -- but I can tell him what I know will never do ` t .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 118]: The strong hand will never do ` t. Vict ` ry and triumph will never do ` t. Agreeing fur to mak one side unnat ` rally awlus and for ever right , and toother side unnat ` rally awlus and for ever wrong , will never , never do ` t. Nor yet lettin alone will never do ` t. Let thousands upon thousands alone , aw leading the like lives and aw faw ` en into the like muddle , and they will be as one , and yo will be as anoother , wi ' a black unpassable world betwixt yo , just as long or short a time as sich-like misery can last .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 77]: Not drawin nigh to fok , wi ' kindness and patience an ' cheery ways , that so draws nigh to one another in their monny troubles , and so cherishes one another in their distresses wi ' what they need themseln -- like , I humbly believe , as no people the genelman ha seen in aw his travels can beat -- will never do ' t till th ' Sun turns t ' ice .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 109]: Most o ' aw , rating 'em as so much Power , and reg ` latin 'em as if they was figures in a soom , or machines : wi'out loves and likens , wi'out memories and inclinations , wi'out souls to weary and souls to hope -- when aw goes quiet , draggin on wi ' 'em as if they 'd nowt o ' th ' kind , and when aw goes onquiet , reproachin 'em for their want o ' sitch humanly feelins in their dealins wi ' yo -- this will never do ` t , sir , till God 's work is onmade . '
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 21]: Stephen stood with the open door in his hand , waiting to know if anything more were expected of him .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 18]: ` Just stop a moment , ' said Mr. Bounderby , excessively red in the face . '
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 26]: I told you , the last time you were here with a grievance , that you had better turn about and come out of that .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 22]: And I also told you , if you remember , that I was up to the gold spoon look-out . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 17]: I were not up to ' t myseln , sir ; I do assure yo . '
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 28]: ` Now it 's clear to me , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 11]: And you go about , sowing it and raising crops .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 12]: That 's the business of your life , my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 19]: Stephen shook his head , mutely protesting that indeed he had other business to do for his life .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 42]: ` You are such a waspish , raspish , ill-conditioned chap , you see , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` that even your own Union , the men who know you best , will have nothing to do with you .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 17]: I never thought those fellows could be right in anything ; but I tell you what !
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 23]: I so far go along with them for a novelty , that I 'll have nothing to do with you either . '
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 9]: Stephen raised his eyes quickly to his face .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 27]: ` You can finish off what you 're at , ' said Mr. Bounderby , with a meaning nod , ` and then go elsewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 30]: ` Sir , yo know weel , ' said Stephen expressively , ` that if I canna get work wi ' yo , I canna get it elsewheer . '
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 20]: The reply was , ` What I know , I know ; and what you know , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 10]: I have no more to say about it . '
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 40]: Stephen glanced at Louisa again , but her eyes were raised to his no more ; therefore , with a sigh , and saying , barely above his breath , ` Heaven help us aw in this world ! '
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 3]: he departed .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 19]: Chapter VI -- Fading Away IT was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 29]: The shadows of night had gathered so fast , that he did not look about him when he closed the door , but plodded straight along the street .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 44]: Nothing was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had encountered on his previous visit to the same house , when he heard a step behind him that he knew , and turning , saw her in Rachael 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 12]: He saw Rachael first , as he had heard her only .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 8]: ` Ah , Rachael , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 8]: Missus , thou wi ' her ! '
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 25]: ` Well , and now you are surprised to be sure , and with reason I must say , ' the old woman returned .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 10]: ` Here I am again , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 8]: ` But how wi ' Rachael ? '
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 21]: said Stephen , falling into their step , walking between them , and looking from the one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 35]: ` Why , I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with you , ' said the old woman , cheerfully , taking the reply upon herself .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 35]: ` My visiting time is later this year than usual , for I have been rather troubled with shortness of breath , and so put it off till the weather was fine and warm .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 55]: For the same reason I do n't make all my journey in one day , but divide it into two days , and get a bed to-night at the Travellers ' Coffee House down by the railroad -LRB- a nice clean house -RRB- , and go back Parliamentary , at six in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 16]: Well , but what has this to do with this good lass , says you ?
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 7]: I 'm going to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 9]: I have heard of Mr. Bounderby being married .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 19]: I read it in the paper , where it looked grand -- oh , it looked fine ! '
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 19]: the old woman dwelt on it with strange enthusiasm : ` and I want to see his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 7]: I have never seen her yet .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 20]: Now , if you 'll believe me , she has n't come out of that house since noon to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 50]: So not to give her up too easily , I was waiting about , a little last bit more , when I passed close to this good lass two or three times ; and her face being so friendly I spoke to her , and she spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 3]: There ! '
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 31]: said the old woman to Stephen , ` you can make all the rest out for yourself now , a deal shorter than I can , I dare say ! '
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 31]: Once again , Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman , though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 30]: With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael , he pursued the subject that interested her in her old age .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 23]: ` Well , missus , ' said he , ' I ha seen the lady , and she were young and hansom .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 24]: Wi ' fine dark thinkin eyes , and a still way , Rachael , as I ha never seen the like on . '
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 5]: ` Young and handsome .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 3]: Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 8]: cried the old woman , quite delighted .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 7]: ` As bonny as a rose !
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 7]: And what a happy wife ! '
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 14]: ` Aye , missus , I suppose she be , ' said Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 8]: But with a doubtful glance at Rachael .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 5]: ` Suppose she be ?
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 4]: She must be .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 13]: She 's your master 's wife , ' returned the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 4]: Stephen nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 21]: ` Though as to master , ' said he , glancing again at Rachael , ` not master onny more .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 11]: That 's aw enden ` twixt him and me . '
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 10]: ` Have you left his work , Stephen ? '
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 7]: asked Rachael , anxiously and quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 34]: ` Why , Rachael , ' he replied , ` whether I ha lef 'n his work , or whether his work ha lef 'n me , cooms t ' th ' same .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 7]: His work and me are parted .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 19]: 'T is as weel so -- better , I were thinkin when yo coom up wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 14]: It would ha brought 'n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 25]: Haply 't is a kindness to monny that I go ; haply 't is a kindness to myseln ; anyways it mun be done .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 26]: I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th ' time , and seek a fort ` n , dear , by beginnin fresh . '
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 10]: ` Where will you go , Stephen ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 27]: I donno t ` night , ' said he , lifting off his hat , and smoothing his thin hair with the flat of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 18]: ` But I 'm not goin t ` night , Rachael , nor yet t ` morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 23]: ` Ta n't easy overmuch t ' know wheer t ' turn , but a good heart will coom to me . '
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 13]: Herein , too , the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 48]: Before he had so much as closed Mr. Bounderby 's door , he had reflected that at least his being obliged to go away was good for her , as it would save her from the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from him .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 56]: Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her , and though he could think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not pursue him , perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the endurance of the last four days , even to unknown difficulties and distresses .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 27]: So he said , with truth , ` I 'm more leetsome , Rachael , under ` t , than I could 'n ha believed . '
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 11]: It was not her part to make his burden heavier .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 14]: She answered with her comforting smile , and the three walked on together .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 19]: Age , especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful , finds much consideration among the poor .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 39]: The old woman was so decent and contented , and made so light of her infirmities , though they had increased upon her since her former interview with Stephen , that they both took an interest in her .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 57]: She was too sprightly to allow of their walking at a slow pace on her account , but she was very grateful to be talked to , and very willing to talk to any extent : so , when they came to their part of the town , she was more brisk and vivacious than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 22]: ` Come to my poor place , missus , ' said Stephen , ` and tak a coop o ' tea .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 20]: Rachael will coom then ; and arterwards I 'll see thee safe t ' thy Travellers ' lodgin . '
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 21]: T may be long , Rachael , ere ever I ha th ' chance o ' thy coompany agen . '
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 15]: They complied , and the three went on to the house where he lodged .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 40]: When they turned into a narrow street , Stephen glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his desolate home ; but it was open , as he had left it , and no one was there .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 24]: The evil spirit of his life had flitted away again , months ago , and he had heard no more of her since .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 25]: The only evidence of her last return now , were the scantier moveables in his room , and the grayer hair upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 38]: He lighted a candle , set out his little tea-board , got hot water from below , and brought in small portions of tea and sugar , a loaf , and some butter from the nearest shop .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 39]: The bread was new and crusty , the butter fresh , and the sugar lump , of course -- in fulfilment of the standard testimony of the Coketown magnates , that these people lived like princes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 24]: Rachael made the tea -LRB- so large a party necessitated the borrowing of a cup -RRB- , and the visitor enjoyed it mightily .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 15]: It was the first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many days .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 40]: He too , with the world a wide heath before him , enjoyed the meal -- again in corroboration of the magnates , as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of these people , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 20]: I ha never thowt yet , missus , ' said Stephen , ` o ' askin thy name . '
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 12]: The old lady announced herself as ` Mrs. Pegler . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 7]: A widder , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 3]: said Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 8]: ` Oh , many long years ! '
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 28]: Mrs. Pegler 's husband -LRB- one of the best on record -RRB- was already dead , by Mrs. Pegler 's calculation , when Stephen was born . ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 18]: Twere a bad job , too , to lose so good a one , ' said Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 5]: ` Onny children ? '
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 21]: Mrs. Pegler 's cup , rattling against her saucer as she held it , denoted some nervousness on her part .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 7]: ` No , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 8]: ` Not now , not now . '
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 10]: ` Dead , Stephen , ' Rachael softly hinted .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 33]: ` I 'm sooary I ha spok 'n on ` t , ' said Stephen , ' I ought t ' hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 7]: I -- I blame myseln . '
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 16]: While he excused himself , the old lady 's cup rattled more and more . '
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 32]: I had a son , ' she said , curiously distressed , and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow ; ` and he did well , wonderfully well .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 12]: But he is not to be spoken of if you please .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 28]: He is -- ' Putting down her cup , she moved her hands as if she would have added , by her action , ` dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 12]: Then she said aloud , ' I have lost him . '
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 38]: Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain , when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs , and calling him to the door , whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 18]: Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf , for she caught a word as it was uttered .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 4]: ` Bounderby ! '
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 14]: she cried , in a suppressed voice , starting up from the table .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 5]: ` Oh hide me !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 10]: Do n't let me be seen for the world .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 12]: Do n't let him come up till I 've got away .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 5]: Pray , pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 29]: She trembled , and was excessively agitated ; getting behind Rachael , when Rachael tried to reassure her ; and not seeming to know what she was about .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 14]: ` But hearken , missus , hearken , ' said Stephen , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 11]: `` Tis n't Mr. Bounderby ; 't is his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 10]: Yo ' r not fearfo ' o ' her .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 12]: Yo was hey-go-mad about her , but an hour sin . '
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 16]: ` But are you sure it 's the lady , and not the gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 6]: she asked , still trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 5]: ` Certain sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 25]: ` Well then , pray do n't speak to me , nor yet take any notice of me , ' said the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 12]: ` Let me be quite to myself in this corner . '
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 39]: Stephen nodded ; looking to Rachael for an explanation , which she was quite unable to give him ; took the candle , went downstairs , and in a few moments returned , lighting Louisa into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 7]: She was followed by the whelp .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 33]: Rachael had risen , and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand , when Stephen , himself profoundly astonished by this visit , put the candle on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 20]: Then he too stood , with his doubled hand upon the table near it , waiting to be addressed .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 41]: For the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings of the Coketown Hands ; for the first time in her life she was face to face with anything like individuality in connection with them .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 11]: She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 20]: She knew what results in work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 17]: She knew them in crowds passing to and from their nests , like ants or beetles .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 22]: But she knew from her reading infinitely more of the ways of toiling insects than of these toiling men and women .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 126]: Something to be worked so much and paid so much , and there ended ; something to be infallibly settled by laws of supply and demand ; something that blundered against those laws , and floundered into difficulty ; something that was a little pinched when wheat was dear , and over-ate itself when wheat was cheap ; something that increased at such a rate of percentage , and yielded such another percentage of crime , and such another percentage of pauperism ; something wholesale , of which vast fortunes were made ; something that occasionally rose like a sea , and did some harm and waste -LRB- chiefly to itself -RRB- , and fell again ; this she knew the Coketown Hands to be .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 24]: But , she had scarcely thought more of separating them into units , than of separating the sea itself into its component drops .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 10]: She stood for some moments looking round the room .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 29]: From the few chairs , the few books , the common prints , and the bed , she glanced to the two women , and to Stephen . '
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 16]: I have come to speak to you , in consequence of what passed just now .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 15]: I should like to be serviceable to you , if you will let me .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 6]: Is this your wife ? '
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 16]: Rachael raised her eyes , and they sufficiently answered no , and dropped again . '
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 39]: I remember , ' said Louisa , reddening at her mistake ; ' I recollect , now , to have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of , though I was not attending to the particulars at the time .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 18]: It was not my meaning to ask a question that would give pain to any one here .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 37]: If I should ask any other question that may happen to have that result , give me credit , if you please , for being in ignorance how to speak to you as I ought . '
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 23]: As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to her , so she now instinctively addressed herself to Rachael .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 12]: Her manner was short and abrupt , yet faltering and timid .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 14]: ` He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband ?
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 12]: You would be his first resource , I think . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 15]: I have heard the end of it , young lady , ' said Rachael .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 21]: ` Did I understand , that , being rejected by one employer , he would probably be rejected by all ?
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 8]: I thought he said as much ? '
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 26]: ` The chances are very small , young lady -- next to nothing -- for a man who gets a bad name among them . '
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 14]: ` What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 8]: ` The name of being troublesome . '
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 24]: ` Then , by the prejudices of his own class , and by the prejudices of the other , he is sacrificed alike ?
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 24]: Are the two so deeply separated in this town , that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them ? '
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 7]: Rachael shook her head in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 29]: ` He fell into suspicion , ' said Louisa , ` with his fellow-weavers , because -- he had made a promise not to be one of them .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 14]: I think it must have been to you that he made that promise .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 10]: Might I ask you why he made it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 6]: Rachael burst into tears . '
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 11]: I did n't seek it of him , poor lad .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 21]: I prayed him to avoid trouble for his own good , little thinking he 'd come to it through me .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 18]: But I know he 'd die a hundred deaths , ere ever he 'd break his word .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 8]: I know that of him well . '
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 19]: Stephen had remained quietly attentive , in his usual thoughtful attitude , with his hand at his chin .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 12]: He now spoke in a voice rather less steady than usual .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 33]: ` No one , excepting myseln , can ever know what honour , an ' what love , an ' respect , I bear to Rachael , or wi ' what cause .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 21]: When I passed that promess , I towd her true , she were th ' Angel o ' my life .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 6]: ` Twere a solemn promess .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 11]: 'T is gone fro ' me , for ever . '
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 19]: Louisa turned her head to him , and bent it with a deference that was new in her .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 12]: She looked from him to Rachael , and her features softened .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 7]: ` What will you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 4]: she asked him .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: And her voice had softened too .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 36]: ` Weel , ma'am , ' said Stephen , making the best of it , with a smile ; ` when I ha finished off , I mun quit this part , and try another .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 27]: Fortnet or misfortnet , a man can but try ; there 's nowt to be done wi'out tryin ' -- cept laying down and dying . '
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 7]: ` How will you travel ? '
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: ` Afoot , my kind ledy , afoot . '
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 11]: Louisa coloured , and a purse appeared in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 19]: The rustling of a bank-note was audible , as she unfolded one and laid it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 29]: ` Rachael , will you tell him -- for you know how , without offence -- that this is freely his , to help him on his way ?
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 10]: Will you entreat him to take it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 17]: I canna do that , young lady , ' she answered , turning her head aside .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 15]: ` Bless you for thinking o ' the poor lad wi ' such tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 19]: But 't is for him to know his heart , and what is right according to it . '
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 55]: Louisa looked , in part incredulous , in part frightened , in part overcome with quick sympathy , when this man of so much self-command , who had been so plain and steady through the late interview , lost his composure in a moment , and now stood with his hand before his face .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 21]: She stretched out hers , as if she would have touched him ; then checked herself , and remained still .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 34]: ` Not e ` en Rachael , ' said Stephen , when he stood again with his face uncovered , ` could mak sitch a kind offerin , by onny words , kinder .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 20]: T ' show that I 'm not a man wi'out reason and gratitude , I 'll tak two pound .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 13]: I 'll borrow ' t for t ' pay ' t back .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 32]: ` Twill be the sweetest work as ever I ha done , that puts it in my power t ' acknowledge once more my lastin thankfulness for this present action . '
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 21]: She was fain to take up the note again , and to substitute the much smaller sum he had named .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 50]: He was neither courtly , nor handsome , nor picturesque , in any respect ; and yet his manner of accepting it , and of expressing his thanks without more words , had a grace in it that Lord Chesterfield could not have taught his son in a century .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 26]: Tom had sat upon the bed , swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick with sufficient unconcern , until the visit had attained this stage .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 20]: Seeing his sister ready to depart , he got up , rather hurriedly , and put in a word .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 8]: ` Just wait a moment , Loo !
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 14]: Before we go , I should like to speak to him a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 6]: Something comes into my head .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 16]: If you 'll step out on the stairs , Blackpool , I 'll mention it .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 8]: Never mind a light , man ! '
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 15]: Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard , to get one .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 9]: ` It do n't want a light . '
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 21]: Stephen followed him out , and Tom closed the room door , and held the lock in his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 4]: I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 4]: he whispered . '
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 10]: I think I can do you a good turn .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 16]: Do n't ask me what it is , because it may not come to anything .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 10]: But there 's no harm in my trying . '
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 18]: His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen 's ear , it was so hot .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 22]: ` That was our light porter at the Bank , ' said Tom , ` who brought you the message to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 16]: I call him our light porter , because I belong to the Bank too . '
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 12]: Stephen thought , ` What a hurry he is in ! '
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 5]: He spoke so confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 5]: ` Now look here !
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 6]: When are you off ? '
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 13]: ` T ' day 's Monday , ' replied Stephen , considering .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 14]: ` Why , sir , Friday or Saturday , nigh ` bout . '
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 9]: ` Friday or Saturday , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 5]: ` Now look here !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 52]: I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you -- that 's my sister , you know , in your room -- but I may be able to , and if I should not be able to , there 's no harm done .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 6]: So I tell you what .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 9]: You 'll know our light porter again ? '
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 9]: ` Yes , sure , ' said Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 8]: ` Very well , ' returned Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 29]: ` When you leave work of a night , between this and your going away , just hang about the Bank an hour or so , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 47]: Do n't take on , as if you meant anything , if he should see you hanging about there ; because I sha n't put him up to speak to you , unless I find I can do you the service I want to do you .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 18]: In that case he 'll have a note or a message for you , but not else .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 4]: Now look here !
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 7]: You are sure you understand . '
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 38]: He had wormed a finger , in the darkness , through a button-hole of Stephen 's coat , and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round , in an extraordinary manner . '
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 9]: I understand , sir , ' said Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 6]: ` Now look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 3]: repeated Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 16]: ` Be sure you do n't make any mistake then , and do n't forget .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 24]: I shall tell my sister as we go home , what I have in view , and she 'll approve , I know .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 4]: Now look here !
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: You 're all right , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 6]: You understand all about it ?
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 4]: Very well then .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 6]: Come along , Loo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 29]: He pushed the door open as he called to her , but did not return into the room , or wait to be lighted down the narrow stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 23]: He was at the bottom when she began to descend , and was in the street before she could take his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 26]: Mrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother and sister were gone , and until Stephen came back with the candle in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 32]: She was in a state of inexpressible admiration of Mrs. Bounderby , and , like an unaccountable old woman , wept , ` because she was such a pretty dear . '
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 32]: Yet Mrs. Pegler was so flurried lest the object of her admiration should return by chance , or anybody else should come , that her cheerfulness was ended for that night .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 44]: It was late too , to people who rose early and worked hard ; therefore the party broke up ; and Stephen and Rachael escorted their mysterious acquaintance to the door of the Travellers ' Coffee House , where they parted from her .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 29]: They walked back together to the corner of the street where Rachael lived , and as they drew nearer and nearer to it , silence crept upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 29]: When they came to the dark corner where their unfrequent meetings always ended , they stopped , still silent , as if both were afraid to speak . '
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 30]: I shall strive t ' see thee agen , Rachael , afore I go , but if not -- ' ` Thou wilt not , Stephen , I know .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 18]: 'T is better that we make up our minds to be open wi ' one another . '
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 7]: ` Thou ` rt awlus right .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 6]: 'T is bolder and better .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 39]: I ha been thinkin then , Rachael , that as 't is but a day or two that remains , ` twere better for thee , my dear , not t ' be seen wi ' me . '
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 13]: T might bring thee into trouble , fur no good . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 11]: Tis not for that , Stephen , that I mind .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 9]: But thou know ` st our old agreement .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 6]: 'T is for that . '
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: ` Well , well , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 7]: `` Tis better , onnyways . '
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 18]: ` Thou ` lt write to me , and tell me all that happens , Stephen ? '
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 25]: What can I say now , but Heaven be wi ' thee , Heaven bless thee , Heaven thank thee and reward thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 26]: ` May it bless thee , Stephen , too , in all thy wanderings , and send thee peace and rest at last ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 46]: I towd thee , my dear , ' said Stephen Blackpool -- ` that night -- that I would never see or think o ' onnything that angered me , but thou , so much better than me , should ` st be beside it .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 7]: Thou ` rt beside it now .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 13]: Thou mak ` st me see it wi ' a better eye .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 3]: Bless thee .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 3]: Good night .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 23]: It was but a hurried parting in a common street , yet it was a sacred remembrance to these two common people .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 35]: Utilitarian economists , skeletons of schoolmasters , Commissioners of Fact , genteel and used-up infidels , gabblers of many little dog 's - eared creeds , the poor you will have always with you .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 74]: Cultivate in them , while there is yet time , the utmost graces of the fancies and affections , to adorn their lives so much in need of ornament ; or , in the day of your triumph , when romance is utterly driven out of their souls , and they and a bare existence stand face to face , Reality will take a wolfish turn , and make an end of you .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 29]: Stephen worked the next day , and the next , uncheered by a word from any one , and shunned in all his comings and goings as before .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 24]: At the end of the second day , he saw land ; at the end of the third , his loom stood empty .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 30]: He had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank , on each of the two first evenings ; and nothing had happened there , good or bad .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 28]: That he might not be remiss in his part of the engagement , he resolved to wait full two hours , on this third and last night .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 68]: There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby 's house , sitting at the first-floor window as he had seen her before ; and there was the light porter , sometimes talking with her there , and sometimes looking over the blind below which had BANK upon it , and sometimes coming to the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 36]: When he first came out , Stephen thought he might be looking for him , and passed near ; but the light porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 17]: Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about , after a long day 's labour .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 37]: Stephen sat upon the step of a door , leaned against a wall under an archway , strolled up and down , listened for the church clock , stopped and watched children playing in the street .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 21]: Some purpose or other is so natural to every one , that a mere loiterer always looks and feels remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 26]: When the first hour was out , Stephen even began to have an uncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable character .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 30]: Then came the lamplighter , and two lengthening lines of light all down the long perspective of the street , until they were blended and lost in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 16]: Mrs. Sparsit closed the first-floor window , drew down the blind , and went up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 29]: Presently , a light went up-stairs after her , passing first the fanlight of the door , and afterwards the two staircase windows , on its way up .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 39]: By and by , one corner of the second-floor blind was disturbed , as if Mrs. Sparsit 's eye were there ; also the other corner , as if the light porter 's eye were on that side .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 9]: Still , no communication was made to Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 27]: Much relieved when the two hours were at last accomplished , he went away at a quick pace , as a recompense for so much loitering .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 38]: He had only to take leave of his landlady , and lie down on his temporary bed upon the floor ; for his bundle was made up for to-morrow , and all was arranged for his departure .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 19]: He meant to be clear of the town very early ; before the Hands were in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 29]: It was barely daybreak , when , with a parting look round his room , mournfully wondering whether he should ever see it again , he went out .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 21]: The town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it , rather than hold communication with him .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 7]: Everything looked wan at that hour .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 18]: Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky , like a sad sea .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 103]: By the place where Rachael lived , though it was not in his way ; by the red brick streets ; by the great silent factories , not trembling yet ; by the railway , where the danger-lights were waning in the strengthening day ; by the railway 's crazy neighbourhood , half pulled down and half built up ; by scattered red brick villas , where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled with a dirty powder , like untidy snuff-takers ; by coal-dust paths and many varieties of ugliness ; Stephen got to the top of the hill , and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 19]: Day was shining radiantly upon the town then , and the bells were going for the morning work .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 17]: Domestic fires were not yet lighted , and the high chimneys had the sky to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 48]: Puffing out their poisonous volumes , they would not be long in hiding it ; but , for half an hour , some of the many windows were golden , which showed the Coketown people a sun eternally in eclipse , through a medium of smoked glass .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 11]: So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 15]: So strange , to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 23]: So strange to have lived to his time of life , and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning !
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 24]: With these musings in his mind , and his bundle under his arm , Stephen took his attentive face along the high road .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 18]: And the trees arched over him , whispering that he left a true and loving heart behind .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 22]: Chapter VII -- Gunpowder Mr. James Harthouse , ` going in ' for his adopted party , soon began to score .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 55]: With the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages , a little more genteel listlessness for the general society , and a tolerable management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty , most effective and most patronized of the polite deadly sins , he speedily came to be considered of much promise .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 51]: The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand point in his favour , enabling him to take to the hard Fact fellows with as good a grace as if he had been born one of the tribe , and to throw all other tribes overboard , as conscious hypocrites .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 19]: ` Whom none of us believe , my dear Mrs. Bounderby , and who do not believe themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 47]: The only difference between us and the professors of virtue or benevolence , or philanthropy -- never mind the name -- is , that we know it is all meaningless , and say so ; while they know it equally and will never say so . '
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 11]: Why should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration ?
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 21]: It was not so unlike her father 's principles , and her early training , that it need startle her .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 29]: Where was the great difference between the two schools , when each chained her down to material realities , and inspired her with no faith in anything else ?
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 24]: What was there in her soul for James Harthouse to destroy , which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its state of innocence !
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 53]: It was even the worse for her at this pass , that in her mind -- implanted there before her eminently practical father began to form it -- a struggling disposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever heard of , constantly strove with doubts and resentments .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 15]: With doubts , because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 23]: With resentments , because of the wrong that had been done her , if it were indeed a whisper of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 23]: Upon a nature long accustomed to self-suppression , thus torn and divided , the Harthouse philosophy came as a relief and justification .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 14]: Everything being hollow and worthless , she had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 18]: What did it matter , she had said to her father , when he proposed her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 9]: What did it matter , she said still .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 18]: With a scornful self-reliance , she asked herself , What did anything matter -- and went on .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 3]: Towards what ?
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 24]: Step by step , onward and downward , towards some end , yet so gradually , that she believed herself to remain motionless .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 15]: As to Mr. Harthouse , whither he tended , he neither considered nor cared .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 17]: He had no particular design or plan before him : no energetic wickedness ruffled his lassitude .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 36]: He was as much amused and interested , at present , as it became so fine a gentleman to be ; perhaps even more than it would have been consistent with his reputation to confess .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 50]: Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother , the honourable and jocular member , that the Bounderbys were ` great fun ; ' and further , that the female Bounderby , instead of being the Gorgon he had expected , was young , and remarkably pretty .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 19]: After that , he wrote no more about them , and devoted his leisure chiefly to their house .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 26]: He was very often in their house , in his flittings and visitings about the Coketown district ; and was much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 44]: It was quite in Mr. Bounderby 's gusty way to boast to all his world that he did n't care about your highly connected people , but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind 's daughter did , she was welcome to their company .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 29]: Mr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation , if the face which changed so beautifully for the whelp , would change for him .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 25]: He was quick enough to observe ; he had a good memory , and did not forget a word of the brother 's revelations .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 18]: He interwove them with everything he saw of the sister , and he began to understand her .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 47]: To be sure , the better and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of perception ; for in natures , as in seas , depth answers unto depth ; but he soon began to read the rest with a student 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 60]: Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds , about fifteen miles from the town , and accessible within a mile or two , by a railway striding on many arches over a wild country , undermined by deserted coal-shafts , and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary engines at pits ' mouths .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 48]: This country , gradually softening towards the neighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby 's retreat , there mellowed into a rustic landscape , golden with heath , and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of the year , and tremulous with leaves and their shadows all the summer time .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 47]: The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated , by one of the Coketown magnates , who , in his determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune , overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 25]: These accidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of Coketown , but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the improvident classes .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 26]: It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this snug little estate , and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in the flower-garden .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 22]: He delighted to live , barrack-fashion , among the elegant furniture , and he bullied the very pictures with his origin .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 34]: ` Why , sir , ' he would say to a visitor , ' I am told that Nickits , ' the late owner , ` gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 43]: Now , to be plain with you , if I ever , in the whole course of my life , take seven looks at it , at a hundred pound a look , it will be as much as I shall do .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 5]: No , by George !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 12]: I do n't forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 78]: For years upon years , the only pictures in my possession , or that I could have got into my possession , by any means , unless I stole 'em , were the engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot , on the blacking bottles that I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with , and that I sold when they were empty for a farthing a-piece , and glad to get it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 11]: Then he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 12]: ` Harthouse , you have a couple of horses down here .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 17]: Bring half a dozen more if you like , and we 'll find room for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 23]: There 's stabling in this place for a dozen horses ; and unless Nickits is belied , he kept the full number .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 8]: A round dozen of 'em , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 13]: When that man was a boy , he went to Westminster School .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 24]: Went to Westminster School as a King 's Scholar , when I was principally living on garbage , and sleeping in market baskets .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 45]: Why , if I wanted to keep a dozen horses -- which I do n't , for one 's enough for me -- I could n't bear to see 'em in their stalls here , and think what my own lodging used to be .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 15]: I could n't look at 'em , sir , and not order 'em out .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 6]: Yet so things come round .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 61]: You see this place ; you know what sort of a place it is ; you are aware that there 's not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere -- I do n't care where -- and here , got into the middle of it , like a maggot into a nut , is Josiah Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 60]: While Nickits -LRB- as a man came into my office , and told me yesterday -RRB- , Nickits , who used to act in Latin , in the Westminster School plays , with the chief-justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face , is drivelling at this minute -- drivelling , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 16]: -- in a fifth floor , up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp . '
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 46]: It was among the leafy shadows of this retirement , in the long sultry summer days , that Mr. Harthouse began to prove the face which had set him wondering when he first saw it , and to try if it would change for him .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 18]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , I esteem it a most fortunate accident that I find you alone here .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 15]: I have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 33]: It was not by any wonderful accident that he found her , the time of day being that at which she was always alone , and the place being her favourite resort .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 38]: It was an opening in a dark wood , where some felled trees lay , and where she would sit watching the fallen leaves of last year , as she had watched the falling ashes at home .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 13]: He sat down beside her , with a glance at her face .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 4]: ` Your brother .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 22]: My young friend Tom -- ' Her colour brightened , and she turned to him with a look of interest . '
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 26]: I never in my life , ' he thought , ` saw anything so remarkable and so captivating as the lighting of those features ! '
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 24]: His face betrayed his thoughts -- perhaps without betraying him , for it might have been according to its instructions so to do .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 4]: ` Pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 33]: The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful -- Tom should be so proud of it -- I know this is inexcusable , but I am so compelled to admire . '
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 10]: ` Being so impulsive , ' she said composedly .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 15]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , no : you know I make no pretence with you .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 34]: You know I am a sordid piece of human nature , ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum , and altogether incapable of any Arcadian proceeding whatever . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 18]: I am waiting , ' she returned , ` for your further reference to my brother . '
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 12]: ` You are rigid with me , and I deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 21]: I am as worthless a dog as you will find , except that I am not false -- not false .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 15]: But you surprised and started me from my subject , which was your brother .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 8]: I have an interest in him . '
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 12]: ` Have you an interest in anything , Mr. Harthouse ? '
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 9]: she asked , half incredulously and half gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 18]: ` If you had asked me when I first came here , I should have said no .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 26]: I must say now -- even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence , and of justly awakening your incredulity -- yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 41]: She made a slight movement , as if she were trying to speak , but could not find voice ; at length she said , ` Mr. Harthouse , I give you credit for being interested in my brother . '
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 6]: I claim to deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 15]: You know how little I do claim , but I will go that length .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 42]: You have done so much for him , you are so fond of him ; your whole life , Mrs. Bounderby , expresses such charming self-forgetfulness on his account -- pardon me again -- I am running wide of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 11]: I am interested in him for his own sake . '
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 21]: She had made the slightest action possible , as if she would have risen in a hurry and gone away .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 17]: He had turned the course of what he said at that instant , and she remained .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 70]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , ' he resumed , in a lighter manner , and yet with a show of effort in assuming it , which was even more expressive than the manner he dismissed ; ` it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother 's years , if he is heedless , inconsiderate , and expensive -- a little dissipated , in the common phrase .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 4]: Is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 7]: ` Allow me to be frank .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 10]: Do you think he games at all ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 7]: I think he makes bets . '
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 23]: Mr. Harthouse waiting , as if that were not her whole answer , she added , ' I know he does . '
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 7]: ` Of course he loses ? '
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 7]: ` Everybody does lose who bets .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 18]: May I hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes ? '
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 21]: She sat , looking down ; but , at this question , raised her eyes searchingly and a little resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 12]: ` Acquit me of impertinent curiosity , my dear Mrs. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 29]: I think Tom may be gradually falling into trouble , and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 10]: -- Shall I say again , for his sake ?
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 5]: Is that necessary ? '
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 13]: She seemed to try to answer , but nothing came of it .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 45]: ` Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me , ' said James Harthouse , again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more airy manner ; ' I will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 28]: Whether -- forgive my plainness -- whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 24]: I do not , ' said Louisa , flushing with her own great remembrance in that wise , ` think it likely . '
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 30]: ` Or , between himself , and -- I may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning , I am sure -- and his highly esteemed brother-in-law . '
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 29]: She flushed deeper and deeper , and was burning red when she replied in a fainter voice , ' I do not think that likely , either . '
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 25]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , ' said Harthouse , after a short silence , ` may there be a better confidence between yourself and me ?
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 10]: Tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 66]: ` You will understand , Mr. Harthouse , ' she returned , after some indecision : she had been more or less uncertain , and troubled throughout the conversation , and yet had in the main preserved her self-contained manner ; ` you will understand that if I tell you what you press to know , it is not by way of complaint or regret .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 21]: I would never complain of anything , and what I have done I do not in the least regret . '
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 7]: ` So spirited , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 4]: thought James Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 19]: ` When I married , I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 7]: Heavily for him , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 10]: Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 5]: They were no sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 6]: I sold them very willingly .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 7]: I attached no value to them .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 9]: They , were quite worthless to me . '
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 32]: Either she saw in his face that he knew , or she only feared in her conscience that he knew , that she spoke of some of her husband 's gifts .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 7]: She stopped , and reddened again .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 27]: If he had not known it before , he would have known it then , though he had been a much duller man than he was .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 29]: ` Since then , I have given my brother , at various times , what money I could spare : in short , what money I have had .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 25]: Confiding in you at all , on the faith of the interest you profess for him , I will not do so by halves .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 24]: Since you have been in the habit of visiting here , he has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 11]: I have not been able to give it to him .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 30]: I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved , but I have kept these secrets until now , when I trust them to your honour .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 19]: I have held no confidence with any one , because -- you anticipated my reason just now . '
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 5]: She abruptly broke off .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 30]: He was a ready man , and he saw , and seized , an opportunity here of presenting her own image to her , slightly disguised as her brother .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 30]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , though a graceless person , of the world worldly , I feel the utmost interest , I assure you , in what you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 10]: I can not possibly be hard upon your brother .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 14]: I understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 27]: With all possible respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby , I think I perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 46]: Bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play , he rushes into these extremes for himself , from opposite extremes that have long been forced -- with the very best intentions we have no doubt -- upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 25]: Mr. Bounderby 's fine bluff English independence , though a most charming characteristic , does not -- as we have agreed -- invite confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 51]: If I might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken , a character misconceived , and abilities misdirected , would turn for relief and guidance , I should express what it presents to my own view . '
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 37]: As she sat looking straight before her , across the changing lights upon the grass into the darkness of the wood beyond , he saw in her face her application of his very distinctly uttered words .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 13]: ` All allowance , ' he continued , ` must be made .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 29]: I have one great fault to find with Tom , however , which I can not forgive , and for which I take him heavily to account . '
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 16]: Louisa turned her eyes to his face , and asked him what fault was that ?
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 13]: ` Perhaps , ' he returned , ' I have said enough .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 21]: Perhaps it would have been better , on the whole , if no allusion to it had escaped me . '
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 8]: ` You alarm me , Mr. Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 7]: Pray let me know it . '
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 36]: ` To relieve you from needless apprehension -- and as this confidence regarding your brother , which I prize I am sure above all possible things , has been established between us -- I obey .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 46]: I can not forgive him for not being more sensible in every word , look , and act of his life , of the affection of his best friend ; of the devotion of his best friend ; of her unselfishness ; of her sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 16]: The return he makes her , within my observation , is a very poor one .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 19]: What she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude , not his ill-humour and caprice .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 36]: Careless fellow as I am , I am not so indifferent , Mrs. Bounderby , as to be regardless of this vice in your brother , or inclined to consider it a venial offence . '
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 14]: The wood floated before her , for her eyes were suffused with tears .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 25]: They rose from a deep well , long concealed , and her heart was filled with acute pain that found no relief in them .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 22]: ` In a word , it is to correct your brother in this , Mrs. Bounderby , that I must aspire .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 53]: My better knowledge of his circumstances , and my direction and advice in extricating them -- rather valuable , I hope , as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale -- will give me some influence over him , and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 10]: I have said enough , and more than enough .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 45]: I seem to be protesting that I am a sort of good fellow , when , upon my honour , I have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect , and openly announce that I am nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 41]: Yonder , among the trees , ' he added , having lifted up his eyes and looked about ; for he had watched her closely until now ; ` is your brother himself ; no doubt , just come down .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 30]: As he seems to be loitering in this direction , it may be as well , perhaps , to walk towards him , and throw ourselves in his way .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 10]: He has been very silent and doleful of late .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 16]: Perhaps , his brotherly conscience is touched -- if there are such things as consciences .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 19]: Though , upon my honour , I hear of them much too often to believe in them . '
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 20]: He assisted her to rise , and she took his arm , and they advanced to meet the whelp .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 26]: He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along : or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 22]: He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime , and his colour changed .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 13]: he stammered ; ' I did n't know you were here . '
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 42]: ` Whose name , Tom , ' said Mr. Harthouse , putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him , so that they all three walked towards the house together , ` have you been carving on the trees ? '
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 5]: ` Whose name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 3]: returned Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 8]: You mean what girl 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 19]: ` You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature 's on the bark , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 28]: ` Not much of that , Mr. Harthouse , unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 18]: Or she might be as ugly as she was rich , without any fear of losing me .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 13]: I 'd carve her name as often as she liked . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 10]: I am afraid you are mercenary , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 7]: ` Mercenary , ' repeated Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 6]: ` Who is not mercenary ?
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 5]: Ask my sister . '
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 16]: ` Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: said Louisa , showing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 17]: ` You know whether the cap fits you , Loo , ' returned her brother sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 11]: ` If it does , you can wear it . '
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 20]: ` Tom is misanthropical to-day , as all bored people are now and then , ' said Mr. Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 9]: ` Do n't believe him , Mrs. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 5]: He knows much better .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 22]: I shall disclose some of his opinions of you , privately expressed to me , unless he relents a little . '
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 42]: ` At all events , Mr. Harthouse , ' said Tom , softening in his admiration of his patron , but shaking his head sullenly too , ` you ca n't tell her that I ever praised her for being mercenary .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 24]: I may have praised her for being the contrary , and I should do it again , if I had as good reason .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 24]: However , never mind this now ; it 's not very interesting to you , and I am sick of the subject . '
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 18]: They walked on to the house , where Louisa quitted her visitor 's arm and went in .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 46]: He stood looking after her , as she ascended the steps , and passed into the shadow of the door ; then put his hand upon her brother 's shoulder again , and invited him with a confidential nod to a walk in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 17]: ` Tom , my fine fellow , I want to have a word with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 71]: They had stopped among a disorder of roses -- it was part of Mr. Bounderby 's humility to keep Nickits 's roses on a reduced scale -- and Tom sat down on a terrace-parapet , plucking buds and picking them to pieces ; while his powerful Familiar stood over him , with a foot upon the parapet , and his figure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 8]: They were just visible from her window .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 5]: Perhaps she saw them .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 9]: ` Tom , what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 24]: Mr. Harthouse , ' said Tom with a groan , ' I am hard up , and bothered out of my life . '
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 13]: ` My good fellow , so am I. ' ` You ! '
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 3]: returned Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 8]: ` You are the picture of independence .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 10]: Mr. Harthouse , I am in a horrible mess .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 34]: You have no idea what a state I have got myself into -- what a state my sister might have got me out of , if she would only have done it . '
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 27]: He took to biting the rosebuds now , and tearing them away from his teeth with a hand that trembled like an infirm old man 's .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 16]: After one exceedingly observant look at him , his companion relapsed into his lightest air .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 15]: ` Tom , you are inconsiderate : you expect too much of your sister .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 16]: You have had money of her , you dog , you know you have . '
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 11]: ` Well , Mr. Harthouse , I know I have .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 8]: How else was I to get it ?
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 23]: Here 's old Bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month , or something of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 25]: Here 's my father drawing what he calls a line , and tying me down to it from a baby , neck and heels .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 16]: Here 's my mother who never has anything of her own , except her complaints .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 25]: What is a fellow to do for money , and where am I to look for it , if not to my sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 13]: He was almost crying , and scattered the buds about by dozens .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 9]: Mr. Harthouse took him persuasively by the coat .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 24]: ` But , my dear Tom , if your sister has not got it -- ' ` Not got it , Mr. Harthouse ?
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 9]: I do n't say she has got it .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 13]: I may have wanted more than she was likely to have got .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 8]: But then she ought to get it .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 5]: She could get it .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 45]: It 's of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now , after what I have told you already ; you know she did n't marry old Bounderby for her own sake , or for his sake , but for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 18]: Then why does n't she get what I want , out of him , for my sake ?
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 34]: She is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it ; she is sharp enough ; she could manage to coax it out of him , if she chose .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 17]: Then why does n't she choose , when I tell her of what consequence it is ?
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 3]: But no .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 20]: There she sits in his company like a stone , instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 18]: I do n't know what you may call this , but I call it unnatural conduct . '
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 49]: There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet , on the other side , into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior , as the injured men of Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 28]: But he preserved his easy attitude ; and nothing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about , a little surface-island .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 19]: ` My dear Tom , ' said Harthouse , ` let me try to be your banker . '
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 20]: ` For God 's sake , ' replied Tom , suddenly , ` do n't talk about bankers ! '
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 12]: And very white he looked , in contrast with the roses .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 3]: Very white .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 50]: Mr. Harthouse , as a thoroughly well-bred man , accustomed to the best society , was not to be surprised -- he could as soon have been affected -- but he raised his eyelids a little more , as if they were lifted by a feeble touch of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 25]: Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his school to wonder , as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind College .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 9]: ` What is the present need , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 3]: Three figures ?
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 4]: Out with them .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 6]: Say what they are . '
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 45]: ` Mr. Harthouse , ' returned Tom , now actually crying ; and his tears were better than his injuries , however pitiful a figure he made : ` it 's too late ; the money is of no use to me at present .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 13]: I should have had it before to be of use to me .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 16]: But I am very much obliged to you ; you 're a true friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 4]: A true friend !
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 6]: ` Whelp , whelp ! '
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 14]: thought Mr. Harthouse , lazily ; ` what an Ass you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 19]: ` And I take your offer as a great kindness , ' said Tom , grasping his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 10]: ` As a great kindness , Mr. Harthouse . '
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 19]: ` Well , ' returned the other , ` it may be of more use by and by .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 38]: And , my good fellow , if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you , I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 18]: ` Thank you , ' said Tom , shaking his head dismally , and chewing rosebuds . '
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 12]: I wish I had known you sooner , Mr. Harthouse . '
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 70]: ` Now , you see , Tom , ' said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion , himself tossing over a rose or two , as a contribution to the island , which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland : ` every man is selfish in everything he does , and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 50]: I am desperately intent ; ' the languor of his desperation being quite tropical ; ` on your softening towards your sister -- which you ought to do ; and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother -- which you ought to be . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 8]: I will be , Mr. Harthouse . '
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 9]: ` No time like the present , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 5]: Begin at once . '
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 5]: ` Certainly I will .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 9]: And my sister Loo shall say so . '
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 66]: ` Having made which bargain , Tom , ' said Harthouse , clapping him on the shoulder again , with an air which left him at liberty to infer -- as he did , poor fool -- that this condition was imposed upon him in mere careless good nature to lessen his sense of obligation , ` we will tear ourselves asunder until dinner-time . '
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 30]: When Tom appeared before dinner , though his mind seemed heavy enough , his body was on the alert ; and he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in . '
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 24]: I did n't mean to be cross , Loo , ' he said , giving her his hand , and kissing her . '
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 18]: I know you are fond of me , and you know I am fond of you . '
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 19]: After this , there was a smile upon Louisa 's face that day , for some one else .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 7]: Alas , for some one else !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 35]: ` So much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for , ' thought James Harthouse , reversing the reflection of his first day 's knowledge of her pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 12]: ` So much the less , so much the less . '
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 48]: Chapter VIII -- Explosion THE next morning was too bright a morning for sleep , and James Harthouse rose early , and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing-room , smoking the rare tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his young friend .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 46]: Reposing in the sunlight , with the fragrance of his eastern pipe about him , and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air , so rich and soft with summer odours , he reckoned up his advantages as an idle winner might count his gains .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 18]: He was not at all bored for the time , and could give his mind to it .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 15]: He had established a confidence with her , from which her husband was excluded .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 34]: He had established a confidence with her , that absolutely turned upon her indifference towards her husband , and the absence , now and at all times , of any congeniality between them .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 53]: He had artfully , but plainly , assured her that he knew her heart in its last most delicate recesses ; he had come so near to her through its tenderest sentiment ; he had associated himself with that feeling ; and the barrier behind which she lived , had melted away .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 8]: All very odd , and very satisfactory !
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 17]: And yet he had not , even now , any earnest wickedness of purpose in him .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 35]: Publicly and privately , it were much better for the age in which he lived , that he and the legion of whom he was one were designedly bad , than indifferent and purposeless .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 16]: It is the drifting icebergs setting with any current anywhere , that wreck the ships .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 26]: When the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion , he goeth about in a shape by which few but savages and hunters are attracted .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 69]: But , when he is trimmed , smoothed , and varnished , according to the mode ; when he is aweary of vice , and aweary of virtue , used up as to brimstone , and used up as to bliss ; then , whether he take to the serving out of red tape , or to the kindling of red fire , he is the very Devil .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 30]: So James Harthouse reclined in the window , indolently smoking , and reckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to be travelling .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 23]: The end to which it led was before him , pretty plainly ; but he troubled himself with no calculations about it .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 7]: What will be , will be .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 48]: As he had rather a long ride to take that day -- for there was a public occasion ` to do ' at some distance , which afforded a tolerable opportunity of going in for the Gradgrind men -- he dressed early and went down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 14]: He was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous evening .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 8]: He resumed where he had left off .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 10]: There was a look of interest for him again .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 35]: He got through the day as much -LRB- or as little -RRB- to his own satisfaction , as was to be expected under the fatiguing circumstances ; and came riding back at six o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 54]: There was a sweep of some half-mile between the lodge and the house , and he was riding along at a foot pace over the smooth gravel , once Nickits 's , when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the shrubbery , with such violence as to make his horse shy across the road .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 4]: ` Harthouse ! '
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 4]: cried Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: ` Have you heard ? '
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 5]: ` Heard what ? '
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 17]: said Harthouse , soothing his horse , and inwardly favouring Mr. Bounderby with no good wishes .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 9]: ` Then you have n't heard ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 11]: I have heard you , and so has this brute .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 7]: I have heard nothing else . '
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 29]: Mr. Bounderby , red and hot , planted himself in the centre of the path before the horse 's head , to explode his bombshell with more effect .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 7]: ` The Bank 's robbed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 8]: ` You do n't mean it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 7]: ` Robbed last night , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 6]: Robbed in an extraordinary manner .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 7]: Robbed with a false key . '
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 5]: ` Of much ? '
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 32]: Mr. Bounderby , in his desire to make the most of it , really seemed mortified by being obliged to reply , ` Why , no ; not of very much .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 7]: But it might have been . '
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 6]: ` Of how much ? '
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 28]: as a sum -- if you stick to a sum -- of not more than a hundred and fifty pound , ' said Bounderby , with impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 13]: ` But it 's not the sum ; it 's the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 16]: It 's the fact of the Bank being robbed , that 's the important circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 10]: I am surprised you do n't see it . '
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 47]: ` My dear Bounderby , ' said James , dismounting , and giving his bridle to his servant , ' I do see it ; and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be , by the spectacle afforded to my mental view .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 36]: Nevertheless , I may be allowed , I hope , to congratulate you -- which I do with all my soul , I assure you -- on your not having sustained a greater loss . '
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 16]: ` Thank ` ee , ' replied Bounderby , in a short , ungracious manner .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 7]: ` But I tell you what .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 10]: It might have been twenty thousand pound . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 6]: I suppose it might . '
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 5]: ` Suppose it might !
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 9]: By the Lord , you may suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 4]: By George ! '
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 14]: said Mr. Bounderby , with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 8]: ` It might have been twice twenty .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 29]: There 's no knowing what it would have been , or would n't have been , as it was , but for the fellows ' being disturbed . '
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 13]: Louisa had come up now , and Mrs. Sparsit , and Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 25]: ` Here 's Tom Gradgrind 's daughter knows pretty well what it might have been , if you do n't , ' blustered Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 15]: ` Dropped , sir , as if she was shot when I told her !
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 9]: Never knew her do such a thing before .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 13]: Does her credit , under the circumstances , in my opinion ! '
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 7]: She still looked faint and pale .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 26]: James Harthouse begged her to take his arm ; and as they moved on very slowly , asked her how the robbery had been committed .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 22]: ` Why , I am going to tell you , ' said Bounderby , irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 22]: ` If you had n't been so mighty particular about the sum , I should have begun to tell you before .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 17]: You know this lady -LRB- for she is a lady -RRB- , Mrs. Sparsit ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 12]: I have already had the honour -- ' ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 17]: And this young man , Bitzer , you saw him too on the same occasion ? '
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 14]: Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent , and Bitzer knuckled his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 4]: ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 6]: They live at the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 10]: You know they live at the Bank , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 17]: Yesterday afternoon , at the close of business hours , everything was put away as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 19]: In the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of , there was never mind how much .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 28]: In the little safe in young Tom 's closet , the safe used for petty purposes , there was a hundred and fifty odd pound . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 13]: A hundred and fifty-four , seven , one , ' said Bitzer .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 19]: retorted Bounderby , stopping to wheel round upon him , ` let 's have none of your interruptions .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 26]: It 's enough to be robbed while you 're snoring because you 're too comfortable , without being put right with your four seven ones .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 18]: I did n't snore , myself , when I was your age , let me tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 8]: I had n't victuals enough to snore .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 8]: And I did n't four seven one .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 7]: Not if I knew it . '
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 32]: Bitzer knuckled his forehead again , in a sneaking manner , and seemed at once particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of Mr. Bounderby 's moral abstinence . '
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 12]: A hundred and fifty odd pound , ' resumed Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 26]: ` That sum of money , young Tom locked in his safe , not a very strong safe , but that 's no matter now .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 7]: Everything was left , all right .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 26]: Some time in the night , while this young fellow snored -- Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , you say you have heard him snore ? '
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 29]: ` Sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ' I can not say that I have heard him precisely snore , and therefore must not make that statement .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 29]: But on winter evenings , when he has fallen asleep at his table , I have heard him , what I should prefer to describe as partially choke .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 23]: I have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in Dutch clocks .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 28]: Not , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , with a lofty sense of giving strict evidence , ` that I would convey any imputation on his moral character .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 25]: I have always considered Bitzer a young man of the most upright principle ; and to that I beg to bear my testimony . '
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 58]: said the exasperated Bounderby , ` while he was snoring , or choking , or Dutch-clocking , or something or other -- being asleep -- some fellows , somehow , whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen , got to young Tom 's safe , forced it , and abstracted the contents .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 55]: Being then disturbed , they made off ; letting themselves out at the main door , and double-locking it again -LRB- it was double-locked , and the key under Mrs. Sparsit 's pillow -RRB- with a false key , which was picked up in the street near the Bank , about twelve o'clock to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 27]: No alarm takes place , till this chap , Bitzer , turns out this morning , and begins to open and prepare the offices for business .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 26]: Then , looking at Tom 's safe , he sees the door ajar , and finds the lock forced , and the money gone . '
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 10]: ` Where is Tom , by the by ? '
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 6]: asked Harthouse , glancing round .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 20]: ` He has been helping the police , ' said Bounderby , ` and stays behind at the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 18]: I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 23]: They would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job ; I can tell 'em that . '
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 6]: ` Is anybody suspected ? '
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 3]: ` Suspected ?
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 8]: I should think there was somebody suspected .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 3]: Egod ! '
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 14]: said Bounderby , relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit 's arm to wipe his heated head .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 14]: ` Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 6]: No , thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 8]: Might Mr. Harthouse inquire Who was suspected ?
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 22]: ` Well , ' said Bounderby , stopping and facing about to confront them all , ` I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 37]: It 's not to be mentioned everywhere ; it 's not to be mentioned anywhere : in order that the scoundrels concerned -LRB- there 's a gang of 'em -RRB- may be thrown off their guard .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 6]: So take this in confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 6]: Now wait a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 7]: Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 23]: ` What should you say to ; ' here he violently exploded : ` to a Hand being in it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 16]: I hope , ' said Harthouse , lazily , ` not our friend Blackpot ? '
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 21]: ` Say Pool instead of Pot , sir , ' returned Bounderby , ` and that 's the man . '
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 11]: Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 3]: O yes !
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 4]: I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 10]: said Bounderby , immediately catching at the sound . '
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 6]: I am used to that .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 6]: I know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 13]: They are the finest people in the world , these fellows are .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 12]: They have got the gift of the gab , they have .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 14]: They only want to have their rights explained to them , they do .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 6]: But I tell you what .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 29]: Show me a dissatisfied Hand , and I 'll show you a man that 's fit for anything bad , I do n't care what it is . '
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 24]: Another of the popular fictions of Coketown , which some pains had been taken to disseminate -- and which some people really believed .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 14]: ` But I am acquainted with these chaps , ' said Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 9]: I can read 'em off , like books .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 10]: Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , I appeal to you .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 41]: What warning did I give that fellow , the first time he set foot in the house , when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over , and floor the Established Church ?
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 62]: Mrs. Sparsit , in point of high connexions , you are on a level with the aristocracy , -- did I say , or did I not say , to that fellow , `` you ca n't hide the truth from me : you are not the kind of fellow I like ; you 'll come to no good '' ? '
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 27]: ` Assuredly , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ` you did , in a highly impressive manner , give him such an admonition . '
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 20]: ` When he shocked you , ma'am , ' said Bounderby ; ` when he shocked your feelings ? '
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 24]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a meek shake of her head , ` he certainly did so .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 42]: Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points -- more foolish if the term is preferred -- than they might have been , if I had always occupied my present position . '
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 37]: Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse , as much as to say , ' I am the proprietor of this female , and she 's worth your attention , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 6]: Then , resumed his discourse .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 19]: ` You can recall for yourself , Harthouse , what I said to him when you saw him .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 9]: I did n't mince the matter with him .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 7]: I am never mealy with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 4]: I KNOW 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 5]: Very well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 8]: Three days after that , he bolted .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 33]: Went off , nobody knows where : as my mother did in my infancy -- only with this difference , that he is a worse subject than my mother , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 8]: What did he do before he went ?
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 51]: What do you say ; ' Mr. Bounderby , with his hat in his hand , gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences , as if it were a tambourine ; ` to his being seen -- night after night -- watching the Bank ?
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 10]: -- to his lurking about there -- after dark ?
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 51]: -- To its striking Mrs. Sparsit -- that he could be lurking for no good -- To her calling Bitzer 's attention to him , and their both taking notice of him -- And to its appearing on inquiry to-day -- that he was also noticed by the neighbours ? '
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 21]: Having come to the climax , Mr. Bounderby , like an oriental dancer , put his tambourine on his head .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 13]: ` Suspicious , ' said James Harthouse , ` certainly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 16]: I think so , sir , ' said Bounderby , with a defiant nod . '
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 9]: But there are more of 'em in it .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 6]: There 's an old woman .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 38]: One never hears of these things till the mischief 's done ; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen ; there 's an old woman turns up now .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 20]: An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick , every now and then .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 52]: She watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins , and on the night when you saw him , she steals away with him and holds a council with him -- I suppose , to make her report on going off duty , and be damned to her . '
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 20]: There was such a person in the room that night , and she shrunk from observation , thought Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 26]: ` This is not all of 'em , even as we already know 'em , ' said Bounderby , with many nods of hidden meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 10]: ` But I have said enough for the present .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 17]: You 'll have the goodness to keep it quiet , and mention it to no one .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 11]: It may take time , but we shall have 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 18]: It 's policy to give 'em line enough , and there 's no objection to that . '
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 31]: ` Of course , they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law , as notice-boards observe , ' replied James Harthouse , ` and serve them right .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 11]: Fellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 15]: If there were no consequences , we should all go in for Banks . '
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 34]: He had gently taken Louisa 's parasol from her hand , and had put it up for her ; and she walked under its shade , though the sun did not shine there .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 22]: ` For the present , Loo Bounderby , ' said her husband , ` here 's Mrs. Sparsit to look after .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 22]: Mrs. Sparsit 's nerves have been acted upon by this business , and she 'll stay here a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 6]: So make her comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 26]: ` Thank you very much , sir , ' that discreet lady observed , ` but pray do not let My comfort be a consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 7]: Anything will do for Me . '
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 39]: It soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her association with that domestic establishment , it was that she was so excessively regardless of herself and regardful of others , as to be a nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 35]: On being shown her chamber , she was so dreadfully sensible of its comforts as to suggest the inference that she would have preferred to pass the night on the mangle in the laundry .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 53]: True , the Powlers and the Scadgerses were accustomed to splendour , ` but it is my duty to remember , ' Mrs. Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace : particularly when any of the domestics were present , ` that what I was , I am no longer .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 59]: Indeed , ' said she , ` if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr. Sparsit was a Powler , or that I myself am related to the Scadgers family ; or if I could even revoke the fact , and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions ; I would gladly do so .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 15]: I should think it , under existing circumstances , right to do so . '
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 67]: The same Hermitical state of mind led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner , until fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them ; when she said , ` Indeed you are very good , sir ; ' and departed from a resolution of which she had made rather formal and public announcement , to ` wait for the simple mutton . '
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 81]: She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt ; and , feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest extent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves , occasionally sat back in her chair and silently wept ; at which periods a tear of large dimensions , like a crystal ear-ring , might be observed -LRB- or rather , must be , for it insisted on public notice -RRB- sliding down her Roman nose .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 19]: But Mrs. Sparsit 's greatest point , first and last , was her determination to pity Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 29]: There were occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily moved to shake her head , as who would say , ` Alas , poor Yorick ! '
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 64]: After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of emotion , she would force a lambent brightness , and would be fitfully cheerful , and would say , ` You have still good spirits , sir , I am thankful to find ; ' and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he did .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 16]: One idiosyncrasy for which she often apologized , she found it excessively difficult to conquer .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 31]: She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ` Miss Gradgrind , ' and yielded to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 60]: Her repetition of this mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion ; but indeed , she said , it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind : whereas , to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs. Bounderby , she found almost impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 37]: It was a further singularity of this remarkable case , that the more she thought about it , the more impossible it appeared ; ` the differences , ' she observed , ` being such . '
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 42]: In the drawing-room after dinner , Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the robbery , examined the witnesses , made notes of the evidence , found the suspected persons guilty , and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of the law .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 20]: That done , Bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to recommend Tom to come home by the mail-train .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 17]: When candles were brought , Mrs. Sparsit murmured , ` Do n't be low , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 16]: Pray let me see you cheerful , sir , as I used to do . '
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 32]: Mr. Bounderby , upon whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him , in a bull-headed blundering way , sentimental , sighed like some large sea-animal . '
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 16]: I can not bear to see you so , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 27]: ` Try a hand at backgammon , sir , as you used to do when I had the honour of living under your roof . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 19]: I have n't played backgammon , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` since that time . '
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 21]: ` No , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , soothingly , ' I am aware that you have not .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes no interest in the game .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 14]: But I shall be happy , sir , if you will condescend . '
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 11]: They played near a window , opening on the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 14]: It was a fine night : not moonlight , but sultry and fragrant .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 26]: Louisa and Mr. Harthouse strolled out into the garden , where their voices could be heard in the stillness , though not what they said .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 22]: Mrs. Sparsit , from her place at the backgammon board , was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the shadows without .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 9]: ` What 's the matter , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 16]: said Mr. Bounderby ; ` you do n't see a Fire , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 21]: ` Oh dear no , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ' I was thinking of the dew . '
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 14]: ` What have you got to do with the dew , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 4]: said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 25]: ` It 's not myself , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ' I am fearful of Miss Gradgrind 's taking cold . '
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 11]: ` She never takes cold , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 6]: ` Really , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 4]: said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 10]: And was affected with a cough in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 16]: When the time drew near for retiring , Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 6]: ` Oh , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 4]: said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 12]: ` Not your sherry warm , with lemon-peel and nutmeg ? '
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 22]: ` Why , I have got out of the habit of taking it now , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 24]: ` The more 's the pity , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit ; ` you are losing all your good old habits .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 5]: Cheer up , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 23]: If Miss Gradgrind will permit me , I will offer to make it for you , as I have often done . '
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 26]: Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she pleased , that considerate lady made the beverage , and handed it to Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 9]: ` It will do you good , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 6]: It will warm your heart .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 17]: It is the sort of thing you want , and ought to take , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 13]: And when Mr. Bounderby said , ` Your health , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 12]: she answered with great feeling , ` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 10]: The same to you , and happiness also . '
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 47]: Finally , she wished him good night , with great pathos ; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed , with a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender , though he could not , for his life , have mentioned what it was .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 20]: Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down , she watched and waited for her brother 's coming home .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 35]: That could hardly be , she knew , until an hour past midnight ; but in the country silence , which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts , time lagged wearily .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 25]: At last , when the darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another , she heard the bell at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 42]: She felt as though she would have been glad that it rang on until daylight ; but it ceased , and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air , and all was dead again .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 13]: She waited yet some quarter of an hour , as she judged .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 30]: Then she arose , put on a loose robe , and went out of her room in the dark , and up the staircase to her brother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 22]: His door being shut , she softly opened it and spoke to him , approaching his bed with a noiseless step .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 20]: She kneeled down beside it , passed her arm over his neck , and drew his face to hers .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 17]: She knew that he only feigned to be asleep , but she said nothing to him .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 25]: He started by and by as if he were just then awakened , and asked who that was , and what was the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 10]: ` Tom , have you anything to tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 25]: If ever you loved me in your life , and have anything concealed from every one besides , tell it to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 10]: I do n't know what you mean , Loo .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 6]: You have been dreaming . '
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 44]: ` My dear brother : ' she laid her head down on his pillow , and her hair flowed over him as if she would hide him from every one but herself : ` is there nothing that you have to tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 11]: Is there nothing you can tell me if you will ?
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 10]: You can tell me nothing that will change me .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 10]: O Tom , tell me the truth ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 11]: I do n't know what you mean , Loo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 38]: ` As you lie here alone , my dear , in the melancholy night , so you must lie somewhere one night , when even I , if I am living then , shall have left you .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 32]: As I am here beside you , barefoot , unclothed , undistinguishable in darkness , so must I lie through all the night of my decay , until I am dust .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 16]: In the name of that time , Tom , tell me the truth now ! '
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 10]: ` What is it you want to know ? '
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 34]: ` You may be certain ; ' in the energy of her love she took him to her bosom as if he were a child ; ` that I will not reproach you .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 14]: You may be certain that I will be compassionate and true to you .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 13]: You may be certain that I will save you at whatever cost .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 10]: O Tom , have you nothing to tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 4]: Whisper very softly .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 13]: Say only `` yes , '' and I shall understand you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 14]: She turned her ear to his lips , but he remained doggedly silent .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: ` Not a word , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 23]: ` How can I say Yes , or how can I say No , when I do n't know what you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 23]: Loo , you are a brave , kind girl , worthy I begin to think of a better brother than I am .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 8]: But I have nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 9]: Go to bed , go to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 16]: ` You are tired , ' she whispered presently , more in her usual way .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 10]: ` Yes , I am quite tired out . '
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 10]: ` You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 8]: Have any fresh discoveries been made ? '
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 13]: ` Only those you have heard of , from -- him . '
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 27]: ` Tom , have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people , and that we saw those three together ? '
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 22]: Did n't you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you asked me to go there with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 13]: But I did not know then what was going to happen . '
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 5]: ` Nor I neither .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 5]: How could I ? '
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 10]: He was very quick upon her with this retort .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 36]: ` Ought I to say , after what has happened , ' said his sister , standing by the bed -- she had gradually withdrawn herself and risen , ` that I made that visit ?
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 5]: Should I say so ?
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 6]: Must I say so ? '
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 23]: ` Good Heavens , Loo , ' returned her brother , ` you are not in the habit of asking my advice .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 5]: say what you like .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 14]: If you keep it to yourself , I shall keep it to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 13]: If you disclose it , there 's an end of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 25]: It was too dark for either to see the other 's face ; but each seemed very attentive , and to consider before speaking .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 23]: ` Tom , do you believe the man I gave the money to , is really implicated in this crime ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 11]: I do n't see why he should n't be . '
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 10]: ` He seemed to me an honest man . '
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 16]: ` Another person may seem to you dishonest , and yet not be so . '
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 12]: There was a pause , for he had hesitated and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 83]: ` In short , ' resumed Tom , as if he had made up his mind , ` if you come to that , perhaps I was so far from being altogether in his favour , that I took him outside the door to tell him quietly , that I thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister , and that I hoped he would make good use of it .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 10]: You remember whether I took him out or not .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 26]: I say nothing against the man ; he may be a very good fellow , for anything I know ; I hope he is . '
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 10]: ` Was he offended by what you said ? '
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 14]: ` No , he took it pretty well ; he was civil enough .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 7]: Where are you , Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 9]: He sat up in bed and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 11]: ` Good night , my dear , good night . '
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 10]: ` You have nothing more to tell me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 5]: What should I have ?
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 12]: You would n't have me tell you a lie ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 31]: I would n't have you do that to-night , Tom , of all the nights in your life ; many and much happier as I hope they will be . '
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 8]: ` Thank you , my dear Loo .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 21]: I am so tired , that I am sure I wonder I do n't say anything to get to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 9]: Go to bed , go to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 32]: Kissing her again , he turned round , drew the coverlet over his head , and lay as still as if that time had come by which she had adjured him .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 14]: She stood for some time at the bedside before she slowly moved away .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 23]: She stopped at the door , looked back when she had opened it , and asked him if he had called her ?
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 17]: But he lay still , and she softly closed the door and returned to her room .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 60]: Then the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her gone , crept out of bed , fastened his door , and threw himself upon his pillow again : tearing his hair , morosely crying , grudgingly loving her , hatefully but impenitently spurning himself , and no less hatefully and unprofitably spurning all the good in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 86]: Chapter IX -- Hearing the Last of It Mrs. Sparsit , lying by to recover the tone of her nerves in Mr. Bounderby 's retreat , kept such a sharp look-out , night and day , under her Coriolanian eyebrows , that her eyes , like a couple of lighthouses on an iron-bound coast , might have warned all prudent mariners from that bold rock her Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its neighbourhood , but for the placidity of her manner .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 129]: Although it was hard to believe that her retiring for the night could be anything but a form , so severely wide awake were those classical eyes of hers , and so impossible did it seem that her rigid nose could yield to any relaxing influence , yet her manner of sitting , smoothing her uncomfortable , not to say , gritty mittens -LRB- they were constructed of a cool fabric like a meat-safe -RRB- , or of ambling to unknown places of destination with her foot in her cotton stirrup , was so perfectly serene , that most observers would have been constrained to suppose her a dove , embodied by some freak of nature , in the earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 12]: She was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 13]: How she got from story to story was a mystery beyond solution .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 38]: A lady so decorous in herself , and so highly connected , was not to be suspected of dropping over the banisters or sliding down them , yet her extraordinary facility of locomotion suggested the wild idea .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 14]: Another noticeable circumstance in Mrs. Sparsit was , that she was never hurried .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 32]: She would shoot with consummate velocity from the roof to the hall , yet would be in full possession of her breath and dignity on the moment of her arrival there .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 15]: Neither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 20]: She took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse , and had some pleasant conversation with him soon after her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 15]: She made him her stately curtsey in the garden , one morning before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 45]: ` It appears but yesterday , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` that I had the honour of receiving you at the Bank , when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby 's address . '
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 40]: ` An occasion , I am sure , not to be forgotten by myself in the course of Ages , ' said Mr. Harthouse , inclining his head to Mrs. Sparsit with the most indolent of all possible airs .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 16]: ` We live in a singular world , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit . '
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 33]: I have had the honour , by a coincidence of which I am proud , to have made a remark , similar in effect , though not so epigrammatically expressed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 65]: A singular world , I would say , sir , ' pursued Mrs. Sparsit ; after acknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows , not altogether so mild in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet tones ; ` as regards the intimacies we form at one time , with individuals we were quite ignorant of , at another .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 25]: I recall , sir , that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss Gradgrind . '
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 12]: ` Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 24]: I availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity , and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 35]: Mrs. Sparsit 's talent for -- in fact for anything requiring accuracy -- with a combination of strength of mind -- and Family -- is too habitually developed to admit of any question . '
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 31]: He was almost falling asleep over this compliment ; it took him so long to get through , and his mind wandered so much in the course of its execution .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 30]: ` You found Miss Gradgrind -- I really can not call her Mrs. Bounderby ; it 's very absurd of me -- as youthful as I described her ? '
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 6]: asked Mrs. Sparsit , sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 12]: ` You drew her portrait perfectly , ' said Mr. Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 7]: ` Presented her dead image . '
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 21]: ` Very engaging , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 5]: ` Highly so . '
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 36]: ` It used to be considered , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation , but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 10]: Ay , and indeed here is Mr. Bounderby ! '
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 25]: cried Mrs. Sparsit , nodding her head a great many times , as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 11]: ` How do you find yourself this morning , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 10]: Pray let us see you cheerful , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 48]: Now , these persistent assuagements of his misery , and lightenings of his load , had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit , and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 81]: So , when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart , ` You want your breakfast , sir , but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table , ' Mr. Bounderby replied , ` If I waited to be taken care of by my wife , ma'am , I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday , so I 'll trouble you to take charge of the teapot . '
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 12]: Mrs. Sparsit complied , and assumed her old position at table .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 9]: This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 91]: She was so humble withal , that when Louisa appeared , she rose , protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances , often as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby 's breakfast , before Mrs. Gradgrind -- she begged pardon , she meant to say Miss Bounderby -- she hoped to be excused , but she really could not get it right yet , though she trusted to become familiar with it by and by -- had assumed her present position .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 68]: It was only -LRB- she observed -RRB- because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late , and Mr. Bounderby 's time was so very precious , and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment , that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request ; long as his will had been a law to her .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 18]: Stop where you are , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` stop where you are !
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 17]: Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 27]: ` Do n't say that , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , almost with severity , ` because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 13]: And to be unkind is not to be you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 11]: ` You may set your mind at rest , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 15]: -- You can take it very quietly , ca n't you , Loo ? '
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 12]: said Mr. Bounderby , in a blustering way to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 4]: ` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 6]: It is of no moment .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 11]: Why should it be of any importance to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 18]: ` Why should it be of any importance to any one , Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 11]: said Mr. Bounderby , swelling with a sense of slight .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 12]: ` You attach too much importance to these things , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 14]: By George , you 'll be corrupted in some of your notions here .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 6]: You are old-fashioned , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 11]: You are behind Tom Gradgrind 's children 's time . '
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 9]: ` What is the matter with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 6]: asked Louisa , coldly surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 8]: ` What has given you offence ? '
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 4]: ` Offence ! '
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 3]: repeated Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 25]: ` Do you suppose if there was any offence given me , I should n't name it , and request to have it corrected ?
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 9]: I am a straightforward man , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 11]: I do n't go beating about for side-winds . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 42]: I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident , or too delicate , ' Louisa answered him composedly : ' I have never made that objection to you , either as a child or as a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 10]: I do n't understand what you would have . '
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 4]: ` Have ? '
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 4]: returned Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 3]: ` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 25]: Otherwise , do n't you , Loo Bounderby , know thoroughly well that I , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , would have it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 33]: She looked at him , as he struck the table and made the teacups ring , with a proud colour in her face that was a new change , Mr. Harthouse thought .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 11]: ` You are incomprehensible this morning , ' said Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 10]: ` Pray take no further trouble to explain yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 9]: I am not curious to know your meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 6]: What does it matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 19]: Nothing more was said on this theme , and Mr. Harthouse was soon idly gay on indifferent subjects .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 53]: But from this day , the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together , and strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence against him with another , into which she had fallen by degrees so fine that she could not retrace them if she tried .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 16]: But whether she ever tried or no , lay hidden in her own closed heart .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 47]: Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion , that , assisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after breakfast , and being then alone with him in the hall , she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand , murmured ` My benefactor ! '
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 7]: and retired , overwhelmed with grief .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 78]: Yet it is an indubitable fact , within the cognizance of this history , that five minutes after he had left the house in the self-same hat , the same descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers , shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait , made a contemptuous grimace at that work of art , and said ` Serve you right , you Noodle , and I am glad of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 12]: Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone , when Bitzer appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 34]: Bitzer had come down by train , shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches that bestrode the wild country of past and present coal-pits , with an express from Stone Lodge .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 15]: It was a hasty note to inform Louisa that Mrs. Gradgrind lay very ill .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 61]: She had never been well within her daughter 's knowledge ; but , she had declined within the last few days , had continued sinking all through the night , and was now as nearly dead , as her limited capacity of being in any state that implied the ghost of an intention to get out of it , allowed .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 39]: Accompanied by the lightest of porters , fit colourless servitor at Death 's door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked , Louisa rumbled to Coketown , over the coal-pits past and present , and was whirled into its smoky jaws .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 17]: She dismissed the messenger to his own devices , and rode away to her old home .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 9]: She had seldom been there since her marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 39]: Her father was usually sifting and sifting at his parliamentary cinder-heap in London -LRB- without being observed to turn up many precious articles among the rubbish -RRB- , and was still hard at it in the national dust-yard .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 62]: Her mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise , to be visited , as she reclined upon her sofa ; young people , Louisa felt herself all unfit for ; Sissy she had never softened to again , since the night when the stroller 's child had raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby 's intended wife .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 13]: She had no inducements to go back , and had rarely gone .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 23]: Neither , as she approached her old home now , did any of the best influences of old home descend upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 118]: The dreams of childhood -- its airy fables ; its graceful , beautiful , humane , impossible adornments of the world beyond : so good to be believed in once , so good to be remembered when outgrown , for then the least among them rises to the stature of a great Charity in the heart , suffering little children to come into the midst of it , and to keep with their pure hands a garden in the stony ways of this world , wherein it were better for all the children of Adam that they should oftener sun themselves , simple and trustful , and not worldly-wise -- what had she to do with these ?
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 111]: Remembrances of how she had journeyed to the little that she knew , by the enchanted roads of what she and millions of innocent creatures had hoped and imagined ; of how , first coming upon Reason through the tender light of Fancy , she had seen it a beneficent god , deferring to gods as great as itself ; not a grim Idol , cruel and cold , with its victims bound hand to foot , and its big dumb shape set up with a sightless stare , never to be moved by anything but so many calculated tons of leverage -- what had she to do with these ?
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 26]: Her remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up of every spring and fountain in her young heart as it gushed out .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 7]: The golden waters were not there .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 21]: They were flowing for the fertilization of the land where grapes are gathered from thorns , and figs from thistles .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 24]: She went , with a heavy , hardened kind of sorrow upon her , into the house and into her mother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 21]: Since the time of her leaving home , Sissy had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 26]: Sissy was at her mother 's side ; and Jane , her sister , now ten or twelve years old , was in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 20]: There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest child was there .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 31]: She reclined , propped up , from mere habit , on a couch : as nearly in her old usual attitude , as anything so helpless could be kept in .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 27]: She had positively refused to take to her bed ; on the ground that if she did , she would never hear the last of it .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 48]: Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls , and the sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her ears , that she might have been lying at the bottom of a well .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 20]: The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been : which had much to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 65]: On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there , she replied , at cross-purposes , that she had never called him by that name since he married Louisa ; that pending her choice of an objectionable name , she had called him J ; and that she could not at present depart from that regulation , not being yet provided with a permanent substitute .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 27]: Louisa had sat by her for some minutes , and had spoken to her often , before she arrived at a clear understanding who it was .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 11]: She then seemed to come to it all at once .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 23]: ` Well , my dear , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind , ` and I hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 8]: It was all your father 's doing .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 7]: He set his heart upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: And he ought to know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 14]: I want to hear of you , mother ; not of myself . '
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 11]: ` You want to hear of me , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 17]: That 's something new , I am sure , when anybody wants to hear of me .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 7]: Not at all well , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 6]: Very faint and giddy . '
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 11]: ` Are you in pain , dear mother ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 30]: I think there 's a pain somewhere in the room , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind , ` but I could n't positively say that I have got it . '
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 12]: After this strange speech , she lay silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 27]: Louisa , holding her hand , could feel no pulse ; but kissing it , could see a slight thin thread of life in fluttering motion .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 13]: ` You very seldom see your sister , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 6]: ` She grows like you .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 8]: I wish you would look at her .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 7]: Sissy , bring her here . '
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 14]: She was brought , and stood with her hand in her sister 's .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 21]: Louisa had observed her with her arm round Sissy 's neck , and she felt the difference of this approach .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 10]: ` Do you see the likeness , Louisa ? '
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 5]: ` Yes , mother .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 7]: I should think her like me .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 6]: But -- ' ` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 16]: Yes , I always say so , ' Mrs. Gradgrind cried , with unexpected quickness .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 6]: ` And that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 12]: I -- I want to speak to you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 13]: Sissy , my good girl , leave us alone a minute . '
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 81]: Louisa had relinquished the hand : had thought that her sister 's was a better and brighter face than hers had ever been : had seen in it , not without a rising feeling of resentment , even in that place and at that time , something of the gentleness of the other face in the room ; the sweet face with the trusting eyes , made paler than watching and sympathy made it , by the rich dark hair .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 41]: Left alone with her mother , Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon her face , like one who was floating away upon some great water , all resistance over , content to be carried down the stream .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 16]: She put the shadow of a hand to her lips again , and recalled her .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 12]: ` You were going to speak to me , mother . '
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 3]: ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 9]: Yes , to be sure , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 21]: You know your father is almost always away now , and therefore I must write to him about it . '
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 6]: ` About what , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 5]: Do n't be troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 4]: About what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 42]: ` You must remember , my dear , that whenever I have said anything , on any subject , I have never heard the last of it : and consequently , that I have long left off saying anything . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 8]: I can hear you , mother . '
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 42]: But , it was only by dint of bending down to her ear , and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved , that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 15]: ` You learnt a great deal , Louisa , and so did your brother .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 9]: Ologies of all kinds from morning to night .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 39]: If there is any Ology left , of any description , that has not been worn to rags in this house , all I can say is , I hope I shall never hear its name . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 16]: I can hear you , mother , when you have strength to go on . '
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 9]: This , to keep her from floating away .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 23]: ` But there is something -- not an Ology at all -- that your father has missed , or forgotten , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 8]: I do n't know what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 14]: I have often sat with Sissy near me , and thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 8]: I shall never get its name now .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 5]: But your father may .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 5]: It makes me restless .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 19]: I want to write to him , to find out for God 's sake , what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 11]: Give me a pen , give me a pen . '
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 23]: Even the power of restlessness was gone , except from the poor head , which could just turn from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 27]: She fancied , however , that her request had been complied with , and that the pen she could not have held was in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 16]: It matters little what figures of wonderful no-meaning she began to trace upon her wrappers .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 58]: The hand soon stopped in the midst of them ; the light that had always been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency , went out ; and even Mrs. Gradgrind , emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth himself in vain , took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and patriarchs .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 79]: Chapter X -- Mrs. Sparsit 's Staircase Mrs. Sparsit 's nerves being slow to recover their tone , the worthy woman made a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby 's retreat , where , notwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming consciousness of her altered station , she resigned herself with noble fortitude to lodging , as one may say , in clover , and feeding on the fat of the land .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 59]: During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship of the Bank , Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency ; continuing to take such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face , as is rarely taken on man , and to call his portrait a Noodle to its face , with the greatest acrimony and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 84]: Mr. Bounderby , having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts -LRB- for he had not yet settled what it was -RRB- , and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do , resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 61]: So when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude , he said to her at the dinner-table , on the day before her departure , ' I tell you what , ma'am ; you shall come down here of a Saturday , while the fine weather lasts , and stay till Monday . '
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 24]: To which Mrs. Sparsit returned , in effect , though not of the Mahomedan persuasion : ` To hear is to obey . '
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 27]: Now , Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman ; but she took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy , into her head .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 40]: Much watching of Louisa , and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour , which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit 's edge , must have given her as it were a lift , in the way of inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 40]: She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase , with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom ; and down those stairs , from day to day and hour to hour , she saw Louisa coming .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 24]: It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit 's life , to look up at her staircase , and to watch Louisa coming down .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 20]: Sometimes slowly , sometimes quickly , sometimes several steps at one bout , sometimes stopping , never turning back .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 21]: If she had once turned back , it might have been the death of Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 25]: She had been descending steadily , to the day , and on the day , when Mr. Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 13]: Mrs. Sparsit was in good spirits , and inclined to be conversational .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 58]: ` And pray , sir , ' said she , ` if I may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve -- which is indeed hardy in me , for I well know you have a reason for everything you do -- have you received intelligence respecting the robbery ? '
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 10]: ` Why , ma'am , no ; not yet .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 11]: Under the circumstances , I did n't expect it yet .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 11]: Rome was n't built in a day , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 15]: ` Very true , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 10]: ` Nor yet in a week , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 19]: ` No , indeed , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a gentle melancholy upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 20]: ` In a similar manner , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , ' I can wait , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 12]: If Romulus and Remus could wait , Josiah Bounderby can wait .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 13]: They were better off in their youth than I was , however .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 17]: They had a she-wolf for a nurse ; I had only a she-wolf for a grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 13]: She did n't give any milk , ma'am ; she gave bruises .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 9]: She was a regular Alderney at that . '
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 6]: Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 19]: ` No , ma'am , ' continued Bounderby , ' I have not heard anything more about it .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 35]: It 's in hand , though ; and young Tom , who rather sticks to business at present -- something new for him ; he had n't the schooling I had -- is helping .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 16]: My injunction is , Keep it quiet , and let it seem to blow over .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 43]: Do what you like under the rose , but do n't give a sign of what you 're about ; or half a hundred of 'em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted , out of reach for good .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 23]: Keep it quiet , and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little , and we shall have 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 12]: ` Very sagacious indeed , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 4]: ` Very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 64]: The old woman you mentioned , sir -- ' ` The old woman I mentioned , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , cutting the matter short , as it was nothing to boast about , ` is not laid hold of ; but , she may take her oath she will be , if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 31]: In the mean time , ma'am , I am of opinion , if you ask me my opinion , that the less she is talked about , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 29]: The same evening , Mrs. Sparsit , in her chamber window , resting from her packing operations , looked towards her great staircase and saw Louisa still descending .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 36]: She sat by Mr. Harthouse , in an alcove in the garden , talking very low ; he stood leaning over her , as they whispered together , and his face almost touched her hair .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 6]: ` If not quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 13]: said Mrs. Sparsit , straining her hawk 's eyes to the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 49]: Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a word of their discourse , or even to know that they were speaking softly , otherwise than from the expression of their figures ; but what they said was this : ` You recollect the man , Mr. Harthouse ? '
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 6]: ` Oh , perfectly ! '
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 14]: ` His face , and his manner , and what he said ? '
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 3]: ` Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 12]: And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 7]: Lengthy and prosy in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 37]: It was knowing to hold forth , in the humble-virtue school of eloquence ; but , I assure you I thought at the time , `` My good fellow , you are over-doing this ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 16]: ` It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man . '
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 10]: ` My dear Louisa -- as Tom says . '
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 6]: Which he never did say .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 10]: ` You know no good of the fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 6]: ` No , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 9]: ` Nor of any other such person ? '
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 36]: ` How can I , ' she returned , with more of her first manner on her than he had lately seen , ` when I know nothing of them , men or women ? '
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 58]: ` My dear Louisa , then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend , who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow-creatures -- for excellent they are , I am quite ready to believe , in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 4]: This fellow talks .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 6]: Well ; every fellow talks .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 4]: He professes morality .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 9]: Well ; all sorts of humbugs profess morality .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 36]: From the House of Commons to the House of Correction , there is a general profession of morality , except among our people ; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 7]: You saw and heard the case .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 38]: Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby -- who , as we know , is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 54]: The member of the fluffy classes was injured , exasperated , left the house grumbling , met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business , went in , put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before , and relieved his mind extremely .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 26]: Really he would have been an uncommon , instead of a common , fellow , if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 16]: Or he may have originated it altogether , if he had the cleverness . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 46]: I almost feel as though it must be bad in me , ' returned Louisa , after sitting thoughtful awhile , ` to be so ready to agree with you , and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 10]: I only say what is reasonable ; nothing worse .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 40]: I have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once -- of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom -- and he is quite of my opinion , and I am quite of his .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 5]: Will you walk ? '
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 40]: They strolled away , among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the twilight -- she leaning on his arm -- and she little thought how she was going down , down , down , Mrs. Sparsit 's staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: Night and day , Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 43]: When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf , it might fall in upon her if it would ; but , until then , there it was to be , a Building , before Mrs. Sparsit 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 9]: And there Louisa always was , upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 9]: And always gliding down , down , down !
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 73]: Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go ; she heard of him here and there ; she saw the changes of the face he had studied ; she , too , remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded , how and when it cleared ; she kept her black eyes wide open , with no touch of pity , with no touch of compunction , all absorbed in interest .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 30]: In the interest of seeing her , ever drawing , with no hand to stay her , nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new Giant 's Staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 25]: With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his portrait , Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 30]: Eager to see it accomplished , and yet patient , she waited for the last fall , as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 37]: Hushed in expectancy , she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs ; and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten -LRB- with her fist in it -RRB- , at the figure coming down .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 35]: Chapter XI -- Lower and Lower THE figure descended the great stairs , steadily , steadily ; always verging , like a weight in deep water , to the black gulf at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 24]: Mr. Gradgrind , apprised of his wife 's decease , made an expedition from London , and buried her in a business-like manner .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 49]: He then returned with promptitude to the national cinder-heap , and resumed his sifting for the odds and ends he wanted , and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes of other people who wanted other odds and ends -- in fact resumed his parliamentary duties .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 12]: In the meantime , Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 65]: Separated from her staircase , all the week , by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house , she yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa , through her husband , through her brother , through James Harthouse , through the outsides of letters and packets , through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 40]: ` Your foot on the last step , my lady , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , apostrophizing the descending figure , with the aid of her threatening mitten , ` and all your art shall never blind me . '
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 38]: Art or nature though , the original stock of Louisa 's character or the graft of circumstances upon it , -- her curious reserve did baffle , while it stimulated , one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 13]: There were times when Mr. James Harthouse was not sure of her .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 43]: There were times when he could not read the face he had studied so long ; and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him , than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 31]: So the time went on ; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere , for three or four days .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 32]: It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank , adding : ` But you 'll go down to-morrow , ma'am , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 11]: You 'll go down just as if I was there .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 9]: It will make no difference to you . '
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 22]: ` Pray , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , reproachfully , ` let me beg you not to say that .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 21]: Your absence will make a vast difference to me , sir , as I think you very well know . '
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 27]: ` Well , ma'am , then you must get on in my absence as well as you can , ' said Mr. Bounderby , not displeased .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 60]: ` Mr. Bounderby , ' retorted Mrs. Sparsit , ` your will is to me a law , sir ; otherwise , it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands , not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me , as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 9]: But you shall say no more , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 9]: I will go , upon your invitation . '
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 32]: ` Why , when I invite you to my house , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , opening his eyes , ' I should hope you want no other invitation . '
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 18]: ` No , indeed , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ' I should hope not .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 6]: Say no more , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 13]: I would , sir , I could see you gay again . '
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 9]: ` What do you mean , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 3]: blustered Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 23]: ` Sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ` there was wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 6]: Be buoyant , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 52]: Mr. Bounderby , under the influence of this difficult adjuration , backed up by her compassionate eye , could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner , and afterwards assert himself at a distance , by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 60]: ` Bitzer , ' said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon , when her patron was gone on his journey , and the Bank was closing , ` present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas , and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup , with a glass of India ale ? '
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 23]: Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way , returned a gracious answer , and followed on its heels .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 25]: ` Mr. Thomas , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` these plain viands being on table , I thought you might be tempted . '
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 13]: ` Thank ` ee , Mrs. Sparsit , ' said the whelp .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 5]: And gloomily fell to .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 10]: ` How is Mr. Harthouse , Mr. Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 12]: ` Oh , he 's all right , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 9]: ` Where may he be at present ? '
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 22]: Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner , after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 11]: ` He is shooting in Yorkshire , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 15]: ` Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church , yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 27]: ` The kind of gentleman , now , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , sweetly , ` whom one might wager to be a good shot ! '
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 7]: ` Crack , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 32]: He had long been a down-looking young fellow , but this characteristic had so increased of late , that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 17]: Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks , if she were so inclined .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 24]: ` Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` as indeed he is of most people .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 13]: May we expect to see him again shortly , Mr. Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 15]: ` Why , I expect to see him to-morrow , ' returned the whelp .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 5]: ` Good news ! '
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 7]: cried Mrs. Sparsit , blandly . '
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 36]: I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here , ' said Tom , ` and I am going to dine with him afterwards , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 20]: He is not coming down to the country house for a week or so , being due somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 27]: At least , he says so ; but I should n't wonder if he was to stop here over Sunday , and stray that way . '
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 6]: ` Which reminds me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 4]: said Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 23]: ` Would you remember a message to your sister , Mr. Tom , if I was to charge you with one ? '
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 3]: ` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 20]: I 'll try , ' returned the reluctant whelp , ` if it is n't a long un . '
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 43]: ` It is merely my respectful compliments , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` and I fear I may not trouble her with my society this week ; being still a little nervous , and better perhaps by my poor self . '
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 39]: If that 's all , ' observed Tom , ` it would n't much matter , even if I was to forget it , for Loo 's not likely to think of you unless she sees you . '
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 41]: Having paid for his entertainment with this agreeable compliment , he relapsed into a hangdog silence until there was no more India ale left , when he said , ` Well , Mrs. Sparsit , I must be off ! '
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 4]: and went off .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 57]: Next day , Saturday , Mrs. Sparsit sat at her window all day long looking at the customers coming in and out , watching the postmen , keeping an eye on the general traffic of the street , revolving many things in her mind , but , above all , keeping her attention on her staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 65]: The evening come , she put on her bonnet and shawl , and went quietly out : having her reasons for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a passenger would arrive from Yorkshire , and for preferring to peep into it round pillars and corners , and out of ladies ' waiting-room windows , to appearing in its precincts openly .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 15]: Tom was in attendance , and loitered about until the expected train came in .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 6]: It brought no Mr. Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 30]: Tom waited until the crowd had dispersed , and the bustle was over ; and then referred to a posted list of trains , and took counsel with porters .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 70]: That done , he strolled away idly , stopping in the street and looking up it and down it , and lifting his hat off and putting it on again , and yawning and stretching himself , and exhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who had still to wait until the next train should come in , an hour and forty minutes hence .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 31]: ` This is a device to keep him out of the way , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , starting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 9]: ` Harthouse is with his sister now ! '
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 22]: It was the conception of an inspired moment , and she shot off with her utmost swiftness to work it out .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 89]: The station for the country house was at the opposite end of the town , the time was short , the road not easy ; but she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach , so quick in darting out of it , producing her money , seizing her ticket , and diving into the train , that she was borne along the arches spanning the land of coal-pits past and present , as if she had been caught up in a cloud and whirled away .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 61]: All the journey , immovable in the air though never left behind ; plain to the dark eyes of her mind , as the electric wires which ruled a colossal strip of music-paper out of the evening sky , were plain to the dark eyes of her body ; Mrs. Sparsit saw her staircase , with the figure coming down .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 6]: Very near the bottom now .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 7]: Upon the brink of the abyss .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 54]: An overcast September evening , just at nightfall , saw beneath its drooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage , pass down the wooden steps of the little station into a stony road , cross it into a green lane , and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 51]: One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests , and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her , and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet , were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she very softly closed a gate .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 26]: She went up to the house , keeping within the shrubbery , and went round it , peeping between the leaves at the lower windows .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 27]: Most of them were open , as they usually were in such warm weather , but there were no lights yet , and all was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 9]: She tried the garden with no better effect .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 34]: She thought of the wood , and stole towards it , heedless of long grass and briers : of worms , snails , and slugs , and all the creeping things that be .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 49]: With her dark eyes and her hook nose warily in advance of her , Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her way through the thick undergrowth , so intent upon her object that she probably would have done no less , if the wood had been a wood of adders .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 30]: The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests , fascinated by the glittering of Mrs. Sparsit 's eyes in the gloom , as she stopped and listened .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 6]: Low voices close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 5]: His voice and hers .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 11]: The appointment was a device to keep the brother away !
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 10]: There they were yonder , by the felled tree .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 14]: Bending low among the dewy grass , Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer to them .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 43]: She drew herself up , and stood behind a tree , like Robinson Crusoe in his ambuscade against the savages ; so near to them that at a spring , and that no great one , she could have touched them both .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 14]: He was there secretly , and had not shown himself at the house .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 33]: He had come on horseback , and must have passed through the neighbouring fields ; for his horse was tied to the meadow side of the fence , within a few paces .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 15]: ` My dearest love , ' said he , ` what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 15]: Knowing you were alone , was it possible that I could stay away ? '
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 51]: ` You may hang your head , to make yourself the more attractive ; I do n't know what they see in you when you hold it up , ' thought Mrs. Sparsit ; ` but you little think , my dearest love , whose eyes are on you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 9]: That she hung her head , was certain .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 27]: She urged him to go away , she commanded him to go away ; but she neither turned her face to him , nor raised it .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 28]: Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit , at any period in her life .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 24]: Her hands rested in one another , like the hands of a statue ; and even her manner of speaking was not hurried .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 34]: ` My dear child , ' said Harthouse ; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his arm embraced her ; ` will you not bear with my society for a little while ? '
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 5]: ` Not here . '
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 5]: ` Where , Louisa ?
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 5]: ` Not here . '
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 29]: ` But we have so little time to make so much of , and I have come so far , and am altogether so devoted , and distracted .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 15]: There never was a slave at once so devoted and ill-used by his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 26]: To look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life , and to be received in your frozen manner , is heart-rending . '
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 17]: ` Am I to say again , that I must be left to myself here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 10]: ` But we must meet , my dear Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 6]: Where shall we meet ? '
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 4]: They both started .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 19]: The listener started , guiltily , too ; for she thought there was another listener among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 14]: It was only rain , beginning to fall fast , in heavy drops .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 30]: ` Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence , innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 58]: ` Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed ; though I am the most unfortunate fellow in the world , I believe , to have been insensible to all other women , and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of the most beautiful , and the most engaging , and the most imperious .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 24]: My dearest Louisa , I can not go myself , or let you go , in this hard abuse of your power . '
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 56]: Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm , and heard him then and there , within her -LRB- Mrs. Sparsit 's -RRB- greedy hearing , tell her how he loved her , and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to play away all that he had in life .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 36]: The objects he had lately pursued , turned worthless beside her ; such success as was almost in his grasp , he flung away from him like the dirt it was , compared with her .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 110]: Its pursuit , nevertheless , if it kept him near her , or its renunciation if it took him from her , or flight if she shared it , or secrecy if she commanded it , or any fate , or every fate , all was alike to him , so that she was true to him , -- the man who had seen how cast away she was , whom she had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration , an interest , of which he had thought himself incapable , whom she had received into her confidence , who was devoted to her and adored her .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 106]: All this , and more , in his hurry , and in hers , in the whirl of her own gratified malice , in the dread of being discovered , in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy rain among the leaves , and a thunderstorm rolling up -- Mrs. Sparsit received into her mind , set off with such an unavoidable halo of confusion and indistinctness , that when at length he climbed the fence and led his horse away , she was not sure where they were to meet , or when , except that they had said it was to be that night .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 23]: But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her ; and while she tracked that one she must be right .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 23]: ` Oh , my dearest love , ' thought Mrs. Sparsit , ` you little think how well attended you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 16]: Mrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood , and saw her enter the house .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 5]: What to do next ?
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 10]: It rained now , in a sheet of water .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 49]: Mrs. Sparsit 's white stockings were of many colours , green predominating ; prickly things were in her shoes ; caterpillars slung themselves , in hammocks of their own making , from various parts of her dress ; rills ran from her bonnet , and her Roman nose .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 19]: In such condition , Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the density of the shrubbery , considering what next ?
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 9]: Lo , Louisa coming out of the house !
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 9]: Hastily cloaked and muffled , and stealing away .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 3]: She elopes !
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 15]: She falls from the lowermost stair , and is swallowed up in the gulf .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 23]: Indifferent to the rain , and moving with a quick determined step , she struck into a side-path parallel with the ride .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 34]: Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees , at but a short distance ; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 14]: When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise , Mrs. Sparsit stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 10]: When she went on , Mrs. Sparsit went on .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 30]: She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come , emerged from the green lane , crossed the stony road , and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 25]: A train for Coketown would come through presently , Mrs. Sparsit knew ; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 48]: In Mrs. Sparsit 's limp and streaming state , no extensive precautions were necessary to change her usual appearance ; but , she stopped under the lee of the station wall , tumbled her shawl into a new shape , and put it on over her bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 26]: So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when she followed up the railroad steps , and paid her money in the small office .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 7]: Louisa sat waiting in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 8]: Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 31]: Both listened to the thunder , which was loud , and to the rain , as it washed off the roof , and pattered on the parapets of the arches .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 29]: Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out ; so , both saw the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron tracks .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 24]: The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling , gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart , announced the train .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 46]: Fire and steam , and smoke , and red light ; a hiss , a crash , a bell , and a shriek ; Louisa put into one carriage , Mrs. Sparsit put into another : the little station a desert speck in the thunderstorm .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 17]: Though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold , Mrs. Sparsit exulted hugely .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 22]: The figure had plunged down the precipice , and she felt herself , as it were , attending on the body .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 22]: Could she , who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph , do less than exult ?
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 24]: ` She will be at Coketown long before him , ' thought Mrs. Sparsit , ` though his horse is never so good .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 7]: Where will she wait for him ?
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 7]: And where will they go together ?
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 2]: Patience .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 5]: We shall see . '
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 15]: The tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion , when the train stopped at its destination .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 16]: Gutters and pipes had burst , drains had overflowed , and streets were under water .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 24]: In the first instant of alighting , Mrs. Sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches , which were in great request .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 23]: ` She will get into one , ' she considered , ` and will be away before I can follow in another .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 24]: At all risks of being run over , I must see the number , and hear the order given to the coachman . '
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 10]: But , Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 11]: Louisa got into no coach , and was already gone .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 21]: The black eyes kept upon the railroad-carriage in which she had travelled , settled upon it a moment too late .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 28]: The door not being opened after several minutes , Mrs. Sparsit passed it and repassed it , saw nothing , looked in , and found it empty .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 108]: Wet through and through : with her feet squelching and squashing in her shoes whenever she moved ; with a rash of rain upon her classical visage ; with a bonnet like an over-ripe fig ; with all her clothes spoiled ; with damp impressions of every button , string , and hook-and-eye she wore , printed off upon her highly connected back ; with a stagnant verdure on her general exterior , such as accumulates on an old park fence in a mouldy lane ; Mrs. Sparsit had no resource but to burst into tears of bitterness and say , ' I have lost her ! '
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 38]: Chapter XII -- Down THE national dustmen , after entertaining one another with a great many noisy little fights among themselves , had dispersed for the present , and Mr. Gradgrind was at home for the vacation .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 32]: He sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock , proving something no doubt -- probably , in the main , that the Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 35]: The noise of the rain did not disturb him much ; but it attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head sometimes , as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 28]: When it thundered very loudly , he glanced towards Coketown , having it in his mind that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 25]: The thunder was rolling into distance , and the rain was pouring down like a deluge , when the door of his room opened .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 19]: He looked round the lamp upon his table , and saw , with amazement , his eldest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 4]: ` Louisa ! '
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 11]: ` Father , I want to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 6]: ` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 5]: How strange you look !
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 25]: And good Heaven , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , wondering more and more , ` have you come here exposed to this storm ? '
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 14]: She put her hands to her dress , as if she hardly knew .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 40]: Then she uncovered her head , and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might , stood looking at him : so colourless , so dishevelled , so defiant and despairing , that he was afraid of her .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 5]: ` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 14]: I conjure you , Louisa , tell me what is the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 17]: She dropped into a chair before him , and put her cold hand on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 12]: ` Father , you have trained me from my cradle ? '
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 7]: ` Yes , Louisa . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 15]: I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny . '
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 17]: He looked at her in doubt and dread , vacantly repeating : ` Curse the hour ?
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 5]: Curse the hour ? '
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 26]: ` How could you give me life , and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death ?
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 8]: Where are the graces of my soul ?
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 8]: Where are the sentiments of my heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 29]: What have you done , O father , what have you done , with the garden that should have bloomed once , in this great wilderness here ! '
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 11]: She struck herself with both her hands upon her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 24]: ` If it had ever been here , its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 24]: I did not mean to say this ; but , father , you remember the last time we conversed in this room ? '
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 26]: He had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now , that it was with difficulty he answered , ` Yes , Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 27]: ` What has risen to my lips now , would have risen to my lips then , if you had given me a moment 's help .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 8]: I do n't reproach you , father .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 18]: What you have never nurtured in me , you have never nurtured in yourself ; but O !
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 33]: if you had only done so long ago , or if you had only neglected me , what a much better and much happier creature I should have been this day ! '
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 20]: On hearing this , after all his care , he bowed his head upon his hand and groaned aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 109]: ` Father , if you had known , when we were last together here , what even I feared while I strove against it -- as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart ; if you had known that there lingered in my breast , sensibilities , affections , weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength , defying all the calculations ever made by man , and no more known to his arithmetic than his Creator is , -- would you have given me to the husband whom I am now sure that I hate ? '
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 6]: He said , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 7]: No , my poor child . '
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 23]: ` Would you have doomed me , at any time , to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me ?
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 84]: Would you have robbed me -- for no one 's enrichment -- only for the greater desolation of this world -- of the immaterial part of my life , the spring and summer of my belief , my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me , my school in which I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them , and to hope in my little sphere to make them better ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 5]: O no , no .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 5]: No , Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 85]: ` Yet , father , if I had been stone blind ; if I had groped my way by my sense of touch , and had been free , while I knew the shapes and surfaces of things , to exercise my fancy somewhat , in regard to them ; I should have been a million times wiser , happier , more loving , more contented , more innocent and human in all good respects , than I am with the eyes I have .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 11]: Now , hear what I have come to say . '
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 10]: He moved , to support her with his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 27]: She rising as he did so , they stood close together : she , with a hand upon his shoulder , looking fixedly in his face .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 54]: ` With a hunger and thirst upon me , father , which have never been for a moment appeased ; with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules , and figures , and definitions were not quite absolute ; I have grown up , battling every inch of my way . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 11]: I never knew you were unhappy , my child . '
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 8]: ` Father , I always knew it .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 16]: In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 53]: What I have learned has left me doubting , misbelieving , despising , regretting , what I have not learned ; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by , and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest . '
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 9]: ` And you so young , Louisa ! '
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 5]: he said with pity .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 6]: ` And I so young .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 36]: In this condition , father -- for I show you now , without fear or favour , the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it -- you proposed my husband to me .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 4]: I took him .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 14]: I never made a pretence to him or you that I loved him .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 19]: I knew , and , father , you knew , and he knew , that I never did .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 19]: I was not wholly indifferent , for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 19]: I made that wild escape into something visionary , and have slowly found out how wild it was .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 29]: But Tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life ; perhaps he became so because I knew so well how to pity him .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 20]: It matters little now , except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors . '
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 30]: As her father held her in his arms , she put her other hand upon his other shoulder , and still looking fixedly in his face , went on .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 74]: ` When I was irrevocably married , there rose up into rebellion against the tie , the old strife , made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures , and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me , father , until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul . '
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 4]: ` Louisa ! '
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 22]: he said , and said imploringly ; for he well remembered what had passed between them in their former interview . '
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 13]: I do not reproach you , father , I make no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 8]: I am here with another object . '
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 8]: ` What can I do , child ?
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 8]: Ask me what you will . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 6]: I am coming to it .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 82]: Father , chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance ; a man such as I had had no experience of ; used to the world ; light , polished , easy ; making no pretences ; avowing the low estimate of everything , that I was half afraid to form in secret ; conveying to me almost immediately , though I do n't know how or by what degrees , that he understood me , and read my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 11]: I could not find that he was worse than I .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 10]: There seemed to be a near affinity between us .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 24]: I only wondered it should be worth his while , who cared for nothing else , to care so much for me . '
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 7]: ` For you , Louisa ! '
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 33]: Her father might instinctively have loosened his hold , but that he felt her strength departing from her , and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes steadfastly regarding him . '
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 11]: I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 9]: It matters very little how he gained it .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 7]: Father , he did gain it .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 19]: What you know of the story of my marriage , he soon knew , just as well . '
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 18]: Her father 's face was ashy white , and he held her in both his arms . '
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 12]: I have done no worse , I have not disgraced you .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 29]: But if you ask me whether I have loved him , or do love him , I tell you plainly , father , that it may be so .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 54]: She took her hands suddenly from his shoulders , and pressed them both upon her side ; while in her face , not like itself -- and in her figure , drawn up , resolute to finish by a last effort what she had to say -- the feelings long suppressed broke loose .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 20]: ` This night , my husband being away , he has been with me , declaring himself my lover .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 19]: This minute he expects me , for I could release myself of his presence by no other means .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 31]: I do not know that I am sorry , I do not know that I am ashamed , I do not know that I am degraded in my own esteem .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 16]: All that I know is , your philosophy and your teaching will not save me .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 11]: Now , father , you have brought me to this .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 8]: Save me by some other means ! '
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 32]: He tightened his hold in time to prevent her sinking on the floor , but she cried out in a terrible voice , ' I shall die if you hold me !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 8]: Let me fall upon the ground ! '
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 31]: And he laid her down there , and saw the pride of his heart and the triumph of his system , lying , an insensible heap , at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 39]: End of the Second Book Book the Third -- Garnering Chapter I -- Another Thing Needful LOUISA awoke from a torpor , and her eyes languidly opened on her old bed at home , and her old room .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 51]: It seemed , at first , as if all that had happened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the shadows of a dream , but gradually , as the objects became more real to her sight , the events became more real to her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 24]: She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness , her eyes were strained and sore , and she was very weak .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 29]: A curious passive inattention had such possession of her , that the presence of her little sister in the room did not attract her notice for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 49]: Even when their eyes had met , and her sister had approached the bed , Louisa lay for minutes looking at her in silence , and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand , before she asked : ` When was I brought to this room ? '
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 7]: ` Last night , Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 7]: ` Who brought me here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 7]: ` Sissy , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 8]: ` Why do you believe so ? '
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 9]: ` Because I found her here this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 24]: She did n't come to my bedside to wake me , as she always does ; and I went to look for her .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 34]: She was not in her own room either ; and I went looking for her all over the house , until I found her here taking care of you and cooling your head .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 5]: Will you see father ?
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 12]: Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke . '
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 11]: ` What a beaming face you have , Jane ! '
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 17]: said Louisa , as her young sister -- timidly still -- bent down to kiss her .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 4]: ` Have I ?
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 8]: I am very glad you think so .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 11]: I am sure it must be Sissy 's doing . '
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 14]: The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck , unbent itself .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 10]: ` You can tell father if you will . '
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 31]: Then , staying her for a moment , she said , ` It was you who made my room so cheerful , and gave it this look of welcome ? '
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 13]: ` Oh no , Louisa , it was done before I came .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 15]: It was -- ' Louisa turned upon her pillow , and heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 30]: When her sister had withdrawn , she turned her head back again , and lay with her face towards the door , until it opened and her father entered .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 20]: He had a jaded anxious look upon him , and his hand , usually steady , trembled in hers .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 37]: He sat down at the side of the bed , tenderly asking how she was , and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet after her agitation and exposure to the weather last night .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 26]: He spoke in a subdued and troubled voice , very different from his usual dictatorial manner ; and was often at a loss for words .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 5]: ` My dear Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 5]: My poor daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 16]: He was so much at a loss at that place , that he stopped altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 4]: He tried again .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 6]: ` My unfortunate child . '
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 14]: The place was so difficult to get over , that he tried again .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 33]: ` It would be hopeless for me , Louisa , to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed I have been , and still am , by what broke upon me last night .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 15]: The ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 32]: The only support on which I leaned , and the strength of which it seemed , and still does seem , impossible to question , has given way in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 7]: I am stunned by these discoveries .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 30]: I have no selfish meaning in what I say ; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last night , to be very heavy indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 8]: She could give him no comfort herein .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 14]: She had suffered the wreck of her whole life upon the rock . '
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 40]: I will not say , Louisa , that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago , it would have been better for us both ; better for your peace , and better for mine .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 23]: For I am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 27]: I had proved my -- my system to myself , and I have rigidly administered it ; and I must bear the responsibility of its failures .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 20]: I only entreat you to believe , my favourite child , that I have meant to do right . '
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 13]: He said it earnestly , and to do him justice he had .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 30]: In gauging fathomless deeps with his little mean excise-rod , and in staggering over the universe with his rusty stiff-legged compasses , he had meant to do great things .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 34]: Within the limits of his short tether he had tumbled about , annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of purpose than many of the blatant personages whose company he kept . '
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 11]: I am well assured of what you say , father .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 9]: I know I have been your favourite child .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 10]: I know you have intended to make me happy .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 12]: I have never blamed you , and I never shall . '
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 12]: He took her outstretched hand , and retained it in his .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 26]: ` My dear , I have remained all night at my table , pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 57]: When I consider your character ; when I consider that what has been known to me for hours , has been concealed by you for years ; when I consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last ; I come to the conclusion that I can not but mistrust myself . '
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 18]: He might have added more than all , when he saw the face now looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 23]: He did add it in effect , perhaps , as he softly moved her scattered hair from her forehead with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 29]: Such little actions , slight in another man , were very noticeable in him ; and his daughter received them as if they had been words of contrition .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 50]: ` But , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , slowly , and with hesitation , as well as with a wretched sense of happiness , ` if I see reason to mistrust myself for the past , Louisa , I should also mistrust myself for the present and the future .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 9]: To speak unreservedly to you , I do .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 84]: I am far from feeling convinced now , however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday , that I am fit for the trust you repose in me ; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me ; that I have the right instinct -- supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature -- how to help you , and to set you right , my child . '
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 24]: She had turned upon her pillow , and lay with her face upon her arm , so that he could not see it .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 19]: All her wildness and passion had subsided ; but , though softened , she was not in tears .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 24]: Her father was changed in nothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to see her in tears .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 32]: ` Some persons hold , ' he pursued , still hesitating , ` that there is a wisdom of the Head , and that there is a wisdom of the Heart .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 18]: I have not supposed so ; but , as I have said , I mistrust myself now .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 9]: I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 17]: It may not be all-sufficient ; how can I venture this morning to say it is !
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 43]: If that other kind of wisdom should be what I have neglected , and should be the instinct that is wanted , Louisa -- ' He suggested it very doubtfully , as if he were half unwilling to admit it even now .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 32]: She made him no answer , lying before him on her bed , still half-dressed , much as he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last night .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 78]: ` Louisa , ' and his hand rested on her hair again , ' I have been absent from here , my dear , a good deal of late ; and though your sister 's training has been pursued according to -- the system , ' he appeared to come to that word with great reluctance always , ` it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun , in her case , at an early age .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 20]: I ask you -- ignorantly and humbly , my daughter -- for the better , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 61]: ` Father , ' she replied , without stirring , ` if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord , let her thank Heaven for it , and go upon her happier way , taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 8]: O my child , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 19]: he said , in a forlorn manner , ' I am an unhappy man to see you thus !
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 20]: What avails it to me that you do not reproach me , if I so bitterly reproach myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 11]: He bent his head , and spoke low to her .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 47]: ` Louisa , I have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house , by mere love and gratitude : that what the Head had left undone and could not do , the Heart may have been doing silently .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 6]: Can it be so ? '
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 7]: She made him no reply . '
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 11]: I am not too proud to believe it , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 11]: How could I be arrogant , and you before me !
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 5]: Can it be so ?
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 8]: Is it so , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 22]: He looked upon her once more , lying cast away there ; and without another word went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 26]: He had not been long gone , when she heard a light tread near the door , and knew that some one stood beside her .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 7]: She did not raise her head .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 35]: A dull anger that she should be seen in her distress , and that the involuntary look she had so resented should come to this fulfilment , smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 8]: All closely imprisoned forces rend and destroy .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 30]: The air that would be healthful to the earth , the water that would enrich it , the heat that would ripen it , tear it when caged up .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 30]: So in her bosom even now ; the strongest qualities she possessed , long turned upon themselves , became a heap of obduracy , that rose against a friend .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 24]: It was well that soft touch came upon her neck , and that she understood herself to be supposed to have fallen asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 9]: The sympathetic hand did not claim her resentment .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 9]: Let it lie there , let it lie .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 17]: It lay there , warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts ; and she rested .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 24]: As she softened with the quiet , and the consciousness of being so watched , some tears made their way into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 23]: The face touched hers , and she knew that there were tears upon it too , and she the cause of them .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 24]: As Louisa feigned to rouse herself , and sat up , Sissy retired , so that she stood placidly near the bedside . '
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 8]: I hope I have not disturbed you .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 15]: I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 8]: ` Why should you stay with me ?
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 6]: My sister will miss you .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 7]: You are everything to her . '
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 5]: ` Am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 8]: returned Sissy , shaking her head . '
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 12]: I would be something to you , if I might . '
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 6]: said Louisa , almost sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 12]: ` Whatever you want most , if I could be that .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 18]: At all events , I would like to try to be as near it as I can .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 15]: And however far off that may be , I will never tire of trying .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 6]: Will you let me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 10]: ` My father sent you to ask me . '
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 8]: ` No indeed , ' replied Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 32]: ` He told me that I might come in now , but he sent me away from the room this morning -- or at least -- ' She hesitated and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 7]: ` At least , what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 11]: said Louisa , with her searching eyes upon her . '
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 27]: I thought it best myself that I should be sent away , for I felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here . '
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 11]: ` Have I always hated you so much ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 21]: I hope not , for I have always loved you , and have always wished that you should know it .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 14]: But you changed to me a little , shortly before you left home .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: Not that I wondered at it .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 44]: You knew so much , and I knew so little , and it was so natural in many ways , going as you were among other friends , that I had nothing to complain of , and was not at all hurt . '
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 11]: Her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 12]: Louisa understood the loving pretence , and her heart smote her .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 6]: ` May I try ? '
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 18]: said Sissy , emboldened to raise her hand to the neck that was insensibly drooping towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 37]: Louisa , taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another moment , held it in one of hers , and answered : ` First , Sissy , do you know what I am ?
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 36]: I am so proud and so hardened , so confused and troubled , so resentful and unjust to every one and to myself , that everything is stormy , dark , and wicked to me .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 7]: Does not that repel you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 5]: ` No ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 79]: I am so unhappy , and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid waste , that if I had been bereft of sense to this hour , and instead of being as learned as you think me , had to begin to acquire the simplest truths , I could not want a guide to peace , contentment , honour , all the good of which I am quite devoid , more abjectly than I do .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 7]: Does not that repel you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 34]: In the innocence of her brave affection , and the brimming up of her old devoted spirit , the once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon the darkness of the other .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 16]: Louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow there .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 21]: She fell upon her knees , and clinging to this stroller 's child looked up at her almost with veneration .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 10]: ` Forgive me , pity me , help me !
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 22]: Have compassion on my great need , and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 6]: O lay it here ! '
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 3]: cried Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 9]: ` Lay it here , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 56]: Chapter II -- Very Ridiculous Mr. James Harthouse passed a whole night and a day in a state of so much hurry , that the World , with its best glass in his eye , would scarcely have recognized him during that insane interval , as the brother Jem of the honourable and jocular member .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 5]: He was positively agitated .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 14]: He several times spoke with an emphasis , similar to the vulgar manner .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 18]: He went in and went out in an unaccountable way , like a man without an object .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 6]: He rode like a highwayman .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 29]: In a word , he was so horribly bored by existing circumstances , that he forgot to go in for boredom in the manner prescribed by the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 66]: After putting his horse at Coketown through the storm , as if it were a leap , he waited up all night : from time to time ringing his bell with the greatest fury , charging the porter who kept watch with delinquency in withholding letters or messages that could not fail to have been entrusted to him , and demanding restitution on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 30]: The dawn coming , the morning coming , and the day coming , and neither message nor letter coming with either , he went down to the country house .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 16]: There , the report was , Mr. Bounderby away , and Mrs. Bounderby in town .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 7]: Left for town suddenly last evening .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 24]: Not even known to be gone until receipt of message , importing that her return was not to be expected for the present .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 15]: In these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her to town .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 8]: He went to the house in town .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 5]: Mrs. Bounderby not there .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 7]: He looked in at the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 8]: Mr. Bounderby away and Mrs. Sparsit away .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 4]: Mrs. Sparsit away ?
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 15]: Who could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of that griffin !
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 20]: I do n't know , ' said Tom , who had his own reasons for being uneasy about it .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 10]: ` She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 11]: She 's always full of mystery ; I hate her .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 19]: So I do that white chap ; he 's always got his blinking eyes upon a fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 10]: ` Where were you last night , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 8]: ` Where was I last night ! '
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 4]: I like that .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 22]: I was waiting for you , Mr. Harthouse , till it came down as I never saw it come down before .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 5]: Where was I too !
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 9]: Where were you , you mean . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 9]: I was prevented from coming -- detained . '
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 4]: ` Detained ! '
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 3]: murmured Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 7]: ` Two of us were detained .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 16]: I was detained looking for you , till I lost every train but the mail .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 26]: It would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night , and have to walk home through a pond .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 11]: I was obliged to sleep in town after all . '
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 3]: ` Where ?
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 11]: Why , in my own bed at Bounderby 's . '
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 8]: ` Did you see your sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 25]: ` How the deuce , ' returned Tom , staring , ` could I see my sister when she was fifteen miles off ? '
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 44]: Cursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he was so true a friend , Mr. Harthouse disembarrassed himself of that interview with the smallest conceivable amount of ceremony , and debated for the hundredth time what all this could mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 7]: He made only one thing clear .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 64]: It was , that whether she was in town or out of town , whether he had been premature with her who was so hard to comprehend , or she had lost courage , or they were discovered , or some mischance or mistake , at present incomprehensible , had occurred , he must remain to confront his fortune , whatever it was .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 25]: The hotel where he was known to live when condemned to that region of blackness , was the stake to which he was tied .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 13]: As to all the rest -- What will be , will be .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 59]: ` So , whether I am waiting for a hostile message , or an assignation , or a penitent remonstrance , or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby in the Lancashire manner -- which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs -- I 'll dine , ' said Mr. James Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 35]: ` Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight ; and if anything of a British nature is to come off between us , it may be as well to be in training . '
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 40]: Therefore he rang the bell , and tossing himself negligently on a sofa , ordered ` Some dinner at six -- with a beefsteak in it , ' and got through the intervening time as well as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 37]: That was not particularly well ; for he remained in the greatest perplexity , and , as the hours went on , and no kind of explanation offered itself , his perplexity augmented at compound interest .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 30]: However , he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do , and entertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than once .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 27]: ` It would n't be bad , ' he yawned at one time , ` to give the waiter five shillings , and throw him . '
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 26]: At another time it occurred to him , ` Or a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone might be hired by the hour . '
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 26]: But these jests did not tell materially on the afternoon , or his suspense ; and , sooth to say , they both lagged fearfully .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 45]: It was impossible , even before dinner , to avoid often walking about in the pattern of the carpet , looking out of the window , listening at the door for footsteps , and occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps approached that room .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 47]: But , after dinner , when the day turned to twilight , and the twilight turned to night , and still no communication was made to him , it began to be as he expressed it , ` like the Holy Office and slow torture . '
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 35]: However , still true to his conviction that indifference was the genuine high-breeding -LRB- the only conviction he had -RRB- , he seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 37]: He had been trying in vain , for half an hour , to read this newspaper , when the waiter appeared and said , at once mysteriously and apologetically : ` Beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 11]: You 're wanted , sir , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 42]: A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to the swell mob , caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return , with bristling indignation , what the Devil he meant by ` wanted ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 7]: ` Beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 12]: Young lady outside , sir , wishes to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 3]: ` Outside ?
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 3]: Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 8]: ` Outside this door , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 25]: Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned , as a block-head duly qualified for that consignment , Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 11]: A young woman whom he had never seen stood there .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 9]: Plainly dressed , very quiet , very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 36]: As he conducted her into the room and placed a chair for her , he observed , by the light of the candles , that she was even prettier than he had at first believed .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 13]: Her face was innocent and youthful , and its expression remarkably pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 38]: She was not afraid of him , or in any way disconcerted ; she seemed to have her mind entirely preoccupied with the occasion of her visit , and to have substituted that consideration for herself . '
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 7]: I speak to Mr. Harthouse ? '
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 8]: she said , when they were alone .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 6]: ` To Mr. Harthouse . '
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 36]: He added in his mind , ` And you speak to him with the most confiding eyes I ever saw , and the most earnest voice -LRB- though so quiet -RRB- I ever heard . '
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 74]: ` If I do not understand -- and I do not , sir ' -- said Sissy , ` what your honour as a gentleman binds you to , in other matters : ' the blood really rose in his face as she began in these words : ' I am sure I may rely upon it to keep my visit secret , and to keep secret what I am going to say .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 28]: I will rely upon it , if you will tell me I may so far trust -- ' ` You may , I assure you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 16]: I am young , as you see ; I am alone , as you see .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 19]: In coming to you , sir , I have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope . '
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 22]: He thought , ` But that is very strong , ' as he followed the momentary upward glance of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 12]: He thought besides , ` This is a very odd beginning .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 11]: I do n't see where we are going . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 20]: I think , ' said Sissy , ` you have already guessed whom I left just now ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 34]: I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four-and-twenty hours -LRB- which have appeared as many years -RRB- , ' he returned , ` on a lady 's account .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 25]: The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady , do not deceive me , I trust . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 8]: I left her within an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 5]: ` At -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 7]: ` At her father 's . '
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 16]: Mr. Harthouse 's face lengthened in spite of his coolness , and his perplexity increased .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 19]: ` Then I certainly , ' he thought , ` do not see where we are going . '
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 7]: ` She hurried there last night .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 15]: She arrived there in great agitation , and was insensible all through the night .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 12]: I live at her father 's , and was with her .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 20]: You may be sure , sir , you will never see her again as long as you live . '
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 36]: Mr. Harthouse drew a long breath ; and , if ever man found himself in the position of not knowing what to say , made the discovery beyond all question that he was so circumstanced .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 94]: The child-like ingenuousness with which his visitor spoke , her modest fearlessness , her truthfulness which put all artifice aside , her entire forgetfulness of herself in her earnest quiet holding to the object with which she had come ; all this , together with her reliance on his easily given promise -- which in itself shamed him -- presented something in which he was so inexperienced , and against which he knew any of his usual weapons would fall so powerless ; that not a word could he rally to his relief .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 28]: At last he said : ` So startling an announcement , so confidently made , and by such lips , is really disconcerting in the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 32]: May I be permitted to inquire , if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words , by the lady of whom we speak ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 8]: I have no charge from her . '
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 9]: ` The drowning man catches at the straw .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 44]: With no disrespect for your judgment , and with no doubt of your sincerity , excuse my saying that I cling to the belief that there is yet hope that I am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady 's presence . '
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 8]: ` There is not the least hope .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 48]: The first object of my coming here , sir , is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again , than there would be if she had died when she came home last night . '
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 4]: ` Must believe ?
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 30]: But if I ca n't -- or if I should , by infirmity of nature , be obstinate -- and wo n't -- ' ` It is still true .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 6]: There is no hope . '
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 30]: James Harthouse looked at her with an incredulous smile upon his lips ; but her mind looked over and beyond him , and the smile was quite thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 13]: He bit his lip , and took a little time for consideration .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 42]: If it should unhappily appear , ' he said , ` after due pains and duty on my part , that I am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment , I shall not become the lady 's persecutor .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 12]: But you said you had no commission from her ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 17]: I have only the commission of my love for her , and her love for me .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 27]: I have no other trust , than that I have been with her since she came home , and that she has given me her confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 18]: I have no further trust , than that I know something of her character and her marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 13]: O Mr. Harthouse , I think you had that trust too ! '
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 44]: He was touched in the cavity where his heart should have been -- in that nest of addled eggs , where the birds of heaven would have lived if they had not been whistled away -- by the fervour of this reproach . '
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 30]: I am not a moral sort of fellow , ' he said , ` and I never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 8]: I am as immoral as need be .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 140]: At the same time , in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation , or in unfortunately compromising her in any way , or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her , not perfectly reconcilable with -- in fact with -- the domestic hearth ; or in taking any advantage of her father 's being a machine , or of her brother 's being a whelp , or of her husband 's being a bear ; I beg to be allowed to assure you that I have had no particularly evil intentions , but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical , that I had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until I began to turn it over .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 23]: Whereas I find , ' said Mr. James Harthouse , in conclusion , ` that it is really in several volumes . '
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 27]: Though he said all this in his frivolous way , the way seemed , for that once , a conscious polishing of but an ugly surface .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 30]: He was silent for a moment ; and then proceeded with a more self-possessed air , though with traces of vexation and disappointment that would not be polished out .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 78]: ` After what has been just now represented to me , in a manner I find it impossible to doubt -- I know of hardly any other source from which I could have accepted it so readily -- I feel bound to say to you , in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed , that I can not refuse to contemplate the possibility -LRB- however unexpected -RRB- of my seeing the lady no more .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 65]: I am solely to blame for the thing having come to this -- and -- and , I can not say , ' he added , rather hard up for a general peroration , ` that I have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow , or that I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever . '
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 14]: Sissy 's face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him was not finished .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 23]: ` You spoke , ' he resumed , as she raised her eyes to him again , ` of your first object .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 13]: I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned ? '
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 10]: ` Will you oblige me by confiding it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 60]: ` Mr. Harthouse , ' returned Sissy , with a blending of gentleness and steadiness that quite defeated him , and with a simple confidence in his being bound to do what she required , that held him at a singular disadvantage , ` the only reparation that remains with you , is to leave here immediately and finally .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 20]: I am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 20]: I am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 25]: I do not say that it is much , or that it is enough ; but it is something , and it is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 47]: Therefore , though without any other authority than I have given you , and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself , I ask you to depart from this place to-night , under an obligation never to return to it . '
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 83]: If she had asserted any influence over him beyond her plain faith in the truth and right of what she said ; if she had concealed the least doubt or irresolution , or had harboured for the best purpose any reserve or pretence ; if she had shown , or felt , the lightest trace of any sensitiveness to his ridicule or his astonishment , or any remonstrance he might offer ; he would have carried it against her at this point .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 21]: But he could as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise , as affect her .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 23]: ` But do you know , ' he asked , quite at a loss , ` the extent of what you ask ?
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 46]: You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business , preposterous enough in itself , but which I have gone in for , and sworn by , and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner ?
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 18]: You probably are not aware of that , but I assure you it 's the fact . '
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 12]: It had no effect on Sissy , fact or no fact .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 27]: ` Besides which , ' said Mr. Harthouse , taking a turn or two across the room , dubiously , ` it 's so alarmingly absurd .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 26]: It would make a man so ridiculous , after going in for these fellows , to back out in such an incomprehensible way . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 22]: I am quite sure , ' repeated Sissy , ` that it is the only reparation in your power , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 14]: I am quite sure , or I would not have come here . '
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 11]: He glanced at her face , and walked about again .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 13]: ` Upon my soul , I do n't know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 5]: So immensely absurd ! '
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 13]: It fell to his lot , now , to stipulate for secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 39]: ` If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing , ' he said , stopping again presently , and leaning against the chimney-piece , ` it could only be in the most inviolable confidence . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 21]: I will trust to you , sir , ' returned Sissy , ` and you will trust to me . '
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 14]: His leaning against the chimney-piece reminded him of the night with the whelp .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 18]: It was the self-same chimney-piece , and somehow he felt as if he were the whelp to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 9]: He could make no way at all . '
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 40]: I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position , ' he said , after looking down , and looking up , and laughing , and frowning , and walking off , and walking back again .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 10]: ` But I see no way out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 7]: What will be , will be .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 7]: This will be , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 19]: I must take off myself , I imagine -- in short , I engage to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 3]: Sissy rose .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 21]: She was not surprised by the result , but she was happy in it , and her face beamed brightly .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 35]: ` You will permit me to say , ' continued Mr. James Harthouse , ` that I doubt if any other ambassador , or ambassadress , could have addressed me with the same success .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 22]: I must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position , but as being vanquished at all points .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 14]: Will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 5]: ` My name ? '
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 4]: said the ambassadress .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 14]: ` The only name I could possibly care to know , to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 5]: ` Sissy Jupe . '
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 7]: ` Pardon my curiosity at parting .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 7]: Related to the family ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 12]: I am only a poor girl , ' returned Sissy . '
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 21]: I was separated from my father -- he was only a stroller -- and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 10]: I have lived in the house ever since . '
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 4]: She was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 33]: ` It wanted this to complete the defeat , ' said Mr. James Harthouse , sinking , with a resigned air , on the sofa , after standing transfixed a little while .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 10]: ` The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 26]: Only a poor girl -- only a stroller -- only James Harthouse made nothing of -- only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure . '
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 14]: The Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the Nile .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 31]: He took a pen upon the instant , and wrote the following note -LRB- in appropriate hieroglyphics -RRB- to his brother : Dear Jack , -- All up at Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 12]: Bored out of the place , and going in for camels .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 9]: Affectionately , JEM , He rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 7]: ` Send my fellow here . '
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 8]: ` Gone to bed , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 12]: ` Tell him to get up , and pack up . '
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 6]: He wrote two more notes .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 28]: One , to Mr. Bounderby , announcing his retirement from that part of the country , and showing where he would be found for the next fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 11]: The other , similar in effect , to Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 37]: Almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions , he had left the tall chimneys of Coketown behind , and was in a railway carriage , tearing and glaring over the dark landscape .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 53]: The moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr. James Harthouse derived some comfortable reflections afterwards , from this prompt retreat , as one of his few actions that made any amends for anything , and as a token to himself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad business .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 9]: But it was not so , at all .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 77]: A secret sense of having failed and been ridiculous -- a dread of what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of things , would say at his expense if they knew it -- so oppressed him , that what was about the very best passage in his life was the one of all others he would not have owned to on any account , and the only one that made him ashamed of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 84]: Chapter III -- Very Decided THE indefatigable Mrs. Sparsit , with a violent cold upon her , her voice reduced to a whisper , and her stately frame so racked by continual sneezes that it seemed in danger of dismemberment , gave chase to her patron until she found him in the metropolis ; and there , majestically sweeping in upon him at his hotel in St. James 's Street , exploded the combustibles with which she was charged , and blew up .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 20]: Having executed her mission with infinite relish , this high-minded woman then fainted away on Mr. Bounderby 's coat-collar .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 29]: Mr. Bounderby 's first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off , and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 35]: He next had recourse to the administration of potent restoratives , such as screwing the patient 's thumbs , smiting her hands , abundantly watering her face , and inserting salt in her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 37]: When these attentions had recovered her -LRB- which they speedily did -RRB- , he hustled her into a fast train without offering any other refreshment , and carried her back to Coketown more dead than alive .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 48]: Regarded as a classical ruin , Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle on her arrival at her journey 's end ; but considered in any other light , the amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive , and impaired her claims to admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 37]: Utterly heedless of the wear and tear of her clothes and constitution , and adamant to her pathetic sneezes , Mr. Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach , and bore her off to Stone Lodge .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 49]: ` Now , Tom Gradgrind , ' said Bounderby , bursting into his father-in-law 's room late at night ; ` here 's a lady here -- Mrs. Sparsit -- you know Mrs. Sparsit -- who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb . '
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 8]: ` You have missed my letter ! '
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 9]: exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind , surprised by the apparition .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 8]: ` Missed your letter , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 3]: bawled Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 10]: ` The present time is no time for letters .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 24]: No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters , with his mind in the state it 's in now . '
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 35]: ` Bounderby , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , in a tone of temperate remonstrance , ' I speak of a very special letter I have written to you , in reference to Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 42]: ` Tom Gradgrind , ' replied Bounderby , knocking the flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table , ' I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me , in reference to Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 9]: Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , stand forward ! '
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 50]: That unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony , without any voice and with painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat , became so aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions , that Mr. Bounderby , unable to bear it , seized her by the arm and shook her .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 23]: ` If you ca n't get it out , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , ` leave me to get it out .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 23]: This is not a time for a lady , however highly connected , to be totally inaudible , and seemingly swallowing marbles .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 35]: Tom Gradgrind , Mrs. Sparsit latterly found herself , by accident , in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman-friend , Mr. James Harthouse . '
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 4]: said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 3]: Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 3]: cried Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 19]: ` And in that conversation -- ' ` It is not necessary to repeat its tenor , Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 6]: I know what passed . '
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 4]: ` You do ?
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 32]: Perhaps , ' said Bounderby , staring with all his might at his so quiet and assuasive father-in-law , ` you know where your daughter is at the present time ! '
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 3]: ` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 5]: She is here . '
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 4]: ` Here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 19]: ` My dear Bounderby , let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks , on all accounts .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 4]: Louisa is here .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 39]: The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak , and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you , Louisa hurried here , for protection .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 21]: I myself had not been at home many hours , when I received her -- here , in this room .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 32]: She hurried by the train to town , she ran from town to this house , through a raging storm , and presented herself before me in a state of distraction .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 10]: Of course , she has remained here ever since .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 19]: Let me entreat you , for your own sake and for hers , to be more quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 42]: Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments , in every direction except Mrs. Sparsit 's direction ; and then , abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady Scadgers , said to that wretched woman : ` Now , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 38]: We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer , for going about the country at express pace , with no other luggage than a Cock-and-a -- Bull , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 45]: ` Sir , ' whispered Mrs. Sparsit , ` my nerves are at present too much shaken , and my health is at present too much impaired , in your service , to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears . '
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 6]: -LRB- Which she did . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 61]: ` Well , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , ` without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family , what I have got to add to that , is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge , namely , a coach .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 71]: And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you 'll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the Bank : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed . '
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 32]: With these words , Mr. Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady , and escorted her to the conveyance in question , shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 5]: He soon returned alone .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 31]: ` Now , as you showed me in your face , Tom Gradgrind , that you wanted to speak to me , ' he resumed , ` here I am .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 57]: But , I am not in a very agreeable state , I tell you plainly : not relishing this business , even as it is , and not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter , as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be treated by his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 17]: You have your opinion , I dare say ; and I have mine , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 25]: If you mean to say anything to me to-night , that goes against this candid remark , you had better let it alone . '
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 24]: Mr. Gradgrind , it will be observed , being much softened , Mr. Bounderby took particular pains to harden himself at all points .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 6]: It was his amiable nature .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 12]: ` My dear Bounderby , ' Mr. Gradgrind began in reply .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 23]: ` Now , you 'll excuse me , ' said Bounderby , ` but I do n't want to be too dear .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 6]: That , to start with .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 22]: When I begin to be dear to a man , I generally find that his intention is to come over me .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 20]: I am not speaking to you politely ; but , as you are aware , I am not polite .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 12]: If you like politeness , you know where to get it .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 23]: You have your gentleman-friends , you know , and they 'll serve you with as much of the article as you want .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 8]: I do n't keep it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 30]: ` Bounderby , ' urged Mr. Gradgrind , ` we are all liable to mistakes -- ' ' I thought you could n't make 'em , ' interrupted Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 6]: ` Perhaps I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 34]: But , I say we are all liable to mistakes and I should feel sensible of your delicacy , and grateful for it , if you would spare me these references to Harthouse .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 26]: I shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement ; pray do not persist in connecting him with mine . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 7]: I never mentioned his name ! '
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 3]: said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 14]: returned Mr. Gradgrind , with a patient , even a submissive , air .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 9]: And he sat for a little while pondering .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 17]: ` Bounderby , I see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood Louisa . '
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 9]: ` Who do you mean by We ? '
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 29]: ` Let me say I , then , ' he returned , in answer to the coarsely blurted question ; ' I doubt whether I have understood Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 16]: I doubt whether I have been quite right in the manner of her education . '
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 10]: ` There you hit it , ' returned Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 7]: ` There I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 11]: You have found it out at last , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 2]: Education !
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 30]: I 'll tell you what education is -- To be tumbled out of doors , neck and crop , and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 9]: That 's what I call education . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 40]: I think your good sense will perceive , ' Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in all humility , ` that whatever the merits of such a system may be , it would be difficult of general application to girls . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 16]: I do n't see it at all , sir , ' returned the obstinate Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 17]: ` Well , ' sighed Mr. Gradgrind , ` we will not enter into the question .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 11]: I assure you I have no desire to be controversial .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 37]: I seek to repair what is amiss , if I possibly can ; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit , Bounderby , for I have been very much distressed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 27]: I do n't understand you , yet , ' said Bounderby , with determined obstinacy , ` and therefore I wo n't make any promises . '
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 47]: ` In the course of a few hours , my dear Bounderby , ' Mr. Gradgrind proceeded , in the same depressed and propitiatory manner , ' I appear to myself to have become better informed as to Louisa 's character , than in previous years .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 16]: The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me , and the discovery is not mine .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 40]: I think there are -- Bounderby , you will be surprised to hear me say this -- I think there are qualities in Louisa , which -- which have been harshly neglected , and -- and a little perverted .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 60]: And -- and I would suggest to you , that -- that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while -- and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration -- it -- it would be the better for the happiness of all of us .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 23]: Louisa , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , shading his face with his hand , ` has always been my favourite child . '
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 32]: The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words , that he seemed to be , and probably was , on the brink of a fit .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 35]: With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson , he pent up his indignation , however , and said : ` You 'd like to keep her here for a time ? '
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 51]: ` I -- I had intended to recommend , my dear Bounderby , that you should allow Louisa to remain here on a visit , and be attended by Sissy -LRB- I mean of course Cecilia Jupe -RRB- , who understands her , and in whom she trusts . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 44]: I gather from all this , Tom Gradgrind , ' said Bounderby , standing up with his hands in his pockets , ` that you are of opinion that there 's what people call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 36]: I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa , and -- and -- and almost all the relations in which I have placed her , ' was her father 's sorrowful reply .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 44]: ` Now , look you here , Tom Gradgrind , ' said Bounderby the flushed , confronting him with his legs wide apart , his hands deeper in his pockets , and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was boisterous .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 14]: ` You have said your say ; I am going to say mine .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 6]: I am a Coketown man .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 7]: I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 44]: I know the bricks of this town , and I know the works of this town , and I know the chimneys of this town , and I know the smoke of this town , and I know the Hands of this town .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 7]: I know 'em all pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 4]: They 're real .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 27]: When a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities , I always tell that man , whoever he is , that I know what he means .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 26]: He means turtle soup and venison , with a gold spoon , and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 7]: That 's what your daughter wants .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 23]: Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants , I recommend you to provide it for her .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 14]: Because , Tom Gradgrind , she will never have it from me . '
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 25]: ` Bounderby , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ' I hoped , after my entreaty , you would have taken a different tone . '
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 20]: ` Just wait a bit , ' retorted Bounderby ; ` you have said your say , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 13]: I heard you out ; hear me out , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 43]: Do n't make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency , because , although I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position , I should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 26]: Now , there 's an incompatibility of some sort or another , I am given to understand by you , between your daughter and me .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 58]: I 'll give you to understand , in reply to that , that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude -- to be summed up in this -- that your daughter do n't properly know her husband 's merits , and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her , by George !
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 7]: of the honour of his alliance .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 9]: That 's plain speaking , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 14]: ` Bounderby , ' urged Mr. Gradgrind , ` this is unreasonable . '
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 5]: ` Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 4]: said Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 9]: I am glad to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 30]: Because when Tom Gradgrind , with his new lights , tells me that what I say is unreasonable , I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 8]: With your permission I am going on .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 32]: You know my origin ; and you know that for a good many years of my life I did n't want a shoeing-horn , in consequence of not having a shoe .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 26]: Yet you may believe or not , as you think proper , that there are ladies -- born ladies -- belonging to families -- Families !
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 12]: -- who next to worship the ground I walk on . '
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 13]: He discharged this like a Rocket , at his father-in-law 's head .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 18]: ` Whereas your daughter , ' proceeded Bounderby , ` is far from being a born lady .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 6]: That you know , yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 40]: Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about such things , for you are very well aware I do n't ; but that such is the fact , and you , Tom Gradgrind , ca n't change it .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 7]: Why do I say this ? '
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 22]: ` Not , I fear , ' observed Mr. Gradgrind , in a low voice , ` to spare me . '
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 21]: ` Hear me out , ' said Bounderby , ` and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 29]: I say this , because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself , and to witness her insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 9]: They have wondered how I have suffered it .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 14]: And I wonder myself now , and I wo n't suffer it . '
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 23]: ` Bounderby , ' returned Mr. Gradgrind , rising , ` the less we say to-night the better , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 20]: ` On the contrary , Tom Gradgrind , the more we say to-night , the better , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 30]: That is , ' the consideration checked him , 'till I have said all I mean to say , and then I do n't care how soon we stop .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 11]: I come to a question that may shorten the business .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 13]: What do you mean by the proposal you made just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 9]: ` What do I mean , Bounderby ? '
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 19]: ` By your visiting proposition , ' said Bounderby , with an inflexible jerk of the hayfield . '
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 42]: I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner , for allowing Louisa a period of repose and reflection here , which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects . '
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 13]: ` To a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility ? '
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 3]: said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 10]: ` If you put it in those terms . '
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 9]: ` What made you think of this ? '
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 4]: said Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 13]: I have already said , I fear Louisa has not been understood .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 25]: Is it asking too much , Bounderby , that you , so far her elder , should aid in trying to set her right ?
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 45]: You have accepted a great charge of her ; for better for worse , for -- ' Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to Stephen Blackpool , but he cut the quotation short with an angry start .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 14]: said he , ' I do n't want to be told about that .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 14]: I know what I took her for , as well as you do .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 17]: Never you mind what I took her for ; that 's my look out . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 62]: I was merely going on to remark , Bounderby , that we may all be more or less in the wrong , not even excepting you ; and that some yielding on your part , remembering the trust you have accepted , may not only be an act of true kindness , but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 9]: I think differently , ' blustered Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 13]: I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 18]: Now , I do n't want to make a quarrel of it with you , Tom Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 24]: To tell you the truth , I do n't think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 16]: As to your gentleman-friend , he may take himself off , wherever he likes best .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 39]: If he falls in my way , I shall tell him my mind ; if he do n't fall in my way , I sha n't , for it wo n't be worth my while to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 69]: As to your daughter , whom I made Loo Bounderby , and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind , if she do n't come home to-morrow , by twelve o'clock at noon , I shall understand that she prefers to stay away , and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here , and you 'll take charge of her for the future .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 26]: What I shall say to people in general , of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law , will be this .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 34]: I am Josiah Bounderby , and I had my bringing-up ; she 's the daughter of Tom Gradgrind , and she had her bringing-up ; and the two horses would n't pull together .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 51]: I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man , I believe ; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common , also , who , in the long run , would come up to my mark . '
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 29]: ` Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this , Bounderby , ' urged Mr. Gradgrind , ` before you commit yourself to such a decision . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 27]: I always come to a decision , ' said Bounderby , tossing his hat on : ` and whatever I do , I do at once .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 46]: I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind 's addressing such a remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , knowing what he knows of him , if I could be surprised by anything Tom Gradgrind did , after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 16]: I have given you my decision , and I have got no more to say .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 12]: So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 43]: At five minutes past twelve o'clock next day , he directed Mrs. Bounderby 's property to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind 's ; advertised his country retreat for sale by private contract ; and resumed a bachelor life .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 34]: Chapter IV -- Lost THE robbery at the Bank had not languished before , and did not cease to occupy a front place in the attention of the principal of that establishment now .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 54]: In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity , as a remarkable man , and a self-made man , and a commercial wonder more admirable than Venus , who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea , he liked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 53]: Consequently , in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood , he even advanced upon his usual display of bustle , and every day made such a rout in renewing his investigations into the robbery , that the officers who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 11]: They were at fault too , and off the scent .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 32]: Although they had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the matter , that most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless , nothing new occurred .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 15]: No implicated man or woman took untimely courage , or made a self-betraying step .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 21]: More remarkable yet , Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of , and the mysterious old woman remained a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 35]: Things having come to this pass , and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it , the upshot of Mr. Bounderby 's investigations was , that he resolved to hazard a bold burst .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 120]: He drew up a placard , offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool , suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night ; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress , complexion , estimated height , and manner , as minutely as he could ; he recited how he had left the town , and in what direction he had been last seen going ; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet ; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night , so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 34]: The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak , collected round the placards , devouring them with eager eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 19]: Not the least eager of the eyes assembled , were the eyes of those who could not read .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 62]: These people , as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud -- there was always some such ready to help them -- stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous , if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 51]: Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards , among turning spindles , rattling looms , and whirling wheels , for hours afterwards ; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets , there were still as many readers as before .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 33]: Slackbridge , the delegate , had to address his audience too that night ; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer , and had brought it in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 59]: Oh , my friends and fellow-countrymen , the down-trodden operatives of Coketown , oh , my fellow-brothers and fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellowmen , what a to-do was there , when Slackbridge unfolded what he called ` that damning document , ' and held it up to the gaze , and for the execration of the working-man community !
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 35]: ` Oh , my fellow-men , behold of what a traitor in the camp of those great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and of Union , is appropriately capable !
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 160]: Oh , my prostrate friends , with the galling yoke of tyrants on your necks and the iron foot of despotism treading down your fallen forms into the dust of the earth , upon which right glad would your oppressors be to see you creeping on your bellies all the days of your lives , like the serpent in the garden -- oh , my brothers , and shall I as a man not add , my sisters too , what do you say , now , of Stephen Blackpool , with a slight stoop in his shoulders and about five foot seven in height , as set forth in this degrading and disgusting document , this blighting bill , this pernicious placard , this abominable advertisement ; and with what majesty of denouncement will you crush the viper , who would bring this stain and shame upon the God-like race that happily has cast him out for ever !
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 14]: Yes , my compatriots , happily cast him out and sent him forth !
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 99]: For you remember how he stood here before you on this platform ; you remember how , face to face and foot to foot , I pursued him through all his intricate windings ; you remember how he sneaked and slunk , and sidled , and splitted of straws , until , with not an inch of ground to which to cling , I hurled him out from amongst us : an object for the undying finger of scorn to point at , and for the avenging fire of every free and thinking mind to scorch and scar !
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 84]: And now , my friends -- my labouring friends , for I rejoice and triumph in that stigma -- my friends whose hard but honest beds are made in toil , and whose scanty but independent pots are boiled in hardship ; and now , I say , my friends , what appellation has that dastard craven taken to himself , when , with the mask torn from his features , he stands before us in all his native deformity , a What ?
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 3]: A thief !
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 3]: A plunderer !
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 25]: A proscribed fugitive , with a price upon his head ; a fester and a wound upon the noble character of the Coketown operative !
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 110]: Therefore , my band of brothers in a sacred bond , to which your children and your children 's children yet unborn have set their infant hands and seals , I propose to you on the part of the United Aggregate Tribunal , ever watchful for your welfare , ever zealous for your benefit , that this meeting does Resolve : That Stephen Blackpool , weaver , referred to in this placard , having been already solemnly disowned by the community of Coketown Hands , the same are free from the shame of his misdeeds , and can not as a class be reproached with his dishonest actions ! '
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 11]: Thus Slackbridge ; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 10]: A few stern voices called out ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 17]: and a score or two hailed , with assenting cries of ` Hear , hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 24]: the caution from one man , ` Slackbridge , y' or over hetter i n't ; y' or a goen too fast ! '
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 34]: But these were pigmies against an army ; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to Slackbridge , and gave three cheers for him , as he sat demonstratively panting at them .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 32]: These men and women were yet in the streets , passing quietly to their homes , when Sissy , who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before , returned .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 6]: ` Who is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 3]: asked Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 40]: ` It is Mr. Bounderby , ' said Sissy , timid of the name , ` and your brother Mr. Tom , and a young woman who says her name is Rachael , and that you know her . '
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 10]: ` What do they want , Sissy dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 7]: ` They want to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 10]: Rachael has been crying , and seems angry . '
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 29]: ` Father , ' said Louisa , for he was present , ' I can not refuse to see them , for a reason that will explain itself .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 7]: Shall they come in here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 14]: As he answered in the affirmative , Sissy went away to bring them .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 6]: She reappeared with them directly .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 19]: Tom was last ; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room , near the door .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 25]: ` Mrs. Bounderby , ' said her husband , entering with a cool nod , ' I do n't disturb you , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 23]: This is an unseasonable hour , but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 41]: Tom Gradgrind , as your son , young Tom , refuses for some obstinate reason or other to say anything at all about those statements , good or bad , I am obliged to confront her with your daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 21]: ` You have seen me once before , young lady , ' said Rachael , standing in front of Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 3]: Tom coughed .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 24]: ` You have seen me , young lady , ' repeated Rachael , as she did not answer , ` once before . '
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 5]: Tom coughed again . '
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 4]: I have . '
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 31]: Rachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby , and said , ` Will you make it known , young lady , where , and who was there ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 26]: I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged , on the night of his discharge from his work , and I saw you there .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 27]: He was there too ; and an old woman who did not speak , and whom I could scarcely see , stood in a dark corner .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 7]: My brother was with me . '
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 12]: ` Why could n't you say so , young Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 4]: demanded Bounderby . '
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 9]: I promised my sister I would n't . '
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 5]: Which Louisa hastily confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 38]: ` And besides , ' said the whelp bitterly , ` she tells her own story so precious well -- and so full -- that what business had I to take it out of her mouth ! '
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 33]: ` Say , young lady , if you please , ' pursued Rachael , ` why , in an evil hour , you ever came to Stephen 's that night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 35]: I felt compassion for him , ' said Louisa , her colour deepening , ` and I wished to know what he was going to do , and wished to offer him assistance . '
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 10]: ` Thank you , ma'am , ' said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 7]: ` Much flattered and obliged . '
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 15]: ` Did you offer him , ' asked Rachael , ' a bank-note ? '
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 18]: ` Yes ; but he refused it , and would only take two pounds in gold . '
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 9]: Rachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 6]: ` Oh , certainly ! '
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 3]: said Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 27]: ` If you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not , I am bound to say it 's confirmed . '
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 29]: ` Young lady , ' said Rachael , ` Stephen Blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town , and where else !
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 18]: There have been a meeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 2]: Stephen !
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 12]: The honestest lad , the truest lad , the best ! '
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 12]: Her indignation failed her , and she broke off sobbing . '
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 11]: I am very , very sorry , ' said Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 26]: ` Oh , young lady , young lady , ' returned Rachael , ' I hope you may be , but I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 11]: I ca n't say what you may ha ' done !
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 21]: The like of you do n't know us , do n't care for us , do n't belong to us .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 13]: I am not sure why you may ha ' come that night .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 32]: I ca n't tell but what you may ha ' come wi ' some aim of your own , not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 39]: I said then , Bless you for coming ; and I said it of my heart , you seemed to take so pitifully to him ; but I do n't know now , I do n't know ! '
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 25]: Louisa could not reproach her for her unjust suspicions ; she was so faithful to her idea of the man , and so afflicted .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 82]: ` And when I think , ' said Rachael through her sobs , ` that the poor lad was so grateful , thinkin you so good to him -- when I mind that he put his hand over his hard-worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there -- Oh , I hope you may be sorry , and ha ' no bad cause to be it ; but I do n't know , I do n't know ! '
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 28]: ` You 're a pretty article , ' growled the whelp , moving uneasily in his dark corner , ` to come here with these precious imputations !
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 22]: You ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself , and you would be by rights . '
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 23]: She said nothing in reply ; and her low weeping was the only sound that was heard , until Mr. Bounderby spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 13]: said he , ` you know what you have engaged to do .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 14]: You had better give your mind to that ; not this . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 33]: Deed , I am loath , ' returned Rachael , drying her eyes , ` that any here should see me like this ; but I wo n't be seen so again .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 66]: Young lady , when I had read what 's put in print of Stephen -- and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you -- I went straight to the Bank to say I knew where Stephen was , and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 39]: I could n't meet wi ' Mr. Bounderby then , and your brother sent me away , and I tried to find you , but you was not to be found , and I went back to work .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 34]: Soon as I come out of the Mill to-night , I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen -- for I know wi ' pride he will come back to shame it !
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 39]: -- and then I went again to seek Mr. Bounderby , and I found him , and I told him every word I knew ; and he believed no word I said , and brought me here . '
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 25]: ` So far , that 's true enough , ' assented Mr. Bounderby , with his hands in his pockets and his hat on .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 25]: ` But I have known you people before to-day , you 'll observe , and I know you never die for want of talking .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 17]: Now , I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now , as doing .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 21]: You have undertaken to do something ; all I remark upon that at present is , do it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 47]: I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon , as I have written to him once before sin ' he went away , ' said Rachael ; ` and he will be here , at furthest , in two days . '
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 9]: ` Then , I 'll tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 48]: You are not aware perhaps , ' retorted Mr. Bounderby , ` that you yourself have been looked after now and then , not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business , on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 8]: The post-office has n't been forgotten either .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 19]: What I 'll tell you is , that no letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 14]: Therefore , what has become of yours , I leave you to guess .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 11]: Perhaps you 're mistaken , and never wrote any . '
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 54]: ` He had n't been gone from here , young lady , ' said Rachael , turning appealingly to Louisa , ` as much as a week , when he sent me the only letter I have had from him , saying that he was forced to seek work in another name . '
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 7]: ` Oh , by George ! '
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 20]: cried Bounderby , shaking his head , with a whistle , ` he changes his name , does he !
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 13]: That 's rather unlucky , too , for such an immaculate chap .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 24]: It 's considered a little suspicious in Courts of Justice , I believe , when an Innocent happens to have many names . '
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 35]: ` What , ' said Rachael , with the tears in her eyes again , ` what , young lady , in the name of Mercy , was left the poor lad to do !
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 32]: The masters against him on one hand , the men against him on the other , he only wantin to work hard in peace , and do what he felt right .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 16]: Can a man have no soul of his own , no mind of his own ?
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 31]: Must he go wrong all through wi ' this side , or must he go wrong all through wi ' that , or else be hunted like a hare ? '
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 27]: ` Indeed , indeed , I pity him from my heart , ' returned Louisa ; ` and I hope that he will clear himself . '
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 12]: ` You need have no fear of that , young lady .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 5]: He is sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 23]: ` All the surer , I suppose , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` for your refusing to tell where he is ?
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 23]: ` He shall not , through any act of mine , come back wi ' the unmerited reproach of being brought back .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 34]: He shall come back of his own accord to clear himself , and put all those that have injured his good character , and he not here for its defence , to shame .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 42]: I have told him what has been done against him , ' said Rachael , throwing off all distrust as a rock throws of the sea , ` and he will be here , at furthest , in two days . '
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 30]: ` Notwithstanding which , ' added Mr. Bounderby , ` if he can be laid hold of any sooner , he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 44]: As to you , I have nothing against you ; what you came and told me turns out to be true , and I have given you the means of proving it to be true , and there 's an end of it .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 7]: I wish you good night all !
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 13]: I must be off to look a little further into this . '
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 26]: Tom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby moved , moved with him , kept close to him , and went away with him .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 19]: The only parting salutation of which he delivered himself was a sulky ` Good night , father ! '
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 17]: With a brief speech , and a scowl at his sister , he left the house .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 15]: Since his sheet-anchor had come home , Mr. Gradgrind had been sparing of speech .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 28]: He still sat silent , when Louisa mildly said : ` Rachael , you will not distrust me one day , when you know me better . '
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 45]: ` It goes against me , ' Rachael answered , in a gentler manner , ` to mistrust any one ; but when I am so mistrusted -- when we all are -- I can not keep such things quite out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 11]: I ask your pardon for having done you an injury .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 9]: I do n't think what I said now .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 18]: Yet I might come to think it again , wi ' the poor lad so wronged . '
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 34]: ` Did you tell him in your letter , ' inquired Sissy , ` that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him , because he had been seen about the Bank at night ?
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 20]: He would then know what he would have to explain on coming back , and would be ready . '
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 23]: ` Yes , dear , ' she returned ; ` but I ca n't guess what can have ever taken him there .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 7]: He never used to go there .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 7]: It was never in his way .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 14]: His way was the same as mine , and not near it . '
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 31]: Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived , and whether she might come to-morrow night , to inquire if there were news of him . '
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 18]: I doubt , ' said Rachael , ` if he can be here till next day . '
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 13]: ` Then I will come next night too , ' said Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 42]: When Rachael , assenting to this , was gone , Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his head , and said to his daughter : ` Louisa , my dear , I have never , that I know of , seen this man .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 10]: Do you believe him to be implicated ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 14]: I think I have believed it , father , though with great difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 8]: I do not believe it now . '
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 21]: ` That is to say , you once persuaded yourself to believe it , from knowing him to be suspected .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 11]: His appearance and manner ; are they so honest ? '
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 5]: ` Very honest . '
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 9]: ` And her confidence not to be shaken !
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 21]: I ask myself , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , musing , ` does the real culprit know of these accusations ?
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 4]: Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 5]: Who is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 10]: His hair had latterly began to change its colour .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 36]: As he leaned upon his hand again , looking gray and old , Louisa , with a face of fear and pity , hurriedly went over to him , and sat close at his side .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 11]: Her eyes by accident met Sissy 's at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 14]: Sissy flushed and started , and Louisa put her finger on her lip .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 23]: Next night , when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not come , she told it in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 32]: Next night again , when she came home with the same account , and added that he had not been heard of , she spoke in the same low frightened tone .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 39]: From the moment of that interchange of looks , they never uttered his name , or any reference to him , aloud ; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery , when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 26]: The two appointed days ran out , three days and nights ran out , and Stephen Blackpool was not come , and remained unheard of .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 54]: On the fourth day , Rachael , with unabated confidence , but considering her despatch to have miscarried , went up to the Bank , and showed her letter from him with his address , at a working colony , one of many , not upon the main road , sixty miles away .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 21]: Messengers were sent to that place , and the whole town looked for Stephen to be brought in next day .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 21]: During this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his shadow , assisting in all the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 33]: He was greatly excited , horribly fevered , bit his nails down to the quick , spoke in a hard rattling voice , and with lips that were black and burnt up .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 46]: At the hour when the suspected man was looked for , the whelp was at the station ; offering to wager that he had made off before the arrival of those who were sent in quest of him , and that he would not appear .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 5]: The whelp was right .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 5]: The messengers returned alone .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 13]: Rachael 's letter had gone , Rachael 's letter had been delivered .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 17]: Stephen Blackpool had decamped in that same hour ; and no soul knew more of him .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 29]: The only doubt in Coketown was , whether Rachael had written in good faith , believing that he really would come back , or warning him to fly .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 7]: On this point opinion was divided .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 12]: Six days , seven days , far on into another week .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 15]: The wretched whelp plucked up a ghastly courage , and began to grow defiant .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 8]: ` Was the suspected fellow the thief ?
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 4]: A pretty question !
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 17]: If not , where was the man , and why did he not come back ? '
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 13]: Where was the man , and why did he not come back ?
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 35]: In the dead of night the echoes of his own words , which had rolled Heaven knows how far away in the daytime , came back instead , and abided by him until morning .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 14]: Chapter V -- Found DAY and night again , day and night again .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 4]: No Stephen Blackpool .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 13]: Where was the man , and why did he not come back ?
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 20]: Every night , Sissy went to Rachael 's lodging , and sat with her in her small neat room .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 15]: All day , Rachael toiled as such people must toil , whatever their anxieties .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 38]: The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or found , who turned out bad or good ; the melancholy mad elephants , like the Hard Fact men , abated nothing of their set routine , whatever happened .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 10]: Day and night again , day and night again .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 5]: The monotony was unbroken .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 27]: Even Stephen Blackpool 's disappearance was falling into the general way , and becoming as monotonous a wonder as any piece of machinery in Coketown . '
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 33]: I misdoubt , ' said Rachael , ` if there is as many as twenty left in all this place , who have any trust in the poor dear lad now . '
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 23]: She said it to Sissy , as they sat in her lodging , lighted only by the lamp at the street corner .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 42]: Sissy had come there when it was already dark , to await her return from work ; and they had since sat at the window where Rachael had found her , wanting no brighter light to shine on their sorrowful talk .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 39]: ` If it had n't been mercifully brought about , that I was to have you to speak to , ' pursued Rachael , ` times are , when I think my mind would not have kept right .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 28]: But I get hope and strength through you ; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him , he will be proved clear ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 15]: I do believe so , ' returned Sissy , ` with my whole heart .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 50]: I feel so certain , Rachael , that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement , is not like to be wrong , that I have no more doubt of him than if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have . '
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 79]: ` And I , my dear , ' said Rachel , with a tremble in her voice , ` have known him through them all , to be , according to his quiet ways , so faithful to everything honest and good , that if he was never to be heard of more , and I was to live to be a hundred years old , I could say with my last breath , God knows my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 10]: I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool ! '
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 25]: ` We all believe , up at the Lodge , Rachael , that he will be freed from suspicion , sooner or later . '
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 79]: ` The better I know it to be so believed there , my dear , ' said Rachael , ` and the kinder I feel it that you come away from there , purposely to comfort me , and keep me company , and be seen wi ' me when I am not yet free from all suspicion myself , the more grieved I am that I should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 16]: And yet I -- ' ` You do n't mistrust her now , Rachael ? '
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 12]: ` Now that you have brought us more together , no .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 43]: But I ca n't at all times keep out of my mind -- ' Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself , that Sissy , sitting by her side , was obliged to listen with attention . '
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 17]: I ca n't at all times keep out of my mind , mistrustings of some one .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 34]: I ca n't think who 't is , I ca n't think how or why it may be done , but I mistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 45]: I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord , and showing himself innocent before them all , some one would be confounded , who -- to prevent that -- has stopped him , and put him out of the way . '
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 14]: ` That is a dreadful thought , ' said Sissy , turning pale .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 14]: ` It is a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered . '
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 8]: Sissy shuddered , and turned paler yet .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 88]: ` When it makes its way into my mind , dear , ' said Rachael , ` and it will come sometimes , though I do all I can to keep it out , wi ' counting on to high numbers as I work , and saying over and over again pieces that I knew when I were a child -- I fall into such a wild , hot hurry , that , however tired I am , I want to walk fast , miles and miles .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 10]: I must get the better of this before bed-time .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 9]: I 'll walk home wi ' you . '
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 42]: ` He might fall ill upon the journey back , ' said Sissy , faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope ; ` and in such a case , there are many places on the road where he might stop . '
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 9]: ` But he is in none of them .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 15]: He has been sought for in all , and he 's not there . '
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 10]: ` True , ' was Sissy 's reluctant admission .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 10]: ` He 'd walk the journey in two days .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 36]: If he was footsore and could n't walk , I sent him , in the letter he got , the money to ride , lest he should have none of his own to spare . '
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 13]: ` Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better , Rachael .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 6]: Come into the air ! '
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 26]: Her gentle hand adjusted Rachael 's shawl upon her shining black hair in the usual manner of her wearing it , and they went out .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 39]: The night being fine , little knots of Hands were here and there lingering at street corners ; but it was supper-time with the greater part of them , and there were but few people in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 18]: ` You 're not so hurried now , Rachael , and your hand is cooler . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 18]: I get better , dear , if I can only walk , and breathe a little fresh .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 14]: ` Times when I ca n't , I turn weak and confused . '
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 24]: ` But you must not begin to fail , Rachael , for you may be wanted at any time to stand by Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 4]: To-morrow is Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 23]: If no news comes to-morrow , let us walk in the country on Sunday morning , and strengthen you for another week .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 5]: Will you go ? '
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 6]: ` Yes , dear . '
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 15]: They were by this time in the street where Mr. Bounderby 's house stood .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 20]: The way to Sissy 's destination led them past the door , and they were going straight towards it .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 27]: Some train had newly arrived in Coketown , which had put a number of vehicles in motion , and scattered a considerable bustle about the town .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 43]: Several coaches were rattling before them and behind them as they approached Mr. Bounderby 's , and one of the latter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the house , that they looked round involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 43]: The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby 's steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach , in an ecstasy of excitement , struggling to open the door ; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment , called to them to stop .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 19]: ` It 's a coincidence , ' exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit , as she was released by the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 6]: ` It 's a Providence !
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 6]: Come out , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 23]: then said Mrs. Sparsit , to some one inside , ` come out , or we 'll have you dragged out ! '
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 11]: Hereupon , no other than the mysterious old woman descended .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 6]: Whom Mrs. Sparsit incontinently collared .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 8]: ` Leave her alone , everybody ! '
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 8]: cried Mrs. Sparsit , with great energy .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 6]: ` Let nobody touch her .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 5]: She belongs to me .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 6]: Come in , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 12]: then said Mrs. Sparsit , reversing her former word of command .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 15]: ` Come in , ma'am , or we 'll have you dragged in ! '
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 58]: The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment , seizing an ancient woman by the throat , and hauling her into a dwelling-house , would have been under any circumstances , sufficient temptation to all true English stragglers so blest as to witness it , to force a way into that dwelling-house and see the matter out .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 49]: But when the phenomenon was enhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over the town with the Bank robbery , it would have lured the stragglers in , with an irresistible attraction , though the roof had been expected to fall upon their heads .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 81]: Accordingly , the chance witnesses on the ground , consisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some five-and-twenty , closed in after Sissy and Rachael , as they closed in after Mrs. Sparsit and her prize ; and the whole body made a disorderly irruption into Mr. Bounderby 's dining-room , where the people behind lost not a moment 's time in mounting on the chairs , to get the better of the people in front .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 7]: ` Fetch Mr. Bounderby down ! '
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 4]: cried Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 13]: ` Rachael , young woman ; you know who this is ? '
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 11]: ` It 's Mrs. Pegler , ' said Rachael . '
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 7]: I should think it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 6]: cried Mrs. Sparsit , exulting .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 5]: ` Fetch Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 6]: Stand away , everybody ! '
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 20]: Here old Mrs. Pegler , muffling herself up , and shrinking from observation , whispered a word of entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 14]: ` Do n't tell me , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , aloud . '
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 27]: I have told you twenty times , coming along , that I will not leave you till I have handed you over to him myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 22]: Mr. Bounderby now appeared , accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp , with whom he had been holding conference up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 18]: Mr. Bounderby looked more astonished than hospitable , at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 10]: ` Why , what 's the matter now ! '
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 7]: ` Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 28]: ` Sir , ' explained that worthy woman , ' I trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 76]: Stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind , sir , and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside , as have been afforded by the young woman , Rachael , fortunately now present to identify , I have had the happiness to succeed , and to bring that person with me -- I need not say most unwillingly on her part .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 39]: It has not been , sir , without some trouble that I have effected this ; but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure , and hunger , thirst , and cold a real gratification . '
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 33]: Here Mrs. Sparsit ceased ; for Mr. Bounderby 's visage exhibited an extraordinary combination of all possible colours and expressions of discomfiture , as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed to his view .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 11]: ` Why , what do you mean by this ? '
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 11]: was his highly unexpected demand , in great warmth . '
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 17]: I ask you , what do you mean by this , Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 6]: exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 13]: ` Why do n't you mind your own business , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 3]: roared Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 16]: ` How dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 10]: This allusion to her favourite feature overpowered Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 38]: She sat down stiffly in a chair , as if she were frozen ; and with a fixed stare at Mr. Bounderby , slowly grated her mittens against one another , as if they were frozen too .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 6]: ` My dear Josiah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 6]: cried Mrs. Pegler , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 5]: ` My darling boy !
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 6]: I am not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 8]: It 's not my fault , Josiah .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 30]: I told this lady over and over again , that I knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you , but she would do it . '
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 10]: ` What did you let her bring you for ?
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 26]: Could n't you knock her cap off , or her tooth out , or scratch her , or do something or other to her ? '
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 3]: asked Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 5]: ` My own boy !
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 50]: She threatened me that if I resisted her , I should be brought by constables , and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a ' -- Mrs. Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the walls -- ` such a fine house as this .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 10]: Indeed , indeed , it is not my fault !
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 8]: My dear , noble , stately boy !
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 14]: I have always lived quiet , and secret , Josiah , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 8]: I have never broken the condition once .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 9]: I have never said I was your mother .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 45]: I have admired you at a distance ; and if I have come to town sometimes , with long times between , to take a proud peep at you , I have done it unbeknown , my love , and gone away again . '
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 50]: Mr. Bounderby , with his hands in his pockets , walked in impatient mortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table , while the spectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler 's appeal , and at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 62]: Mr. Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done , Mr. Gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady : ' I am surprised , madam , ' he observed with severity , ` that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son , after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him . '
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 5]: ` Me unnatural ! '
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 6]: cried poor old Mrs. Pegler .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 4]: ` Me inhuman !
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 6]: To my dear boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 4]: ` Dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 15]: ` Yes ; dear in his self-made prosperity , madam , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 27]: Not very dear , however , when you deserted him in his infancy , and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 6]: I deserted my Josiah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 8]: cried Mrs. Pegler , clasping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 36]: ` Now , Lord forgive you , sir , for your wicked imaginations , and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother , who died in my arms before Josiah was born .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 15]: May you repent of it , sir , and live to know better ! '
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 52]: She was so very earnest and injured , that Mr. Gradgrind , shocked by the possibility which dawned upon him , said in a gentler tone : ` Do you deny , then , madam , that you left your son to -- to be brought up in the gutter ? '
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 7]: ` Josiah in the gutter ! '
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Pegler .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 8]: ` No such a thing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 5]: For shame on you !
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 64]: My dear boy knows , and will give you to know , that though he come of humble parents , he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could , and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful , and I 've his books at home to show it !
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 6]: Aye , have I ! '
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 8]: said Mrs. Pegler , with indignant pride .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 68]: ` And my dear boy knows , and will give you to know , sir , that after his beloved father died , when he was eight years old , his mother , too , could pinch a bit , as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it , to help him out in life , and put him ` prentice .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 33]: And a steady lad he was , and a kind master he had to lend him a hand , and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 83]: And I 'll give you to know , sir -- for this my dear boy wo n't -- that though his mother kept but a little village shop , he never forgot her , but pensioned me on thirty pound a year -- more than I want , for I put by out of it -- only making the condition that I was to keep down in my own part , and make no boasts about him , and not trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 21]: And I never have , except with looking at him once a year , when he has never knowed it .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 73]: And it 's right , ' said poor old Mrs. Pegler , in affectionate championship , ` that I should keep down in my own part , and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a many unbefitting things , and I am well contented , and I can keep my pride in my Josiah to myself , and I can love for love 's own sake !
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 23]: And I am ashamed of you , sir , ' said Mrs. Pegler , lastly , ` for your slanders and suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 20]: And I never stood here before , nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 18]: And I should n't be here now , if it had n't been for being brought here .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 35]: And for shame upon you , Oh , for shame , to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son , with my son standing here to tell you so different ! '
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 64]: The bystanders , on and off the dining-room chairs , raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler , and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament , when Mr. Bounderby , who had never ceased walking up and down , and had every moment swelled larger and larger , and grown redder and redder , stopped short . '
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 32]: I do n't exactly know , ' said Mr. Bounderby , ` how I come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company , but I do n't inquire .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 33]: When they 're quite satisfied , perhaps they 'll be so good as to disperse ; whether they 're satisfied or not , perhaps they 'll be so good as to disperse .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 31]: I 'm not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs , I have not undertaken to do it , and I 'm not a going to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 31]: Therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject , will be disappointed -- particularly Tom Gradgrind , and he ca n't know it too soon .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 18]: In reference to the Bank robbery , there has been a mistake made , concerning my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 25]: If there had n't been over-officiousness it would n't have been made , and I hate over-officiousness at all times , whether or no .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 4]: Good evening ! '
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 36]: Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms , holding the door open for the company to depart , there was a blustering sheepishness upon him , at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 59]: Detected as the Bully of humility , who had built his windy reputation upon lies , and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced the mean claim -LRB- there is no meaner -RRB- to tack himself on to a pedigree , he cut a most ridiculous figure .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 52]: With the people filing off at the door he held , who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole town , to be given to the four winds , he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn , if he had had his ears cropped .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 40]: Even that unlucky female , Mrs. Sparsit , fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond , was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man and self-made Humbug , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 31]: Rachael and Sissy , leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son 's for that night , walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 39]: Mr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far , and spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool ; for whom he thought this signal failure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 22]: As to the whelp ; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions , he had stuck close to Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 23]: He seemed to feel that as long as Bounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge , he was so far safe .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 36]: He never visited his sister , and had only seen her once since she went home : that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to Bounderby , as already related .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 32]: There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister 's mind , to which she never gave utterance , which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 43]: The same dark possibility had presented itself in the same shapeless guise , this very day , to Sissy , when Rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen 's return , having put him out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 60]: Louisa had never spoken of harbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery , she and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject , save in that one interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on his hand ; but it was understood between them , and they both knew it .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 38]: This other fear was so awful , that it hovered about each of them like a ghostly shadow ; neither daring to think of its being near herself , far less of its being near the other .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 16]: And still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up , throve with him .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 13]: If Stephen Blackpool was not the thief , let him show himself .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 5]: Why did n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 3]: Another night .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 5]: Another day and night .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 4]: No Stephen Blackpool .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 13]: Where was the man , and why did he not come back ?
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 34]: Chapter VI -- The Starlight THE Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn , clear and cool , when early in the morning Sissy and Rachael met , to walk in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 91]: As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood 's too -- after the manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth -- it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air , which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life , to get a few miles away by the railroad , and then begin their walk , or their lounge in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 32]: Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means , and were put down at a station about midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby 's retreat .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 57]: Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal , it was green elsewhere , and there were trees to see , and there were larks singing -LRB- though it was Sunday -RRB- , and there were pleasant scents in the air , and all was over-arched by a bright blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 44]: In the distance one way , Coketown showed as a black mist ; in another distance hills began to rise ; in a third , there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where it shone upon the far-off sea .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 30]: Under their feet , the grass was fresh ; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it , and speckled it ; hedgerows were luxuriant ; everything was at peace .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 55]: Engines at pits ' mouths , and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily labour into the ground , were alike quiet ; wheels had ceased for a short space to turn ; and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the shocks and noises of another time .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 52]: They walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes , sometimes getting over a fragment of a fence so rotten that it dropped at a touch of the foot , sometimes passing near a wreck of bricks and beams overgrown with grass , marking the site of deserted works .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 9]: They followed paths and tracks , however slight .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 45]: Mounds where the grass was rank and high , and where brambles , dock-weed , and such-like vegetation , were confusedly heaped together , they always avoided ; for dismal stories were told in that country of the old pits hidden beneath such indications .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 11]: The sun was high when they sat down to rest .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 21]: They had seen no one , near or distant , for a long time ; and the solitude remained unbroken .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 33]: ` It is so still here , Rachael , and the way is so untrodden , that I think we must be the first who have been here all the summer . '
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 21]: As Sissy said it , her eyes were attracted by another of those rotten fragments of fence upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 8]: She got up to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 8]: ` And yet I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 8]: This has not been broken very long .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 10]: The wood is quite fresh where it gave way .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 5]: Here are footsteps too .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 5]: -- O Rachael ! '
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 11]: She ran back , and caught her round the neck .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 6]: Rachael had already started up .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 8]: ` What is the matter ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 10]: There is a hat lying in the grass . '
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 5]: They went forward together .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 11]: Rachael took it up , shaking from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 23]: She broke into a passion of tears and lamentations : Stephen Blackpool was written in his own hand on the inside . '
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 9]: O the poor lad , the poor lad !
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 7]: He has been made away with .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 7]: He is lying murdered here ! '
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 13]: ` Is there -- has the hat any blood upon it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 3]: Sissy faltered .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 23]: They were afraid to look ; but they did examine it , and found no mark of violence , inside or out .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 31]: It had been lying there some days , for rain and dew had stained it , and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 15]: They looked fearfully about them , without moving , but could see nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 18]: ` Rachael , ' Sissy whispered , ' I will go on a little by myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 32]: She had unclasped her hand , and was in the act of stepping forward , when Rachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the wide landscape .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 22]: Before them , at their very feet , was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 20]: They sprang back , and fell upon their knees , each hiding her face upon the other 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 7]: ` O , my good Lord !
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 5]: He 's down there !
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 4]: Down there ! '
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 34]: At first this , and her terrific screams , were all that could be got from Rachael , by any tears , by any prayers , by any representations , by any means .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 26]: It was impossible to hush her ; and it was deadly necessary to hold her , or she would have flung herself down the shaft .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 20]: ` Rachael , dear Rachael , good Rachael , for the love of Heaven , not these dreadful cries !
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 13]: Think of Stephen , think of Stephen , think of Stephen ! '
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 40]: By an earnest repetition of this entreaty , poured out in all the agony of such a moment , Sissy at last brought her to be silent , and to look at her with a tearless face of stone .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 8]: ` Rachael , Stephen may be living .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 27]: You would n't leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place , a moment , if you could bring help to him ? '
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 8]: ` No , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 11]: ` Do n't stir from here , for his sake !
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 7]: Let me go and listen . '
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 29]: She shuddered to approach the pit ; but she crept towards it on her hands and knees , and called to him as loud as she could call .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 8]: She listened , but no sound replied .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 11]: She called again and listened ; still no answering sound .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 9]: She did this , twenty , thirty times .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 21]: She took a little clod of earth from the broken ground where he had stumbled , and threw it in .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 7]: She could not hear it fall .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 36]: The wide prospect , so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago , almost carried despair to her brave heart , as she rose and looked all round her , seeing no help .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 10]: ` Rachael , we must lose not a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 10]: We must go in different directions , seeking aid .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 19]: You shall go by the way we have come , and I will go forward by the path .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 13]: Tell any one you see , and every one what has happened .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 9]: Think of Stephen , think of Stephen ! '
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 13]: She knew by Rachael 's face that she might trust her now .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 59]: And after standing for a moment to see her running , wringing her hands as she ran , she turned and went upon her own search ; she stopped at the hedge to tie her shawl there as a guide to the place , then threw her bonnet aside , and ran as she had never run before .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 11]: Run , Sissy , run , in Heaven 's name !
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 6]: Do n't stop for breath .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 4]: Run , run !
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 56]: Quickening herself by carrying such entreaties in her thoughts , she ran from field to field , and lane to lane , and place to place , as she had never run before ; until she came to a shed by an engine-house , where two men lay in the shade , asleep on straw .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 44]: First to wake them , and next to tell them , all so wild and breathless as she was , what had brought her there , were difficulties ; but they no sooner understood her than their spirits were on fire like hers .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 50]: One of the men was in a drunken slumber , but on his comrade 's shouting to him that a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft , he started out to a pool of dirty water , put his head in it , and came back sober .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 23]: With these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further , and with that one to another , while they ran elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 35]: Then a horse was found ; and she got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad , and send a message to Louisa , which she wrote and gave him .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 43]: By this time a whole village was up : and windlasses , ropes , poles , candles , lanterns , all things necessary , were fast collecting and being brought into one place , to be carried to the Old Hell Shaft .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 24]: It seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man lying in the grave where he had been buried alive .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 48]: She could not bear to remain away from it any longer -- it was like deserting him -- and she hurried swiftly back , accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers , including the drunken man whom the news had sobered , and who was the best man of all .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 20]: When they came to the Old Hell Shaft , they found it as lonely as she had left it .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 40]: The men called and listened as she had done , and examined the edge of the chasm , and settled how it had happened , and then sat down to wait until the implements they wanted should come up .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 38]: Every sound of insects in the air , every stirring of the leaves , every whisper among these men , made Sissy tremble , for she thought it was a cry at the bottom of the pit .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 27]: But the wind blew idly over it , and no sound arose to the surface , and they sat upon the grass , waiting and waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 30]: After they had waited some time , straggling people who had heard of the accident began to come up ; then the real help of implements began to arrive .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 25]: In the midst of this , Rachael returned ; and with her party there was a surgeon , who brought some wine and medicines .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 19]: But , the expectation among the people that the man would be found alive was very slight indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 50]: There being now people enough present to impede the work , the sobered man put himself at the head of the rest , or was put there by the general consent , and made a large ring round the Old Hell Shaft , and appointed men to keep it .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 54]: Besides such volunteers as were accepted to work , only Sissy and Rachael were at first permitted within this ring ; but , later in the day , when the message brought an express from Coketown , Mr. Gradgrind and Louisa , and Mr. Bounderby , and the whelp , were also there .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 36]: The sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and Rachael had first sat down upon the grass , before a means of enabling two men to descend securely was rigged with poles and ropes .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 30]: Difficulties had arisen in the construction of this machine , simple as it was ; requisites had been found wanting , and messages had had to go and return .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 50]: It was five o'clock in the afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday , before a candle was sent down to try the air , while three or four rough faces stood crowded close together , attentively watching it : the man at the windlass lowering as they were told .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 18]: The candle was brought up again , feebly burning , and then some water was cast in .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 26]: Then the bucket was hooked on ; and the sobered man and another got in with lights , giving the word ` Lower away ! '
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 41]: As the rope went out , tight and strained , and the windlass creaked , there was not a breath among the one or two hundred men and women looking on , that came as it was wont to come .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 15]: The signal was given and the windlass stopped , with abundant rope to spare .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 25]: Apparently so long an interval ensued with the men at the windlass standing idle , that some women shrieked that another accident had happened !
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 25]: But the surgeon who held the watch , declared five minutes not to have elapsed yet , and sternly admonished them to keep silence .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 16]: He had not well done speaking , when the windlass was reversed and worked again .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 28]: Practised eyes knew that it did not go as heavily as it would if both workmen had been coming up , and that only one was returning .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 30]: The rope came in tight and strained ; and ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass , and all eyes were fastened on the pit .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 14]: The sobered man was brought up and leaped out briskly on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: There was an universal cry of ` Alive or dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 8]: and then a deep , profound hush .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 7]: When he said ` Alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 12]: a great shout arose and many eyes had tears in them .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 22]: ` But he 's hurt very bad , ' he added , as soon as he could make himself heard again .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 5]: ` Where 's doctor ?
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 19]: He 's hurt so very bad , sir , that we donno how to get him up . '
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 27]: They all consulted together , and looked anxiously at the surgeon , as he asked some questions , and shook his head on receiving the replies .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 32]: The sun was setting now ; and the red light in the evening sky touched every face there , and caused it to be distinctly seen in all its rapt suspense .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 29]: The consultation ended in the men returning to the windlass , and the pitman going down again , carrying the wine and some other small matters with him .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 7]: Then the other man came up .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 44]: In the meantime , under the surgeon 's directions , some men brought a hurdle , on which others made a thick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw , while he himself contrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 76]: As these were made , they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last come up , with instructions how to use them : and as he stood , shown by the light he carried , leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the poles , and sometimes glancing down the pit , and sometimes glancing round upon the people , he was not the least conspicuous figure in the scene .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 10]: It was dark now , and torches were kindled .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 59]: It appeared from the little this man said to those about him , which was quickly repeated all over the circle , that the lost man had fallen upon a mass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was half choked up , and that his fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the side .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 71]: He lay upon his back with one arm doubled under him , and according to his own belief had hardly stirred since he fell , except that he had moved his free hand to a side pocket , in which he remembered to have some bread and meat -LRB- of which he had swallowed crumbs -RRB- , and had likewise scooped up a little water in it now and then .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 39]: He had come straight away from his work , on being written to , and had walked the whole journey ; and was on his way to Mr. Bounderby 's country house after dark , when he fell .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 38]: He was crossing that dangerous country at such a dangerous time , because he was innocent of what was laid to his charge , and could n't rest from coming the nearest way to deliver himself up .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 48]: The Old Hell Shaft , the pitman said , with a curse upon it , was worthy of its bad name to the last ; for though Stephen could speak now , he believed it would soon be found to have mangled the life out of him .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 34]: When all was ready , this man , still taking his last hurried charges from his comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him , disappeared into the pit .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 19]: The rope went out as before , the signal was made as before , and the windlass stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 9]: No man removed his hand from it now .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 24]: Every one waited with his grasp set , and his body bent down to the work , ready to reverse and wind in .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 14]: At length the signal was given , and all the ring leaned forward .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 30]: For , now , the rope came in , tightened and strained to its utmost as it appeared , and the men turned heavily , and the windlass complained .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 17]: It was scarcely endurable to look at the rope , and think of its giving way .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 70]: But , ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass safely , and the connecting chains appeared , and finally the bucket with the two men holding on at the sides -- a sight to make the head swim , and oppress the heart -- and tenderly supporting between them , slung and tied within , the figure of a poor , crushed , human creature .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 41]: A low murmur of pity went round the throng , and the women wept aloud , as this form , almost without form , was moved very slowly from its iron deliverance , and laid upon the bed of straw .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 12]: At first , none but the surgeon went close to it .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 24]: He did what he could in its adjustment on the couch , but the best that he could do was to cover it .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 12]: That gently done , he called to him Rachael and Sissy .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 44]: And at that time the pale , worn , patient face was seen looking up at the sky , with the broken right hand lying bare on the outside of the covering garments , as if waiting to be taken by another hand .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 20]: They gave him drink , moistened his face with water , and administered some drops of cordial and wine .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 20]: Though he lay quite motionless looking up at the sky , he smiled and said , ` Rachael . '
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 38]: She stooped down on the grass at his side , and bent over him until her eyes were between his and the sky , for he could not so much as turn them to look at her .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 7]: ` Rachael , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 5]: She took his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 15]: He smiled again and said , ` Do n't let ' t go . '
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 15]: ` Thou ` rt in great pain , my own dear Stephen ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 9]: I ha ' been , but not now .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 22]: I ha ' been -- dreadful , and dree , and long , my dear -- but 't is ower now .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 8]: Ah , Rachael , aw a muddle !
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 10]: Fro ' first to last , a muddle ! '
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 16]: The spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said the word . '
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 57]: I ha ' fell into th ' pit , my dear , as have cost wi'in the knowledge o ' old fok now livin , hundreds and hundreds o ' men 's lives -- fathers , sons , brothers , dear to thousands an ' thousands , an ' keeping 'em fro ' want and hunger .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 20]: I ha ' fell into a pit that ha ' been wi ' th ' Firedamp crueller than battle .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 73]: I ha ' read on ' t in the public petition , as onny one may read , fro ' the men that works in pits , in which they ha ' pray 'n and pray 'n the lawmakers for Christ 's sake not to let their work be murder to 'em , but to spare 'em for th ' wives and children that they loves as well as gentlefok loves theirs .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 22]: When it were in work , it killed wi'out need ; when 't is let alone , it kills wi'out need .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 23]: See how we die an ' no need , one way an ' another -- in a muddle -- every day ! '
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 12]: He faintly said it , without any anger against any one .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 5]: Merely as the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 13]: ` Thy little sister , Rachael , thou hast not forgot her .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 16]: Thou ` rt not like to forget her now , and me so nigh her .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 68]: Thou know ` st -- poor , patient , suff ` rin , dear -- how thou didst work for her , seet 'n all day long in her little chair at thy winder , and how she died , young and misshapen , awlung o ' sickly air as had 'n no need to be , an ' awlung o ' working people 's miserable homes .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 3]: A muddle !
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 5]: Aw a muddle ! '
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 22]: Louisa approached him ; but he could not see her , lying with his face turned up to the night sky .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 30]: ` If aw th ' things that tooches us , my dear , was not so muddled , I should 'n ha ' had 'n need to coom heer .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 30]: If we was not in a muddle among ourseln , I should 'n ha ' been , by my own fellow weavers and workin ' brothers , so mistook .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 32]: If Mr. Bounderby had ever know 'd me right -- if he 'd ever know 'd me at aw -- he would 'n ha ' took 'n offence wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 9]: He would 'n ha ' suspect 'n me .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 7]: But look up yonder , Rachael !
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 4]: Look aboove ! '
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 14]: Following his eyes , she saw that he was gazing at a star .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 22]: ` It ha ' shined upon me , ' he said reverently , ` in my pain and trouble down below .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 8]: It ha ' shined into my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 33]: I ha ' look 'n at ' t and thowt o ' thee , Rachael , till the muddle in my mind have cleared awa , above a bit , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 30]: If soom ha ' been wantin ' in unnerstan ` in me better , I , too , ha ' been wantin ' in unnerstan ` in them better .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 43]: When I got thy letter , I easily believen that what the yoong ledy sen and done to me , and what her brother sen and done to me , was one , and that there were a wicked plot betwixt 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 31]: When I fell , I were in anger wi ' her , an ' hurryin on t ' be as onjust t ' her as oothers was t ' me .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 17]: But in our judgments , like as in our doins , we mun bear and forbear .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 73]: In my pain an ' trouble , lookin up yonder , -- wi ' it shinin on me -- I ha ' seen more clear , and ha ' made it my dyin prayer that aw th ' world may on ' y coom toogether more , an ' get a better unnerstan ` in o ' one another , than when I were in ' t my own weak seln . '
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 23]: Louisa hearing what he said , bent over him on the opposite side to Rachael , so that he could see her .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 7]: ` You ha ' heard ? '
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 11]: he said , after a few moments ' silence . '
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 10]: I ha ' not forgot you , ledy . '
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 10]: ` Yes , Stephen , I have heard you .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 7]: And your prayer is mine . '
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 7]: ` You ha ' a father .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 10]: Will yo tak ' a message to him ? '
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 12]: ` He is here , ' said Louisa , with dread .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 9]: ` Shall I bring him to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 6]: ` If yo please . '
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 6]: Louisa returned with her father .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 12]: Standing hand-in-hand , they both looked down upon the solemn countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 18]: ` Sir , yo will clear me an ' mak my name good wi ' aw men .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 7]: This I leave to yo . '
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 8]: Mr. Gradgrind was troubled and asked how ?
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 16]: ` Sir , ' was the reply : ` yor son will tell yo how .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 3]: Ask him .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 16]: I mak no charges : I leave none ahint me : not a single word .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 16]: I ha ' seen an ' spok 'n wi ' yor son , one night .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 59]: I ask no more o ' yo than that yo clear me -- an ' I trust to yo to do ` t. ' The bearers being now ready to carry him away , and the surgeon being anxious for his removal , those who had torches or lanterns , prepared to go in front of the litter .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 60]: Before it was raised , and while they were arranging how to go , he said to Rachael , looking upward at the star : ` Often as I coom to myseln , and found it shinin ' on me down there in my trouble , I thowt it were the star as guided to Our Saviour 's home .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 10]: I awmust think it be the very star ! '
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 30]: They lifted him up , and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to take him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 6]: ` Rachael , beloved lass !
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 7]: Do n't let go my hand .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 13]: We may walk toogether t ` night , my dear ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 18]: I will hold thy hand , and keep beside thee , Stephen , all the way . '
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 4]: ` Bless thee !
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 10]: Will soombody be pleased to coover my face ! '
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 28]: They carried him very gently along the fields , and down the lanes , and over the wide landscape ; Rachael always holding the hand in hers .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 8]: Very few whispers broke the mournful silence .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 7]: It was soon a funeral procession .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 33]: The star had shown him where to find the God of the poor ; and through humility , and sorrow , and forgiveness , he had gone to his Redeemer 's rest .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 26]: Chapter VII -- Whelp -- Hunting BEFORE the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was broken , one figure had disappeared from within it .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 26]: Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa , who held her father 's arm , but in a retired place by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 50]: When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to the couch , Sissy , attentive to all that happened , slipped behind that wicked shadow -- a sight in the horror of his face , if there had been eyes there for any sight but one -- and whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 16]: Without turning his head , he conferred with her a few moments , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 14]: Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 24]: When the father reached home , he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby 's , desiring his son to come to him directly .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 31]: The reply was , that Mr. Bounderby having missed him in the crowd , and seeing nothing of him since , had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge . '
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 20]: I believe , father , ' said Louisa , ` he will not come back to town to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 10]: Mr. Gradgrind turned away , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 51]: In the morning , he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was opened , and seeing his son 's place empty -LRB- he had not the courage to look in at first -RRB- went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way there .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 39]: To whom he said that , for reasons he would soon explain , but entreated not then to be asked for , he had found it necessary to employ his son at a distance for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 21]: Also , that he was charged with the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool 's memory , and declaring the thief .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 27]: Mr. Bounderby quite confounded , stood stock-still in the street after his father-in-law had left him , swelling like an immense soap-bubble , without its beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 18]: Mr. Gradgrind went home , locked himself in his room , and kept it all that day .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 28]: When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door , he said , without opening it , ` Not now , my dears ; in the evening . '
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 20]: On their return in the evening , he said , ' I am not able yet -- to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 25]: He ate nothing all day , and had no candle after dark ; and they heard him walking to and fro late at night .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 23]: But , in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour , and took his usual place at the table .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 39]: Aged and bent he looked , and quite bowed down ; and yet he looked a wiser man , and a better man , than in the days when in this life he wanted nothing -- but Facts .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 29]: Before he left the room , he appointed a time for them to come to him ; and so , with his gray head drooping , went away .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 22]: ` Dear father , ' said Louisa , when they kept their appointment , ` you have three young children left .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 17]: They will be different , I will be different yet , with Heaven 's help . '
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 16]: She gave her hand to Sissy , as if she meant with her help too .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 10]: ` Your wretched brother , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 21]: ` Do you think he had planned this robbery , when he went with you to the lodging ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 6]: I fear so , father .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 17]: I know he had wanted money very much , and had spent a great deal . '
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 25]: ` The poor man being about to leave the town , it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 15]: I think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there , father .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 10]: For I asked him to go there with me .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 9]: The visit did not originate with him . '
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 10]: ` He had some conversation with the poor man .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 7]: Did he take him aside ? '
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 9]: ` He took him out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 49]: I asked him afterwards , why he had done so , and he made a plausible excuse ; but since last night , father , and when I remember the circumstances by its light , I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them . '
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 28]: ` Let me know , ' said her father , ` if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 67]: I fear , father , ' hesitated Louisa , ` that he must have made some representation to Stephen Blackpool -- perhaps in my name , perhaps in his own -- which induced him to do in good faith and honesty , what he had never done before , and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before he left the town . '
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 5]: ` Too plain ! '
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 4]: returned the father .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 5]: ` Too plain ! '
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 12]: He shaded his face , and remained silent for some moments .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 17]: Recovering himself , he said : ` And now , how is he to be found ?
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 9]: How is he to be saved from justice ?
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 31]: In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth , how is he to be found by us , and only by us ?
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 9]: Ten thousand pounds could not effect it . '
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 9]: ` Sissy has effected it , father . '
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 39]: He raised his eyes to where she stood , like a good fairy in his house , and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness , ` It is always you , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 68]: ` We had our fears , ' Sissy explained , glancing at Louisa , ` before yesterday ; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last night , and heard what passed -LRB- being close to Rachael all the time -RRB- , I went to him when no one saw , and said to him , `` Do n't look at me .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 6]: See where your father is .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 12]: Escape at once , for his sake and your own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 28]: He was in a tremble before I whispered to him , and he started and trembled more then , and said , `` Where can I go ?
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 17]: I have very little money , and I do n't know who will hide me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 8]: I thought of father 's old circus .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 27]: I have not forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year , and I read of him in a paper only the other day .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 23]: I told him to hurry there , and tell his name , and ask Mr. Sleary to hide him till I came .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 14]: `` I 'll get to him before the morning , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 11]: And I saw him shrink away among the people . '
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 5]: ` Thank Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 4]: exclaimed his father .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 9]: ` He may be got abroad yet . '
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 36]: It was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had directed him was within three hours ' journey of Liverpool , whence he could be swiftly dispatched to any part of the world .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 99]: But , caution being necessary in communicating with him -- for there was a greater danger every moment of his being suspected now , and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr. Bounderby himself , in a bullying vein of public zeal , might play a Roman part -- it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in question , by a circuitous course , alone ; and that the unhappy father , setting forth in an opposite direction , should get round to the same bourne by another and wider route .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 82]: It was further agreed that he should not present himself to Mr. Sleary , lest his intentions should be mistrusted , or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to take flight anew ; but , that the communication should be left to Sissy and Louisa to open ; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery and disgrace , of his father 's being at hand and of the purpose for which they had come .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 26]: When these arrangements had been well considered and were fully understood by all three , it was time to begin to carry them into execution .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 53]: Early in the afternoon , Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from his own house into the country , to be taken up on the line by which he was to travel ; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different course , encouraged by not seeing any face they knew .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 64]: The two travelled all night , except when they were left , for odd numbers of minutes , at branch-places , up illimitable flights of steps , or down wells -- which was the only variety of those branches -- and , early in the morning , were turned out on a swamp , a mile or two from the town they sought .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 68]: From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old postilion , who happened to be up early , kicking a horse in a fly : and so were smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs lived : which , although not a magnificent or even savoury approach , was , as is usual in such cases , the legitimate highway .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 17]: The first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of Sleary 's Circus .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 20]: The company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off , and had opened there last night .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 22]: The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road , and the travelling on that road was very slow .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 56]: Though they took but a hasty breakfast , and no rest -LRB- which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances -RRB- , it was noon before they began to find the bills of Sleary 's Horse-riding on barns and walls , and one o'clock when they stopped in the market-place .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 34]: A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders , commencing at that very hour , was in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon the stones of the street .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 25]: Sissy recommended that , to avoid making inquiries and attracting attention in the town , they should present themselves to pay at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 22]: If Mr. Sleary were taking the money , he would be sure to know her , and would proceed with discretion .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 31]: If he were not , he would be sure to see them inside ; and , knowing what he had done with the fugitive , would proceed with discretion still .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 14]: Therefore , they repaired , with fluttering hearts , to the well-remembered booth .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 27]: The flag with the inscription SLEARY 'S HORSE -- RIDING was there ; and the Gothic niche was there ; but Mr. Sleary was not there .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 73]: Master Kidderminster , grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest credulity as Cupid any more , had yielded to the invincible force of circumstances -LRB- and his beard -RRB- , and , in the capacity of a man who made himself generally useful , presided on this occasion over the exchequer -- having also a drum in reserve , on which to expend his leisure moments and superfluous forces .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 37]: In the extreme sharpness of his look out for base coin , Mr. Kidderminster , as at present situated , never saw anything but money ; so Sissy passed him unrecognised , and they went in .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 36]: The Emperor of Japan , on a steady old white horse stencilled with black spots , was twirling five wash-hand basins at once , as it is the favourite recreation of that monarch to do .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 25]: Sissy , though well acquainted with his Royal line , had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor , and his reign was peaceful .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 37]: Miss Josephine Sleary , in her celebrated graceful Equestrian Tyrolean Flower Act , was then announced by a new clown -LRB- who humorously said Cauliflower Act -RRB- , and Mr. Sleary appeared , leading her in .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 38]: Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long whip-lash , and the Clown had only said , ` If you do it again , I 'll throw the horse at you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 10]: when Sissy was recognised both by father and daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 34]: But they got through the Act with great self-possession ; and Mr. Sleary , saving for the first instant , conveyed no more expression into his locomotive eye than into his fixed one .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 34]: The performance seemed a little long to Sissy and Louisa , particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary -LRB- who said ` Indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 68]: to all his observations in the calmest way , and with his eye on the house -RRB- about two legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg , when in came four legs , and laid hold of one leg , and up got two legs , caught hold of three legs , and threw 'em at four legs , who ran away with one leg .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 36]: For , although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher , a three-legged stool , a dog , and a leg of mutton , this narrative consumed time ; and they were in great suspense .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 42]: At last , however , little fair-haired Josephine made her curtsey amid great applause ; and the Clown , left alone in the ring , had just warmed himself , and said , ` Now I 'll have a turn ! '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 12]: when Sissy was touched on the shoulder , and beckoned out .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 51]: She took Louisa with her ; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very little private apartment , with canvas sides , a grass floor , and a wooden ceiling all aslant , on which the box company stamped their approbation , as if they were coming through .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 25]: ` Thethilia , ' said Mr. Sleary , who had brandy and water at hand , ` it doth me good to thee you .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 22]: You wath alwayth a favourite with uth , and you 've done uth credith thinth the old timeth I 'm thure .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 26]: You mutht thee our people , my dear , afore we thpeak of bithnith , or they 'll break their hearth -- ethpethially the women .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 44]: Here ` th Jothphine hath been and got married to E. W. B. Childerth , and thee hath got a boy , and though he ` th only three yearth old , he thtickth on to any pony you can bring againtht him .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 33]: He ` th named The Little Wonder of Thcolathtic Equitation ; and if you do n't hear of that boy at Athley ` th , you 'll hear of him at Parith .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 15]: And you recollect Kidderminthter , that wath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf ?
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 6]: He ` th married too .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 4]: Married a widder .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 7]: Old enough to be hith mother .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 19]: Thee wath Tightrope , thee wath , and now thee ` th nothing -- on accounth of fat .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 19]: They 've got two children , tho we 're thtrong in the Fairy bithnith and the Nurthery dodge .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 82]: If you wath to thee our Children in the Wood , with their father and mother both a dyin ' on a horthe -- their uncle a retheiving of 'em ath hith wardth , upon a horthe -- themthelvth both a goin ' a black-berryin ' on a horthe -- and the Robinth a coming in to cover 'em with leavth , upon a horthe -- you 'd thay it wath the completetht thing ath ever you thet your eyeth on !
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 19]: And you remember Emma Gordon , my dear , ath wath a ` motht a mother to you ?
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 10]: Of courthe you do ; I need n't athk .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 7]: Emma , thee lotht her huthband .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 66]: He wath throw 'd a heavy back-fall off a Elephant in a thort of a Pagoda thing ath the Thultan of the Indieth , and he never got the better of it ; and thee married a thecond time -- married a Cheethemonger ath fell in love with her from the front -- and he ` th a Overtheer and makin ' a fortun . '
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 37]: These various changes , Mr. Sleary , very short of breath now , related with great heartiness , and with a wonderful kind of innocence , considering what a bleary and brandy-and-watery old veteran he was .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 39]: Afterwards he brought in Josephine , and E. W. B. Childers -LRB- rather deeply lined in the jaws by daylight -RRB- , and the Little Wonder of Scholastic Equitation , and in a word , all the company .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 52]: Amazing creatures they were in Louisa 's eyes , so white and pink of complexion , so scant of dress , and so demonstrative of leg ; but it was very agreeable to see them crowding about Sissy , and very natural in Sissy to be unable to refrain from tears .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 42]: Now Thethilia hath kithd all the children , and hugged all the women , and thaken handth all round with all the men , clear , every one of you , and ring in the band for the thecond part ! '
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 14]: As soon as they were gone , he continued in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 27]: ` Now , Thethilia , I do n't athk to know any thecreth , but I thuppothe I may conthider thith to be Mith Thquire . '
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 6]: ` This is his sister .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 9]: ` And t ` other o n'th daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 7]: That ' h what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 8]: Hope I thee you well , mith .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 10]: And I hope the Thquire ` th well ? '
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 20]: ` My father will be here soon , ' said Louisa , anxious to bring him to the point .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 7]: ` Is my brother safe ? '
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 6]: ` Thafe and thound ! '
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 4]: he replied . '
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 17]: I want you jutht to take a peep at the Ring , mith , through here .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 14]: Thethilia , you know the dodgeth ; find a thpy-hole for yourthelf . '
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 10]: They each looked through a chink in the boards .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 19]: ` That ' h Jack the Giant Killer -- piethe of comic infant bithnith , ' said Sleary .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 91]: ` There ` th a property-houthe , you thee , for Jack to hide in ; there ` th my Clown with a thauthepan-lid and a thpit , for Jack ` th thervant ; there ` th little Jack himthelf in a thplendid thoot of armour ; there ` th two comic black thervanth twithe ath big ath the houthe , to thtand by it and to bring it in and clear it ; and the Giant -LRB- a very ecthpenthive bathket one -RRB- , he a n't on yet .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 9]: Now , do you thee 'em all ? '
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' they both said .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 16]: ` Look at 'em again , ' said Sleary , ` look at 'em well .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 5]: You thee em all ?
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 29]: Now , mith ; ' he put a form for them to sit on ; ' I have my opinionth , and the Thquire your father hath hith .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 23]: I do n't want to know what your brother ` th been up to ; ith better for me not to know .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 20]: All I thay ith , the Thquire hath thtood by Thethilia , and I 'll thtand by the Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 9]: Your brother ith one them black thervanth . '
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 13]: Louisa uttered an exclamation , partly of distress , partly of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 25]: ` Ith a fact , ' said Sleary , ` and even knowin ' it , you could n't put your finger on him .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 5]: Let the Thquire come .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 10]: I thall keep your brother here after the performanth .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 12]: I thant undreth him , nor yet wath hith paint off .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 35]: Let the Thquire come here after the performanth , or come here yourthelf after the performanth , and you thall find your brother , and have the whole plathe to talk to him in .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 17]: Never mind the lookth of him , ath long ath he ` th well hid . '
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 18]: Louisa , with many thanks and with a lightened load , detained Mr. Sleary no longer then .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 27]: She left her love for her brother , with her eyes full of tears ; and she and Sissy went away until later in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 8]: Mr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 30]: He too had encountered no one whom he knew ; and was now sanguine with Sleary 's assistance , of getting his disgraced son to Liverpool in the night .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 65]: As neither of the three could be his companion without almost identifying him under any disguise , he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust , beseeching him to ship the bearer off at any cost , to North or South America , or any distant part of the world to which he could be the most speedily and privately dispatched .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 31]: This done , they walked about , waiting for the Circus to be quite vacated ; not only by the audience , but by the company and by the horses .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 35]: After watching it a long time , they saw Mr. Sleary bring out a chair and sit down by the side-door , smoking ; as if that were his signal that they might approach .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 16]: ` Your thervant , Thquire , ' was his cautious salutation as they passed in .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 11]: ` If you want me you 'll find me here .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 13]: You muth n't mind your thon having a comic livery on . '
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 26]: They all three went in ; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn , on the Clown 's performing chair in the middle of the ring .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 39]: On one of the back benches , remote in the subdued light and the strangeness of the place , sat the villainous whelp , sulky to the last , whom he had the misery to call his son .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 111]: In a preposterous coat , like a beadle 's , with cuffs and flaps exaggerated to an unspeakable extent ; in an immense waistcoat , knee-breeches , buckled shoes , and a mad cocked hat ; with nothing fitting him , and everything of coarse material , moth-eaten and full of holes ; with seams in his black face , where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition daubed all over it ; anything so grimly , detestably , ridiculously shameful as the whelp in his comic livery , Mr. Gradgrind never could by any other means have believed in , weighable and measurable fact though it was .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 11]: And one of his model children had come to this !
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 19]: At first the whelp would not draw any nearer , but persisted in remaining up there by himself .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 63]: Yielding at length , if any concession so sullenly made can be called yielding , to the entreaties of Sissy -- for Louisa he disowned altogether -- he came down , bench by bench , until he stood in the sawdust , on the verge of the circle , as far as possible , within its limits from where his father sat .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 7]: ` How was this done ? '
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 4]: asked the father .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 7]: ` How was what done ? '
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 5]: moodily answered the son .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 17]: ` This robbery , ' said the father , raising his voice upon the word . '
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 18]: I forced the safe myself over night , and shut it up ajar before I went away .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 13]: I had had the key that was found , made long before .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 16]: I dropped it that morning , that it might be supposed to have been used .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 10]: I did n't take the money all at once .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 15]: I pretended to put my balance away every night , but I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 8]: Now you know all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 26]: ` If a thunderbolt had fallen on me , ' said the father , ` it would have shocked me less than this ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 11]: I do n't see why , ' grumbled the son .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 24]: ` So many people are employed in situations of trust ; so many people , out of so many , will be dishonest .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 16]: I have heard you talk , a hundred times , of its being a law .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 6]: How can I help laws ?
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 10]: You have comforted others with such things , father .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 4]: Comfort yourself ! '
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 40]: The father buried his face in his hands , and the son stood in his disgraceful grotesqueness , biting straw : his hands , with the black partly worn away inside , looking like the hands of a monkey .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 27]: The evening was fast closing in ; and from time to time , he turned the whites of his eyes restlessly and impatiently towards his father .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 23]: They were the only parts of his face that showed any life or expression , the pigment upon it was so thick .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 14]: ` You must be got to Liverpool , and sent abroad . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 5]: I suppose I must .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 26]: I ca n't be more miserable anywhere , ' whimpered the whelp , ` than I have been here , ever since I can remember .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 6]: That 's one thing . '
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 27]: Mr. Gradgrind went to the door , and returned with Sleary , to whom he submitted the question , How to get this deplorable object away ?
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 12]: ` Why , I 've been thinking of it , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 17]: There ` th not muth time to lothe , tho you muth thay yeth or no .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 8]: Ith over twenty mileth to the rail .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 24]: There ` th a coath in half an hour , that goeth to the rail , ` purpothe to cath the mail train .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 10]: That train will take him right to Liverpool . '
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 11]: ` But look at him , ' groaned Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 24]: ` Will any coach -- ' ' I do n't mean that he thould go in the comic livery , ' said Sleary .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 25]: ` Thay the word , and I 'll make a Jothkin of him , out of the wardrobe , in five minutes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 11]: I do n't understand , ' said Mr. Gradgrind . '
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 6]: A Jothkin -- a Carter .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 8]: Make up your mind quick , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 7]: There 'll be beer to feth .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 17]: I 've never met with nothing but beer ath 'll ever clean a comic blackamoor . '
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 49]: Mr. Gradgrind rapidly assented ; Mr. Sleary rapidly turned out from a box , a smock frock , a felt hat , and other essentials ; the whelp rapidly changed clothes behind a screen of baize ; Mr. Sleary rapidly brought beer , and washed him white again .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 36]: ` Now , ' said Sleary , ` come along to the coath , and jump up behind ; I 'll go with you there , and they 'll thuppothe you one of my people .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 14]: Thay farewell to your family , and tharp ` th the word . '
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 6]: With which he delicately retired .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 11]: ` Here is your letter , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 10]: ` All necessary means will be provided for you .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 26]: Atone , by repentance and better conduct , for the shocking action you have committed , and the dreadful consequences to which it has led .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 19]: Give me your hand , my poor boy , and may God forgive you as I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 17]: The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 13]: But , when Louisa opened her arms , he repulsed her afresh .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 4]: ` Not you .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 14]: I do n't want to have anything to say to you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 16]: O Tom , Tom , do we end so , after all my love ! '
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 7]: ` After all your love ! '
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 5]: he returned , obdurately .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 4]: ` Pretty love !
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 27]: Leaving old Bounderby to himself , and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off , and going home just when I was in the greatest danger .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 4]: Pretty love that !
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 23]: Coming out with every word about our having gone to that place , when you saw the net was gathering round me .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 4]: Pretty love that !
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 7]: You have regularly given me up .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 7]: You never cared for me . '
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 8]: ` Tharp ` th the word ! '
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 7]: said Sleary , at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 54]: They all confusedly went out : Louisa crying to him that she forgave him , and loved him still , and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so , and glad to think of these her last words , far away : when some one ran against them .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 23]: Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy , who were both before him while his sister yet clung to his shoulder , stopped and recoiled .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 52]: For , there was Bitzer , out of breath , his thin lips parted , his thin nostrils distended , his white eyelashes quivering , his colourless face more colourless than ever , as if he ran himself into a white heat , when other people ran themselves into a glow .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 30]: There he stood , panting and heaving , as if he had never stopped since the night , now long ago , when he had run them down before .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 31]: ` I 'm sorry to interfere with your plans , ' said Bitzer , shaking his head , ` but I ca n't allow myself to be done by horse-riders .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 31]: I must have young Mr. Tom ; he must n't be got away by horse-riders ; here he is in a smock frock , and I must have him ! '
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 9]: By the collar , too , it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 9]: For , so he took possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 20]: Chapter VIII -- Philosophical THEY went back into the booth , Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders out .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 28]: Bitzer , still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar , stood in the Ring , blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 24]: ` Bitzer , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , broken down , and miserably submissive to him , ` have you a heart ? '
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 27]: ` The circulation , sir , ' returned Bitzer , smiling at the oddity of the question , ` could n't be carried on without one .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 29]: No man , sir , acquainted with the facts established by Harvey relating to the circulation of the blood , can doubt that I have a heart . '
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 17]: ` Is it accessible , ' cried Mr. Gradgrind , ` to any compassionate influence ? '
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 16]: ` It is accessible to Reason , sir , ' returned the excellent young man .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 7]: ` And to nothing else . '
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 18]: They stood looking at each other ; Mr. Gradgrind 's face as white as the pursuer 's .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 34]: ` What motive -- even what motive in reason -- can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` and crushing his miserable father ?
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 5]: See his sister here .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 4]: Pity us ! '
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 45]: ` Sir , ' returned Bitzer , in a very business-like and logical manner , ` since you ask me what motive I have in reason , for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown , it is only reasonable to let you know .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 13]: I have suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 17]: I had had my eye upon him before that time , for I knew his ways .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 44]: I have kept my observations to myself , but I have made them ; and I have got ample proofs against him now , besides his running away , and besides his own confession , which I was just in time to overhear .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 16]: I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning , and following you here .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 22]: I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown , in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 21]: Sir , I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom 's situation .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 26]: And I wish to have his situation , sir , for it will be a rise to me , and will do me good . '
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 18]: ` If this is solely a question of self-interest with you -- ' Mr. Gradgrind began . '
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 32]: I beg your pardon for interrupting you , sir , ' returned Bitzer ; ` but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 13]: What you must always appeal to , is a person 's self-interest .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 6]: It 's your only hold .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 5]: We are so constituted .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 21]: I was brought up in that catechism when I was very young , sir , as you are aware . '
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 21]: ` What sum of money , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` will you set against your expected promotion ? '
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 27]: ` Thank you , sir , ' returned Bitzer , ` for hinting at the proposal ; but I will not set any sum against it .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 54]: Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative , I have gone over the calculations in my mind ; and I find that to compound a felony , even on very high terms indeed , would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank . '
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 25]: ` Bitzer , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , stretching out his hands as though he would have said , See how miserable I am !
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 13]: ` Bitzer , I have but one chance left to soften you .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 8]: You were many years at my school .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 45]: If , in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there , you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son , I entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 26]: I really wonder , sir , ' rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative manner , ` to find you taking a position so untenable .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 22]: My schooling was paid for ; it was a bargain ; and when I came away , the bargain ended . '
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 17]: It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 18]: Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything , or render anybody help without purchase .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 17]: Gratitude was to be abolished , and the virtues springing from it were not to be .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 22]: Every inch of the existence of mankind , from birth to death , was to be a bargain across a counter .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 26]: And if we did n't get to Heaven that way , it was not a politico-economical place , and we had no business there . '
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 16]: I do n't deny , ' added Bitzer , ` that my schooling was cheap .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 7]: But that comes right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 19]: I was made in the cheapest market , and have to dispose of myself in the dearest . '
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 13]: He was a little troubled here , by Louisa and Sissy crying .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 24]: ` Pray do n't do that , ' said he , ` it 's of no use doing that : it only worries .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 21]: You seem to think that I have some animosity against young Mr. Tom ; whereas I have none at all .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 20]: I am only going , on the reasonable grounds I have mentioned , to take him back to Coketown .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 16]: If he was to resist , I should set up the cry of Stop thief !
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 14]: But , he wo n't resist , you may depend upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 36]: Mr. Sleary , who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as immovably jammed in his head as his fixed one , had listened to these doctrines with profound attention , here stepped forward .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 66]: ` Thquire , you know perfectly well , and your daughter knowth perfectly well -LRB- better than you , becauthe I thed it to her -RRB- , that I did n't know what your thon had done , and that I did n't want to know -- I thed it wath better not , though I only thought , then , it wath thome thkylarking .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 46]: However , thith young man having made it known to be a robbery of a bank , why , that ' h a theriouth thing ; muth too theriouth a thing for me to compound , ath thith young man hath very properly called it .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 34]: Conthequently , Thquire , you muth n't quarrel with me if I take thith young ma n'th thide , and thay he ` th right and there ` th no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 30]: But I tell you what I 'll do , Thquire ; I 'll drive your thon and thith young man over to the rail , and prevent expothure here .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 15]: I ca n't conthent to do more , but I 'll do that . '
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 24]: Fresh lamentations from Louisa , and deeper affliction on Mr. Gradgrind 's part , followed this desertion of them by their last friend .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 20]: But , Sissy glanced at him with great attention ; nor did she in her own breast misunderstand him .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 26]: As they were all going out again , he favoured her with one slight roll of his movable eye , desiring her to linger behind .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 27]: As he locked the door , he said excitedly : ` The Thquire thtood by you , Thethilia , and I 'll thtand by the Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 26]: More than that : thith ith a prethiouth rathcal , and belongth to that bluthtering Cove that my people nearly pitht out o ' winder .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 53]: It 'll be a dark night ; I 've got a horthe that 'll do anything but thpeak ; I 've got a pony that 'll go fifteen mile an hour with Childerth driving of him ; I 've got a dog that 'll keep a man to one plathe four-and-twenty hourth .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 8]: Get a word with the young Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 30]: Tell him , when he theeth our horthe begin to danthe , not to be afraid of being thpilt , but to look out for a pony-gig coming up .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 26]: Tell him , when he theeth that gig clothe by , to jump down , and it 'll take him off at a rattling pathe .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 20]: If my dog leth thith young man thtir a peg on foot , I give him leave to go .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 25]: And if my horthe ever thtirth from that thpot where he beginth a danthing , till the morning -- I do n't know him ?
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 8]: -- Tharp ` th the word ! '
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 35]: The word was so sharp , that in ten minutes Mr. Childers , sauntering about the market-place in a pair of slippers , had his cue , and Mr. Sleary 's equipage was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 37]: It was a fine sight , to behold the learned dog barking round it , and Mr. Sleary instructing him , with his one practicable eye , that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 55]: Soon after dark they all three got in and started ; the learned dog -LRB- a formidable creature -RRB- already pinning Bitzer with his eye , and sticking close to the wheel on his side , that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 14]: The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 18]: At eight o'clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared : both in high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 7]: ` All right , Thquire ! '
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 14]: said Mr. Sleary , ` your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 17]: Childerth took him off , an hour and a half after we left there latht night .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 38]: The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat -LRB- he would have walthed if he had n't been in harneth -RRB- , and then I gave him the word and he went to thleep comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 37]: When that prethiouth young Rathcal thed he 'd go for ` ard afoot , the dog hung on to hith neck-hankercher with all four legth in the air and pulled him down and rolled him over .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 29]: Tho he come back into the drag , and there he that , 'till I turned the horthe ` th head , at half-patht thixth thith morning . '
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 26]: Mr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks , of course ; and hinted as delicately as he could , at a handsome remuneration in money . '
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 35]: I do n't want money mythelf , Thquire ; but Childerth ith a family man , and if you wath to like to offer him a five-pound note , it might n't be unactheptable .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 30]: Likewithe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog , or a thet of bellth for the horthe , I thould be very glad to take 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 8]: Brandy and water I alwayth take . '
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 14]: He had already called for a glass , and now called for another .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 39]: ` If you would n't think it going too far , Thquire , to make a little thpread for the company at about three and thixth ahead , not reckoning Luth , it would make 'em happy . '
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 16]: All these little tokens of his gratitude , Mr. Gradgrind very willingly undertook to render .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 16]: Though he thought them far too slight , he said , for such a service .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 31]: ` Very well , Thquire ; then , if you 'll only give a Horthe-riding , a bethpeak , whenever you can , you 'll more than balanthe the account .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 21]: Now , Thquire , if your daughter will ethcuthe me , I thould like one parting word with you . '
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 44]: Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room ; Mr. Sleary , stirring and drinking his brandy and water as he stood , went on : ` Thquire , -- you do n't need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth . '
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 14]: ` Their instinct , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` is surprising . '
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 27]: ` Whatever you call it -- and I 'm bletht if I know what to call it ' -- said Sleary , ` it ith athtonithing .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 17]: The way in whith a dog 'll find you -- the dithtanthe he 'll come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 15]: ` His scent , ' said Mr. Gradgrind , ` being so fine . '
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 69]: ` I 'm bletht if I know what to call it , ' repeated Sleary , shaking his head , ` but I have had dogth find me , Thquire , in a way that made me think whether that dog had n't gone to another dog , and thed , `` You do n't happen to know a perthon of the name of Thleary , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 21]: Perthon of the name of Thleary , in the Horthe -- Riding way -- thtout man -- game eye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 39]: And whether that dog might n't have thed , `` Well , I ca n't thay I know him mythelf , but I know a dog that I think would be likely to be acquainted with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 19]: And whether that dog might n't have thought it over , and thed , `` Thleary , Thleary !
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 7]: O yeth , to be thure !
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 12]: A friend of mine menthioned him to me at one time .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 9]: I can get you hith addreth directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 38]: In conthequenth of my being afore the public , and going about tho muth , you thee , there mutht be a number of dogth acquainted with me , Thquire , that I do n't know ! '
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 11]: Mr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 32]: ` Any way , ' said Sleary , after putting his lips to his brandy and water , ` ith fourteen month ago , Thquire , thinthe we wath at Chethter .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 27]: We wath getting up our Children in the Wood one morning , when there cometh into our Ring , by the thtage door , a dog .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 24]: He had travelled a long way , he wath in a very bad condithon , he wath lame , and pretty well blind .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 58]: He went round to our children , one after another , as if he wath a theeking for a child he know 'd ; and then he come to me , and throwd hithelf up behind , and thtood on hith two forelegth , weak ath he wath , and then he wagged hith tail and died .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 8]: Thquire , that dog wath Merrylegth . '
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 8]: ` Sissy 's father 's dog ! '
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 10]: ` Thethilia ` th father ` th old dog .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 34]: Now , Thquire , I can take my oath , from my knowledge of that dog , that that man wath dead -- and buried -- afore that dog come back to me .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 21]: Joth ` phine and Childerth and me talked it over a long time , whether I thould write or not .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 7]: But we agreed , `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 19]: There ` th nothing comfortable to tell ; why unthettle her mind , and make her unhappy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 52]: Tho , whether her father bathely detherted her ; or whether he broke hith own heart alone , rather than pull her down along with him ; never will be known , now , Thquire , till -- no , not till we know how the dogth findth uth out ! '
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 35]: ` She keeps the bottle that he sent her for , to this hour ; and she will believe in his affection to the last moment of her life , ' said Mr. Gradgrind .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 18]: ` It theemth to prethent two thingth to a perthon , do n't it , Thquire ? '
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 83]: said Mr. Sleary , musing as he looked down into the depths of his brandy and water : ` one , that there ith a love in the world , not all Thelf-interetht after all , but thomething very different ; t ` other , that it bath a way of ith own of calculating or not calculating , whith thomehow or another ith at leatht ath hard to give a name to , ath the wayth of the dogth ith ! '
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 12]: Mr. Gradgrind looked out of window , and made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 10]: Mr. Sleary emptied his glass and recalled the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 10]: ` Thethilia my dear , kith me and good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 36]: Mith Thquire , to thee you treating of her like a thithter , and a thithter that you trutht and honour with all your heart and more , ith a very pretty thight to me .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 20]: I hope your brother may live to be better detherving of you , and a greater comfort to you .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 9]: Thquire , thake handth , firtht and latht !
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 9]: Do n't be croth with uth poor vagabondth .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 5]: People mutht be amuthed .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 25]: They ca n't be alwayth a learning , nor yet they ca n't be alwayth a working , they a n't made for it .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 7]: You mutht have uth , Thquire .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 22]: Do the withe thing and the kind thing too , and make the betht of uth ; not the wurtht ! '
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 35]: ` And I never thought before , ' said Mr. Sleary , putting his head in at the door again to say it , ` that I wath tho muth of a Cackler ! '
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 28]: Chapter IX -- Final IT is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain blusterer , before the vain blusterer sees it himself .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 19]: Mr. Bounderby felt that Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously anticipated him , and presumed to be wiser than he .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 45]: Inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant discovery of Mrs. Pegler , he turned this presumption , on the part of a woman in her dependent position , over and over in his mind , until it accumulated with turning like a great snowball .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 82]: At last he made the discovery that to discharge this highly connected female -- to have it in his power to say , ` She was a woman of family , and wanted to stick to me , but I would n't have it , and got rid of her ' -- would be to get the utmost possible amount of crowning glory out of the connection , and at the same time to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her deserts .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 33]: Filled fuller than ever , with this great idea , Mr. Bounderby came in to lunch , and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days , where his portrait was .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 22]: Mrs. Sparsit sat by the fire , with her foot in her cotton stirrup , little thinking whither she was posting .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 23]: Since the Pegler affair , this gentlewoman had covered her pity for Mr. Bounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and contrition .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 25]: In virtue thereof , it had become her habit to assume a woful look , which woful look she now bestowed upon her patron .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 10]: ` What 's the matter now , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 12]: said Mr. Bounderby , in a very short , rough way .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 19]: ` Pray , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , ` do not bite my nose off . '
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 9]: ` Bite your nose off , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 5]: ` Your nose ! '
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 18]: meaning , as Mrs. Sparsit conceived , that it was too developed a nose for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 22]: After which offensive implication , he cut himself a crust of bread , and threw the knife down with a noise .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 20]: Mrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup , and said , ` Mr. Bounderby , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 6]: ` Well , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 4]: retorted Mr. Bounderby .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 8]: ` What are you staring at ? '
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 21]: ` May I ask , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ` have you been ruffled this morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 6]: ` Yes , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 28]: ` May I inquire , sir , ' pursued the injured woman , ` whether I am the unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper ? '
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 25]: ` Now , I 'll tell you what , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , ' I am not come here to be bullied .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 35]: A female may be highly connected , but she ca n't be permitted to bother and badger a man in my position , and I am not going to put up with it . '
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 24]: -LRB- Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on : foreseeing that if he allowed of details , he would be beaten . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 24]: Mrs. Sparsit first elevated , then knitted , her Coriolanian eyebrows ; gathered up her work into its proper basket ; and rose .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 9]: ` Sir , ' said she , majestically .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 15]: ` It is apparent to me that I am in your way at present .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 9]: I will retire to my own apartment . '
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 11]: ` Allow me to open the door , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 14]: ` Thank you , sir ; I can do it for myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 42]: ` You had better allow me , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , passing her , and getting his hand upon the lock ; ` because I can take the opportunity of saying a word to you , before you go .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 17]: Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , I rather think you are cramped here , do you know ?
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 30]: It appears to me , that , under my humble roof , there 's hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people 's affairs . '
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 24]: Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn , and said with great politeness , ` Really , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 36]: I have been thinking it over , you see , since the late affairs have happened , ma'am , ' said Bounderby ; ` and it appears to my poor judgment -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 20]: Pray , sir , ' Mrs. Sparsit interposed , with sprightly cheerfulness , ` do n't disparage your judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 10]: Everybody knows how unerring Mr. Bounderby 's judgment is .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 7]: Everybody has had proofs of it .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 9]: It must be the theme of general conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 17]: Disparage anything in yourself but your judgment , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 37]: Mr. Bounderby , very red and uncomfortable , resumed : ` It appears to me , ma'am , I say , that a different sort of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of your powers .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 13]: Such an establishment as your relation , Lady Scadgers 's , now .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 18]: Do n't you think you might find some affairs there , ma'am , to interfere with ? '
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 29]: ` It never occurred to me before , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit ; ` but now you mention it , should think it highly probable . '
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 25]: ` Then suppose you try , ma'am , ' said Bounderby , laying an envelope with a cheque in it in her little basket .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 46]: ` You can take your own time for going , ma'am ; but perhaps in the meanwhile , it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind , to eat her meals by herself , and not to be intruded upon .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 25]: I really ought to apologise to you -- being only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown -- for having stood in your light so long . '
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 14]: ` Pray do n't name it , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 53]: ` If that portrait could speak , sir -- but it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others , -- it would testify , that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually addressed it as the picture of a Noodle .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 23]: Nothing that a Noodle does , can awaken surprise or indignation ; the proceedings of a Noodle can only inspire contempt . '
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 40]: Thus saying , Mrs. Sparsit , with her Roman features like a medal struck to commemorate her scorn of Mr. Bounderby , surveyed him fixedly from head to foot , swept disdainfully past him , and ascended the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 27]: Mr. Bounderby closed the door , and stood before the fire ; projecting himself after his old explosive manner into his portrait -- and into futurity .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 6]: Into how much of futurity ?
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 82]: He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily fight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury , with the grudging , smarting , peevish , tormenting Lady Scadgers , still laid up in bed with her mysterious leg , and gobbling her insufficient income down by about the middle of every quarter , in a mean little airless lodging , a mere closet for one , a mere crib for two ; but did he see more ?
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 58]: Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers , as the rising young man , so devoted to his master 's great merits , who had won young Tom 's place , and had almost captured young Tom himself , in the times when by various rascals he was spirited away ?
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 97]: Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will , whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs , past five-and-fifty years of age , each taking upon himself the name , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall , for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings , for ever attend a Bounderby chapel , for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain , for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate , and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs , with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster ?
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 57]: Had he any prescience of the day , five years to come , when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street , and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble , plunder , false pretences , vile example , little service and much law ?
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 3]: Probably not .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 10]: Yet the portrait was to see it all out .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 22]: Here was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day , and in the same hour , sitting thoughtful in his own room .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 8]: How much of futurity did he see ?
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 48]: Did he see himself , a white-haired decrepit man , bending his hitherto inflexible theories to appointed circumstances ; making his facts and figures subservient to Faith , Hope , and Charity ; and no longer trying to grind that Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills ?
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 16]: Did he catch sight of himself , therefore much despised by his late political associates ?
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 64]: Did he see them , in the era of its being quite settled that the national dustmen have only to do with one another , and owe no duty to an abstraction called a People , ` taunting the honourable gentleman ' with this and with that and with what not , five nights a-week , until the small hours of the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 11]: Probably he had that much foreknowledge , knowing his men .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 29]: Here was Louisa on the night of the same day , watching the fire as in days of yore , though with a gentler and a humbler face .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 11]: How much of the future might arise before her vision ?
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 61]: Broadsides in the streets , signed with her father 's name , exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool , weaver , from misplaced suspicion , and publishing the guilt of his own son , with such extenuation as his years and temptation -LRB- he could not bring himself to add , his education -RRB- might beseech ; were of the Present .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 30]: So , Stephen Blackpool 's tombstone , with her father 's record of his death , was almost of the Present , for she knew it was to be .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 7]: These things she could plainly see .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 8]: But , how much of the Future ?
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 134]: A working woman , christened Rachael , after a long illness once again appearing at the ringing of the Factory bell , and passing to and fro at the set hours , among the Coketown Hands ; a woman of pensive beauty , always dressed in black , but sweet-tempered and serene , and even cheerful ; who , of all the people in the place , alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded , drunken wretch of her own sex , who was sometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her , and crying to her ; a woman working , ever working , but content to do it , and preferring to do it as her natural lot , until she should be too old to labour any more ?
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 5]: Did Louisa see this ?
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 7]: Such a thing was to be .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 47]: A lonely brother , many thousands of miles away , writing , on paper blotted with tears , that her words had too soon come true , and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear face ?
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 61]: At length this brother coming nearer home , with hope of seeing her , and being delayed by illness ; and then a letter , in a strange hand , saying ` he died in hospital , of fever , such a day , and died in penitence and love of you : his last word being your name ' ?
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 6]: Did Louisa see these things ?
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 6]: Such things were to be .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 64]: Herself again a wife -- a mother -- lovingly watchful of her children , ever careful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than a childhood of the body , as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing , and a possession , any hoarded scrap of which , is a blessing and happiness to the wisest ?
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 5]: Did Louisa see this ?
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 8]: Such a thing was never to be .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 148]: But , happy Sissy 's happy children loving her ; all children loving her ; she , grown learned in childish lore ; thinking no innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised ; trying hard to know her humbler fellow-creatures , and to beautify their lives of machinery and reality with those imaginative graces and delights , without which the heart of infancy will wither up , the sturdiest physical manhood will be morally stark death , and the plainest national prosperity figures can show , will be the Writing on the Wall , -- she holding this course as part of no fantastic vow , or bond , or brotherhood , or sisterhood , or pledge , or covenant , or fancy dress , or fancy fair ; but simply as a duty to be done , -- did Louisa see these things of herself ?
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 6]: These things were to be .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 3]: Dear reader !
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 23]: It rests with you and me , whether , in our two fields of action , similar things shall be or not .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 4]: Let them be !
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 22]: We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth , to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and cold .
