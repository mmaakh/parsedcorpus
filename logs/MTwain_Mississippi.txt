Parsing [sent. 1 len. 27]: LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI BY MARK TWAIN THE ` BODY OF THE NATION ' BUT the basin of the Mississippi is the BODY OF THE NATION .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 21]: All the other parts are but members , important in themselves , yet more important in their relations to this .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 34]: Exclusive of the Lake basin and of 300,000 square miles in Texas and New Mexico , which in many aspects form a part of it , this basin contains about 1,250,000 square miles .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 21]: In extent it is the second great valley of the world , being exceeded only by that of the Amazon .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 82]: The valley of the frozen Obi approaches it in extent ; that of La Plata comes next in space , and probably in habitable capacity , having about eight-ninths of its area ; then comes that of the Yenisei , with about seven-ninths ; the Lena , Amoor , Hoang-ho , Yang-tse-kiang , and Nile , five-ninths ; the Ganges , less than one-half ; the Indus , less than one-third ; the Euphrates , one-fifth ; the Rhine , one-fifteenth .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 18]: It exceeds in extent the whole of Europe , exclusive of Russia , Norway , and Sweden .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 25]: IT WOULD CONTAIN AUSTRIA FOUR TIMES , GERMANY OR SPAIN FIVE TIMES , FRANCE SIX TIMES , THE BRITISH ISLANDS OR ITALY TEN TIMES .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 56]: Conceptions formed from the river-basins of Western Europe are rudely shocked when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi ; nor are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of Siberia , the lofty plateaus of Central Asia , or the mighty sweep of the swampy Amazon more adequate .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 23]: Latitude , elevation , and rainfall all combine to render every part of the Mississippi Valley capable of supporting a dense population .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 16]: AS A DWELLING-PLACE FOR CIVILIZED MAN IT IS BY FAR THE FIRST UPON OUR GLOBE .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 25]: EDITOR 'S TABLE , HARPER 'S MAGAZINE , FEBRUARY 1863 Chapter 1 The River and Its History THE Mississippi is well worth reading about .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 17]: It is not a commonplace river , but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 22]: Considering the Missouri its main branch , it is the longest river in the world -- four thousand three hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 48]: It seems safe to say that it is also the crookedest river in the world , since in one part of its journey it uses up one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the crow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 32]: It discharges three times as much water as the St. Lawrence , twenty-five times as much as the Rhine , and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the Thames .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 50]: No other river has so vast a drainage-basin : it draws its water supply from twenty-eight States and Territories ; from Delaware , on the Atlantic seaboard , and from all the country between that and Idaho on the Pacific slope -- a spread of forty-five degrees of longitude .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 31]: The Mississippi receives and carries to the Gulf water from fifty-four subordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats , and from some hundreds that are navigable by flats and keels .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 55]: The area of its drainage-basin is as great as the combined areas of England , Wales , Scotland , Ireland , France , Spain , Portugal , Germany , Austria , Italy , and Turkey ; and almost all this wide region is fertile ; the Mississippi valley , proper , is exceptionally so .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 25]: It is a remarkable river in this : that instead of widening toward its mouth , it grows narrower ; grows narrower and deeper .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 55]: From the junction of the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea , the width averages a mile in high water : thence to the sea the width steadily diminishes , until , at the ` Passes , ' above the mouth , it is but little over half a mile .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 29]: At the junction of the Ohio the Mississippi 's depth is eighty-seven feet ; the depth increases gradually , reaching one hundred and twenty-nine just above the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 21]: The difference in rise and fall is also remarkable -- not in the upper , but in the lower river .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 23]: The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez -LRB- three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth -RRB- -- about fifty feet .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 29]: But at Bayou La Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet ; at New Orleans only fifteen , and just above the mouth only two and one half .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 56]: An article in the New Orleans ` Times-Democrat , ' based upon reports of able engineers , states that the river annually empties four hundred and six million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexico -- which brings to mind Captain Marryat 's rude name for the Mississippi -- ` the Great Sewer . '
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 20]: This mud , solidified , would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and forty-one feet high .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 40]: The mud deposit gradually extends the land -- but only gradually ; it has extended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which have elapsed since the river took its place in history .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 42]: The belief of the scientific people is , that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge , where the hills cease , and that the two hundred miles of land between there and the Gulf was built by the river .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 24]: This gives us the age of that piece of country , without any trouble at all -- one hundred and twenty thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 15]: Yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that lies around there anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 30]: The Mississippi is remarkable in still another way -- its disposition to make prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land , and thus straightening and shortening itself .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 14]: More than once it has shortened itself thirty miles at a single jump !
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 31]: These cut-offs have had curious effects : they have thrown several river towns out into the rural districts , and built up sand bars and forests in front of them .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 30]: The town of Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg : a recent cutoff has radically changed the position , and Delta is now TWO MILES ABOVE Vicksburg .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 15]: Both of these river towns have been retired to the country by that cut-off .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 61]: A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions : for instance , a man is living in the State of Mississippi to-day , a cut-off occurs to-night , and to-morrow the man finds himself and his land over on the other side of the river , within the boundaries and subject to the laws of the State of Louisiana !
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 31]: Such a thing , happening in the upper river in the old times , could have transferred a slave from Missouri to Illinois and made a free man of him .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 25]: The Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone : it is always changing its habitat BODILY -- is always moving bodily SIDEWISE .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 20]: At Hard Times , La. , the river is two miles west of the region it used to occupy .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 33]: As a result , the original SITE of that settlement is not now in Louisiana at all , but on the other side of the river , in the State of Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 35]: NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THAT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MILES OF OLD MISSISSIPPI RIVER WHICH LA SALLE FLOATED DOWN IN HIS CANOES , TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO , IS GOOD SOLID DRY GROUND NOW .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 22]: The river lies to the right of it , in places , and to the left of it in other places .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 65]: Although the Mississippi 's mud builds land but slowly , down at the mouth , where the Gulfs billows interfere with its work , it builds fast enough in better protected regions higher up : for instance , Prophet 's Island contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years ago ; since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 29]: But enough of these examples of the mighty stream 's eccentricities for the present -- I will give a few more of them further along in the book .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 22]: Let us drop the Mississippi 's physical history , and say a word about its historical history -- so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 58]: We can glance briefly at its slumbrous first epoch in a couple of short chapters ; at its second and wider-awake epoch in a couple more ; at its flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good many succeeding chapters ; and then talk about its comparatively tranquil present epoch in what shall be left of the book .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 42]: The world and the books are so accustomed to use , and over-use , the word ` new ' in connection with our country , that we early get and permanently retain the impression that there is nothing old about it .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 41]: We do of course know that there are several comparatively old dates in American history , but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea , no distinct realization , of the stretch of time which they represent .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 78]: To say that De Soto , the first white man who ever saw the Mississippi River , saw it in 1542 , is a remark which states a fact without interpreting it : it is something like giving the dimensions of a sunset by astronomical measurements , and cataloguing the colors by their scientific names ; -- as a result , you get the bald fact of the sunset , but you do n't see the sunset .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 12]: It would have been better to paint a picture of it .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 53]: The date 1542 , standing by itself , means little or nothing to us ; but when one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it , he adds perspective and color , and then realizes that this is one of the American dates which is quite respectable for age .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 75]: For instance , when the Mississippi was first seen by a white man , less than a quarter of a century had elapsed since Francis I. 's defeat at Pavia ; the death of Raphael ; the death of Bayard , SANS PEUR ET SANS REPROCHE ; the driving out of the Knights-Hospitallers from Rhodes by the Turks ; and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions , -- the act which began the Reformation .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 63]: When De Soto took his glimpse of the river , Ignatius Loyola was an obscure name ; the order of the Jesuits was not yet a year old ; Michael Angelo 's paint was not yet dry on the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel ; Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born , but would be before the year closed .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 142]: Catherine de Medici was a child ; Elizabeth of England was not yet in her teens ; Calvin , Benvenuto Cellini , and the Emperor Charles V. were at the top of their fame , and each was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion ; Margaret of Navarre was writing the ` Heptameron ' and some religious books , -- the first survives , the others are forgotten , wit and indelicacy being sometimes better literature preservers than holiness ; lax court morals and the absurd chivalry business were in full feather , and the joust and the tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who could fight better than they could spell , while religion was the passion of their ladies , and classifying their offspring into children of full rank and children by brevet their pastime .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 63]: In fact , all around , religion was in a peculiarly blooming condition : the Council of Trent was being called ; the Spanish Inquisition was roasting , and racking , and burning , with a free hand ; elsewhere on the continent the nations were being persuaded to holy living by the sword and fire ; in England , Henry VIII .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 25]: had suppressed the monasteries , burnt Fisher and another bishop or two , and was getting his English reformation and his harem effectively started .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 75]: When De Soto stood on the banks of the Mississippi , it was still two years before Luther 's death ; eleven years before the burning of Servetus ; thirty years before the St. Bartholomew slaughter ; Rabelais was not yet published ; ` Don Quixote ' was not yet written ; Shakespeare was not yet born ; a hundred long years must still elapse before Englishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 34]: Unquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a datable fact which considerably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country , and gives her a most respectable outside-aspect of rustiness and antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 20]: De Soto merely glimpsed the river , then died and was buried in it by his priests and soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 37]: One would expect the priests and the soldiers to multiply the river 's dimensions by ten -- the Spanish custom of the day -- and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 19]: On the contrary , their narratives when they reached home , did not excite that amount of curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 20]: The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites during a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 82]: One may ` sense ' the interval to his mind , after a fashion , by dividing it up in this way : After De Soto glimpsed the river , a fraction short of a quarter of a century elapsed , and then Shakespeare was born ; lived a trifle more than half a century , then died ; and when he had been in his grave considerably more than half a century , the SECOND white man saw the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 20]: In our day we do n't allow a hundred and thirty years to elapse between glimpses of a marvel .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 46]: If somebody should discover a creek in the county next to the one that the North Pole is in , Europe and America would start fifteen costly expeditions thither : one to explore the creek , and the other fourteen to hunt for each other .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 18]: For more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements on our Atlantic coasts .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 93]: These people were in intimate communication with the Indians : in the south the Spaniards were robbing , slaughtering , enslaving and converting them ; higher up , the English were trading beads and blankets to them for a consideration , and throwing in civilization and whiskey , ` for lagniappe ; ' and in Canada the French were schooling them in a rudimentary way , missionarying among them , and drawing whole populations of them at a time to Quebec , and later to Montreal , to buy furs of them .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 50]: Necessarily , then , these various clusters of whites must have heard of the great river of the far west ; and indeed , they did hear of it vaguely , -- so vaguely and indefinitely , that its course , proportions , and locality were hardly even guessable .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 21]: The mere mysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled exploration ; but this did not occur .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 37]: Apparently nobody happened to want such a river , nobody needed it , nobody was curious about it ; so , for a century and a half the Mississippi remained out of the market and undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 37]: When De Soto found it , he was not hunting for a river , and had no present occasion for one ; consequently he did not value it or even take any particular notice of it .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 19]: But at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out that river and exploring it .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 26]: It always happens that when a man seizes upon a neglected and important idea , people inflamed with the same notion crop up all around .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 7]: It happened so in this instance .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 25]: Naturally the question suggests itself , Why did these people want the river now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations ?
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 48]: Apparently it was because at this late day they thought they had discovered a way to make it useful ; for it had come to be believed that the Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California , and therefore afforded a short cut from Canada to China .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 17]: Previously the supposition had been that it emptied into the Atlantic , or Sea of Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 29]: Chapter 2 The River and Its Explorers LA SALLE himself sued for certain high privileges , and they were graciously accorded him by Louis XIV of inflated memory .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 59]: Chief among them was the privilege to explore , far and wide , and build forts , and stake out continents , and hand the same over to the king , and pay the expenses himself ; receiving , in return , some little advantages of one sort or another ; among them the monopoly of buffalo hides .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 51]: He spent several years and about all of his money , in making perilous and painful trips between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois , before he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape that he could strike for the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 9]: And meantime other parties had had better fortune .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 22]: In 1673 Joliet the merchant , and Marquette the priest , crossed the country and reached the banks of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 26]: They went by way of the Great Lakes ; and from Green Bay , in canoes , by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 36]: Marquette had solemnly contracted , on the feast of the Immaculate Conception , that if the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river , he would name it Conception , in her honor .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 5]: He kept his word .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 13]: In that day , all explorers traveled with an outfit of priests .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 7]: De Soto had twenty-four with him .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 7]: La Salle had several , also .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 52]: The expeditions were often out of meat , and scant of clothes , but they always had the furniture and other requisites for the mass ; they were always prepared , as one of the quaint chroniclers of the time phrased it , to ` explain hell to the savages . '
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 28]: On the 17th of June , 1673 , the canoes of Joliet and Marquette and their five subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 29]: Mr. Parkman says : ` Before them a wide and rapid current coursed athwart their way , by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick in forests . '
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 25]: He continues : ` Turning southward , they paddled down the stream , through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man . '
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 69]: A big cat-fish collided with Marquette 's canoe , and startled him ; and reasonably enough , for he had been warned by the Indians that he was on a foolhardy journey , and even a fatal one , for the river contained a demon ` whose roar could be heard at a great distance , and who would engulf them in the abyss where he dwelt . '
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 49]: I have seen a Mississippi catfish that was more than six feet long , and weighed two hundred and fifty pounds ; and if Marquette 's fish was the fellow to that one , he had a fair right to think the river 's roaring demon was come .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 50]: ` At length the buffalo began to appear , grazing in herds on the great prairies which then bordered the river ; and Marquette describes the fierce and stupid look of the old bulls as they stared at the intruders through the tangled mane which nearly blinded them . '
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 47]: The voyagers moved cautiously : ` Landed at night and made a fire to cook their evening meal ; then extinguished it , embarked again , paddled some way farther , and anchored in the stream , keeping a man on the watch till morning . '
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 26]: They did this day after day and night after night ; and at the end of two weeks they had not seen a human being .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 9]: The river was an awful solitude , then .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 11]: And it is now , over most of its stretch .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 45]: But at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon the footprints of men in the mud of the western bank -- a Robinson Crusoe experience which carries an electric shiver with it yet , when one stumbles on it in print .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 47]: They had been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious and pitiless as the river demon , and destroyed all comers without waiting for provocation ; but no matter , Joliet and Marquette struck into the country to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 84]: They found them , by and by , and were hospitably received and well treated -- if to be received by an Indian chief who has taken off his last rag in order to appear at his level best is to be received hospitably ; and if to be treated abundantly to fish , porridge , and other game , including dog , and have these things forked into one 's mouth by the ungloved fingers of Indians is to be well treated .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 24]: In the morning the chief and six hundred of his tribesmen escorted the Frenchmen to the river and bade them a friendly farewell .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 22]: On the rocks above the present city of Alton they found some rude and fantastic Indian paintings , which they describe .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 38]: A short distance below ' a torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current of the Mississippi , boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs , branches , and uprooted trees . '
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 41]: This was the mouth of the Missouri , ` that savage river , ' which ` descending from its mad career through a vast unknown of barbarism , poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its gentle sister . '
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 125]: By and by they passed the mouth of the Ohio ; they passed cane-brakes ; they fought mosquitoes ; they floated along , day after day , through the deep silence and loneliness of the river , drowsing in the scant shade of makeshift awnings , and broiling with the heat ; they encountered and exchanged civilities with another party of Indians ; and at last they reached the mouth of the Arkansas -LRB- about a month out from their starting-point -RRB- , where a tribe of war-whooping savages swarmed out to meet and murder them ; but they appealed to the Virgin for help ; so in place of a fight there was a feast , and plenty of pleasant palaver and fol-de-rol .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 24]: They had proved to their satisfaction , that the Mississippi did not empty into the Gulf of California , or into the Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 10]: They believed it emptied into the Gulf of Mexico .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 14]: They turned back , now , and carried their great news to Canada .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: But belief is not proof .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 11]: It was reserved for La Salle to furnish the proof .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 27]: He was provokingly delayed , by one misfortune after another , but at last got his expedition under way at the end of the year 1681 .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 44]: In the dead of winter he and Henri de Tonty , son of Lorenzo Tonty , who invented the tontine , his lieutenant , started down the Illinois , with a following of eighteen Indians brought from New England , and twenty-three Frenchmen .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 24]: They moved in procession down the surface of the frozen river , on foot , and dragging their canoes after them on sledges .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 20]: At Peoria Lake they struck open water , and paddled thence to the Mississippi and turned their prows southward .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 57]: They plowed through the fields of floating ice , past the mouth of the Missouri ; past the mouth of the Ohio , by-and-by ; ` and , gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp , landed on the 24th of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs , ' where they halted and built Fort Prudhomme .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 34]: ` Again , ' says Mr. Parkman , ` they embarked ; and with every stage of their adventurous progress , the mystery of this vast new world was more and more unveiled .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 10]: More and more they entered the realms of spring .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 26]: The hazy sunlight , the warm and drowsy air , the tender foliage , the opening flowers , betokened the reviving life of nature . '
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 29]: Day by day they floated down the great bends , in the shadow of the dense forests , and in time arrived at the mouth of the Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 33]: First , they were greeted by the natives of this locality as Marquette had before been greeted by them -- with the booming of the war drum and the flourish of arms .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 22]: The Virgin composed the difficulty in Marquette 's case ; the pipe of peace did the same office for La Salle .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 17]: The white man and the red man struck hands and entertained each other during three days .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 52]: Then , to the admiration of the savages , La Salle set up a cross with the arms of France on it , and took possession of the whole country for the king -- the cool fashion of the time -- while the priest piously consecrated the robbery with a hymn .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 42]: The priest explained the mysteries of the faith ` by signs , ' for the saving of the savages ; thus compensating them with possible possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth which they had just been robbed of .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 28]: And also , by signs , La Salle drew from these simple children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the Putrid , over the water .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 7]: Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 31]: These performances took place on the site of the future town of Napoleon , Arkansas , and there the first confiscation-cross was raised on the banks of the great river .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 23]: Marquette 's and Joliet 's voyage of discovery ended at the same spot -- the site of the future town of Napoleon .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 38]: When De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river , away back in the dim early days , he took it from that same spot -- the site of the future town of Napoleon , Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 32]: Therefore , three out of the four memorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the mighty river , occurred , by accident , in one and the same place .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 19]: It is a most curious distinction , when one comes to look at it and think about it .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 27]: France stole that vast country on that spot , the future Napoleon ; and by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back again !
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 16]: -- make restitution , not to the owners , but to their white American heirs .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 60]: The voyagers journeyed on , touching here and there ; ` passed the sites , since become historic , of Vicksburg and Grand Gulf , ' and visited an imposing Indian monarch in the Teche country , whose capital city was a substantial one of sun-baked bricks mixed with straw -- better houses than many that exist there now .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 29]: The chiefs house contained an audience room forty feet square ; and there he received Tonty in State , surrounded by sixty old men clothed in white cloaks .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 24]: There was a temple in the town , with a mud wall about it ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to the sun .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 44]: The voyagers visited the Natchez Indians , near the site of the present city of that name , where they found a ` religious and political despotism , a privileged class descended from the sun , a temple and a sacred fire . '
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 25]: It must have been like getting home again ; it was home with an advantage , in fact , for it lacked Louis XIV .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 60]: A few more days swept swiftly by , and La Salle stood in the shadow of his confiscating cross , at the meeting of the waters from Delaware , and from Itaska , and from the mountain ranges close upon the Pacific , with the waters of the Gulf of Mexico , his task finished , his prodigy achieved .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 29]: Mr. Parkman , in closing his fascinating narrative , thus sums up : ` On that day , the realm of France received on parchment a stupendous accession .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 95]: The fertile plains of Texas ; the vast basin of the Mississippi , from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of the Gulf ; from the woody ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks of the Rocky Mountains -- a region of savannas and forests , sun-cracked deserts and grassy prairies , watered by a thousand rivers , ranged by a thousand warlike tribes , passed beneath the scepter of the Sultan of Versailles ; and all by virtue of a feeble human voice , inaudible at half a mile . '
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 16]: Chapter 3 Frescoes from the Past APPARENTLY the river was ready for business , now .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 28]: But no , the distribution of a population along its banks was as calm and deliberate and time-devouring a process as the discovery and exploration had been .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 31]: Seventy years elapsed , after the exploration , before the river 's borders had a white population worth considering ; and nearly fifty more before the river had a commerce .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 49]: Between La Salle 's opening of the river and the time when it may be said to have become the vehicle of anything like a regular and active commerce , seven sovereigns had occupied the throne of England , America had become an independent nation , Louis XIV .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 4]: and Louis XV .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 32]: had rotted and died , the French monarchy had gone down in the red tempest of the revolution , and Napoleon was a name that was beginning to be talked about .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 9]: Truly , there were snails in those days .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 14]: The river 's earliest commerce was in great barges -- keelboats , broadhorns .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 26]: They floated and sailed from the upper rivers to New Orleans , changed cargoes there , and were tediously warped and poled back by hand .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 10]: A voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine months .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 103]: In time this commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of rough and hardy men ; rude , uneducated , brave , suffering terrific hardships with sailor-like stoicism ; heavy drinkers , coarse frolickers in moral sties like the Natchez-under-the-hill of that day , heavy fighters , reckless fellows , every one , elephantinely jolly , foul-witted , profane ; prodigal of their money , bankrupt at the end of the trip , fond of barbaric finery , prodigious braggarts ; yet , in the main , honest , trustworthy , faithful to promises and duty , and often picturesquely magnanimous .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 7]: By and by the steamboat intruded .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 45]: Then for fifteen or twenty years , these men continued to run their keelboats down-stream , and the steamers did all of the upstream business , the keelboatmen selling their boats in New Orleans , and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 31]: But after a while the steamboats so increased in number and in speed that they were able to absorb the entire commerce ; and then keelboating died a permanent death .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 52]: The keelboatman became a deck hand , or a mate , or a pilot on the steamer ; and when steamer-berths were not open to him , he took a berth on a Pittsburgh coal-flat , or on a pine-raft constructed in the forests up toward the sources of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 42]: In the heyday of the steamboating prosperity , the river from end to end was flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts , all managed by hand , and employing hosts of the rough characters whom I have been trying to describe .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 105]: I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to glide by Hannibal when I was a boy , -- an acre or so of white , sweet-smelling boards in each raft , a crew of two dozen men or more , three or four wigwams scattered about the raft 's vast level space for storm-quarters , -- and I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk of their big crews , the ex-keelboatmen and their admiringly patterning successors ; for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get on these rafts and have a ride .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 63]: By way of illustrating keelboat talk and manners , and that now-departed and hardly-remembered raft-life , I will throw in , in this place , a chapter from a book which I have been working at , by fits and starts , during the past five or six years , and may possibly finish in the course of five or six more .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 34]: The book is a story which details some passages in the life of an ignorant village boy , Huck Finn , son of the town drunkard of my time out west , there .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 42]: He has run away from his persecuting father , and from a persecuting good widow who wishes to make a nice , truth-telling , respectable boy of him ; and with him a slave of the widow 's has also escaped .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 57]: They have found a fragment of a lumber raft -LRB- it is high water and dead summer time -RRB- , and are floating down the river by night , and hiding in the willows by day , -- bound for Cairo , -- whence the negro will seek freedom in the heart of the free States .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 12]: But in a fog , they pass Cairo without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 76]: By and by they begin to suspect the truth , and Huck Finn is persuaded to end the dismal suspense by swimming down to a huge raft which they have seen in the distance ahead of them , creeping aboard under cover of the darkness , and gathering the needed information by eavesdropping : -- But you know a young person ca n't wait very well when he is impatient to find a thing out .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 77]: We talked it over , and by and by Jim said it was such a black night , now , that it would n't be no risk to swim down to the big raft and crawl aboard and listen -- they would talk about Cairo , because they would be calculating to go ashore there for a spree , maybe , or anyway they would send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or something .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 24]: Jim had a wonderful level head , for a nigger : he could most always start a good plan when you wanted one .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 23]: I stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river , and struck out for the raft 's light .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 21]: By and by , when I got down nearly to her , I eased up and went slow and cautious .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 11]: But everything was all right -- nobody at the sweeps .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 42]: So I swum down along the raft till I was most abreast the camp fire in the middle , then I crawled aboard and inched along and got in amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather side of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 15]: There was thirteen men there -- they was the watch on deck of course .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 8]: And a mighty rough-looking lot , too .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 16]: They had a jug , and tin cups , and they kept the jug moving .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 24]: One man was singing -- roaring , you may say ; and it was n't a nice song -- for a parlor anyway .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 18]: He roared through his nose , and strung out the last word of every line very long .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 19]: When he was done they all fetched a kind of Injun war-whoop , and then another was sung .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 78]: It begun : -- ` There was a woman in our towdn , In our towdn did dwed ' l -LRB- dwell , -RRB- She loved her husband dear-i-lee , But another man twyste as wed ` l. Singing too , riloo , riloo , riloo , Ri-too , riloo , rilay - - - e , She loved her husband dear-i-lee , But another man twyste as wed ` l. And so on -- fourteen verses .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 45]: It was kind of poor , and when he was going to start on the next verse one of them said it was the tune the old cow died on ; and another one said , ` Oh , give us a rest . '
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 10]: And another one told him to take a walk .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 30]: They made fun of him till he got mad and jumped up and begun to cuss the crowd , and said he could lame any thief in the lot .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 29]: They was all about to make a break for him , but the biggest man there jumped up and says -- ` Set whar you are , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 11]: Leave him to me ; he 's my meat . '
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 17]: Then he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his heels together every time .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 54]: He flung off a buckskin coat that was all hung with fringes , and says , ` You lay thar tell the chawin-up 's done ; ' and flung his hat down , which was all over ribbons , and says , ` You lay thar tell his sufferin 's is over . '
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 20]: Then he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together again and shouted out -- ` Whoo-oop !
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 17]: I 'm the old original iron-jawed , brass-mounted , copper-bellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansaw !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 5]: -- Look at me !
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 12]: I 'm the man they call Sudden Death and General Desolation !
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 27]: Sired by a hurricane , dam 'd by an earthquake , half-brother to the cholera , nearly related to the small-pox on the mother 's side !
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 4]: Look at me !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 34]: I take nineteen alligators and a bar ' l of whiskey for breakfast when I 'm in robust health , and a bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when I 'm ailing !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 18]: I split the everlasting rocks with my glance , and I squench the thunder when I speak !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 2]: Whoo-oop !
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 11]: Stand back and give me room according to my strength !
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 18]: Blood 's my natural drink , and the wails of the dying is music to my ear !
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 8]: Cast your eye on me , gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 19]: -- and lay low and hold your breath , for I 'm bout to turn myself loose ! '
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 57]: All the time he was getting this off , he was shaking his head and looking fierce , and kind of swelling around in a little circle , tucking up his wrist-bands , and now and then straightening up and beating his breast with his fist , saying , ` Look at me , gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 24]: When he got through , he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times , and let off a roaring ` Whoo-oop !
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 12]: I 'm the bloodiest son of a wildcat that lives ! '
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 69]: Then the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down over his right eye ; then he bent stooping forward , with his back sagged and his south end sticking out far , and his fists a-shoving out and drawing in in front of him , and so went around in a little circle about three times , swelling himself up and breathing hard .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 37]: Then he straightened , and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times , before he lit again -LRB- that made them cheer -RRB- , and he begun to shout like this -- ` Whoo-oop !
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 14]: bow your neck and spread , for the kingdom of sorrow 's a-coming !
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 14]: Hold me down to the earth , for I feel my powers a-working !
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 2]: whoo-oop !
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 15]: I 'm a child of sin , do n't let me get a start !
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 8]: Smoked glass , here , for all !
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 14]: Do n't attempt to look at me with the naked eye , gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 26]: When I 'm playful I use the meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude for a seine , and drag the Atlantic Ocean for whales !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 17]: I scratch my head with the lightning , and purr myself to sleep with the thunder !
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 57]: When I 'm cold , I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe in it ; when I 'm hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm ; when I 'm thirsty I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge ; when I range the earth hungry , famine follows in my tracks !
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 2]: Whoo-oop !
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 6]: Bow your neck and spread !
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 38]: I put my hand on the sun 's face and make it night in the earth ; I bite a piece out of the moon and hurry the seasons ; I shake myself and crumble the mountains !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 12]: Contemplate me through leather -- do n't use the naked eye !
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 12]: I 'm the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels !
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 24]: The massacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments , the destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life !
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 24]: The boundless vastness of the great American desert is my enclosed property , and I bury my dead on my own premises ! '
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 32]: He jumped up and cracked his heels together three times before he lit -LRB- they cheered him again -RRB- , and as he come down he shouted out : ` Whoo-oop !
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 16]: bow your neck and spread , for the pet child of calamity 's a-coming ! '
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 212]: Then the other one went to swelling around and blowing again -- the first one -- the one they called Bob ; next , the Child of Calamity chipped in again , bigger than ever ; then they both got at it at the same time , swelling round and round each other and punching their fists most into each other 's faces , and whooping and jawing like Injuns ; then Bob called the Child names , and the Child called him names back again : next , Bob called him a heap rougher names and the Child come back at him with the very worst kind of language ; next , Bob knocked the Child 's hat off , and the Child picked it up and kicked Bob 's ribbony hat about six foot ; Bob went and got it and said never mind , this war n't going to be the last of this thing , because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive , and so the Child better look out , for there was a time a-coming , just as sure as he was a living man , that he would have to answer to him with the best blood in his body .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 69]: The Child said no man was willinger than he was for that time to come , and he would give Bob fair warning , now , never to cross his path again , for he could never rest till he had waded in his blood , for such was his nature , though he was sparing him now on account of his family , if he had one .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 57]: Both of them was edging away in different directions , growling and shaking their heads and going on about what they was going to do ; but a little black-whiskered chap skipped up and says -- ` Come back here , you couple of chicken-livered cowards , and I 'll thrash the two of ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 7]: And he done it , too .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 28]: He snatched them , he jerked them this way and that , he booted them around , he knocked them sprawling faster than they could get up .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 40]: Why , it war n't two minutes till they begged like dogs -- and how the other lot did yell and laugh and clap their hands all the way through , and shout ` Sail in , Corpse-Maker ! '
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 3]: ` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 9]: at him again , Child of Calamity ! '
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 9]: ` Bully for you , little Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 11]: Well , it was a perfect pow-wow for a while .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 15]: Bob and the Child had red noses and black eyes when they got through .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 57]: Little Davy made them own up that they were sneaks and cowards and not fit to eat with a dog or drink with a nigger ; then Bob and the Child shook hands with each other , very solemn , and said they had always respected each other and was willing to let bygones be bygones .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 47]: So then they washed their faces in the river ; and just then there was a loud order to stand by for a crossing , and some of them went forward to man the sweeps there , and the rest went aft to handle the after-sweeps .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 48]: I laid still and waited for fifteen minutes , and had a smoke out of a pipe that one of them left in reach ; then the crossing was finished , and they stumped back and had a drink around and went to talking and singing again .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 29]: Next they got out an old fiddle , and one played and another patted juba , and the rest turned themselves loose on a regular old-fashioned keel-boat break-down .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 23]: They could n't keep that up very long without getting winded , so by and by they settled around the jug again .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 120]: They sung ` jolly , jolly raftman 's the life for me , ' with a musing chorus , and then they got to talking about differences betwixt hogs , and their different kind of habits ; and next about women and their different ways : and next about the best ways to put out houses that was afire ; and next about what ought to be done with the Injuns ; and next about what a king had to do , and how much he got ; and next about how to make cats fight ; and next about what to do when a man has fits ; and next about differences betwixt clear-water rivers and muddy-water ones .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 110]: The man they called Ed said the muddy Mississippi water was wholesomer to drink than the clear water of the Ohio ; he said if you let a pint of this yaller Mississippi water settle , you would have about a half to three-quarters of an inch of mud in the bottom , according to the stage of the river , and then it war n't no better than Ohio water -- what you wanted to do was to keep it stirred up -- and when the river was low , keep mud on hand to put in and thicken the water up the way it ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 36]: The Child of Calamity said that was so ; he said there was nutritiousness in the mud , and a man that drunk Mississippi water could grow corn in his stomach if he wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 15]: He says -- ` You look at the graveyards ; that tells the tale .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 26]: Trees wo n't grow worth chucks in a Cincinnati graveyard , but in a Sent Louis graveyard they grow upwards of eight hundred foot high .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 16]: It 's all on account of the water the people drunk before they laid up .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 11]: A Cincinnati corpse do n't richen a soil any . '
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 16]: And they talked about how Ohio water did n't like to mix with Mississippi water .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 73]: Ed said if you take the Mississippi on a rise when the Ohio is low , you 'll find a wide band of clear water all the way down the east side of the Mississippi for a hundred mile or more , and the minute you get out a quarter of a mile from shore and pass the line , it is all thick and yaller the rest of the way across .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 47]: Then they talked about how to keep tobacco from getting moldy , and from that they went into ghosts and told about a lot that other folks had seen ; but Ed says -- ` Why do n't you tell something that you 've seen yourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 7]: Now let me have a say .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 138]: Five years ago I was on a raft as big as this , and right along here it was a bright moonshiny night , and I was on watch and boss of the stabboard oar forrard , and one of my pards was a man named Dick Allbright , and he come along to where I was sitting , forrard -- gaping and stretching , he was -- and stooped down on the edge of the raft and washed his face in the river , and come and set down by me and got out his pipe , and had just got it filled , when he looks up and says -- ' `` Why looky-here , '' he says , `` ai n't that Buck Miller 's place , over yander in the bend . '' '
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' says I , `` it is -- why . ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 27]: He laid his pipe down and leant his head on his hand , and says -- ' `` I thought we 'd be furder down . ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 74]: I says -- ' `` I thought it too , when I went off watch '' -- we was standing six hours on and six off -- `` but the boys told me , '' I says , `` that the raft did n't seem to hardly move , for the last hour , '' says I , `` though she 's a slipping along all right , now , '' says I .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 56]: He give a kind of a groan , and says -- ' `` I 've seed a raft act so before , along here , '' he says , '' ` pears to me the current has most quit above the head of this bend durin ' the last two years , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 21]: ` Well , he raised up two or three times , and looked away off and around on the water .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 8]: That started me at it , too .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 22]: A body is always doing what he sees somebody else doing , though there may n't be no sense in it .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 20]: Pretty soon I see a black something floating on the water away off to stabboard and quartering behind us .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 10]: I see he was looking at it , too .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 10]: I says -- ' `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 30]: He says , sort of pettish , -- ' `` Tai n't nothing but an old empty bar ` l. '' ' `` An empty bar ` l ! ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 20]: says I , `` why , '' says I , `` a spy-glass is a fool to your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 13]: How can you tell it 's an empty bar ` l ? ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 32]: He says -- ' `` I do n't know ; I reckon it ai n't a bar ` l , but I thought it might be , '' says he . '
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 41]: `` Yes , '' I says , `` so it might be , and it might be anything else , too ; a body ca n't tell nothing about it , such a distance as that , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 16]: ` We had n't nothing else to do , so we kept on watching it .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 25]: By and by I says -- ' `` Why looky-here , Dick Allbright , that thing 's a-gaining on us , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 6]: ` He never said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 20]: The thing gained and gained , and I judged it must be a dog that was about tired out .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 74]: Well , we swung down into the crossing , and the thing floated across the bright streak of the moonshine , and , by George , it was bar ` l. Says I -- ' `` Dick Allbright , what made you think that thing was a bar ` l , when it was a half a mile off , '' says I. Says he -- ' `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 13]: Says I -- ' `` You tell me , Dick Allbright . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 61]: He says -- ' `` Well , I knowed it was a bar ` l ; I 've seen it before ; lots has seen it ; they says it 's a haunted bar ` l. '' ' I called the rest of the watch , and they come and stood there , and I told them what Dick said .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 15]: It floated right along abreast , now , and did n't gain any more .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 7]: It was about twenty foot off .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 15]: Some was for having it aboard , but the rest did n't want to .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 16]: Dick Allbright said rafts that had fooled with it had got bad luck by it .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 13]: The captain of the watch said he did n't believe in it .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 24]: He said he reckoned the bar ' l gained on us because it was in a little better current than what we was .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 9]: He said it would leave by and by .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 101]: ` So then we went to talking about other things , and we had a song , and then a breakdown ; and after that the captain of the watch called for another song ; but it was clouding up , now , and the bar ' l stuck right thar in the same place , and the song did n't seem to have much warm-up to it , somehow , and so they did n't finish it , and there war n't any cheers , but it sort of dropped flat , and nobody said anything for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 47]: Then everybody tried to talk at once , and one chap got off a joke , but it war n't no use , they did n't laugh , and even the chap that made the joke did n't laugh at it , which ai n't usual .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 20]: We all just settled down glum , and watched the bar ` l , and was oneasy and oncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 33]: Well , sir , it shut down black and still , and then the wind begin to moan around , and next the lightning begin to play and the thunder to grumble .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 36]: And pretty soon there was a regular storm , and in the middle of it a man that was running aft stumbled and fell and sprained his ankle so that he had to lay up .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 8]: This made the boys shake their heads .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 21]: And every time the lightning come , there was that bar ' l with the blue lights winking around it .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 9]: We was always on the look-out for it .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 12]: But by and by , towards dawn , she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 19]: When the day come we could n't see her anywhere , and we war n't sorry , neither .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 33]: ` But next night about half-past nine , when there was songs and high jinks going on , here she comes again , and took her old roost on the stabboard side .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 8]: There war n't no more high jinks .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 27]: Everybody got solemn ; nobody talked ; you could n't get anybody to do anything but set around moody and look at the bar ` l .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 7]: It begun to cloud up again .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 17]: When the watch changed , the off watch stayed up , ` stead of turning in .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 29]: The storm ripped and roared around all night , and in the middle of it another man tripped and sprained his ankle , and had to knock off .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 14]: The bar ' l left towards day , and nobody see it go .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 12]: ` Everybody was sober and down in the mouth all day .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 18]: I do n't mean the kind of sober that comes of leaving liquor alone -- not that .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 28]: They was quiet , but they all drunk more than usual -- not together -- but each man sidled off and took it private , by himself .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 61]: ` After dark the off watch did n't turn in ; nobody sung , nobody talked ; the boys did n't scatter around , neither ; they sort of huddled together , forrard ; and for two hours they set there , perfectly still , looking steady in the one direction , and heaving a sigh once in a while .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 11]: And then , here comes the bar ' l again .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 7]: She took up her old place .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 10]: She staid there all night ; nobody turned in .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: The storm come on again , after midnight .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 81]: It got awful dark ; the rain poured down ; hail , too ; the thunder boomed and roared and bellowed ; the wind blowed a hurricane ; and the lightning spread over everything in big sheets of glare , and showed the whole raft as plain as day ; and the river lashed up white as milk as far as you could see for miles , and there was that bar ' l jiggering along , same as ever .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 29]: The captain ordered the watch to man the after sweeps for a crossing , and nobody would go -- no more sprained ankles for them , they said .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 7]: They would n't even walk aft .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 31]: Well then , just then the sky split wide open , with a crash , and the lightning killed two men of the after watch , and crippled two more .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 7]: Crippled them how , says you ?
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 6]: Why , sprained their ankles !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 15]: ` The bar ' l left in the dark betwixt lightnings , towards dawn .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 13]: Well , not a body eat a bite at breakfast that morning .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 17]: After that the men loafed around , in twos and threes , and talked low together .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 9]: But none of them herded with Dick Allbright .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 8]: They all give him the cold shake .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 18]: If he come around where any of the men was , they split up and sidled away .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 9]: They would n't man the sweeps with him .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 49]: The captain had all the skiffs hauled up on the raft , alongside of his wigwam , and would n't let the dead men be took ashore to be planted ; he did n't believe a man that got ashore would come back ; and he was right .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 33]: ` After night come , you could see pretty plain that there was going to be trouble if that bar ' l come again ; there was such a muttering going on .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 28]: A good many wanted to kill Dick Allbright , because he 'd seen the bar ' l on other trips , and that had an ugly look .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 7]: Some wanted to put him ashore .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 20]: Some said , let 's all go ashore in a pile , if the bar ' l comes again .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 35]: ` This kind of whispers was still going on , the men being bunched together forrard watching for the bar ` l , when , lo and behold you , here she comes again .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 15]: Down she comes , slow and steady , and settles into her old tracks .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 8]: You could a heard a pin drop .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 60]: Then up comes the captain , and says : -- ' `` Boys , do n't be a pack of children and fools ; I do n't want this bar ' l to be dogging us all the way to Orleans , and YOU do n't ; well , then , how 's the best way to stop it ?
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 10]: Burn it up , -- that 's the way .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 12]: I 'm going to fetch it aboard , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 12]: And before anybody could say a word , in he went .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 23]: ` He swum to it , and as he come pushing it to the raft , the men spread to one side .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 21]: But the old man got it aboard and busted in the head , and there was a baby in it !
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 9]: Yes , sir , a stark naked baby .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 15]: It was Dick Allbright 's baby ; he owned up and said so . '
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 66]: `` Yes , '' he says , a-leaning over it , `` yes , it is my own lamented darling , my poor lost Charles William Allbright deceased , '' says he , -- for he could curl his tongue around the bulliest words in the language when he was a mind to , and lay them before you without a jint started , anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 95]: Yes , he said he used to live up at the head of this bend , and one night he choked his child , which was crying , not intending to kill it , -- which was prob ` ly a lie , -- and then he was scared , and buried it in a bar ` l , before his wife got home , and off he went , and struck the northern trail and went to rafting ; and this was the third year that the bar ' l had chased him .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 31]: He said the bad luck always begun light , and lasted till four men was killed , and then the bar ' l did n't come any more after that .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 28]: He said if the men would stand it one more night , -- and was a-going on like that , -- but the men had got enough .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 60]: They started to get out a boat to take him ashore and lynch him , but he grabbed the little child all of a sudden and jumped overboard with it hugged up to his breast and shedding tears , and we never see him again in this life , poor old suffering soul , nor Charles William neither . '
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 7]: ` WHO was shedding tears ? '
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 12]: says Bob ; ` was it Allbright or the baby ? '
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 18]: ` Why , Allbright , of course ; did n't I tell you the baby was dead .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 11]: Been dead three years -- how could it cry ? '
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 19]: ` Well , never mind how it could cry -- how could it KEEP all that time ? '
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 3]: says Davy .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 8]: ` You answer me that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 13]: I do n't know how it done it , ' says Ed .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 15]: ` It done it though -- that 's all I know about it . '
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 14]: ` Say -- what did they do with the bar ` l ? '
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 6]: says the Child of Calamity .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 18]: ` Why , they hove it overboard , and it sunk like a chunk of lead . '
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 13]: ` Edward , did the child look like it was choked ? '
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 3]: says one .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: ` Did it have its hair parted ? '
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 3]: says another .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 14]: ` What was the brand on that bar ` l , Eddy ? '
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 7]: says a fellow they called Bill .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 13]: ` Have you got the papers for them statistics , Edmund ? '
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 3]: says Jimmy .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 19]: ` Say , Edwin , was you one of the men that was killed by the lightning . '
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 3]: says Davy .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 3]: ` Him ?
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 14]: O , no , he was both of 'em , ' says Bob .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 5]: Then they all haw-hawed .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 16]: ` Say , Edward , do n't you reckon you 'd better take a pill ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 11]: You look bad -- do n't you feel pale ? '
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 6]: says the Child of Calamity .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 33]: ` O , come , now , Eddy , ' says Jimmy , ` show up ; you must a kept part of that bar ' l to prove the thing by .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 15]: Show us the bunghole -- do -- and we 'll all believe you . '
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 15]: ` Say , boys , ' says Bill , ` less divide it up .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 6]: Thar 's thirteen of us .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 18]: I can swaller a thirteenth of the yarn , if you can worry down the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 49]: Ed got up mad and said they could all go to some place which he ripped out pretty savage , and then walked off aft cussing to himself , and they yelling and jeering at him , and roaring and laughing so you could hear them a mile .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 41]: ` Boys , we 'll split a watermelon on that , ' says the Child of Calamity ; and he come rummaging around in the dark amongst the shingle bundles where I was , and put his hand on me .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 15]: I was warm and soft and naked ; so he says ` Ouch ! '
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 4]: and jumped back .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 25]: ` Fetch a lantern or a chunk of fire here , boys -- there 's a snake here as big as a cow ! '
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 16]: So they run there with a lantern and crowded up and looked in on me .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 10]: ` Come out of that , you beggar ! '
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 3]: says one .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 6]: ` Who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 3]: says another .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 7]: ` What are you after here ?
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 9]: Speak up prompt , or overboard you go .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 7]: ` Snake him out , boys .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 8]: Snatch him out by the heels . '
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 12]: I began to beg , and crept out amongst them trembling .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 19]: They looked me over , wondering , and the Child of Calamity says -- ' A cussed thief !
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 10]: Lend a hand and less heave him overboard ! '
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 34]: ` No , ' says Big Bob , ` less get out the paint-pot and paint him a sky blue all over from head to heel , and then heave him over ! '
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 7]: ` Good , that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 8]: Go for the paint , Jimmy . '
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 46]: When the paint come , and Bob took the brush and was just going to begin , the others laughing and rubbing their hands , I begun to cry , and that sort of worked on Davy , and he says -- '' Vast there !
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 7]: He 's nothing but a cub .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 11]: ` I 'll paint the man that tetches him ! '
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 31]: So I looked around on them , and some of them grumbled and growled , and Bob put down the paint , and the others did n't take it up .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 21]: ` Come here to the fire , and less see what you 're up to here , ' says Davy .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 12]: ` Now set down there and give an account of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 9]: How long have you been aboard here ? '
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 25]: ` Not over a quarter of a minute , sir , ' says I. ` How did you get dry so quick ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 7]: I do n't know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 9]: I 'm always that way , mostly . '
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 9]: ` Oh , you are , are you .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 6]: What 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 9]: I war n't going to tell my name .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 21]: I did n't know what to say , so I just says -- ` Charles William Allbright , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 28]: Then they roared -- the whole crowd ; and I was mighty glad I said that , because maybe laughing would get them in a better humor .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 19]: When they got done laughing , Davy says -- ` It wo n't hardly do , Charles William .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 34]: You could n't have growed this much in five year , and you was a baby when you come out of the bar ` l , you know , and dead at that .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 24]: Come , now , tell a straight story , and nobody 'll hurt you , if you ai n't up to anything wrong .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 6]: What IS your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 6]: ` Aleck Hopkins , sir .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 5]: Aleck James Hopkins . '
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 14]: ` Well , Aleck , where did you come from , here ? '
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 6]: ` From a trading scow .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 7]: She lays up the bend yonder .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 6]: I was born on her .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 57]: Pap has traded up and down here all his life ; and he told me to swim off here , because when you went by he said he would like to get some of you to speak to a Mr. Jonas Turner , in Cairo , and tell him -- ' ` Oh , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 25]: ` Yes , sir ; it 's as true as the world ; Pap he says -- ' ` Oh , your grandmother ! '
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 21]: They all laughed , and I tried again to talk , but they broke in on me and stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 20]: ` Now , looky-here , ' says Davy ; ` you 're scared , and so you talk wild .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 18]: Honest , now , do you live in a scow , or is it a lie ? '
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , in a trading scow .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 10]: She lays up at the head of the bend .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 8]: But I war n't born in her .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 7]: It 's our first trip . '
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: ` Now you 're talking !
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 9]: What did you come aboard here , for ?
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 4]: To steal ? '
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 9]: ` No , sir , I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 12]: -- It was only to get a ride on the raft .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 6]: All boys does that . '
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 7]: ` Well , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 8]: But what did you hide for ? '
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 9]: ` Sometimes they drive the boys off . '
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 5]: ` So they do .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 4]: They might steal .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 23]: Looky-here ; if we let you off this time , will you keep out of these kind of scrapes hereafter ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 6]: Deed I will , boss .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: You try me . '
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 6]: ` All right , then .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 9]: You ai n't but little ways from shore .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 18]: Overboard with you , and do n't you make a fool of yourself another time this way .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 19]: -- Blast it , boy , some raftsmen would rawhide you till you were black and blue ! '
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 16]: I did n't wait to kiss good-bye , but went overboard and broke for shore .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 20]: When Jim come along by and by , the big raft was away out of sight around the point .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 16]: I swum out and got aboard , and was mighty glad to see home again .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 33]: The boy did not get the information he was after , but his adventure has furnished the glimpse of the departed raftsman and keelboatman which I desire to offer in this place .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 37]: I now come to a phase of the Mississippi River life of the flush times of steamboating , which seems to me to warrant full examination -- the marvelous science of piloting , as displayed there .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 13]: I believe there has been nothing like it elsewhere in the world .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 29]: Chapter 4 The Boys ' Ambition WHEN I was a boy , there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades in our village -LCB- footnote -LSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 14]: Hannibal , Missouri -RSB- -RCB- on the west bank of the Mississippi River .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 8]: That was , to be a steamboatman .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 14]: We had transient ambitions of other sorts , but they were only transient .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 60]: When a circus came and went , it left us all burning to become clowns ; the first negro minstrel show that came to our section left us all suffering to try that kind of life ; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good , God would permit us to be pirates .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 20]: These ambitions faded out , each in its turn ; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always remained .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 20]: Once a day a cheap , gaudy packet arrived upward from St. Louis , and another downward from Keokuk .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 23]: Before these events , the day was glorious with expectancy ; after them , the day was a dead and empty thing .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 13]: Not only the boys , but the whole village , felt this .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 245]: After all these years I can picture that old time to myself now , just as it was then : the white town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer 's morning ; the streets empty , or pretty nearly so ; one or two clerks sitting in front of the Water Street stores , with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against the wall , chins on breasts , hats slouched over their faces , asleep -- with shingle-shavings enough around to show what broke them down ; a sow and a litter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk , doing a good business in watermelon rinds and seeds ; two or three lonely little freight piles scattered about the ` levee ; ' a pile of ` skids ' on the slope of the stone-paved wharf , and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow of them ; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf , but nobody to listen to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against them ; the great Mississippi , the majestic , the magnificent Mississippi , rolling its mile-wide tide along , shining in the sun ; the dense forest away on the other side ; the ` point ' above the town , and the ` point ' below , bounding the river-glimpse and turning it into a sort of sea , and withal a very still and brilliant and lonely one .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 42]: Presently a film of dark smoke appears above one of those remote ` points ; ' instantly a negro drayman , famous for his quick eye and prodigious voice , lifts up the cry , 'S - t-e-a-m-boat a-comin ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 5]: and the scene changes !
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 40]: The town drunkard stirs , the clerks wake up , a furious clatter of drays follows , every house and store pours out a human contribution , and all in a twinkling the dead town is alive and moving .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 22]: Drays , carts , men , boys , all go hurrying from many quarters to a common center , the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 24]: Assembled there , the people fasten their eyes upon the coming boat as upon a wonder they are seeing for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 11]: And the boat IS rather a handsome sight , too .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 249]: She is long and sharp and trim and pretty ; she has two tall , fancy-topped chimneys , with a gilded device of some kind swung between them ; a fanciful pilot-house , a glass and ` gingerbread ' , perched on top of the ` texas ' deck behind them ; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat 's name ; the boiler deck , the hurricane deck , and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings ; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff ; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely ; the upper decks are black with passengers ; the captain stands by the big bell , calm , imposing , the envy of all ; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys -- a husbanded grandeur created with a bit of pitch pine just before arriving at a town ; the crew are grouped on the forecastle ; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow , and an envied deckhand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand ; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge-cocks , the captain lifts his hand , a bell rings , the wheels stop ; then they turn back , churning the water to foam , and the steamer is at rest .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 48]: Then such a scramble as there is to get aboard , and to get ashore , and to take in freight and to discharge freight , all at one and the same time ; and such a yelling and cursing as the mates facilitate it all with !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 25]: Ten minutes later the steamer is under way again , with no flag on the jack-staff and no black smoke issuing from the chimneys .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 21]: After ten more minutes the town is dead again , and the town drunkard asleep by the skids once more .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 31]: My father was a justice of the peace , and I supposed he possessed the power of life and death over all men and could hang anybody that offended him .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 23]: This was distinction enough for me as a general thing ; but the desire to be a steamboatman kept intruding , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 68]: I first wanted to be a cabin-boy , so that I could come out with a white apron on and shake a tablecloth over the side , where all my old comrades could see me ; later I thought I would rather be the deckhand who stood on the end of the stage-plank with the coil of rope in his hand , because he was particularly conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 18]: But these were only day-dreams , -- they were too heavenly to be contemplated as real possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 10]: By and by one of our boys went away .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 10]: He was not heard of for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 16]: At last he turned up as apprentice engineer or ` striker ' on a steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 12]: This thing shook the bottom out of all my Sunday-school teachings .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 29]: That boy had been notoriously worldly , and I just the reverse ; yet he was exalted to this eminence , and I left in obscurity and misery .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 11]: There was nothing generous about this fellow in his greatness .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 44]: He would always manage to have a rusty bolt to scrub while his boat tarried at our town , and he would sit on the inside guard and scrub it , where we could all see him and envy him and loathe him .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 65]: And whenever his boat was laid up he would come home and swell around the town in his blackest and greasiest clothes , so that nobody could help remembering that he was a steamboatman ; and he used all sorts of steamboat technicalities in his talk , as if he were so used to them that he forgot common people could not understand them .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 27]: He would speak of the ` labboard ' side of a horse in an easy , natural way that would make one wish he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 89]: And he was always talking about ` St. Looy ' like an old citizen ; he would refer casually to occasions when he ` was coming down Fourth Street , ' or when he was ` passing by the Planter 's House , ' or when there was a fire and he took a turn on the brakes of ` the old Big Missouri ; ' and then he would go on and lie about how many towns the size of ours were burned down there that day .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 42]: Two or three of the boys had long been persons of consideration among us because they had been to St. Louis once and had a vague general knowledge of its wonders , but the day of their glory was over now .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 21]: They lapsed into a humble silence , and learned to disappear when the ruthless ` cub ' - engineer approached .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 11]: This fellow had money , too , and hair oil .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 12]: Also an ignorant silver watch and a showy brass watch chain .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 10]: He wore a leather belt and used no suspenders .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 17]: If ever a youth was cordially admired and hated by his comrades , this one was .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 7]: No girl could withstand his charms .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 11]: He ` cut out ' every boy in the village .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 24]: When his boat blew up at last , it diffused a tranquil contentment among us such as we had not known for months .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 59]: But when he came home the next week , alive , renowned , and appeared in church all battered up and bandaged , a shining hero , stared at and wondered over by everybody , it seemed to us that the partiality of Providence for an undeserving reptile had reached a point where it was open to criticism .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 15]: This creature 's career could produce but one result , and it speedily followed .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 10]: Boy after boy managed to get on the river .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 8]: The minister 's son became an engineer .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 45]: The doctor 's and the post-master 's sons became ` mud clerks ; ' the wholesale liquor dealer 's son became a barkeeper on a boat ; four sons of the chief merchant , and two sons of the county judge , became pilots .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 8]: Pilot was the grandest position of all .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 36]: The pilot , even in those days of trivial wages , had a princely salary -- from a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month , and no board to pay .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 15]: Two months of his wages would pay a preacher 's salary for a year .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 8]: Now some of us were left disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 17]: We could not get on the river -- at least our parents would not let us .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: So by and by I ran away .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 19]: I said I never would come home again till I was a pilot and could come in glory .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 8]: But somehow I could not manage it .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 44]: I went meekly aboard a few of the boats that lay packed together like sardines at the long St. Louis wharf , and very humbly inquired for the pilots , but got only a cold shoulder and short words from mates and clerks .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 53]: I had to make the best of this sort of treatment for the time being , but I had comforting daydreams of a future when I should be a great and honored pilot , with plenty of money , and could kill some of these mates and clerks and pay for them .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 28]: Chapter 5 I Want to be a Cub-pilot MONTHS afterward the hope within me struggled to a reluctant death , and I found myself without an ambition .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 8]: But I was ashamed to go home .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 17]: I was in Cincinnati , and I set to work to map out a new career .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 21]: I had been reading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by an expedition sent out by our government .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 36]: It was said that the expedition , owing to difficulties , had not thoroughly explored a part of the country lying about the head-waters , some four thousand miles from the mouth of the river .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 21]: It was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to New Orleans , where I could doubtless get a ship .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 17]: I had thirty dollars left ; I would go and complete the exploration of the Amazon .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 11]: This was all the thought I gave to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 9]: I never was great in matters of detail .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 23]: I packed my valise , and took passage on an ancient tub called the ` Paul Jones , ' for New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 37]: For the sum of sixteen dollars I had the scarred and tarnished splendors of ` her ' main saloon principally to myself , for she was not a creature to attract the eye of wiser travelers .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 28]: When we presently got under way and went poking down the broad Ohio , I became a new being , and the subject of my own admiration .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 5]: I was a traveler !
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 12]: A word never had tasted so good in my mouth before .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 26]: I had an exultant sense of being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes which I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 40]: I was in such a glorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of me , and I was able to look down and pity the untraveled with a compassion that had hardly a trace of contempt in it .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 35]: Still , when we stopped at villages and wood-yards , I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the boiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country boys on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 30]: If they did not seem to discover me , I presently sneezed to attract their attention , or moved to a position where they could not help seeing me .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 25]: And as soon as I knew they saw me I gaped and stretched , and gave other signs of being mightily bored with traveling .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 36]: I kept my hat off all the time , and stayed where the wind and the sun could strike me , because I wanted to get the bronzed and weather-beaten look of an old traveler .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 37]: Before the second day was half gone I experienced a joy which filled me with the purest gratitude ; for I saw that the skin had begun to blister and peel off my face and neck .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 14]: I wished that the boys and girls at home could see me now .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 13]: We reached Louisville in time -- at least the neighborhood of it .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 21]: We stuck hard and fast on the rocks in the middle of the river , and lay there four days .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 34]: I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a part of the boat 's family , a sort of infant son to the captain and younger brother to the officers .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 27]: There is no estimating the pride I took in this grandeur , or the affection that began to swell and grow in me for those people .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 18]: I could not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns that sort of presumption in a mere landsman .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 34]: I particularly longed to acquire the least trifle of notice from the big stormy mate , and I was on the alert for an opportunity to do him a service to that end .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 5]: It came at last .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 51]: The riotous powwow of setting a spar was going on down on the forecastle , and I went down there and stood around in the way -- or mostly skipping out of it -- till the mate suddenly roared a general order for somebody to bring him a capstan bar .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 21]: I sprang to his side and said : ` Tell me where it is -- I 'll fetch it ! '
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 29]: If a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic service for the Emperor of Russia , the monarch could not have been more astounded than the mate was .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 5]: He even stopped swearing .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 8]: He stood and stared down at me .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 13]: It took him ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 16]: Then he said impressively : ` Well , if this do n't beat hell ! '
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 23]: and turned to his work with the air of a man who had been confronted with a problem too abstruse for solution .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 14]: I crept away , and courted solitude for the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 18]: I did not go to dinner ; I stayed away from supper until everybody else had finished .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 18]: I did not feel so much like a member of the boat 's family now as before .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 18]: However , my spirits returned , in installments , as we pursued our way down the river .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 24]: I was sorry I hated the mate so , because it was not in -LRB- young -RRB- human nature not to admire him .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 56]: He was huge and muscular , his face was bearded and whiskered all over ; he had a red woman and a blue woman tattooed on his right arm , -- one on each side of a blue anchor with a red rope to it ; and in the matter of profanity he was sublime .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 20]: When he was getting out cargo at a landing , I was always where I could see and hear .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 19]: He felt all the majesty of his great position , and made the world feel it , too .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 30]: When he gave even the simplest order , he discharged it like a blast of lightning , and sent a long , reverberating peal of profanity thundering after it .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 26]: I could not help contrasting the way in which the average landsman would give an order , with the mate 's way of doing it .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 60]: If the landsman should wish the gang-plank moved a foot farther forward , he would probably say : ` James , or William , one of you push that plank forward , please ; ' but put the mate in his place and he would roar out : ` Here , now , start that gang-plank for ` ard !
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 4]: Lively , now !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 5]: WHAT 're you about !
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 3]: Snatch it !
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 3]: SNATCH it !
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 2]: there !
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 3]: Aft again !
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 3]: aft again !
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 6]: do n't you hear me .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 5]: Dash it to dash !
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 8]: are you going to SLEEP over it !
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 4]: ` VAST heaving .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 8]: ` Vast heaving , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 7]: Going to heave it clear astern ?
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 8]: WHERE 're you going with that barrel !
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 26]: FOR ` ARD with it ` fore I make you swallow it , you dash-dash-dash-DASHED split between a tired mud-turtle and a crippled hearse-horse ! '
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 8]: I wished I could talk like that .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 33]: When the soreness of my adventure with the mate had somewhat worn off , I began timidly to make up to the humblest official connected with the boat -- the night watchman .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 24]: He snubbed my advances at first , but I presently ventured to offer him a new chalk pipe ; and that softened him .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 25]: So he allowed me to sit with him by the big bell on the hurricane deck , and in time he melted into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 28]: He could not well have helped it , I hung with such homage on his words and so plainly showed that I felt honored by his notice .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 38]: He told me the names of dim capes and shadowy islands as we glided by them in the solemnity of the night , under the winking stars , and by and by got to talking about himself .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 28]: He seemed over-sentimental for a man whose salary was six dollars a week -- or rather he might have seemed so to an older person than I .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 24]: But I drank in his words hungrily , and with a faith that might have moved mountains if it had been applied judiciously .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 16]: What was it to me that he was soiled and seedy and fragrant with gin ?
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 36]: What was it to me that his grammar was bad , his construction worse , and his profanity so void of art that it was an element of weakness rather than strength in his conversation ?
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 20]: He was a wronged man , a man who had seen trouble , and that was enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 26]: As he mellowed into his plaintive history his tears dripped upon the lantern in his lap , and I cried , too , from sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 99]: He said he was the son of an English nobleman -- either an earl or an alderman , he could not remember which , but believed was both ; his father , the nobleman , loved him , but his mother hated him from the cradle ; and so while he was still a little boy he was sent to ` one of them old , ancient colleges ' -- he could n't remember which ; and by and by his father died and his mother seized the property and ` shook ' him as he phrased it .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 95]: After his mother shook him , members of the nobility with whom he was acquainted used their influence to get him the position of ` loblolly-boy in a ship ; ' and from that point my watchman threw off all trammels of date and locality and branched out into a narrative that bristled all along with incredible adventures ; a narrative that was so reeking with bloodshed and so crammed with hair-breadth escapes and the most engaging and unconscious personal villainies , that I sat speechless , enjoying , shuddering , wondering , worshipping .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 79]: It was a sore blight to find out afterwards that he was a low , vulgar , ignorant , sentimental , half-witted humbug , an untraveled native of the wilds of Illinois , who had absorbed wildcat literature and appropriated its marvels , until in time he had woven odds and ends of the mess into this yarn , and then gone on telling it to fledglings like me , until he had come to believe it himself .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 44]: Chapter 6 A Cub-pilot 's Experience WHAT with lying on the rocks four days at Louisville , and some other delays , the poor old ` Paul Jones ' fooled away about two weeks in making the voyage from Cincinnati to New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 39]: This gave me a chance to get acquainted with one of the pilots , and he taught me how to steer the boat , and thus made the fascination of river life more potent than ever for me .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 52]: It also gave me a chance to get acquainted with a youth who had taken deck passage -- more 's the pity ; for he easily borrowed six dollars of me on a promise to return to the boat and pay it back to me the day after we should arrive .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 12]: But he probably died or forgot , for he never came .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 26]: It was doubtless the former , since he had said his parents were wealthy , and he only traveled deck passage because it was cooler .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 5]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 11]: ` Deck ' Passage , i.e. steerage passage . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 6]: I soon discovered two things .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 62]: One was that a vessel would not be likely to sail for the mouth of the Amazon under ten or twelve years ; and the other was that the nine or ten dollars still left in my pocket would not suffice for so imposing an exploration as I had planned , even if I could afford to wait for a ship .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 11]: Therefore it followed that I must contrive a new career .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 12]: The ` Paul Jones ' was now bound for St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 19]: I planned a siege against my pilot , and at the end of three hard days he surrendered .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 31]: He agreed to teach me the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis for five hundred dollars , payable out of the first wages I should receive after graduating .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 30]: I entered upon the small enterprise of ` learning ' twelve or thirteen hundred miles of the great Mississippi River with the easy confidence of my time of life .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 25]: If I had really known what I was about to require of my faculties , I should not have had the courage to begin .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 38]: I supposed that all a pilot had to do was to keep his boat in the river , and I did not consider that that could be much of a trick , since it was so wide .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 23]: The boat backed out from New Orleans at four in the afternoon , and it was ` our watch ' until eight .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 51]: Mr. Bixby , my chief , ` straightened her up , ' plowed her along past the sterns of the other boats that lay at the Levee , and then said , ` Here , take her ; shave those steamships as close as you 'd peel an apple . '
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 39]: I took the wheel , and my heart-beat fluttered up into the hundreds ; for it seemed to me that we were about to scrape the side off every ship in the line , we were so close .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 46]: I held my breath and began to claw the boat away from the danger ; and I had my own opinion of the pilot who had known no better than to get us into such peril , but I was too wise to express it .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 52]: In half a minute I had a wide margin of safety intervening between the ` Paul Jones ' and the ships ; and within ten seconds more I was set aside in disgrace , and Mr. Bixby was going into danger again and flaying me alive with abuse of my cowardice .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 38]: I was stung , but I was obliged to admire the easy confidence with which my chief loafed from side to side of his wheel , and trimmed the ships so closely that disaster seemed ceaselessly imminent .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 53]: When he had cooled a little he told me that the easy water was close ashore and the current outside , and therefore we must hug the bank , up-stream , to get the benefit of the former , and stay well out , down-stream , to take advantage of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 21]: In my own mind I resolved to be a down-stream pilot and leave the up-streaming to people dead to prudence .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 12]: Now and then Mr. Bixby called my attention to certain things .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 10]: Said he , ` This is Six-Mile Point . '
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 3]: I assented .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 16]: It was pleasant enough information , but I could not see the bearing of it .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 15]: I was not conscious that it was a matter of any interest to me .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 12]: Another time he said , ` This is Nine-Mile Point . '
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: Later he said , ` This is Twelve-Mile Point . '
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 24]: They were all about level with the water 's edge ; they all looked about alike to me ; they were monotonously unpicturesque .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 9]: I hoped Mr. Bixby would change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 40]: But no ; he would crowd up around a point , hugging the shore with affection , and then say : ` The slack water ends here , abreast this bunch of China-trees ; now we cross over . '
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 5]: So he crossed over .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 15]: He gave me the wheel once or twice , but I had no luck .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 32]: I either came near chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation , or I yawed too far from shore , and so dropped back into disgrace again and got abused .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 16]: The watch was ended at last , and we took supper and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 21]: At midnight the glare of a lantern shone in my eyes , and the night watchman said -- ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 4]: turn out ! '
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 5]: And then he left .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 22]: I could not understand this extraordinary procedure ; so I presently gave up trying to , and dozed off to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 15]: Pretty soon the watchman was back again , and this time he was gruff .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 4]: I was annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 22]: I said : -- ` What do you want to come bothering around here in the middle of the night for .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 15]: Now as like as not I 'll not get to sleep again to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 18]: The watchman said -- ` Well , if this a n't good , I 'm blest . '
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 27]: The ` off-watch ' was just turning in , and I heard some brutal laughter from them , and such remarks as ` Hello , watchman !
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 9]: a n't the new cub turned out yet ?
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 6]: He 's delicate , likely .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 19]: Give him some sugar in a rag and send for the chambermaid to sing rock-a-by-baby to him . '
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 10]: About this time Mr. Bixby appeared on the scene .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 24]: Something like a minute later I was climbing the pilot-house steps with some of my clothes on and the rest in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 8]: Mr. Bixby was close behind , commenting .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 21]: Here was something fresh -- this thing of getting up in the middle of the night to go to work .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 15]: It was a detail in piloting that had never occurred to me at all .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 31]: I knew that boats ran all night , but somehow I had never happened to reflect that somebody had to get up out of a warm bed to run them .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 32]: I began to fear that piloting was not quite so romantic as I had imagined it was ; there was something very real and work-like about this new phase of it .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 16]: It was a rather dingy night , although a fair number of stars were out .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 30]: The big mate was at the wheel , and he had the old tub pointed at a star and was holding her straight up the middle of the river .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 28]: The shores on either hand were not much more than half a mile apart , but they seemed wonderfully far away and ever so vague and indistinct .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 19]: The mate said : -- ` We 've got to land at Jones 's plantation , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 7]: The vengeful spirit in me exulted .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 47]: I said to myself , I wish you joy of your job , Mr. Bixby ; you 'll have a good time finding Mr. Jones 's plantation such a night as this ; and I hope you never WILL find it as long as you live .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 20]: Mr. Bixby said to the mate : -- ` Upper end of the plantation , or the lower ? '
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 5]: ` Upper . ' '
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 6]: I ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 31]: The stumps there are out of water at this stage : It 's no great distance to the lower , and you 'll have to get along with that . '
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 6]: ` All right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 17]: If Jones do n't like it he 'll have to lump it , I reckon . '
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 6]: And then the mate left .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 12]: My exultation began to cool and my wonder to come up .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 27]: Here was a man who not only proposed to find this plantation on such a night , but to find either end of it you preferred .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 30]: I dreadfully wanted to ask a question , but I was carrying about as many short answers as my cargo-room would admit of , so I held my peace .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 41]: All I desired to ask Mr. Bixby was the simple question whether he was ass enough to really imagine he was going to find that plantation on a night when all plantations were exactly alike and all the same color .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 5]: But I held in .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 12]: I used to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 22]: Mr. Bixby made for the shore and soon was scraping it , just the same as if it had been daylight .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 21]: And not only that , but singing -- ` Father in heaven , the day is declining , ' etc. .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 19]: It seemed to me that I had put my life in the keeping of a peculiarly reckless outcast .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 23]: Presently he turned on me and said : -- ` What 's the name of the first point above New Orleans ? '
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 14]: I was gratified to be able to answer promptly , and I did .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: I said I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: ` Do n't KNOW ? '
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 5]: This manner jolted me .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 12]: I was down at the foot again , in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 12]: But I had to say just what I had said before .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 14]: ` Well , you 're a smart one , ' said Mr. Bixby .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 11]: ` What 's the name of the NEXT point ? '
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 7]: Once more I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 7]: ` Well , this beats anything .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 14]: Tell me the name of ANY point or place I told you . '
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 11]: I studied a while and decided that I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 4]: ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 16]: What do you start out from , above Twelve-Mile Point , to cross over ? '
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 10]: ` I -- I -- do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 10]: ` You -- you -- do n't know ? '
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 7]: mimicking my drawling manner of speech .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 7]: ` What DO you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 11]: ` I -- I -- nothing , for certain . '
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 12]: ` By the great Caesar 's ghost , I believe you !
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 18]: You 're the stupidest dunderhead I ever saw or ever heard of , so help me Moses !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 10]: The idea of you being a pilot -- you !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 16]: Why , you do n't know enough to pilot a cow down a lane . '
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 8]: Oh , but his wrath was up !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 25]: He was a nervous man , and he shuffled from one side of his wheel to the other as if the floor was hot .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 16]: He would boil a while to himself , and then overflow and scald me again .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 4]: ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 15]: What do you suppose I told you the names of those points for ? '
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 32]: I tremblingly considered a moment , and then the devil of temptation provoked me to say : -- ` Well -- to -- to -- be entertaining , I thought . '
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 9]: This was a red rag to the bull .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 33]: He raged and stormed so -LRB- he was crossing the river at the time -RRB- that I judge it made him blind , because he ran over the steering-oar of a trading-scow .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 12]: Of course the traders sent up a volley of red-hot profanity .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 26]: Never was a man so grateful as Mr. Bixby was : because he was brim full , and here were subjects who would TALK BACK .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 23]: He threw open a window , thrust his head out , and such an irruption followed as I never had heard before .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 25]: The fainter and farther away the scowmen 's curses drifted , the higher Mr. Bixby lifted his voice and the weightier his adjectives grew .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 9]: When he closed the window he was empty .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 20]: You could have drawn a seine through his system and not caught curses enough to disturb your mother with .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 37]: Presently he said to me in the gentlest way -- ` My boy , you must get a little memorandum book , and every time I tell you a thing , put it down right away .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 21]: There 's only one way to be a pilot , and that is to get this entire river by heart .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 31]: You have to know it just like A B C. ' That was a dismal revelation to me ; for my memory was never loaded with anything but blank cartridges .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 9]: However , I did not feel discouraged long .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 20]: I judged that it was best to make some allowances , for doubtless Mr. Bixby was ` stretching . '
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 15]: Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few strokes on the big bell .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 16]: The stars were all gone now , and the night was as black as ink .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 23]: I could hear the wheels churn along the bank , but I was not entirely certain that I could see the shore .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 21]: The voice of the invisible watchman called up from the hurricane deck -- ` What 's this , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 6]: ` Jones 's plantation . '
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 20]: I said to myself , I wish I might venture to offer a small bet that it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 6]: But I did not chirp .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 6]: I only waited to see .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 69]: Mr. Bixby handled the engine bells , and in due time the boat 's nose came to the land , a torch glowed from the forecastle , a man skipped ashore , a darky 's voice on the bank said , ` Gim me de k ` yarpet-bag , Mars ' Jones , ' and the next moment we were standing up the river again , all serene .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 41]: I reflected deeply awhile , and then said -- but not aloud -- ` Well , the finding of that plantation was the luckiest accident that ever happened ; but it could n't happen again in a hundred years . '
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 11]: And I fully believed it was an accident , too .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 50]: By the time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up the river , I had learned to be a tolerably plucky up-stream steersman , in daylight , and before we reached St. Louis I had made a trifle of progress in night-work , but only a trifle .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 47]: I had a note-book that fairly bristled with the names of towns , ` points , ' bars , islands , bends , reaches , etc. ; but the information was to be found only in the notebook -- none of it was in my head .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 55]: It made my heart ache to think I had only got half of the river set down ; for as our watch was four hours off and four hours on , day and night , there was a long four-hour gap in my book for every time I had slept since the voyage began .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 24]: My chief was presently hired to go on a big New Orleans boat , and I packed my satchel and went with him .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 6]: She was a grand affair .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 55]: When I stood in her pilot-house I was so far above the water that I seemed perched on a mountain ; and her decks stretched so far away , fore and aft , below me , that I wondered how I could ever have considered the little ` Paul Jones ' a large craft .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 7]: There were other differences , too .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 151]: The ` Paul Jones 's ' pilot-house was a cheap , dingy , battered rattle-trap , cramped for room : but here was a sumptuous glass temple ; room enough to have a dance in ; showy red and gold window-curtains ; an imposing sofa ; leather cushions and a back to the high bench where visiting pilots sit , to spin yarns and ` look at the river ; ' bright , fanciful ` cuspadores ' instead of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust ; nice new oil-cloth on the floor ; a hospitable big stove for winter ; a wheel as high as my head , costly with inlaid work ; a wire tiller-rope ; bright brass knobs for the bells ; and a tidy , white-aproned , black ` texas-tender , ' to bring up tarts and ices and coffee during mid-watch , day and night .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 30]: Now this was ` something like , ' and so I began to take heart once more to believe that piloting was a romantic sort of occupation after all .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 20]: The moment we were under way I began to prowl about the great steamer and fill myself with joy .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 78]: She was as clean and as dainty as a drawing-room ; when I looked down her long , gilded saloon , it was like gazing through a splendid tunnel ; she had an oil-picture , by some gifted sign-painter , on every stateroom door ; she glittered with no end of prism-fringed chandeliers ; the clerk 's office was elegant , the bar was marvelous , and the bar-keeper had been barbered and upholstered at incredible cost .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 56]: The boiler deck -LRB- i.e. the second story of the boat , so to speak -RRB- was as spacious as a church , it seemed to me ; so with the forecastle ; and there was no pitiful handful of deckhands , firemen , and roustabouts down there , but a whole battalion of men .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 20]: The fires were fiercely glaring from a long row of furnaces , and over them were eight huge boilers !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 5]: This was unutterable pomp .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: The mighty engines -- but enough of this .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 8]: I had never felt so fine before .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 22]: And when I found that the regiment of natty servants respectfully ` sir 'd ' me , my satisfaction was complete .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 20]: Chapter 7 A Daring Deed WHEN I returned to the pilot-house St. Louis was gone and I was lost .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 33]: Here was a piece of river which was all down in my book , but I could make neither head nor tail of it : you understand , it was turned around .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 25]: I had seen it when coming up-stream , but I had never faced about to see how it looked when it was behind me .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 21]: My heart broke again , for it was plain that I had got to learn this troublesome river BOTH WAYS .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 17]: The pilot-house was full of pilots , going down to ` look at the river . '
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 79]: What is called the ` upper river ' -LRB- the two hundred miles between St. Louis and Cairo , where the Ohio comes in -RRB- was low ; and the Mississippi changes its channel so constantly that the pilots used to always find it necessary to run down to Cairo to take a fresh look , when their boats were to lie in port a week ; that is , when the water was at a low stage .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 67]: A deal of this ` looking at the river ' was done by poor fellows who seldom had a berth , and whose only hope of getting one lay in their being always freshly posted and therefore ready to drop into the shoes of some reputable pilot , for a single trip , on account of such pilot 's sudden illness , or some other necessity .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 53]: And a good many of them constantly ran up and down inspecting the river , not because they ever really hoped to get a berth , but because -LRB- they being guests of the boat -RRB- it was cheaper to ` look at the river ' than stay ashore and pay board .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 24]: In time these fellows grew dainty in their tastes , and only infested boats that had an established reputation for setting good tables .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 45]: All visiting pilots were useful , for they were always ready and willing , winter or summer , night or day , to go out in the yawl and help buoy the channel or assist the boat 's pilots in any way they could .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 32]: They were likewise welcome because all pilots are tireless talkers , when gathered together , and as they talk only about the river they are always understood and are always interesting .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 25]: Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on earth but the river , and his pride in his occupation surpasses the pride of kings .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: We had a fine company of these river-inspectors along , this trip .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 19]: There were eight or ten ; and there was abundance of room for them in our great pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 23]: Two or three of them wore polished silk hats , elaborate shirt-fronts , diamond breast-pins , kid gloves , and patent-leather boots .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 25]: They were choice in their English , and bore themselves with a dignity proper to men of solid means and prodigious reputation as pilots .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 27]: The others were more or less loosely clad , and wore upon their heads tall felt cones that were suggestive of the days of the Commonwealth .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 18]: I was a cipher in this august company , and felt subdued , not to say torpid .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 58]: I was not even of sufficient consequence to assist at the wheel when it was necessary to put the tiller hard down in a hurry ; the guest that stood nearest did that when occasion required -- and this was pretty much all the time , because of the crookedness of the channel and the scant water .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 20]: I stood in a corner ; and the talk I listened to took the hope all out of me .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 20]: One visitor said to another -- ` Jim , how did you run Plum Point , coming up ? '
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 107]: ` It was in the night , there , and I ran it the way one of the boys on the `` Diana '' told me ; started out about fifty yards above the wood pile on the false point , and held on the cabin under Plum Point till I raised the reef -- quarter less twain -- then straightened up for the middle bar till I got well abreast the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the bend , then got my stern on the cotton-wood and head on the low place above the point , and came through a-booming -- nine and a half . '
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: ` Pretty square crossing , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 13]: ` Yes , but the upper bar 's working down fast . '
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 50]: Another pilot spoke up and said -- ' I had better water than that , and ran it lower down ; started out from the false point -- mark twain -- raised the second reef abreast the big snag in the bend , and had quarter less twain . '
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 37]: One of the gorgeous ones remarked -- ' I do n't want to find fault with your leadsmen , but that 's a good deal of water for Plum Point , it seems to me . '
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 21]: There was an approving nod all around as this quiet snub dropped on the boaster and ` settled ' him .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 7]: And so they went on talk-talk-talking .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 128]: Meantime , the thing that was running in my mind was , ` Now if my ears hear aright , I have not only to get the names of all the towns and islands and bends , and so on , by heart , but I must even get up a warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cotton-wood and obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve hundred miles ; and more than that , I must actually know where these things are in the dark , unless these guests are gifted with eyes that can pierce through two miles of solid blackness ; I wish the piloting business was in Jericho and I had never thought of it . '
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 37]: At dusk Mr. Bixby tapped the big bell three times -LRB- the signal to land -RRB- , and the captain emerged from his drawing-room in the forward end of the texas , and looked up inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 16]: Mr. Bixby said -- ` We will lay up here all night , captain . '
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 7]: ` Very well , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 13]: The boat came to shore and was tied up for the night .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 25]: It seemed to me a fine thing that the pilot could do as he pleased , without asking so grand a captain 's permission .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 19]: I took my supper and went immediately to bed , discouraged by my day 's observations and experiences .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 13]: My late voyage 's note-booking was but a confusion of meaningless names .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 20]: It had tangled me all up in a knot every time I had looked at it in the daytime .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 27]: I now hoped for respite in sleep ; but no , it reveled all through my head till sunrise again , a frantic and tireless nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 9]: Next morning I felt pretty rusty and low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 38]: We went booming along , taking a good many chances , for we were anxious to ` get out of the river ' -LRB- as getting out to Cairo was called -RRB- before night should overtake us .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 42]: But Mr. Bixby 's partner , the other pilot , presently grounded the boat , and we lost so much time in getting her off that it was plain that darkness would overtake us a good long way above the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 32]: This was a great misfortune , especially to certain of our visiting pilots , whose boats would have to wait for their return , no matter how long that might be .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 9]: It sobered the pilot-house talk a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 21]: Coming up-stream , pilots did not mind low water or any kind of darkness ; nothing stopped them but fog .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 35]: But down-stream work was different ; a boat was too nearly helpless , with a stiff current pushing behind her ; so it was not customary to run down-stream at night in low water .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 41]: There seemed to be one small hope , however : if we could get through the intricate and dangerous Hat Island crossing before night , we could venture the rest , for we would have plainer sailing and better water .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 12]: But it would be insanity to attempt Hat Island at night .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 54]: So there was a deal of looking at watches all the rest of the day , and a constant ciphering upon the speed we were making ; Hat Island was the eternal subject ; sometimes hope was high and sometimes we were delayed in a bad crossing , and down it went again .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 65]: For hours all hands lay under the burden of this suppressed excitement ; it was even communicated to me , and I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island , and under such an awful pressure of responsibility , that I wished I might have five minutes on shore to draw a good , full , relieving breath , and start over again .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 7]: We were standing no regular watches .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 35]: Each of our pilots ran such portions of the river as he had run when coming up-stream , because of his greater familiarity with it ; but both remained in the pilot house constantly .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 17]: An hour before sunset , Mr. Bixby took the wheel and Mr. W -- stepped aside .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 22]: For the next thirty minutes every man held his watch in his hand and was restless , silent , and uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 26]: At last somebody said , with a doomful sigh -- ` Well , yonder 's Hat Island -- and we ca n't make it . '
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 38]: All the watches closed with a snap , everybody sighed and muttered something about its being ` too bad , too bad -- ah , if we could only have got here half an hour sooner ! '
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 11]: and the place was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 15]: Some started to go out , but loitered , hearing no bell-tap to land .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 12]: The sun dipped behind the horizon , the boat went on .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 39]: Inquiring looks passed from one guest to another ; and one who had his hand on the door-knob and had turned it , waited , then presently took away his hand and let the knob turn back again .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 7]: We bore steadily down the bend .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 15]: More looks were exchanged , and nods of surprised admiration -- but no words .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 22]: Insensibly the men drew together behind Mr. Bixby , as the sky darkened and one or two dim stars came out .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 10]: The dead silence and sense of waiting became oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 22]: Mr. Bixby pulled the cord , and two deep , mellow notes from the big bell floated off on the night .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 11]: Then a pause , and one more note was struck .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 17]: The watchman 's voice followed , from the hurricane deck -- ` Labboard lead , there !
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 4]: Stabboard lead ! '
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 25]: The cries of the leadsmen began to rise out of the distance , and were gruffly repeated by the word-passers on the hurricane deck .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 5]: 'M - a-r-k three !
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 4]: ... M-a-r-k three !
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 4]: ... Quarter-less three !
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 4]: ... Half twain !
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 4]: ... Quarter twain !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 4]: ... M-a-r-k twain !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 28]: ... Quarter-less -- ' Mr. Bixby pulled two bell-ropes , and was answered by faint jinglings far below in the engine room , and our speed slackened .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 9]: The steam began to whistle through the gauge-cocks .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 21]: The cries of the leadsmen went on -- and it is a weird sound , always , in the night .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 19]: Every pilot in the lot was watching now , with fixed eyes , and talking under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 9]: Nobody was calm and easy but Mr. Bixby .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 50]: He would put his wheel down and stand on a spoke , and as the steamer swung into her -LRB- to me -RRB- utterly invisible marks -- for we seemed to be in the midst of a wide and gloomy sea -- he would meet and fasten her there .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 33]: Out of the murmur of half-audible talk , one caught a coherent sentence now and then -- such as -- ` There ; she 's over the first reef all right ! '
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 22]: After a pause , another subdued voice -- ` Her stern 's coming down just exactly right , by George ! '
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 13]: ` Now she 's in the marks ; over she goes ! '
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 15]: Somebody else muttered -- ` Oh , it was done beautiful -- BEAUTIFUL ! '
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 14]: Now the engines were stopped altogether , and we drifted with the current .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 23]: Not that I could see the boat drift , for I could not , the stars being all gone by this time .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 14]: This drifting was the dismalest work ; it held one 's heart still .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 12]: Presently I discovered a blacker gloom than that which surrounded us .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 8]: It was the head of the island .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 8]: We were closing right down upon it .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 36]: We entered its deeper shadow , and so imminent seemed the peril that I was likely to suffocate ; and I had the strongest impulse to do SOMETHING , anything , to save the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 28]: But still Mr. Bixby stood by his wheel , silent , intent as a cat , and all the pilots stood shoulder to shoulder at his back .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 8]: ` She 'll not make it ! '
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 3]: somebody whispered .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 22]: The water grew shoaler and shoaler , by the leadsman 's cries , till it was down to -- ` Eight-and-a-half !
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 4]: ... E-i-g-h-t feet !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 4]: ... E-i-g-h-t feet !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 23]: ... Seven-and -- ' Mr. Bixby said warningly through his speaking tube to the engineer -- ` Stand by , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 6]: ` Aye-aye , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 3]: ` Seven-and-a-half !
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 3]: Seven feet !
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 7]: Six-and -- ' We touched bottom !
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 30]: Instantly Mr. Bixby set a lot of bells ringing , shouted through the tube , ` NOW , let her have it -- every ounce you 've got ! '
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 11]: then to his partner , ` Put her hard down !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 3]: snatch her !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 4]: snatch her ! '
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 28]: The boat rasped and ground her way through the sand , hung upon the apex of disaster a single tremendous instant , and then over she went !
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 21]: And such a shout as went up at Mr. Bixby 's back never loosened the roof of a pilot-house before !
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 8]: There was no more trouble after that .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 29]: Mr. Bixby was a hero that night ; and it was some little time , too , before his exploit ceased to be talked about by river men .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 123]: Fully to realize the marvelous precision required in laying the great steamer in her marks in that murky waste of water , one should know that not only must she pick her intricate way through snags and blind reefs , and then shave the head of the island so closely as to brush the overhanging foliage with her stern , but at one place she must pass almost within arm 's reach of a sunken and invisible wreck that would snatch the hull timbers from under her if she should strike it , and destroy a quarter of a million dollars ' worth of steam-boat and cargo in five minutes , and maybe a hundred and fifty human lives into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 26]: The last remark I heard that night was a compliment to Mr. Bixby , uttered in soliloquy and with unction by one of our guests .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 18]: He said -- ` By the Shadow of Death , but he 's a lightning pilot ! '
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 48]: Chapter 8 Perplexing Lessons At the end of what seemed a tedious while , I had managed to pack my head full of islands , towns , bars , ` points , ' and bends ; and a curiously inanimate mass of lumber it was , too .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 56]: However , inasmuch as I could shut my eyes and reel off a good long string of these names without leaving out more than ten miles of river in every fifty , I began to feel that I could take a boat down to New Orleans if I could make her skip those little gaps .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 33]: But of course my complacency could hardly get start enough to lift my nose a trifle into the air , before Mr. Bixby would think of something to fetch it down again .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 21]: One day he turned on me suddenly with this settler -- ` What is the shape of Walnut Bend ? '
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 14]: He might as well have asked me my grandmother 's opinion of protoplasm .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 17]: I reflected respectfully , and then said I did n't know it had any particular shape .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 26]: My gunpowdery chief went off with a bang , of course , and then went on loading and firing until he was out of adjectives .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 38]: I had learned long ago that he only carried just so many rounds of ammunition , and was sure to subside into a very placable and even remorseful old smooth-bore as soon as they were all gone .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 16]: That word ` old ' is merely affectionate ; he was not more than thirty-four .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 3]: I waited .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 22]: By and by he said -- ` My boy , you 've got to know the SHAPE of the river perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 15]: It is all there is left to steer by on a very dark night .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: Everything else is blotted out and gone .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 21]: But mind you , it has n't the same shape in the night that it has in the day-time . '
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 15]: ` How on earth am I ever going to learn it , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 13]: ` How do you follow a hall at home in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 8]: Because you know the shape of it .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 7]: You ca n't see it . '
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 41]: ` Do you mean to say that I 've got to know all the million trifling variations of shape in the banks of this interminable river as well as I know the shape of the front hall at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 30]: ` On my honor , you 've got to know them BETTER than any man ever did know the shapes of the halls in his own house . ' '
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 7]: I wish I was dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 33]: ` Now I do n't want to discourage you , but -- ' ` Well , pile it on me ; I might as well have it now as another time . '
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 19]: ` You see , this has got to be learned ; there is n't any getting around it .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 61]: A clear starlight night throws such heavy shadows that if you did n't know the shape of a shore perfectly you would claw away from every bunch of timber , because you would take the black shadow of it for a solid cape ; and you see you would be getting scared to death every fifteen minutes by the watch .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 21]: You would be fifty yards from shore all the time when you ought to be within fifty feet of it .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 35]: You ca n't see a snag in one of those shadows , but you know exactly where it is , and the shape of the river tells you when you are coming to it .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 27]: Then there 's your pitch-dark night ; the river is a very different shape on a pitch-dark night from what it is on a starlight night .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 30]: All shores seem to be straight lines , then , and mighty dim ones , too ; and you 'd RUN them for straight lines only you know better .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 42]: You boldly drive your boat right into what seems to be a solid , straight wall -LRB- you knowing very well that in reality there is a curve there -RRB- , and that wall falls back and makes way for you .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 7]: Then there 's your gray mist .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 29]: You take a night when there 's one of these grisly , drizzly , gray mists , and then there is n't any particular shape to a shore .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 15]: A gray mist would tangle the head of the oldest man that ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 18]: Well , then , different kinds of MOONLIGHT change the shape of the river in different ways .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 15]: You see -- ' ` Oh , do n't say any more , please !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 20]: Have I got to learn the shape of the river according to all these five hundred thousand different ways ?
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 18]: If I tried to carry all that cargo in my head it would make me stoop-shouldered . '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 3]: ` NO !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 43]: you only learn THE shape of the river , and you learn it with such absolute certainty that you can always steer by the shape that 's IN YOUR HEAD , and never mind the one that 's before your eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 21]: ` Very well , I 'll try it ; but after I have learned it can I depend on it .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 13]: Will it keep the same form and not go fooling around ? '
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 47]: Before Mr. Bixby could answer , Mr. W -- came in to take the watch , and he said -- ` Bixby , you 'll have to look out for President 's Island and all that country clear away up above the Old Hen and Chickens .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 14]: The banks are caving and the shape of the shores changing like everything .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 11]: Why , you would n't know the point above 40 .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 11]: You can go up inside the old sycamore-snag , now .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 5]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 27]: It may not be necessary , but still it can do no harm to explain that ` inside ' means between the snag and the shore .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 10]: -- M.T. -RSB- -RCB- So that question was answered .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: Here were leagues of shore changing shape .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 9]: My spirits were down in the mud again .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 8]: Two things seemed pretty apparent to me .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 49]: One was , that in order to be a pilot a man had got to learn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know ; and the other was , that he must learn it all over again in a different way every twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 9]: That night we had the watch until twelve .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 20]: Now it was an ancient river custom for the two pilots to chat a bit when the watch changed .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 58]: While the relieving pilot put on his gloves and lit his cigar , his partner , the retiring pilot , would say something like this -- ' I judge the upper bar is making down a little at Hale 's Point ; had quarter twain with the lower lead and mark twain -LCB- footnote -LSB- Two fathoms .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 11]: ` Quarter twain ' is two-and-a-quarter fathoms , thirteen-and-a-half feet .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 10]: ` Mark three ' is three fathoms . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 5]: with the other . '
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 15]: ` Yes , I thought it was making down a little , last trip .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 5]: Meet any boats ? '
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 27]: ` Met one abreast the head of 21 , but she was away over hugging the bar , and I could n't make her out entirely .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 20]: I took her for the `` Sunny South '' -- had n't any skylights forward of the chimneys . '
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 4]: And so on .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 29]: And as the relieving pilot took the wheel his partner -LCB- footnote -LSB- ` Partner ' is a technical term for ` the other pilot ' . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 24]: would mention that we were in such-and-such a bend , and say we were abreast of such-and-such a man 's wood-yard or plantation .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 10]: This was courtesy ; I supposed it was necessity .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 34]: But Mr. W -- came on watch full twelve minutes late on this particular night , -- a tremendous breach of etiquette ; in fact , it is the unpardonable sin among pilots .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 24]: So Mr. Bixby gave him no greeting whatever , but simply surrendered the wheel and marched out of the pilot-house without a word .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 60]: I was appalled ; it was a villainous night for blackness , we were in a particularly wide and blind part of the river , where there was no shape or substance to anything , and it seemed incredible that Mr. Bixby should have left that poor fellow to kill the boat trying to find out where he was .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: But I resolved that I would stand by him any way .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: He should find that he was not wholly friendless .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 14]: So I stood around , and waited to be asked where we were .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 26]: But Mr. W -- plunged on serenely through the solid firmament of black cats that stood for an atmosphere , and never opened his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 60]: Here is a proud devil , thought I ; here is a limb of Satan that would rather send us all to destruction than put himself under obligations to me , because I am not yet one of the salt of the earth and privileged to snub captains and lord it over everything dead and alive in a steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 26]: I presently climbed up on the bench ; I did not think it was safe to go to sleep while this lunatic was on watch .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 43]: However , I must have gone to sleep in the course of time , because the next thing I was aware of was the fact that day was breaking , Mr. W -- gone , and Mr. Bixby at the wheel again .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 30]: So it was four o'clock and all well -- but me ; I felt like a skinful of dry bones and all of them trying to ache at once .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 12]: Mr. Bixby asked me what I had stayed up there for .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 20]: I confessed that it was to do Mr. W -- a benevolence , -- tell him where he was .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 47]: It took five minutes for the entire preposterousness of the thing to filter into Mr. Bixby 's system , and then I judge it filled him nearly up to the chin ; because he paid me a compliment -- and not much of a one either .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 29]: He said , ` Well , taking you by-and-large , you do seem to be more different kinds of an ass than any creature I ever saw before .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 11]: What did you suppose he wanted to know for ? '
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 12]: I said I thought it might be a convenience to him .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 4]: ` Convenience D-nation !
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 29]: Did n't I tell you that a man 's got to know the river in the night the same as he 'd know his own front hall ? '
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 51]: ` Well , I can follow the front hall in the dark if I know it IS the front hall ; but suppose you set me down in the middle of it in the dark and not tell me which hall it is ; how am I to know ? '
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 12]: ` Well you 've GOT to , on the river ! '
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 4]: ` All right .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 19]: Then I 'm glad I never said anything to Mr. W -- ' ' I should say so .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 24]: Why , he 'd have slammed you through the window and utterly ruined a hundred dollars ' worth of window-sash and stuff . '
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 20]: I was glad this damage had been saved , for it would have made me unpopular with the owners .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 16]: They always hated anybody who had the name of being careless , and injuring things .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 37]: I went to work now to learn the shape of the river ; and of all the eluding and ungraspable objects that ever I tried to get mind or hands on , that was the chief .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 68]: I would fasten my eyes upon a sharp , wooded point that projected far into the river some miles ahead of me , and go to laboriously photographing its shape upon my brain ; and just as I was beginning to succeed to my satisfaction , we would draw up toward it and the exasperating thing would begin to melt away and fold back into the bank !
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 45]: If there had been a conspicuous dead tree standing upon the very point of the cape , I would find that tree inconspicuously merged into the general forest , and occupying the middle of a straight shore , when I got abreast of it !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 47]: No prominent hill would stick to its shape long enough for me to make up my mind what its form really was , but it was as dissolving and changeful as if it had been a mountain of butter in the hottest corner of the tropics .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 20]: Nothing ever had the same shape when I was coming downstream that it had borne when I went up .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 9]: I mentioned these little difficulties to Mr. Bixby .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 14]: He said -- ` That 's the very main virtue of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 17]: If the shapes did n't change every three seconds they would n't be of any use .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 11]: Take this place where we are now , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 117]: As long as that hill over yonder is only one hill , I can boom right along the way I 'm going ; but the moment it splits at the top and forms a V , I know I 've got to scratch to starboard in a hurry , or I 'll bang this boat 's brains out against a rock ; and then the moment one of the prongs of the V swings behind the other , I 've got to waltz to larboard again , or I 'll have a misunderstanding with a snag that would snatch the keelson out of this steamboat as neatly as if it were a sliver in your hand .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 26]: If that hill did n't change its shape on bad nights there would be an awful steamboat grave-yard around here inside of a year . '
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 62]: It was plain that I had got to learn the shape of the river in all the different ways that could be thought of , -- upside down , wrong end first , inside out , fore-and-aft , and ` thortships , ' -- and then know what to do on gray nights when it had n't any shape at all .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 6]: So I set about it .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 26]: In the course of time I began to get the best of this knotty lesson , and my self-complacency moved to the front once more .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 16]: Mr. Bixby was all fixed , and ready to start it to the rear again .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 27]: He opened on me after this fashion -- ` How much water did we have in the middle crossing at Hole-in-the-Wall , trip before last ? '
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 6]: I considered this an outrage .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 28]: I said -- ` Every trip , down and up , the leadsmen are singing through that tangled place for three-quarters of an hour on a stretch .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 14]: How do you reckon I can remember such a mess as that ? '
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 11]: ` My boy , you 've got to remember it .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 72]: You 've got to remember the exact spot and the exact marks the boat lay in when we had the shoalest water , in everyone of the five hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New Orleans ; and you must n't get the shoal soundings and marks of one trip mixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another , either , for they 're not often twice alike .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 7]: You must keep them separate . '
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 45]: When I came to myself again , I said -- ` When I get so that I can do that , I 'll be able to raise the dead , and then I wo n't have to pilot a steamboat to make a living .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 8]: I want to retire from this business .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 16]: I want a slush-bucket and a brush ; I 'm only fit for a roustabout .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 33]: I have n't got brains enough to be a pilot ; and if I had I would n't have strength enough to carry them around , unless I went on crutches . '
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 5]: ` Now drop that !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 21]: When I say I 'll learn -LCB- footnote -LSB- ` Teach ' is not in the river vocabulary . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 9]: a man the river , I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 16]: And you can depend on it , I 'll learn him or kill him . '
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 16]: Chapter 9 Continued Perplexities THERE was no use in arguing with a person like this .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 27]: I promptly put such a strain on my memory that by and by even the shoal water and the countless crossing-marks began to stay with me .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 8]: But the result was just the same .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 15]: I never could more than get one knotty thing learned before another presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 32]: Now I had often seen pilots gazing at the water and pretending to read it as if it were a book ; but it was a book that told me nothing .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 25]: A time came at last , however , when Mr. Bixby seemed to think me far enough advanced to bear a lesson on water-reading .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 19]: So he began -- ` Do you see that long slanting line on the face of the water ?
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 7]: Now , that 's a reef .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 8]: Moreover , it 's a bluff reef .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 22]: There is a solid sand-bar under it that is nearly as straight up and down as the side of a house .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 18]: There is plenty of water close up to it , but mighty little on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 15]: If you were to hit it you would knock the boat 's brains out .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 19]: Do you see where the line fringes out at the upper end and begins to fade away ? '
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 17]: ` Well , that is a low place ; that is the head of the reef .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 11]: You can climb over there , and not hurt anything .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 22]: Cross over , now , and follow along close under the reef -- easy water there -- not much current . '
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 12]: I followed the reef along till I approached the fringed end .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 10]: Then Mr. Bixby said -- ` Now get ready .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 7]: Wait till I give the word .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 15]: She wo n't want to mount the reef ; a boat hates shoal water .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 13]: Stand by -- wait -- WAIT -- keep her well in hand .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 5]: NOW cramp her down !
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 3]: Snatch her !
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 4]: snatch her ! '
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 27]: He seized the other side of the wheel and helped to spin it around until it was hard down , and then we held it so .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 39]: The boat resisted , and refused to answer for a while , and next she came surging to starboard , mounted the reef , and sent a long , angry ridge of water foaming away from her bows .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 19]: ` Now watch her ; watch her like a cat , or she 'll get away from you .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 57]: When she fights strong and the tiller slips a little , in a jerky , greasy sort of way , let up on her a trifle ; it is the way she tells you at night that the water is too shoal ; but keep edging her up , little by little , toward the point .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 36]: You are well up on the bar , now ; there is a bar under every point , because the water that comes down around it forms an eddy and allows the sediment to sink .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 22]: Do you see those fine lines on the face of the water that branch out like the ribs of a fan .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 23]: Well , those are little reefs ; you want to just miss the ends of them , but run them pretty close .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 7]: Now look out -- look out !
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 23]: Do n't you crowd that slick , greasy-looking place ; there ai n't nine feet there ; she wo n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 13]: She begins to smell it ; look sharp , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 7]: Oh blazes , there you go !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 5]: Stop the starboard wheel !
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: Ship up to back !
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 4]: Set her back !
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 30]: The engine bells jingled and the engines answered promptly , shooting white columns of steam far aloft out of the ` scape pipes , but it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 60]: The boat had ` smelt ' the bar in good earnest ; the foamy ridges that radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared , a great dead swell came rolling forward and swept ahead of her , she careened far over to larboard , and went tearing away toward the other shore as if she were about scared to death .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 24]: We were a good mile from where we ought to have been , when we finally got the upper hand of her again .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 23]: During the afternoon watch the next day , Mr. Bixby asked me if I knew how to run the next few miles .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 42]: I said -- ` Go inside the first snag above the point , outside the next one , start out from the lower end of Higgins 's wood-yard , make a square crossing and -- ' ` That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 14]: I 'll be back before you close up on the next point . '
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 5]: But he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 22]: He was still below when I rounded it and entered upon a piece of river which I had some misgivings about .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 18]: I did not know that he was hiding behind a chimney to see how I would perform .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 28]: I went gaily along , getting prouder and prouder , for he had never left the boat in my sole charge such a length of time before .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 49]: I even got to ` setting ' her and letting the wheel go , entirely , while I vaingloriously turned my back and inspected the stem marks and hummed a tune , a sort of easy indifference which I had prodigiously admired in Bixby and other great pilots .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 37]: Once I inspected rather long , and when I faced to the front again my heart flew into my mouth so suddenly that if I had n't clapped my teeth together I should have lost it .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 16]: One of those frightful bluff reefs was stretching its deadly length right across our bows !
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 63]: My head was gone in a moment ; I did not know which end I stood on ; I gasped and could not get my breath ; I spun the wheel down with such rapidity that it wove itself together like a spider 's web ; the boat answered and turned square away from the reef , but the reef followed her !
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 17]: I fled , and still it followed , still it kept -- right across my bows !
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 14]: I never looked to see where I was going , I only fled .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 13]: The awful crash was imminent -- why did n't that villain come !
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 16]: If I committed the crime of ringing a bell , I might get thrown overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 8]: But better that than kill the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 28]: So in blind desperation I started such a rattling ` shivaree ' down below as never had astounded an engineer in this world before , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 41]: Amidst the frenzy of the bells the engines began to back and fill in a furious way , and my reason forsook its throne -- we were about to crash into the woods on the other side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 13]: Just then Mr. Bixby stepped calmly into view on the hurricane deck .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 9]: My soul went out to him in gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 23]: My distress vanished ; I would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara , with Mr. Bixby on the hurricane deck .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 60]: He blandly and sweetly took his tooth-pick out of his mouth between his fingers , as if it were a cigar -- we were just in the act of climbing an overhanging big tree , and the passengers were scudding astern like rats -- and lifted up these commands to me ever so gently -- ` Stop the starboard .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 4]: Stop the larboard .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 7]: Set her back on both . '
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 23]: The boat hesitated , halted , pressed her nose among the boughs a critical instant , then reluctantly began to back away .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 5]: ` Stop the larboard .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 5]: Come ahead on it .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 4]: Stop the starboard .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 5]: Come ahead on it .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 7]: Point her for the bar . '
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 53]: I sailed away as serenely as a summer 's morning Mr. Bixby came in and said , with mock simplicity -- ` When you have a hail , my boy , you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land , so that the engineers can get ready . '
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 15]: I blushed under the sarcasm , and said I had n't had any hail .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 9]: Then it was for wood , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 16]: The officer of the watch will tell you when he wants to wood up . '
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 12]: I went on consuming and said I was n't after wood .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 3]: ` Indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 14]: Why , what could you want over here in the bend , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 19]: Did you ever know of a boat following a bend up-stream at this stage of the river ? '
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 14]: ` No sir , -- and I was n't trying to follow it .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 10]: I was getting away from a bluff reef . '
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 23]: ` No , it was n't a bluff reef ; there is n't one within three miles of where you were . '
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 6]: ` But I saw it .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 10]: It was as bluff as that one yonder . '
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 4]: ` Just about .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 5]: Run over it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 10]: ` Do you give it as an order ? '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 5]: Run over it . '
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 13]: ` If I do n't , I wish I may die . '
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 11]: ` All right ; I am taking the responsibility . '
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 21]: I was just as anxious to kill the boat , now , as I had been to save her before .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 24]: I impressed my orders upon my memory , to be used at the inquest , and made a straight break for the reef .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 19]: As it disappeared under our bows I held my breath ; but we slid over it like oil .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 9]: ` Now do n't you see the difference ?
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 9]: It was n't anything but a WIND reef .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 6]: The wind does that . '
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 5]: ` So I see .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 9]: But it is exactly like a bluff reef .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 12]: How am I ever going to tell them apart ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 6]: I ca n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 5]: It is an instinct .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 36]: By and by you will just naturally KNOW one from the other , but you never will be able to explain why or how you know them apart ' It turned out to be true .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 52]: The face of the water , in time , became a wonderful book -- a book that was a dead language to the uneducated passenger , but which told its mind to me without reserve , delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with a voice .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 25]: And it was not a book to be read once and thrown aside , for it had a new story to tell every day .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 47]: Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there was never a page that was void of interest , never one that you could leave unread without loss , never one that you would want to skip , thinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other thing .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 29]: There never was so wonderful a book written by man ; never one whose interest was so absorbing , so unflagging , so sparkingly renewed with every reperusal .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 99]: The passenger who could not read it was charmed with a peculiar sort of faint dimple on its surface -LRB- on the rare occasions when he did not overlook it altogether -RRB- ; but to the pilot that was an ITALICIZED passage ; indeed , it was more than that , it was a legend of the largest capitals , with a string of shouting exclamation points at the end of it ; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 22]: It is the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes , and the most hideous to a pilot 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 52]: In truth , the passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds , whereas to the trained eye these were not pictures at all , but the grimmest and most dead-earnest of reading-matter .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 41]: Now when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to know every trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters of the alphabet , I had made a valuable acquisition .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 8]: But I had lost something , too .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I lived .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 17]: All the grace , the beauty , the poetry had gone out of the majestic river !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 19]: I still keep in mind a certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 159]: A broad expanse of the river was turned to blood ; in the middle distance the red hue brightened into gold , through which a solitary log came floating , black and conspicuous ; in one place a long , slanting mark lay sparkling upon the water ; in another the surface was broken by boiling , tumbling rings , that were as many-tinted as an opal ; where the ruddy flush was faintest , was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines , ever so delicately traced ; the shore on our left was densely wooded , and the somber shadow that fell from this forest was broken in one place by a long , ruffled trail that shone like silver ; and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single leafy bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was flowing from the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 43]: There were graceful curves , reflected images , woody heights , soft distances ; and over the whole scene , far and near , the dissolving lights drifted steadily , enriching it , every passing moment , with new marvels of coloring .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 6]: I stood like one bewitched .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 10]: I drank it in , in a speechless rapture .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 18]: The world was new to me , and I had never seen anything like this at home .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 48]: But as I have said , a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river 's face ; another day came when I ceased altogether to note them .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 207]: Then , if that sunset scene had been repeated , I should have looked upon it without rapture , and should have commented upon it , inwardly , after this fashion : This sun means that we are going to have wind to-morrow ; that floating log means that the river is rising , small thanks to it ; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef which is going to kill somebody 's steamboat one of these nights , if it keeps on stretching out like that ; those tumbling ` boils ' show a dissolving bar and a changing channel there ; the lines and circles in the slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is shoaling up dangerously ; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the ` break ' from a new snag , and he has located himself in the very best place he could have found to fish for steamboats ; that tall dead tree , with a single living branch , is not going to last long , and then how is a body ever going to get through this blind place at night without the friendly old landmark .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 14]: No , the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 28]: All the value any feature of it had for me now was the amount of usefulness it could furnish toward compassing the safe piloting of a steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 12]: Since those days , I have pitied doctors from my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 26]: What does the lovely flush in a beauty 's cheek mean to a doctor but a ` break ' that ripples above some deadly disease .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 21]: Are not all her visible charms sown thick with what are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay ?
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 28]: Does he ever see her beauty at all , or does n't he simply view her professionally , and comment upon her unwholesome condition all to himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 19]: And does n't he sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning his trade ?
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 33]: Chapter 10 Completing My Education WHOSOEVER has done me the courtesy to read my chapters which have preceded this may possibly wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting as a science .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 17]: It was the prime purpose of those chapters ; and I am not quite done yet .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 20]: I wish to show , in the most patient and painstaking way , what a wonderful science it is .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 143]: Ship channels are buoyed and lighted , and therefore it is a comparatively easy undertaking to learn to run them ; clear-water rivers , with gravel bottoms , change their channels very gradually , and therefore one needs to learn them but once ; but piloting becomes another matter when you apply it to vast streams like the Mississippi and the Missouri , whose alluvial banks cave and change constantly , whose snags are always hunting up new quarters , whose sandbars are never at rest , whose channels are for ever dodging and shirking , and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and all weathers without the aid of a single light-house or a single buoy ; for there is neither light nor buoy to be found anywhere in all this three or four thousand miles of villainous river .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 19]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- True at the time referred to ; not true now -LRB- 1882 -RRB- . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 43]: I feel justified in enlarging upon this great science for the reason that I feel sure no one has ever yet written a paragraph about it who had piloted a steamboat himself , and so had a practical knowledge of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 40]: If the theme were hackneyed , I should be obliged to deal gently with the reader ; but since it is wholly new , I have felt at liberty to take up a considerable degree of room with it .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 122]: When I had learned the name and position of every visible feature of the river ; when I had so mastered its shape that I could shut my eyes and trace it from St. Louis to New Orleans ; when I had learned to read the face of the water as one would cull the news from the morning paper ; and finally , when I had trained my dull memory to treasure up an endless array of soundings and crossing-marks , and keep fast hold of them , I judged that my education was complete : so I got to tilting my cap to the side of my head , and wearing a tooth-pick in my mouth at the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 9]: Mr. Bixby had his eye on these airs .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 20]: One day he said -- ` What is the height of that bank yonder , at Burgess 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 8]: ` How can I tell , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 9]: It is three-quarters of a mile away . '
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 8]: ` Very poor eye -- very poor .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 5]: Take the glass . '
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 15]: I took the glass , and presently said -- ' I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 15]: I suppose that that bank is about a foot and a half high . '
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 6]: ` Foot and a half !
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 6]: That 's a six-foot bank .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 12]: How high was the bank along here last trip ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 10]: I do n't know ; I never noticed . '
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 5]: ` You did n't ?
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 10]: Well , you must always do it hereafter . '
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 16]: ` Because you 'll have to know a good many things that it tells you .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 34]: For one thing , it tells you the stage of the river -- tells you whether there 's more water or less in the river along here than there was last trip . '
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 8]: ` The leads tell me that . '
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 11]: I rather thought I had the advantage of him there .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 9]: ` Yes , but suppose the leads lie ?
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 18]: The bank would tell you so , and then you 'd stir those leadsmen up a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 18]: There was a ten-foot bank here last trip , and there is only a six-foot bank now .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: What does that signify ? '
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 15]: ` That the river is four feet higher than it was last trip . '
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 4]: ` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 8]: Is the river rising or falling ? '
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 4]: ` Rising . '
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: ` No it ai n't . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 8]: I guess I am right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 11]: Yonder is some drift-wood floating down the stream . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 21]: A rise starts the drift-wood , but then it keeps on floating a while after the river is done rising .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 9]: Now the bank will tell you about this .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 13]: Wait till you come to a place where it shelves a little .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 21]: Now here ; do you see this narrow belt of fine sediment That was deposited while the water was higher .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 10]: You see the driftwood begins to strand , too .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 7]: The bank helps in other ways .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 11]: Do you see that stump on the false point ? '
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 8]: ` Ay , ay , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 14]: ` Well , the water is just up to the roots of it .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: You must make a note of that . '
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 16]: ` Because that means that there 's seven feet in the chute of 103 . '
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 13]: ` But 103 is a long way up the river yet . '
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 12]: ` That 's where the benefit of the bank comes in .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 30]: There is water enough in 103 NOW , yet there may not be by the time we get there ; but the bank will keep us posted all along .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 30]: You do n't run close chutes on a falling river , up-stream , and there are precious few of them that you are allowed to run at all down-stream .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 11]: There 's a law of the United States against it .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 22]: The river may be rising by the time we get to 103 , and in that case we 'll run it .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 8]: We are drawing -- how much ? '
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 13]: ` Six feet aft , -- six and a half forward . '
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 11]: ` Well , you do seem to know something . '
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 38]: ` But what I particularly want to know is , if I have got to keep up an everlasting measuring of the banks of this river , twelve hundred miles , month in and month out ? '
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 5]: ` Of course ! '
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 11]: My emotions were too deep for words for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 11]: Presently I said -- ' And how about these chutes .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 8]: Are there many of them ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 5]: I should say so .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 25]: I fancy we sha n't run any of the river this trip as you 've ever seen it run before -- so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 109]: If the river begins to rise again , we 'll go up behind bars that you 've always seen standing out of the river , high and dry like the roof of a house ; we 'll cut across low places that you 've never noticed at all , right through the middle of bars that cover three hundred acres of river ; we 'll creep through cracks where you 've always thought was solid land ; we 'll dart through the woods and leave twenty-five miles of river off to one side ; we 'll see the hind-side of every island between New Orleans and Cairo . '
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 22]: ` Then I 've got to go to work and learn just as much more river as I already know . '
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 18]: ` Just about twice as much more , as near as you can come at it . '
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 9]: ` Well , one lives to find out .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 14]: I think I was a fool when I went into this business . '
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 7]: ` Yes , that is true .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 5]: And you are yet .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 12]: But you 'll not be when you 've learned it . '
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 11]: ` Ah , I never can learn it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 8]: I will see that you DO . '
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 40]: By and by I ventured again -- ` Have I got to learn all this thing just as I know the rest of the river -- shapes and all -- and so I can run it at night ? '
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 45]: And you 've got to have good fair marks from one end of the river to the other , that will help the bank tell you when there is water enough in each of these countless places -- like that stump , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 115]: When the river first begins to rise , you can run half a dozen of the deepest of them ; when it rises a foot more you can run another dozen ; the next foot will add a couple of dozen , and so on : so you see you have to know your banks and marks to a dead moral certainty , and never get them mixed ; for when you start through one of those cracks , there 's no backing out again , as there is in the big river ; you 've got to go through , or stay there six months if you get caught on a falling river .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 27]: There are about fifty of these cracks which you ca n't run at all except when the river is brim full and over the banks . '
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 10]: ` This new lesson is a cheerful prospect . '
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 4]: ` Cheerful enough .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 24]: And mind what I 've just told you ; when you start into one of those places you 've got to go through .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 30]: They are too narrow to turn around in , too crooked to back out of , and the shoal water is always up at the head ; never elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 37]: And the head of them is always likely to be filling up , little by little , so that the marks you reckon their depth by , this season , may not answer for next . '
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 12]: ` Learn a new set , then , every year ? '
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 3]: ` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 7]: Cramp her up to the bar !
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 14]: What are you standing up through the middle of the river for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 9]: The next few months showed me strange things .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 22]: On the same day that we held the conversation above narrated , we met a great rise coming down the river .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 29]: The whole vast face of the stream was black with drifting dead logs , broken boughs , and great trees that had caved in and been washed away .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 111]: It required the nicest steering to pick one 's way through this rushing raft , even in the day-time , when crossing from point to point ; and at night the difficulty was mightily increased ; every now and then a huge log , lying deep in the water , would suddenly appear right under our bows , coming head-on ; no use to try to avoid it then ; we could only stop the engines , and one wheel would walk over that log from one end to the other , keeping up a thundering racket and careening the boat in a way that was very uncomfortable to passengers .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 41]: Now and then we would hit one of these sunken logs a rattling bang , dead in the center , with a full head of steam , and it would stun the boat as if she had hit a continent .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 39]: Sometimes this log would lodge , and stay right across our nose , and back the Mississippi up before it ; we would have to do a little craw-fishing , then , to get away from the obstruction .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 35]: We often hit WHITE logs , in the dark , for we could not see them till we were right on them ; but a black log is a pretty distinct object at night .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 13]: A white snag is an ugly customer when the daylight is gone .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 72]: Of course , on the great rise , down came a swarm of prodigious timber-rafts from the head waters of the Mississippi , coal barges from Pittsburgh , little trading scows from everywhere , and broad-horns from ` Posey County , ' Indiana , freighted with ` fruit and furniture ' -- the usual term for describing it , though in plain English the freight thus aggrandized was hoop-poles and pumpkins .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 16]: Pilots bore a mortal hatred to these craft ; and it was returned with usury .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 23]: The law required all such helpless traders to keep a light burning , but it was a law that was often broken .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 51]: All of a sudden , on a murky night , a light would hop up , right under our bows , almost , and an agonized voice , with the backwoods ` whang ' to it , would wail out -- ` Whar 'n the -- you goin ' to !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 23]: Cai n't you see nothin ' , you dash-dashed aig-suckin ' , sheep-stealin ' , one-eyed son of a stuffed monkey ! '
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 76]: Then for an instant , as we whistled by , the red glare from our furnaces would reveal the scow and the form of the gesticulating orator as if under a lightning-flash , and in that instant our firemen and deck-hands would send and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity , one of our wheels would walk off with the crashing fragments of a steering-oar , and down the dead blackness would shut again .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 54]: And that flatboatman would be sure to go into New Orleans and sue our boat , swearing stoutly that he had a light burning all the time , when in truth his gang had the lantern down below to sing and lie and drink and gamble by , and no watch on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 97]: Once , at night , in one of those forest-bordered crevices -LRB- behind an island -RRB- which steamboatmen intensely describe with the phrase ` as dark as the inside of a cow , ' we should have eaten up a Posey County family , fruit , furniture , and all , but that they happened to be fiddling down below , and we just caught the sound of the music in time to sheer off , doing no serious damage , unfortunately , but coming so near it that we had good hopes for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 46]: These people brought up their lantern , then , of course ; and as we backed and filled to get away , the precious family stood in the light of it -- both sexes and various ages -- and cursed us till everything turned blue .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 24]: Once a coalboatman sent a bullet through our pilot-house , when we borrowed a steering oar of him in a very narrow place .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 17]: Chapter 11 The River Rises DURING this big rise these small-fry craft were an intolerable nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 69]: We were running chute after chute , -- a new world to me , -- and if there was a particularly cramped place in a chute , we would be pretty sure to meet a broad-horn there ; and if he failed to be there , we would find him in a still worse locality , namely , the head of the chute , on the shoal water .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 12]: And then there would be no end of profane cordialities exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 90]: Sometimes , in the big river , when we would be feeling our way cautiously along through a fog , the deep hush would suddenly be broken by yells and a clamor of tin pans , and all in instant a log raft would appear vaguely through the webby veil , close upon us ; and then we did not wait to swap knives , but snatched our engine bells out by the roots and piled on all the steam we had , to scramble out of the way !
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 20]: One does n't hit a rock or a solid log craft with a steamboat when he can get excused .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 27]: You will hardly believe it , but many steamboat clerks always carried a large assortment of religious tracts with them in those old departed steamboating days .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 4]: Indeed they did .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 39]: Twenty times a day we would be cramping up around a bar , while a string of these small-fry rascals were drifting down into the head of the bend away above and beyond us a couple of miles .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 23]: Now a skiff would dart away from one of them , and come fighting its laborious way across the desert of water .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 28]: It would ` ease all , ' in the shadow of our forecastle , and the panting oarsmen would shout , ` Gim me a pa-a-per ! '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 7]: as the skiff drifted swiftly astern .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 12]: The clerk would throw over a file of New Orleans journals .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 27]: If these were picked up without comment , you might notice that now a dozen other skiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying anything .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 17]: You understand , they had been waiting to see how No. 1 was going to fare .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 41]: No. 1 making no comment , all the rest would bend to their oars and come on , now ; and as fast as they came the clerk would heave over neat bundles of religious tracts , tied to shingles .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 43]: The amount of hard swearing which twelve packages of religious literature will command when impartially divided up among twelve raftsmen 's crews , who have pulled a heavy skiff two miles on a hot day to get them , is simply incredible .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 16]: As I have said , the big rise brought a new world under my vision .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 86]: By the time the river was over its banks we had forsaken our old paths and were hourly climbing over bars that had stood ten feet out of water before ; we were shaving stumpy shores , like that at the foot of Madrid Bend , which I had always seen avoided before ; we were clattering through chutes like that of 82 , where the opening at the foot was an unbroken wall of timber till our nose was almost at the very spot .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 8]: Some of these chutes were utter solitudes .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 27]: The dense , untouched forest overhung both banks of the crooked little crack , and one could believe that human creatures had never intruded there before .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 46]: The swinging grape-vines , the grassy nooks and vistas glimpsed as we swept by , the flowering creepers waving their red blossoms from the tops of dead trunks , and all the spendthrift richness of the forest foliage , were wasted and thrown away there .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 69]: The chutes were lovely places to steer in ; they were deep , except at the head ; the current was gentle ; under the ` points ' the water was absolutely dead , and the invisible banks so bluff that where the tender willow thickets projected you could bury your boat 's broadside in them as you tore along , and then you seemed fairly to fly .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 93]: Behind other islands we found wretched little farms , and wretcheder little log-cabins ; there were crazy rail fences sticking a foot or two above the water , with one or two jeans-clad , chills-racked , yellow-faced male miserables roosting on the top-rail , elbows on knees , jaws in hands , grinding tobacco and discharging the result at floating chips through crevices left by lost teeth ; while the rest of the family and the few farm-animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat riding at her moorings close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 67]: In this flat-boat the family would have to cook and eat and sleep for a lesser or greater number of days -LRB- or possibly weeks -RRB- , until the river should fall two or three feet and let them get back to their log-cabin and their chills again -- chills being a merciful provision of an all-wise Providence to enable them to take exercise without exertion .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 45]: And this sort of watery camping out was a thing which these people were rather liable to be treated to a couple of times a year : by the December rise out of the Ohio , and the June rise out of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 34]: And yet these were kindly dispensations , for they at least enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and then , and look upon life when a steamboat went by .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 24]: They appreciated the blessing , too , for they spread their mouths and eyes wide open and made the most of these occasions .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 21]: Now what COULD these banished creatures find to do to keep from dying of the blues during the low-water season !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 22]: Once , in one of these lovely island chutes , we found our course completely bridged by a great fallen tree .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 13]: This will serve to show how narrow some of the chutes were .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 33]: The passengers had an hour 's recreation in a virgin wilderness , while the boat-hands chopped the bridge away ; for there was no such thing as turning back , you comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 87]: From Cairo to Baton Rouge , when the river is over its banks , you have no particular trouble in the night , for the thousand-mile wall of dense forest that guards the two banks all the way is only gapped with a farm or wood-yard opening at intervals , and so you ca n't ` get out of the river ' much easier than you could get out of a fenced lane ; but from Baton Rouge to New Orleans it is a different matter .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 23]: The river is more than a mile wide , and very deep -- as much as two hundred feet , in places .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 38]: Both banks , for a good deal over a hundred miles , are shorn of their timber and bordered by continuous sugar plantations , with only here and there a scattering sapling or row of ornamental China-trees .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 19]: The timber is shorn off clear to the rear of the plantations , from two to four miles .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 18]: When the first frost threatens to come , the planters snatch off their crops in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 49]: When they have finished grinding the cane , they form the refuse of the stalks -LRB- which they call BAGASSE -RRB- into great piles and set fire to them , though in other sugar countries the bagasse is used for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar mills .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 17]: Now the piles of damp bagasse burn slowly , and smoke like Satan 's own kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 59]: An embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks of the Mississippi all the way down that lower end of the river , and this embankment is set back from the edge of the shore from ten to perhaps a hundred feet , according to circumstances ; say thirty or forty feet , as a general thing .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 43]: Fill that whole region with an impenetrable gloom of smoke from a hundred miles of burning bagasse piles , when the river is over the banks , and turn a steamboat loose along there at midnight and see how she will feel .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 9]: And see how you will feel , too !
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 54]: You find yourself away out in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless , that fades out and loses itself in the murky distances ; for you can not discern the thin rib of embankment , and you are always imagining you see a straggling tree when you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 18]: The plantations themselves are transformed by the smoke , and look like a part of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 14]: All through your watch you are tortured with the exquisite misery of uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 15]: You hope you are keeping in the river , but you do not know .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 33]: All that you are sure about is that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank and destruction , when you think you are a good half-mile from shore .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 43]: And you are sure , also , that if you chance suddenly to fetch up against the embankment and topple your chimneys overboard , you will have the small comfort of knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 28]: One of the great Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar plantation one night , at such a time , and had to stay there a week .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 15]: But there was no novelty about it ; it had often been done before .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 24]: I thought I had finished this chapter , but I wish to add a curious thing , while it is in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 12]: It is only relevant in that it is connected with piloting .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 20]: There used to be an excellent pilot on the river , a Mr. X. , who was a somnambulist .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 33]: It was said that if his mind was troubled about a bad piece of river , he was pretty sure to get up and walk in his sleep and do strange things .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 21]: He was once fellow-pilot for a trip or two with George Ealer , on a great New Orleans passenger packet .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 32]: During a considerable part of the first trip George was uneasy , but got over it by and by , as X. seemed content to stay in his bed when asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 30]: Late one night the boat was approaching Helena , Arkansas ; the water was low , and the crossing above the town in a very blind and tangled condition .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 49]: X. had seen the crossing since Ealer had , and as the night was particularly drizzly , sullen , and dark , Ealer was considering whether he had not better have X. called to assist in running the place , when the door opened and X. walked in .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 66]: Now on very dark nights , light is a deadly enemy to piloting ; you are aware that if you stand in a lighted room , on such a night , you can not see things in the street to any purpose ; but if you put out the lights and stand in the gloom you can make out objects in the street pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 52]: So , on very dark nights , pilots do not smoke ; they allow no fire in the pilot-house stove if there is a crack which can allow the least ray to escape ; they order the furnaces to be curtained with huge tarpaulins and the sky-lights to be closely blinded .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 9]: Then no light whatever issues from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 14]: The undefinable shape that now entered the pilot-house had Mr. X. 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 45]: This said -- ` Let me take her , George ; I 've seen this place since you have , and it is so crooked that I reckon I can run it myself easier than I could tell you how to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 16]: ` It is kind of you , and I swear _ I _ am willing .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 12]: I have n't got another drop of perspiration left in me .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 13]: I have been spinning around and around the wheel like a squirrel .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 23]: It is so dark I ca n't tell which way she is swinging till she is coming around like a whirligig . '
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 13]: So Ealer took a seat on the bench , panting and breathless .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 51]: The black phantom assumed the wheel without saying anything , steadied the waltzing steamer with a turn or two , and then stood at ease , coaxing her a little to this side and then to that , as gently and as sweetly as if the time had been noonday .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 15]: When Ealer observed this marvel of steering , he wished he had not confessed !
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 32]: He stared , and wondered , and finally said -- ` Well , I thought I knew how to steer a steamboat , but that was another mistake of mine . '
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 12]: X. said nothing , but went serenely on with his work .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 186]: He rang for the leads ; he rang to slow down the steam ; he worked the boat carefully and neatly into invisible marks , then stood at the center of the wheel and peered blandly out into the blackness , fore and aft , to verify his position ; as the leads shoaled more and more , he stopped the engines entirely , and the dead silence and suspense of ` drifting ' followed when the shoalest water was struck , he cracked on the steam , carried her handsomely over , and then began to work her warily into the next system of shoal marks ; the same patient , heedful use of leads and engines followed , the boat slipped through without touching bottom , and entered upon the third and last intricacy of the crossing ; imperceptibly she moved through the gloom , crept by inches into her marks , drifted tediously till the shoalest water was cried , and then , under a tremendous head of steam , went swinging over the reef and away into deep water and safety !
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 34]: Ealer let his long-pent breath pour out in a great , relieving sigh , and said -- ` That 's the sweetest piece of piloting that was ever done on the Mississippi River !
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 17]: I would n't believed it could be done , if I had n't seen it . '
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 32]: There was no reply , and he added -- ` Just hold her five minutes longer , partner , and let me run down and get a cup of coffee . '
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 23]: A minute later Ealer was biting into a pie , down in the ` texas , ' and comforting himself with coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 33]: Just then the night watchman happened in , and was about to happen out again , when he noticed Ealer and exclaimed -- ` Who is at the wheel , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 14]: ` X. ' ` Dart for the pilot-house , quicker than lightning ! '
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 19]: The next moment both men were flying up the pilot-house companion way , three steps at a jump !
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 3]: Nobody there !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 17]: The great steamer was whistling down the middle of the river at her own sweet will !
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 51]: The watchman shot out of the place again ; Ealer seized the wheel , set an engine back with power , and held his breath while the boat reluctantly swung away from a ` towhead ' which she was about to knock into the middle of the Gulf of Mexico !
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 29]: By and by the watchman came back and said -- ` Did n't that lunatic tell you he was asleep , when he first came up here ? '
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 4]: ` NO . '
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 6]: ` Well , he was .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 53]: I found him walking along on top of the railings just as unconcerned as another man would walk a pavement ; and I put him to bed ; now just this minute there he was again , away astern , going through that sort of tight-rope deviltry the same as before . '
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 19]: ` Well , I think I 'll stay by , next time he has one of those fits .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 9]: But I hope he 'll have them often .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 14]: You just ought to have seen him take this boat through Helena crossing .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 8]: I never saw anything so gaudy before .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 29]: And if he can do such gold-leaf , kid-glove , diamond-breastpin piloting when he is sound asleep , what COULD N'T he do if he was dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 54]: Chapter 12 Sounding WHEN the river is very low , and one 's steamboat is ` drawing all the water ' there is in the channel , -- or a few inches more , as was often the case in the old times , -- one must be painfully circumspect in his piloting .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 27]: We used to have to ` sound ' a number of particularly bad places almost every trip when the river was at a very low stage .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 7]: Sounding is done in this way .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 139]: The boat ties up at the shore , just above the shoal crossing ; the pilot not on watch takes his ` cub ' or steersman and a picked crew of men -LRB- sometimes an officer also -RRB- , and goes out in the yawl -- provided the boat has not that rare and sumptuous luxury , a regularly-devised ` sounding-boat ' -- and proceeds to hunt for the best water , the pilot on duty watching his movements through a spy-glass , meantime , and in some instances assisting by signals of the boat 's whistle , signifying ` try higher up ' or ` try lower down ; ' for the surface of the water , like an oil-painting , is more expressive and intelligible when inspected from a little distance than very close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 27]: The whistle signals are seldom necessary , however ; never , perhaps , except when the wind confuses the significant ripples upon the water 's surface .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 102]: When the yawl has reached the shoal place , the speed is slackened , the pilot begins to sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long , and the steersman at the tiller obeys the order to ` hold her up to starboard ; ' or , ` let her fall off to larboard ; ' -LCB- footnote -LSB- The term ` larboard ' is never used at sea now , to signify the left hand ; but was always used on the river in my time -RSB- -RCB- or ` steady -- steady as you go . '
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 26]: When the measurements indicate that the yawl is approaching the shoalest part of the reef , the command is given to ` ease all ! '
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 13]: Then the men stop rowing and the yawl drifts with the current .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 13]: The next order is , ` Stand by with the buoy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 21]: The moment the shallowest point is reached , the pilot delivers the order , ` Let go the buoy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 5]: and over she goes .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 32]: If the pilot is not satisfied , he sounds the place again ; if he finds better water higher up or lower down , he removes the buoy to that place .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 112]: Being finally satisfied , he gives the order , and all the men stand their oars straight up in the air , in line ; a blast from the boat 's whistle indicates that the signal has been seen ; then the men ` give way ' on their oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy ; the steamer comes creeping carefully down , is pointed straight at the buoy , husbands her power for the coming struggle , and presently , at the critical moment , turns on all her steam and goes grinding and wallowing over the buoy and the sand , and gains the deep water beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 14]: Or maybe she does n't ; maybe she ` strikes and swings . '
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 16]: Then she has to while away several hours -LRB- or days -RRB- sparring herself off .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 29]: Sometimes a buoy is not laid at all , but the yawl goes ahead , hunting the best water , and the steamer follows along in its wake .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 26]: Often there is a deal of fun and excitement about sounding , especially if it is a glorious summer day , or a blustering night .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 17]: But in winter the cold and the peril take most of the fun out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 37]: A buoy is nothing but a board four or five feet long , with one end turned up ; it is a reversed school-house bench , with one of the supports left and the other removed .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 25]: It is anchored on the shoalest part of the reef by a rope with a heavy stone made fast to the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 22]: But for the resistance of the turned-up end of the reversed bench , the current would pull the buoy under water .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 39]: At night , a paper lantern with a candle in it is fastened on top of the buoy , and this can be seen a mile or more , a little glimmering spark in the waste of blackness .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 14]: Nothing delights a cub so much as an opportunity to go out sounding .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 110]: There is such an air of adventure about it ; often there is danger ; it is so gaudy and man-of-war-like to sit up in the stern-sheets and steer a swift yawl ; there is something fine about the exultant spring of the boat when an experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into the oars ; it is lovely to see the white foam stream away from the bows ; there is music in the rush of the water ; it is deliciously exhilarating , in summer , to go speeding over the breezy expanses of the river when the world of wavelets is dancing in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 35]: It is such grandeur , too , to the cub , to get a chance to give an order ; for often the pilot will simply say , ` Let her go about ! '
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 23]: and leave the rest to the cub , who instantly cries , in his sternest tone of command , ` Ease starboard !
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 5]: Strong on the larboard !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 4]: Starboard give way !
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 7]: With a will , men ! '
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 64]: The cub enjoys sounding for the further reason that the eyes of the passengers are watching all the yawl 's movements with absorbing interest if the time be daylight ; and if it be night he knows that those same wondering eyes are fastened upon the yawl 's lantern as it glides out into the gloom and dims away in the remote distance .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 26]: One trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent her time in our pilot-house with her uncle and aunt , every day and all day long .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 7]: I fell in love with her .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 11]: So did Mr. Thornburg 's cub , Tom G -- .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 19]: Tom and I had been bosom friends until this time ; but now a coolness began to arise .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 52]: I told the girl a good many of my river adventures , and made myself out a good deal of a hero ; Tom tried to make himself appear to be a hero , too , and succeeded to some extent , but then he always had a way of embroidering .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 20]: However , virtue is its own reward , so I was a barely perceptible trifle ahead in the contest .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 24]: About this time something happened which promised handsomely for me : the pilots decided to sound the crossing at the head of 21 .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 37]: This would occur about nine or ten o'clock at night , when the passengers would be still up ; it would be Mr. Thornburg 's watch , therefore my chief would have to do the sounding .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 64]: We had a perfect love of a sounding-boat -- long , trim , graceful , and as fleet as a greyhound ; her thwarts were cushioned ; she carried twelve oarsmen ; one of the mates was always sent in her to transmit orders to her crew , for ours was a steamer where no end of ` style ' was put on .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 13]: We tied up at the shore above 21 , and got ready .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 31]: It was a foul night , and the river was so wide , there , that a landsman 's uneducated eyes could discern no opposite shore through such a gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 11]: The passengers were alert and interested ; everything was satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 44]: As I hurried through the engine-room , picturesquely gotten up in storm toggery , I met Tom , and could not forbear delivering myself of a mean speech -- ` Ai n't you glad YOU do n't have to go out sounding ? '
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 28]: Tom was passing on , but he quickly turned , and said -- ` Now just for that , you can go and get the sounding-pole yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 23]: I was going after it , but I 'd see you in Halifax , now , before I 'd do it . '
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 8]: ` Who wants you to get it ?
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 7]: It 's in the sounding-boat . '
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 7]: ` It ai n't , either .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 22]: It 's been new-painted ; and it 's been up on the ladies ' cabin guards two days , drying . '
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 30]: I flew back , and shortly arrived among the crowd of watching and wondering ladies just in time to hear the command : ` Give way , men ! '
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 43]: I looked over , and there was the gallant sounding-boat booming away , the unprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller , and my chief sitting by him with the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a fool 's errand to fetch .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 27]: Then that young girl said to me -- ` Oh , how awful to have to go out in that little boat on such a night !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 9]: Do you think there is any danger ? '
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 7]: I would rather have been stabbed .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 14]: I went off , full of venom , to help in the pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 27]: By and by the boat 's lantern disappeared , and after an interval a wee spark glimmered upon the face of the water a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 19]: Mr. Thornburg blew the whistle , in acknowledgment , backed the steamer out , and made for it .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 18]: We flew along for a while , then slackened steam and went cautiously gliding toward the spark .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 14]: Presently Mr. Thornburg exclaimed -- ` Hello , the buoy-lantern 's out ! '
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 5]: He stopped the engines .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 17]: A moment or two later he said -- ` Why , there it is again ! '
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 16]: So he came ahead on the engines once more , and rang for the leads .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 13]: Gradually the water shoaled up , and then began to deepen again !
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 13]: Mr. Thornburg muttered -- ` Well , I do n't understand this .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 10]: I believe that buoy has drifted off the reef .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 11]: Seems to be a little too far to the left .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 13]: No matter , it is safest to run over it anyhow . '
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 16]: So , in that solid world of darkness we went creeping down on the light .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 37]: Just as our bows were in the act of plowing over it , Mr. Thornburg seized the bell-ropes , rang a startling peal , and exclaimed -- ` My soul , it 's the sounding-boat ! '
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 24]: A sudden chorus of wild alarms burst out far below -- a pause -- and then the sound of grinding and crashing followed .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 7]: Mr. Thornburg exclaimed -- ` There !
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 10]: the paddle-wheel has ground the sounding-boat to lucifer matches !
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 2]: Run !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 6]: See who is killed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 13]: I was on the main deck in the twinkling of an eye .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 14]: My chief and the third mate and nearly all the men were safe .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 58]: They had discovered their danger when it was too late to pull out of the way ; then , when the great guards overshadowed them a moment later , they were prepared and knew what to do ; at my chiefs order they sprang at the right instant , seized the guard , and were hauled aboard .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 18]: The next moment the sounding-yawl swept aft to the wheel and was struck and splintered to atoms .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 22]: Two of the men and the cub Tom , were missing -- a fact which spread like wildfire over the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 27]: The passengers came flocking to the forward gangway , ladies and all , anxious-eyed , white-faced , and talked in awed voices of the dreadful thing .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 13]: And often and again I heard them say , ` Poor fellows !
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 7]: poor boy , poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 18]: By this time the boat 's yawl was manned and away , to search for the missing .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 12]: Now a faint call was heard , off to the left .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 9]: The yawl had disappeared in the other direction .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 31]: Half the people rushed to one side to encourage the swimmer with their shouts ; the other half rushed the other way to shriek to the yawl to turn about .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 18]: By the callings , the swimmer was approaching , but some said the sound showed failing strength .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 39]: The crowd massed themselves against the boiler-deck railings , leaning over and staring into the gloom ; and every faint and fainter cry wrung from them such words as , ` Ah , poor fellow , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 9]: is there no way to save him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 24]: But still the cries held out , and drew nearer , and presently the voice said pluckily -- ' I can make it !
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 7]: Stand by with a rope ! '
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 8]: What a rousing cheer they gave him !
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 28]: The chief mate took his stand in the glare of a torch-basket , a coil of rope in his hand , and his men grouped about him .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 37]: The next moment the swimmer 's face appeared in the circle of light , and in another one the owner of it was hauled aboard , limp and drenched , while cheer on cheer went up .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 6]: It was that devil Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 15]: The yawl crew searched everywhere , but found no sign of the two men .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 20]: They probably failed to catch the guard , tumbled back , and were struck by the wheel and killed .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 23]: Tom had never jumped for the guard at all , but had plunged head-first into the river and dived under the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 42]: It was nothing ; I could have done it easy enough , and I said so ; but everybody went on just the same , making a wonderful to do over that ass , as if he had done something great .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 32]: That girl could n't seem to have enough of that pitiful ` hero ' the rest of the trip ; but little I cared ; I loathed her , any way .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 16]: The way we came to mistake the sounding-boat 's lantern for the buoy-light was this .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 52]: My chief said that after laying the buoy he fell away and watched it till it seemed to be secure ; then he took up a position a hundred yards below it and a little to one side of the steamer 's course , headed the sounding-boat up-stream , and waited .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 140]: Having to wait some time , he and the officer got to talking ; he looked up when he judged that the steamer was about on the reef ; saw that the buoy was gone , but supposed that the steamer had already run over it ; he went on with his talk ; he noticed that the steamer was getting very close on him , but that was the correct thing ; it was her business to shave him closely , for convenience in taking him aboard ; he was expecting her to sheer off , until the last moment ; then it flashed upon him that she was trying to run him down , mistaking his lantern for the buoy-light ; so he sang out , ` Stand by to spring for the guard , men ! '
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 9]: and the next instant the jump was made .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 42]: Chapter 13 A Pilot 's Needs BUT I am wandering from what I was intending to do , that is , make plainer than perhaps appears in the previous chapters , some of the peculiar requirements of the science of piloting .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 23]: First of all , there is one faculty which a pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has brought it to absolute perfection .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 7]: Nothing short of perfection will do .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 5]: That faculty is memory .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 31]: He can not stop with merely thinking a thing is so and so ; he must know it ; for this is eminently one of the ` exact ' sciences .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 39]: With what scorn a pilot was looked upon , in the old times , if he ever ventured to deal in that feeble phrase ' I think , ' instead of the vigorous one ' I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 29]: One can not easily realize what a tremendous thing it is to know every trivial detail of twelve hundred miles of river and know it with absolute exactness .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 103]: If you will take the longest street in New York , and travel up and down it , conning its features patiently until you know every house and window and door and lamp-post and big and little sign by heart , and know them so accurately that you can instantly name the one you are abreast of when you are set down at random in that street in the middle of an inky black night , you will then have a tolerable notion of the amount and the exactness of a pilot 's knowledge who carries the Mississippi River in his head .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 60]: And then if you will go on until you know every street crossing , the character , size , and position of the crossing-stones , and the varying depth of mud in each of those numberless places , you will have some idea of what the pilot must know in order to keep a Mississippi steamer out of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 65]: Next , if you will take half of the signs in that long street , and CHANGE THEIR PLACES once a month , and still manage to know their new positions accurately on dark nights , and keep up with these repeated changes without making any mistakes , you will understand what is required of a pilot 's peerless memory by the fickle Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 16]: I think a pilot 's memory is about the most wonderful thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 74]: To know the Old and New Testaments by heart , and be able to recite them glibly , forward or backward , or begin at random anywhere in the book and recite both ways and never trip or make a mistake , is no extravagant mass of knowledge , and no marvelous facility , compared to a pilot 's massed knowledge of the Mississippi and his marvelous facility in the handling of it .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 19]: I make this comparison deliberately , and believe I am not expanding the truth when I do it .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 13]: Many will think my figure too strong , but pilots will not .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 50]: And how easily and comfortably the pilot 's memory does its work ; how placidly effortless is its way ; how UNCONSCIOUSLY it lays up its vast stores , hour by hour , day by day , and never loses or mislays a single valuable package of them all !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 4]: Take an instance .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 9]: Let a leadsman cry , ` Half twain !
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 3]: half twain !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 3]: half twain !
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 3]: half twain !
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 4]: half twain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 60]: until it become as monotonous as the ticking of a clock ; let conversation be going on all the time , and the pilot be doing his share of the talking , and no longer consciously listening to the leadsman ; and in the midst of this endless string of half twains let a single ` quarter twain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 83]: be interjected , without emphasis , and then the half twain cry go on again , just as before : two or three weeks later that pilot can describe with precision the boat 's position in the river when that quarter twain was uttered , and give you such a lot of head-marks , stern-marks , and side-marks to guide you , that you ought to be able to take the boat there and put her in that same spot again yourself !
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 51]: The cry of ` quarter twain ' did not really take his mind from his talk , but his trained faculties instantly photographed the bearings , noted the change of depth , and laid up the important details for future reference without requiring any assistance from him in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 110]: If you were walking and talking with a friend , and another friend at your side kept up a monotonous repetition of the vowel sound A , for a couple of blocks , and then in the midst interjected an R , thus , A , A , A , A , A , R , A , A , A , etc. , and gave the R no emphasis , you would not be able to state , two or three weeks afterward , that the R had been put in , nor be able to tell what objects you were passing at the moment it was done .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 20]: But you could if your memory had been patiently and laboriously trained to do that sort of thing mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 23]: Give a man a tolerably fair memory to start with , and piloting will develop it into a very colossus of capability .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 11]: But ONLY IN THE MATTERS IT IS DAILY DRILLED IN .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 64]: A time would come when the man 's faculties could not help noticing landmarks and soundings , and his memory could not help holding on to them with the grip of a vise ; but if you asked that same man at noon what he had had for breakfast , it would be ten chances to one that he could not tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 22]: Astonishing things can be done with the human memory if you will devote it faithfully to one particular line of business .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 41]: At the time that wages soared so high on the Missouri River , my chief , Mr. Bixby , went up there and learned more than a thousand miles of that stream with an ease and rapidity that were astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 58]: When he had seen each division once in the daytime and once at night , his education was so nearly complete that he took out a ` daylight ' license ; a few trips later he took out a full license , and went to piloting day and night -- and he ranked A 1 , too .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 23]: Mr. Bixby placed me as steersman for a while under a pilot whose feats of memory were a constant marvel to me .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 15]: However , his memory was born in him , I think , not built .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 9]: For instance , somebody would mention a name .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 14]: Instantly Mr. Brown would break in -- ` Oh , I knew HIM .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 23]: Sallow-faced , red-headed fellow , with a little scar on the side of his throat , like a splinter under the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 10]: He was only in the Southern trade six months .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 6]: That was thirteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 7]: I made a trip with him .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 128]: There was five feet in the upper river then ; the `` Henry Blake '' grounded at the foot of Tower Island drawing four and a half ; the `` George Elliott '' unshipped her rudder on the wreck of the `` Sunflower '' -- ' ` Why , the `` Sunflower '' did n't sink until -- ' ' I know when she sunk ; it was three years before that , on the 2nd of December ; Asa Hardy was captain of her , and his brother John was first clerk ; and it was his first trip in her , too ; Tom Jones told me these things a week afterward in New Orleans ; he was first mate of the `` Sunflower . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 26]: Captain Hardy stuck a nail in his foot the 6th of July of the next year , and died of the lockjaw on the 15th .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 13]: His brother died two years after 3rd of March , -- erysipelas .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 27]: I never saw either of the Hardys , -- they were Alleghany River men , -- but people who knew them told me all these things .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 41]: And they said Captain Hardy wore yarn socks winter and summer just the same , and his first wife 's name was Jane Shook -- she was from New England -- and his second one died in a lunatic asylum .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 6]: It was in the blood .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 7]: She was from Lexington , Kentucky .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 9]: Name was Horton before she was married . '
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 15]: And so on , by the hour , the man 's tongue would go .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 7]: He could NOT forget any thing .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 5]: It was simply impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 27]: The most trivial details remained as distinct and luminous in his head , after they had lain there for years , as the most memorable events .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 14]: His was not simply a pilot 's memory ; its grasp was universal .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 28]: If he were talking about a trifling letter he had received seven years before , he was pretty sure to deliver you the entire screed from memory .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 63]: And then without observing that he was departing from the true line of his talk , he was more than likely to hurl in a long-drawn parenthetical biography of the writer of that letter ; and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer 's relatives , one by one , and give you their biographies , too .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 10]: Such a memory as that is a great misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 11]: To it , all occurrences are of the same size .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 13]: Its possessor can not distinguish an interesting circumstance from an uninteresting one .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 21]: As a talker , he is bound to clog his narrative with tiresome details and make himself an insufferable bore .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 10]: Moreover , he can not stick to his subject .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 20]: He picks up every little grain of memory he discerns in his way , and so is led aside .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 20]: Mr. Brown would start out with the honest intention of telling you a vastly funny anecdote about a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 130]: He would be ` so full of laugh ' that he could hardly begin ; then his memory would start with the dog 's breed and personal appearance ; drift into a history of his owner ; of his owner 's family , with descriptions of weddings and burials that had occurred in it , together with recitals of congratulatory verses and obituary poetry provoked by the same : then this memory would recollect that one of these events occurred during the celebrated ` hard winter ' of such and such a year , and a minute description of that winter would follow , along with the names of people who were frozen to death , and statistics showing the high figures which pork and hay went up to .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 111]: Pork and hay would suggest corn and fodder ; corn and fodder would suggest cows and horses ; cows and horses would suggest the circus and certain celebrated bare-back riders ; the transition from the circus to the menagerie was easy and natural ; from the elephant to equatorial Africa was but a step ; then of course the heathen savages would suggest religion ; and at the end of three or four hours ' tedious jaw , the watch would change , and Brown would go out of the pilot-house muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years before about the efficacy of prayer as a means of grace .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 22]: And the original first mention would be all you had learned about that dog , after all this waiting and hungering .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 19]: A pilot must have a memory ; but there are two higher qualities which he must also have .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 22]: He must have good and quick judgment and decision , and a cool , calm courage that no peril can shake .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 46]: Give a man the merest trifle of pluck to start with , and by the time he has become a pilot he can not be unmanned by any danger a steamboat can get into ; but one can not quite say the same for judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 28]: Judgment is a matter of brains , and a man must START with a good stock of that article or he will never succeed as a pilot .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 54]: The growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the time , but it does not reach a high and satisfactory condition until some time after the young pilot has been ` standing his own watch , ' alone and under the staggering weight of all the responsibilities connected with the position .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 66]: When an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted with the river , he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his steamboat , night or day , that he presently begins to imagine that it is HIS courage that animates him ; but the first time the pilot steps out and leaves him to his own devices he finds out it was the other man 's .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 15]: He discovers that the article has been left out of his own cargo altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 50]: The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a moment ; he is not prepared for them ; he does not know how to meet them ; all his knowledge forsakes him ; and within fifteen minutes he is as white as a sheet and scared almost to death .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 21]: Therefore pilots wisely train these cubs by various strategic tricks to look danger in the face a little more calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 15]: A favorite way of theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon the candidate .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 27]: Mr. Bixby served me in this fashion once , and for years afterward I used to blush even in my sleep when I thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 80]: I had become a good steersman ; so good , indeed , that I had all the work to do on our watch , night and day ; Mr. Bixby seldom made a suggestion to me ; all he ever did was to take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in particularly bad crossings , land the boat when she needed to be landed , play gentleman of leisure nine-tenths of the watch , and collect the wages .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 35]: The lower river was about bank-full , and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any crossing between Cairo and New Orleans without help or instruction , I should have felt irreparably hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 24]: The idea of being afraid of any crossing in the lot , in the DAY-TIME , was a thing too preposterous for contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 44]: Well , one matchless summer 's day I was bowling down the bend above island 66 , brimful of self-conceit and carrying my nose as high as a giraffe 's , when Mr. Bixby said -- ' I am going below a while .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 9]: I suppose you know the next crossing ? '
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 6]: This was almost an affront .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 13]: It was about the plainest and simplest crossing in the whole river .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 29]: One could n't come to any harm , whether he ran it right or not ; and as for depth , there never had been any bottom there .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 8]: I knew all this , perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 7]: ` Know how to RUN it ?
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 12]: Why , I can run it with my eyes shut . '
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 10]: ` How much water is there in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 9]: ` Well , that is an odd question .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 12]: I could n't get bottom there with a church steeple . '
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 9]: ` You think so , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 10]: The very tone of the question shook my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 8]: That was what Mr. Bixby was expecting .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 8]: He left , without saying anything more .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 9]: I began to imagine all sorts of things .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 50]: Mr. Bixby , unknown to me , of course , sent somebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the leadsmen , another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers , and then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could observe results .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 20]: Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck ; next the chief mate appeared ; then a clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 35]: Every moment or two a straggler was added to my audience ; and before I got to the head of the island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my nose .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 9]: I began to wonder what the trouble was .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 29]: As I started across , the captain glanced aloft at me and said , with a sham uneasiness in his voice -- ` Where is Mr. Bixby ? '
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 7]: ` Gone below , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 8]: But that did the business for me .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 23]: My imagination began to construct dangers out of nothing , and they multiplied faster than I could keep the run of them .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 11]: All at once I imagined I saw shoal water ahead !
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 18]: The wave of coward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every joint in me .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 8]: All my confidence in that crossing vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 39]: I seized the bell-rope ; dropped it , ashamed ; seized it again ; dropped it once more ; clutched it tremblingly one again , and pulled it so feebly that I could hardly hear the stroke myself .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 16]: Captain and mate sang out instantly , and both together -- ` Starboard lead there !
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 6]: and quick about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 5]: This was another shock .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 56]: I began to climb the wheel like a squirrel ; but I would hardly get the boat started to port before I would see new dangers on that side , and away I would spin to the other ; only to find perils accumulating to starboard , and be crazy to get to port again .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 14]: Then came the leadsman 's sepulchral cry -- 'D - e-e-p four ! '
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 7]: Deep four in a bottomless crossing !
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 9]: The terror of it took my breath away .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 5]: 'M - a-r-k three !
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 8]: ... M-a-r-k three ... Quarter less three !
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 5]: ... Half twain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 4]: This was frightful !
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 9]: I seized the bell-ropes and stopped the engines .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 4]: ` Quarter twain !
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 3]: Quarter twain !
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 4]: MARK twain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 4]: I was helpless .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 11]: I did not know what in the world to do .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 25]: I was quaking from head to foot , and I could have hung my hat on my eyes , they stuck out so far .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 5]: ` Quarter LESS twain !
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 6]: Nine and a HALF ! '
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 5]: We were DRAWING nine !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 8]: My hands were in a nerveless flutter .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 10]: I could not ring a bell intelligibly with them .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 24]: I flew to the speaking-tube and shouted to the engineer -- ` Oh , Ben , if you love me , BACK her !
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 4]: Quick , Ben !
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 11]: Oh , back the immortal SOUL out of her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 7]: I heard the door close gently .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 17]: I looked around , and there stood Mr. Bixby , smiling a bland , sweet smile .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 15]: Then the audience on the hurricane deck sent up a thundergust of humiliating laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 19]: I saw it all , now , and I felt meaner than the meanest man in human history .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 38]: I laid in the lead , set the boat in her marks , came ahead on the engines , and said -- ` It was a fine trick to play on an orphan , WAS N'T it ?
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 25]: I suppose I 'll never hear the last of how I was ass enough to heave the lead at the head of 66 . '
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 11]: ` Well , no , you wo n't , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 19]: In fact I hope you wo n't ; for I want you to learn something by that experience .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 13]: Did n't you KNOW there was no bottom in that crossing ? '
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , I did . '
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 6]: ` Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 17]: You should n't have allowed me or anybody else to shake your confidence in that knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 5]: Try to remember that .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 17]: And another thing : when you get into a dangerous place , do n't turn coward .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 10]: That is n't going to help matters any . '
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 12]: It was a good enough lesson , but pretty hardly learned .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 28]: Yet about the hardest part of it was that for months I so often had to hear a phrase which I had conceived a particular distaste for .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 17]: It was , ` Oh , Ben , if you love me , back her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 73]: Chapter 14 Rank and Dignity of Piloting IN my preceding chapters I have tried , by going into the minutiae of the science of piloting , to carry the reader step by step to a comprehension of what the science consists of ; and at the same time I have tried to show him that it is a very curious and wonderful science , too , and very worthy of his attention .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 38]: If I have seemed to love my subject , it is no surprising thing , for I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since , and I took a measureless pride in it .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 27]: The reason is plain : a pilot , in those days , was the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 88]: Kings are but the hampered servants of parliament and people ; parliaments sit in chains forged by their constituency ; the editor of a newspaper can not be independent , but must work with one hand tied behind him by party and patrons , and be content to utter only half or two-thirds of his mind ; no clergyman is a free man and may speak the whole truth , regardless of his parish 's opinions ; writers of all kinds are manacled servants of the public .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 16]: We write frankly and fearlessly , but then we ` modify ' before we print .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 34]: In truth , every man and woman and child has a master , and worries and frets in servitude ; but in the day I write of , the Mississippi pilot had none .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 42]: The captain could stand upon the hurricane deck , in the pomp of a very brief authority , and give him five or six orders while the vessel backed into the stream , and then that skipper 's reign was over .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 24]: The moment that the boat was under way in the river , she was under the sole and unquestioned control of the pilot .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 35]: He could do with her exactly as he pleased , run her when and whither he chose , and tie her up to the bank whenever his judgment said that that course was best .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 25]: His movements were entirely free ; he consulted no one , he received commands from nobody , he promptly resented even the merest suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 36]: Indeed , the law of the United States forbade him to listen to commands or suggestions , rightly considering that the pilot necessarily knew better how to handle the boat than anybody could tell him .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 29]: So here was the novelty of a king without a keeper , an absolute monarch who was absolute in sober truth and not by a fiction of words .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 35]: I have seen a boy of eighteen taking a great steamer serenely into what seemed almost certain destruction , and the aged captain standing mutely by , filled with apprehension but powerless to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 29]: His interference , in that particular instance , might have been an excellent thing , but to permit it would have been to establish a most pernicious precedent .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 25]: It will easily be guessed , considering the pilot 's boundless authority , that he was a great personage in the old steamboating days .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 33]: He was treated with marked courtesy by the captain and with marked deference by all the officers and servants ; and this deferential spirit was quickly communicated to the passengers , too .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 29]: I think pilots were about the only people I ever knew who failed to show , in some degree , embarrassment in the presence of traveling foreign princes .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 17]: But then , people in one 's own grade of life are not usually embarrassing objects .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 17]: By long habit , pilots came to put all their wishes in the form of commands .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 34]: It ` gravels ' me , to this day , to put my will in the weak shape of a request , instead of launching it in the crisp language of an order .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 34]: In those old days , to load a steamboat at St. Louis , take her to New Orleans and back , and discharge cargo , consumed about twenty-five days , on an average .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 58]: Seven or eight of these days the boat spent at the wharves of St. Louis and New Orleans , and every soul on board was hard at work , except the two pilots ; they did nothing but play gentleman up town , and receive the same wages for it as if they had been on duty .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 38]: The moment the boat touched the wharf at either city , they were ashore ; and they were not likely to be seen again till the last bell was ringing and everything in readiness for another voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 20]: When a captain got hold of a pilot of particularly high reputation , he took pains to keep him .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 43]: When wages were four hundred dollars a month on the Upper Mississippi , I have known a captain to keep such a pilot in idleness , under full pay , three months at a time , while the river was frozen up .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 20]: And one must remember that in those cheap times four hundred dollars was a salary of almost inconceivable splendor .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 21]: Few men on shore got such pay as that , and when they did they were mightily looked up to .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 31]: When pilots from either end of the river wandered into our small Missouri village , they were sought by the best and the fairest , and treated with exalted respect .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 54]: Lying in port under wages was a thing which many pilots greatly enjoyed and appreciated ; especially if they belonged in the Missouri River in the heyday of that trade -LRB- Kansas times -RRB- , and got nine hundred dollars a trip , which was equivalent to about eighteen hundred dollars a month .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 8]: Here is a conversation of that day .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 47]: A chap out of the Illinois River , with a little stern-wheel tub , accosts a couple of ornate and gilded Missouri River pilots -- ` Gentlemen , I 've got a pretty good trip for the upcountry , and shall want you about a month .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 7]: How much will it be ? '
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 7]: ` Eighteen hundred dollars apiece . '
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 5]: ` Heavens and earth !
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 17]: You take my boat , let me have your wages , and I 'll divide ! '
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 39]: I will remark , in passing , that Mississippi steamboatmen were important in landsmen 's eyes -LRB- and in their own , too , in a degree -RRB- according to the dignity of the boat they were on .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 30]: For instance , it was a proud thing to be of the crew of such stately craft as the ` Aleck Scott ' or the ` Grand Turk . '
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 31]: Negro firemen , deck hands , and barbers belonging to those boats were distinguished personages in their grade of life , and they were well aware of that fact too .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 21]: A stalwart darkey once gave offense at a negro ball in New Orleans by putting on a good many airs .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 20]: Finally one of the managers bustled up to him and said -- ` Who IS you , any way ?
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 4]: Who is you ?
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 9]: dat 's what I wants to know ! '
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 37]: The offender was not disconcerted in the least , but swelled himself up and threw that into his voice which showed that he knew he was not putting on all those airs on a stinted capital .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 5]: ` Who IS I ?
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 4]: Who IS I ?
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 10]: I let you know mighty quick who I is !
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 28]: I want you niggers to understan ' dat I fires de middle do ' -LCB- footnote -LSB- Door -RSB- -RCB- on de `` Aleck Scott ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 4]: That was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 34]: The barber of the ` Grand Turk ' was a spruce young negro , who aired his importance with balmy complacency , and was greatly courted by the circle in which he moved .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 24]: The young colored population of New Orleans were much given to flirting , at twilight , on the banquettes of the back streets .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 18]: Somebody saw and heard something like the following , one evening , in one of those localities .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 37]: A middle-aged negro woman projected her head through a broken pane and shouted -LRB- very willing that the neighbors should hear and envy -RRB- , ` You Mary Ann , come in de house dis minute !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 33]: Stannin ' out dah foolin ' ` long wid dat low trash , an ' heah 's de barber offn de `` Gran ' Turk '' wants to conwerse wid you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 37]: My reference , a moment ago , to the fact that a pilot 's peculiar official position placed him out of the reach of criticism or command , brings Stephen W -- naturally to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 23]: He was a gifted pilot , a good fellow , a tireless talker , and had both wit and humor in him .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 31]: He had a most irreverent independence , too , and was deliciously easy-going and comfortable in the presence of age , official dignity , and even the most august wealth .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 37]: He always had work , he never saved a penny , he was a most persuasive borrower , he was in debt to every pilot on the river , and to the majority of the captains .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 27]: He could throw a sort of splendor around a bit of harum-scarum , devil-may-care piloting , that made it almost fascinating -- but not to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 27]: He made a trip with good old Captain Y -- once , and was ` relieved ' from duty when the boat got to New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 7]: Somebody expressed surprise at the discharge .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 11]: Captain Y -- shuddered at the mere mention of Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 20]: Then his poor , thin old voice piped out something like this : -- ` Why , bless me !
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 21]: I would n't have such a wild creature on my boat for the world -- not for the whole world !
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 21]: He swears , he sings , he whistles , he yells -- I never saw such an Injun to yell .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 14]: All times of the night -- it never made any difference to him .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 29]: He would just yell that way , not for anything in particular , but merely on account of a kind of devilish comfort he got out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 30]: I never could get into a sound sleep but he would fetch me out of bed , all in a cold sweat , with one of those dreadful war-whoops .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 15]: A queer being -- very queer being ; no respect for anything or anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 8]: Sometimes he called me `` Johnny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 10]: And he kept a fiddle , and a cat .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 4]: He played execrably .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 14]: This seemed to distress the cat , and so the cat would howl .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 13]: Nobody could sleep where that man -- and his family -- was .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 3]: And reckless .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 7]: There never was anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 48]: Now you may believe it or not , but as sure as I am sitting here , he brought my boat a-tilting down through those awful snags at Chicot under a rattling head of steam , and the wind a-blowing like the very nation , at that !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: My officers will tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 4]: They saw it .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 43]: And , sir , while he was a-tearing right down through those snags , and I a-shaking in my shoes and praying , I wish I may never speak again if he did n't pucker up his mouth and go to WHISTLING !
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 51]: Yes , sir ; whistling `` Buffalo gals , ca n't you come out tonight , ca n't you come out to-night , ca n't you come out to-night ; '' and doing it as calmly as if we were attending a funeral and were n't related to the corpse .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 44]: And when I remonstrated with him about it , he smiled down on me as if I was his child , and told me to run in the house and try to be good , and not be meddling with my superiors ! '
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 20]: Once a pretty mean captain caught Stephen in New Orleans out of work and as usual out of money .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 61]: He laid steady siege to Stephen , who was in a very ` close place , ' and finally persuaded him to hire with him at one hundred and twenty-five dollars per month , just half wages , the captain agreeing not to divulge the secret and so bring down the contempt of all the guild upon the poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 34]: But the boat was not more than a day out of New Orleans before Stephen discovered that the captain was boasting of his exploit , and that all the officers had been told .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 7]: Stephen winced , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 27]: About the middle of the afternoon the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck , cast his eye around , and looked a good deal surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 18]: He glanced inquiringly aloft at Stephen , but Stephen was whistling placidly , and attending to business .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 45]: The captain stood around a while in evident discomfort , and once or twice seemed about to make a suggestion ; but the etiquette of the river taught him to avoid that sort of rashness , and so he managed to hold his peace .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 15]: He chafed and puzzled a few minutes longer , then retired to his apartments .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 14]: But soon he was out again , and apparently more perplexed than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 25]: Presently he ventured to remark , with deference -- ` Pretty good stage of the river now , ai n't it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 8]: ` Well , I should say so !
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 8]: Bank-full IS a pretty liberal stage . '
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 12]: ` Seems to be a good deal of current here . '
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 8]: ` Good deal do n't describe it !
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 8]: It 's worse than a mill-race . '
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 18]: ` Is n't it easier in toward shore than it is out here in the middle ? '
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: ` Yes , I reckon it is ; but a body ca n't be too careful with a steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 21]: It 's pretty safe out here ; ca n't strike any bottom here , you can depend on that . '
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 8]: The captain departed , looking rueful enough .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 19]: At this rate , he would probably die of old age before his boat got to St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 35]: Next day he appeared on deck and again found Stephen faithfully standing up the middle of the river , fighting the whole vast force of the Mississippi , and whistling the same placid tune .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 6]: This thing was becoming serious .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 36]: In by the shore was a slower boat clipping along in the easy water and gaining steadily ; she began to make for an island chute ; Stephen stuck to the middle of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 7]: Speech was WRUNG from the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 22]: He said -- ` Mr. W -- , do n't that chute cut off a good deal of distance ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 12]: I think it does , but I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 5]: ` Do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 16]: Well , is n't there water enough in it now to go through ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: I expect there is , but I am not certain . '
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 8]: ` Upon my word this is odd !
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 14]: Why , those pilots on that boat yonder are going to try it .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 17]: Do you mean to say that you do n't know as much as they do ? '
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 3]: ` THEY !
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 7]: Why , THEY are two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pilots !
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 25]: But do n't you be uneasy ; I know as much as any man can afford to know for a hundred and twenty-five ! '
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 4]: The captain surrendered .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 20]: Five minutes later Stephen was bowling through the chute and showing the rival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pair of heels .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 44]: Chapter 15 The Pilots ' Monopoly ONE day , on board the ` Aleck Scott , ' my chief , Mr. Bixby , was crawling carefully through a close place at Cat Island , both leads going , and everybody holding his breath .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 41]: The captain , a nervous , apprehensive man , kept still as long as he could , but finally broke down and shouted from the hurricane deck -- ` For gracious ' sake , give her steam , Mr. Bixby !
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 4]: give her steam !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 11]: She 'll never raise the reef on this headway ! '
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 22]: For all the effect that was produced upon Mr. Bixby , one would have supposed that no remark had been made .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 37]: But five minutes later , when the danger was past and the leads laid in , he burst instantly into a consuming fury , and gave the captain the most admirable cursing I ever listened to .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 27]: No bloodshed ensued ; but that was because the captain 's cause was weak ; for ordinarily he was not a man to take correction quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 54]: Having now set forth in detail the nature of the science of piloting , and likewise described the rank which the pilot held among the fraternity of steamboatmen , this seems a fitting place to say a few words about an organization which the pilots once formed for the protection of their guild .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 28]: It was curious and noteworthy in this , that it was perhaps the compactest , the completest , and the strongest commercial organization ever formed among men .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 35]: For a long time wages had been two hundred and fifty dollars a month ; but curiously enough , as steamboats multiplied and business increased , the wages began to fall little by little .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 10]: It was easy to discover the reason of this .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 9]: Too many pilots were being ` made . '
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 52]: It was nice to have a ` cub , ' a steersman , to do all the hard work for a couple of years , gratis , while his master sat on a high bench and smoked ; all pilots and captains had sons or nephews who wanted to be pilots .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 18]: By and by it came to pass that nearly every pilot on the river had a steersman .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 40]: When a steersman had made an amount of progress that was satisfactory to any two pilots in the trade , they could get a pilot 's license for him by signing an application directed to the United States Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 17]: Nothing further was needed ; usually no questions were asked , no proofs of capacity required .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 22]: Very well , this growing swarm of new pilots presently began to undermine the wages , in order to get berths .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 14]: Too late -- apparently -- the knights of the tiller perceived their mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 20]: Plainly , something had to be done , and quickly ; but what was to be the needful thing .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 4]: A close organization .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: Nothing else would answer .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 19]: To compass this seemed an impossibility ; so it was talked , and talked , and then dropped .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 14]: It was too likely to ruin whoever ventured to move in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 32]: But at last about a dozen of the boldest -- and some of them the best -- pilots on the river launched themselves into the enterprise and took all the chances .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 64]: They got a special charter from the legislature , with large powers , under the name of the Pilots ' Benevolent Association ; elected their officers , completed their organization , contributed capital , put ` association ' wages up to two hundred and fifty dollars at once -- and then retired to their homes , for they were promptly discharged from employment .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 20]: But there were two or three unnoticed trifles in their by-laws which had the seeds of propagation in them .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 25]: For instance , all idle members of the association , in good standing , were entitled to a pension of twenty-five dollars per month .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 25]: This began to bring in one straggler after another from the ranks of the new-fledged pilots , in the dull -LRB- summer -RRB- season .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 23]: Better have twenty-five dollars than starve ; the initiation fee was only twelve dollars , and no dues required from the unemployed .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 27]: Also , the widows of deceased members in good standing could draw twenty-five dollars per month , and a certain sum for each of their children .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 14]: Also , the said deceased would be buried at the association 's expense .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 14]: These things resurrected all the superannuated and forgotten pilots in the Mississippi Valley .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 16]: They came from farms , they came from interior villages , they came from everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 20]: They came on crutches , on drays , in ambulances , -- any way , so they got there .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 24]: They paid in their twelve dollars , and straightway began to draw out twenty-five dollars a month , and calculate their burial bills .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 36]: By and by , all the useless , helpless pilots , and a dozen first-class ones , were in the association , and nine-tenths of the best pilots out of it and laughing at it .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 9]: It was the laughing-stock of the whole river .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 13]: Everybody joked about the by-law requiring members to pay ten per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 33]: of their wages , every month , into the treasury for the support of the association , whereas all the members were outcast and tabooed , and no one would employ them .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 60]: Everybody was derisively grateful to the association for taking all the worthless pilots out of the way and leaving the whole field to the excellent and the deserving ; and everybody was not only jocularly grateful for that , but for a result which naturally followed , namely , the gradual advance of wages as the busy season approached .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 64]: Wages had gone up from the low figure of one hundred dollars a month to one hundred and twenty-five , and in some cases to one hundred and fifty ; and it was great fun to enlarge upon the fact that this charming thing had been accomplished by a body of men not one of whom received a particle of benefit from it .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 45]: Some of the jokers used to call at the association rooms and have a good time chaffing the members and offering them the charity of taking them as steersmen for a trip , so that they could see what the forgotten river looked like .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 18]: However , the association was content ; or at least it gave no sign to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 45]: Now and then it captured a pilot who was ` out of luck , ' and added him to its list ; and these later additions were very valuable , for they were good pilots ; the incompetent ones had all been absorbed before .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 41]: As business freshened , wages climbed gradually up to two hundred and fifty dollars -- the association figure -- and became firmly fixed there ; and still without benefiting a member of that body , for no member was hired .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 13]: The hilarity at the association 's expense burst all bounds , now .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 17]: There was no end to the fun which that poor martyr had to put up with .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 12]: However , it is a long lane that has no turning .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 33]: Winter approached , business doubled and trebled , and an avalanche of Missouri , Illinois and Upper Mississippi River boats came pouring down to take a chance in the New Orleans trade .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 15]: All of a sudden pilots were in great demand , and were correspondingly scarce .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 7]: The time for revenge was come .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 26]: It was a bitter pill to have to accept association pilots at last , yet captains and owners agreed that there was no other way .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 7]: But none of these outcasts offered !
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 22]: So there was a still bitterer pill to be swallowed : they must be sought out and asked for their services .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 26]: Captain -- was the first man who found it necessary to take the dose , and he had been the loudest derider of the organization .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 45]: He hunted up one of the best of the association pilots and said -- ` Well , you boys have rather got the best of us for a little while , so I 'll give in with as good a grace as I can .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 14]: I 've come to hire you ; get your trunk aboard right away .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 10]: I want to leave at twelve o'clock . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 7]: I do n't know about that .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 7]: Who is your other pilot ? '
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 8]: ` I 've got I. S -- .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 4]: Why ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 7]: I ca n't go with him .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 9]: He do n't belong to the association . '
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 6]: ` It 's so . '
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 36]: ` Do you mean to tell me that you wo n't turn a wheel with one of the very best and oldest pilots on the river because he do n't belong to your association ? '
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 7]: ` Yes , I do . '
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 11]: ` Well , if this is n't putting on airs !
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 25]: I supposed I was doing you a benevolence ; but I begin to think that I am the party that wants a favor done .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 11]: Are you acting under a law of the concern ? '
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: ` Show it to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 28]: So they stepped into the association rooms , and the secretary soon satisfied the captain , who said -- ` Well , what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 13]: I have hired Mr. S -- for the entire season . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 12]: I will provide for you , ' said the secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 21]: I will detail a pilot to go with you , and he shall be on board at twelve o'clock . '
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 21]: ` But if I discharge S -- , he will come on me for the whole season 's wages . '
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 16]: ` Of course that is a matter between you and Mr. S -- , captain .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 10]: We can not meddle in your private affairs . '
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 9]: The captain stormed , but to no purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 26]: In the end he had to discharge S -- , pay him about a thousand dollars , and take an association pilot in his place .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 11]: The laugh was beginning to turn the other way now .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 35]: Every day , thenceforward , a new victim fell ; every day some outraged captain discharged a non-association pet , with tears and profanity , and installed a hated association man in his berth .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 27]: In a very little while , idle non-associationists began to be pretty plenty , brisk as business was , and much as their services were desired .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 14]: The laugh was shifting to the other side of their mouths most palpably .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 36]: These victims , together with the captains and owners , presently ceased to laugh altogether , and began to rage about the revenge they would take when the passing business ` spurt ' was over .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 20]: Soon all the laughers that were left were the owners and crews of boats that had two non-association pilots .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 8]: But their triumph was not very long-lived .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 34]: For this reason : It was a rigid rule of the association that its members should never , under any circumstances whatever , give information about the channel to any ` outsider . '
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 22]: By this time about half the boats had none but association pilots , and the other half had none but outsiders .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 33]: At the first glance one would suppose that when it came to forbidding information about the river these two parties could play equally at that game ; but this was not so .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 32]: At every good-sized town from one end of the river to the other , there was a ` wharf-boat ' to land at , instead of a wharf or a pier .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 15]: Freight was stored in it for transportation ; waiting passengers slept in its cabins .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 34]: Upon each of these wharf-boats the association 's officers placed a strong box fastened with a peculiar lock which was used in no other service but one -- the United States mail service .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 11]: It was the letter-bag lock , a sacred governmental thing .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 19]: By dint of much beseeching the government had been persuaded to allow the association to use this lock .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 12]: Every association man carried a key which would open these boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 89]: That key , or rather a peculiar way of holding it in the hand when its owner was asked for river information by a stranger -- for the success of the St. Louis and New Orleans association had now bred tolerably thriving branches in a dozen neighboring steamboat trades -- was the association man 's sign and diploma of membership ; and if the stranger did not respond by producing a similar key and holding it in a certain manner duly prescribed , his question was politely ignored .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 42]: From the association 's secretary each member received a package of more or less gorgeous blanks , printed like a billhead , on handsome paper , properly ruled in columns ; a bill-head worded something like this -- STEAMER GREAT REPUBLIC .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 11]: JOHN SMITH MASTER PILOTS , JOHN JONES AND THOMAS BROWN .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 18]: + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + | CROSSINGS .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 3]: | SOUNDINGS .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 3]: | MARKS .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 3]: | REMARKS .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 39]: | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + These blanks were filled up , day by day , as the voyage progressed , and deposited in the several wharf-boat boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 38]: For instance , as soon as the first crossing , out from St. Louis , was completed , the items would be entered upon the blank , under the appropriate headings , thus -- ` St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 8]: Nine and a half -LRB- feet -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 24]: Stern on court-house , head on dead cottonwood above wood-yard , until you raise the first reef , then pull up square . '
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 17]: Then under head of Remarks : ` Go just outside the wrecks ; this is important .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 13]: New snag just where you straighten down ; go above it . '
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 91]: The pilot who deposited that blank in the Cairo box -LRB- after adding to it the details of every crossing all the way down from St. Louis -RRB- took out and read half a dozen fresh reports -LRB- from upward-bound steamers -RRB- concerning the river between Cairo and Memphis , posted himself thoroughly , returned them to the box , and went back aboard his boat again so armed against accident that he could not possibly get his boat into trouble without bringing the most ingenious carelessness to his aid .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 27]: Imagine the benefits of so admirable a system in a piece of river twelve or thirteen hundred miles long , whose channel was shifting every day !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 48]: The pilot who had formerly been obliged to put up with seeing a shoal place once or possibly twice a month , had a hundred sharp eyes to watch it for him , now , and bushels of intelligent brains to tell him how to run it .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 10]: His information about it was seldom twenty-four hours old .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 88]: If the reports in the last box chanced to leave any misgivings on his mind concerning a treacherous crossing , he had his remedy ; he blew his steam-whistle in a peculiar way as soon as he saw a boat approaching ; the signal was answered in a peculiar way if that boat 's pilots were association men ; and then the two steamers ranged alongside and all uncertainties were swept away by fresh information furnished to the inquirer by word of mouth and in minute detail .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 43]: The first thing a pilot did when he reached New Orleans or St. Louis was to take his final and elaborate report to the association parlors and hang it up there , -- after which he was free to visit his family .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 42]: In these parlors a crowd was always gathered together , discussing changes in the channel , and the moment there was a fresh arrival , everybody stopped talking till this witness had told the newest news and settled the latest uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 18]: Other craftsmen can ` sink the shop , ' sometimes , and interest themselves in other matters .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 36]: Not so with a pilot ; he must devote himself wholly to his profession and talk of nothing else ; for it would be small gain to be perfect one day and imperfect the next .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 16]: He has no time or words to waste if he would keep ` posted . '
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 10]: But the outsiders had a hard time of it .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 23]: No particular place to meet and exchange information , no wharf-boat reports , none but chance and unsatisfactory ways of getting news .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 26]: The consequence was that a man sometimes had to run five hundred miles of river on information that was a week or ten days old .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 23]: At a fair stage of the river that might have answered ; but when the dead low water came it was destructive .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 7]: Now came another perfectly logical result .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 30]: The outsiders began to ground steamboats , sink them , and get into all sorts of trouble , whereas accidents seemed to keep entirely away from the association men .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 39]: Wherefore even the owners and captains of boats furnished exclusively with outsiders , and previously considered to be wholly independent of the association and free to comfort themselves with brag and laughter , began to feel pretty uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 38]: Still , they made a show of keeping up the brag , until one black day when every captain of the lot was formally ordered to immediately discharge his outsiders and take association pilots in their stead .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 13]: And who was it that had the dashing presumption to do that ?
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 18]: Alas , it came from a power behind the throne that was greater than the throne itself .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 5]: It was the underwriters !
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 10]: It was no time to ` swap knives . '
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 11]: Every outsider had to take his trunk ashore at once .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 22]: Of course it was supposed that there was collusion between the association and the underwriters , but this was not so .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 38]: The latter had come to comprehend the excellence of the ` report ' system of the association and the safety it secured , and so they had made their decision among themselves and upon plain business principles .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 17]: There was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp of the outsiders now .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 19]: But no matter , there was but one course for them to pursue , and they pursued it .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 18]: They came forward in couples and groups , and proffered their twelve dollars and asked for membership .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 15]: They were surprised to learn that several new by-laws had been long ago added .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 25]: For instance , the initiation fee had been raised to fifty dollars ; that sum must be tendered , and also ten per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 19]: of the wages which the applicant had received each and every month since the founding of the association .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 12]: In many cases this amounted to three or four hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 15]: Still , the association would not entertain the application until the money was present .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 10]: Even then a single adverse vote killed the application .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 37]: Every member had to vote ` Yes ' or ` No ' in person and before witnesses ; so it took weeks to decide a candidacy , because many pilots were so long absent on voyages .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 28]: However , the repentant sinners scraped their savings together , and one by one , by our tedious voting process , they were added to the fold .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 14]: A time came , at last , when only about ten remained outside .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 10]: They said they would starve before they would apply .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 17]: They remained idle a long while , because of course nobody could venture to employ them .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 25]: By and by the association published the fact that upon a certain date the wages would be raised to five hundred dollars per month .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 25]: All the branch associations had grown strong , now , and the Red River one had advanced wages to seven hundred dollars a month .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 16]: Reluctantly the ten outsiders yielded , in view of these things , and made application .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 62]: There was another new by-law , by this time , which required them to pay dues not only on all the wages they had received since the association was born , but also on what they would have received if they had continued at work up to the time of their application , instead of going off to pout in idleness .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 19]: It turned out to be a difficult matter to elect them , but it was accomplished at last .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 36]: The most virulent sinner of this batch had stayed out and allowed ` dues ' to accumulate against him so long that he had to send in six hundred and twenty-five dollars with his application .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 14]: The association had a good bank account now , and was very strong .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 7]: There was no longer an outsider .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 119]: A by-law was added forbidding the reception of any more cubs or apprentices for five years ; after which time a limited number would be taken , not by individuals , but by the association , upon these terms : the applicant must not be less than eighteen years old , and of respectable family and good character ; he must pass an examination as to education , pay a thousand dollars in advance for the privilege of becoming an apprentice , and must remain under the commands of the association until a great part of the membership -LRB- more than half , I think -RRB- should be willing to sign his application for a pilot 's license .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 16]: All previously-articled apprentices were now taken away from their masters and adopted by the association .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 30]: The president and secretary detailed them for service on one boat or another , as they chose , and changed them from boat to boat according to certain rules .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 27]: If a pilot could show that he was in infirm health and needed assistance , one of the cubs would be ordered to go with him .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 16]: The widow and orphan list grew , but so did the association 's financial resources .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 14]: The association attended its own funerals in state , and paid for them .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 33]: When occasion demanded , it sent members down the river upon searches for the bodies of brethren lost by steamboat accidents ; a search of this kind sometimes cost a thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 14]: The association procured a charter and went into the insurance business , also .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 16]: It not only insured the lives of its members , but took risks on steamboats .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 5]: The organization seemed indestructible .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 9]: It was the tightest monopoly in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 34]: By the United States law , no man could become a pilot unless two duly licensed pilots signed his application ; and now there was nobody outside of the association competent to sign .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 10]: Consequently the making of pilots was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 25]: Every year some would die and others become incapacitated by age and infirmity ; there would be no new ones to take their places .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 58]: In time , the association could put wages up to any figure it chose ; and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry the thing too far and provoke the national government into amending the licensing system , steamboat owners would have to submit , since there would be no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 25]: The owners and captains were the only obstruction that lay between the association and absolute power ; and at last this one was removed .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 15]: Incredible as it may seem , the owners and captains deliberately did it themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 71]: When the pilots ' association announced , months beforehand , that on the first day of September , 1861 , wages would be advanced to five hundred dollars per month , the owners and captains instantly put freights up a few cents , and explained to the farmers along the river the necessity of it , by calling their attention to the burdensome rate of wages about to be established .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 17]: It was a rather slender argument , but the farmers did not seem to detect it .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 48]: It looked reasonable to them that to add five cents freight on a bushel of corn was justifiable under the circumstances , overlooking the fact that this advance on a cargo of forty thousand sacks was a good deal more than necessary to cover the new wages .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 38]: So , straightway the captains and owners got up an association of their own , and proposed to put captains ' wages up to five hundred dollars , too , and move for another advance in freights .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 21]: It was a novel idea , but of course an effect which had been produced once could be produced again .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 48]: The new association decreed -LRB- for this was before all the outsiders had been taken into the pilots ' association -RRB- that if any captain employed a non-association pilot , he should be forced to discharge him , and also pay a fine of five hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 30]: Several of these heavy fines were paid before the captains ' organization grew strong enough to exercise full authority over its membership ; but that all ceased , presently .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 28]: The captains tried to get the pilots to decree that no member of their corporation should serve under a non-association captain ; but this proposition was declined .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 28]: The pilots saw that they would be backed up by the captains and the underwriters anyhow , and so they wisely refrained from entering into entangling alliances .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 25]: As I have remarked , the pilots ' association was now the compactest monopoly in the world , perhaps , and seemed simply indestructible .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 10]: And yet the days of its glory were numbered .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 174]: First , the new railroad stretching up through Mississippi , Tennessee , and Kentucky , to Northern railway centers , began to divert the passenger travel from the steamers ; next the war came and almost entirely annihilated the steamboating industry during several years , leaving most of the pilots idle , and the cost of living advancing all the time ; then the treasurer of the St. Louis association put his hand into the till and walked off with every dollar of the ample fund ; and finally , the railroads intruding everywhere , there was little for steamers to do , when the war was over , but carry freights ; so straightway some genius from the Atlantic coast introduced the plan of towing a dozen steamer cargoes down to New Orleans at the tail of a vulgar little tug-boat ; and behold , in the twinkling of an eye , as it were , the association and the noble science of piloting were things of the dead and pathetic past !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 25]: Chapter 16 Racing Days IT was always the custom for the boats to leave New Orleans between four and five o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 66]: From three o'clock onward they would be burning rosin and pitch pine -LRB- the sign of preparation -RRB- , and so one had the picturesque spectacle of a rank , some two or three miles long , of tall , ascending columns of coal-black smoke ; a colonnade which supported a sable roof of the same smoke blended together and spreading abroad over the city .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 21]: Every outward-bound boat had its flag flying at the jack-staff , and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 197]: Two or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with more than usual emphasis ; countless processions of freight barrels and boxes were spinning athwart the levee and flying aboard the stage-planks , belated passengers were dodging and skipping among these frantic things , hoping to reach the forecastle companion way alive , but having their doubts about it ; women with reticules and bandboxes were trying to keep up with husbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying babies , and making a failure of it by losing their heads in the whirl and roar and general distraction ; drays and baggage-vans were clattering hither and thither in a wild hurry , every now and then getting blocked and jammed together , and then during ten seconds one could not see them for the profanity , except vaguely and dimly ; every windlass connected with every forehatch , from one end of that long array of steamboats to the other , was keeping up a deafening whiz and whir , lowering freight into the hold , and the half-naked crews of perspiring negroes that worked them were roaring such songs as ` De Las ' Sack !
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 6]: De Las ' Sack ! '
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 19]: -- inspired to unimaginable exaltation by the chaos of turmoil and racket that was driving everybody else mad .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 19]: By this time the hurricane and boiler decks of the steamers would be packed and black with passengers .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 60]: The ` last bells ' would begin to clang , all down the line , and then the powwow seemed to double ; in a moment or two the final warning came , -- a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs , with the cry , ` All dat ai n't goin ' , please to git asho ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 8]: -- and behold , the powwow quadrupled !
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 15]: People came swarming ashore , overturning excited stragglers that were trying to swarm aboard .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 49]: One more moment later a long array of stage-planks was being hauled in , each with its customary latest passenger clinging to the end of it with teeth , nails , and everything else , and the customary latest procrastinator making a wild spring shoreward over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 22]: Now a number of the boats slide backward into the stream , leaving wide gaps in the serried rank of steamers .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 19]: Citizens crowd the decks of boats that are not to go , in order to see the sight .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 101]: Steamer after steamer straightens herself up , gathers all her strength , and presently comes swinging by , under a tremendous head of steam , with flag flying , black smoke rolling , and her entire crew of firemen and deck-hands -LRB- usually swarthy negroes -RRB- massed together on the forecastle , the best ` voice ' in the lot towering from the midst -LRB- being mounted on the capstan -RRB- , waving his hat or a flag , and all roaring a mighty chorus , while the parting cannons boom and the multitudinous spectators swing their hats and huzza !
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 19]: Steamer after steamer falls into line , and the stately procession goes winging its flight up the river .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 53]: In the old times , whenever two fast boats started out on a race , with a big crowd of people looking on , it was inspiring to hear the crews sing , especially if the time were night-fall , and the forecastle lit up with the red glare of the torch-baskets .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 5]: Racing was royal fun .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 42]: The public always had an idea that racing was dangerous ; whereas the opposite was the case -- that is , after the laws were passed which restricted each boat to just so many pounds of steam to the square inch .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 15]: No engineer was ever sleepy or careless when his heart was in a race .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 13]: He was constantly on the alert , trying gauge-cocks and watching things .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 35]: The dangerous place was on slow , plodding boats , where the engineers drowsed around and allowed chips to get into the ` doctor ' and shut off the water supply from the boilers .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 23]: In the ` flush times ' of steamboating , a race between two notoriously fleet steamers was an event of vast importance .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 29]: The date was set for it several weeks in advance , and from that time forward , the whole Mississippi Valley was in a state of consuming excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 16]: Politics and the weather were dropped , and people talked only of the coming race .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 15]: As the time approached , the two steamers ` stripped ' and got ready .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 28]: Every encumbrance that added weight , or exposed a resisting surface to wind or water , was removed , if the boat could possibly do without it .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 31]: The ` spars , ' and sometimes even their supporting derricks , were sent ashore , and no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 64]: When the ` Eclipse ' and the ` A. L. Shotwell ' ran their great race many years ago , it was said that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off the fanciful device which hung between the ` Eclipse 's ' chimneys , and that for that one trip the captain left off his kid gloves and had his head shaved .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 7]: But I always doubted these things .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 47]: If the boat was known to make her best speed when drawing five and a half feet forward and five feet aft , she was carefully loaded to that exact figure -- she would n't enter a dose of homoeopathic pills on her manifest after that .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 21]: Hardly any passengers were taken , because they not only add weight but they never will ` trim boat . '
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 39]: They always run to the side when there is anything to see , whereas a conscientious and experienced steamboatman would stick to the center of the boat and part his hair in the middle with a spirit level .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 31]: No way-freights and no way-passengers were allowed , for the racers would stop only at the largest towns , and then it would be only ` touch and go . '
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 28]: Coal flats and wood flats were contracted for beforehand , and these were kept ready to hitch on to the flying steamers at a moment 's warning .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 14]: Double crews were carried , so that all work could be quickly done .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 66]: The chosen date being come , and all things in readiness , the two great steamers back into the stream , and lie there jockeying a moment , and apparently watching each other 's slightest movement , like sentient creatures ; flags drooping , the pent steam shrieking through safety-valves , the black smoke rolling and tumbling from the chimneys and darkening all the air .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 50]: People , people everywhere ; the shores , the house-tops , the steamboats , the ships , are packed with them , and you know that the borders of the broad Mississippi are going to be fringed with humanity thence northward twelve hundred miles , to welcome these racers .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 61]: Presently tall columns of steam burst from the ` scape-pipes of both steamers , two guns boom a good-bye , two red-shirted heroes mounted on capstans wave their small flags above the massed crews on the forecastles , two plaintive solos linger on the air a few waiting seconds , two mighty choruses burst forth -- and here they come !
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 25]: Brass bands bray Hail Columbia , huzza after huzza thunders from the shores , and the stately creatures go whistling by like the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 31]: Those boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans and St. Louis , except for a second or two at large towns , or to hitch thirty-cord wood-boats alongside .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 48]: You should be on board when they take a couple of those wood-boats in tow and turn a swarm of men into each ; by the time you have wiped your glasses and put them on , you will be wondering what has become of that wood .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 15]: Two nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each other day after day .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 28]: They might even stay side by side , but for the fact that pilots are not all alike , and the smartest pilots will win the race .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 46]: If one of the boats has a ` lightning ' pilot , whose ` partner ' is a trifle his inferior , you can tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has gained ground or lost some during each four-hour stretch .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 17]: The shrewdest pilot can delay a boat if he has not a fine genius for steering .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 7]: Steering is a very high art .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 22]: One must not keep a rudder dragging across a boat 's stem if he wants to get up the river fast .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 11]: There is a great difference in boats , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 26]: For a long time I was on a boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left port in .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 9]: But of course this was at rare intervals .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 21]: Ferryboats used to lose valuable trips because their passengers grew old and died , waiting for us to get by .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 7]: This was at still rarer intervals .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 16]: I had the documents for these occurrences , but through carelessness they have been mislaid .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 33]: This boat , the ` John J. Roe , ' was so slow that when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend , it was five years before the owners heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 20]: That was always a confusing fact to me , but it is according to the record , any way .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 24]: She was dismally slow ; still , we often had pretty exciting times racing with islands , and rafts , and such things .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 10]: One trip , however , we did rather well .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 9]: We went to St. Louis in sixteen days .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 24]: But even at this rattling gait I think we changed watches three times in Fort Adams reach , which is five miles long .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 27]: A ` reach ' is a piece of straight river , and of course the current drives through such a place in a pretty lively way .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 36]: That trip we went to Grand Gulf , from New Orleans , in four days -LRB- three hundred and forty miles -RRB- ; the ` Eclipse ' and ` Shotwell ' did it in one .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 31]: We were nine days out , in the chute of 63 -LRB- seven hundred miles -RRB- ; the ` Eclipse ' and ` Shotwell ' went there in two days .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 32]: Something over a generation ago , a boat called the ` J. M. White ' went from New Orleans to Cairo in three days , six hours , and forty-four minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 21]: In 1853 the ` Eclipse ' made the same trip in three days , three hours , and twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 6]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- Time disputed .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 13]: Some authorities add 1 hour and 16 minutes to this . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 17]: In 1870 the ` R. E. Lee ' did it in three days and ONE hour .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 10]: This last is called the fastest trip on record .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 10]: I will try to show that it was not .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 43]: For this reason : the distance between New Orleans and Cairo , when the ` J. M. White ' ran it , was about eleven hundred and six miles ; consequently her average speed was a trifle over fourteen miles per hour .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 38]: In the ` Eclipse 's ' day the distance between the two ports had become reduced to one thousand and eighty miles ; consequently her average speed was a shade under fourteen and three-eighths miles per hour .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 33]: In the ` R. E. Lee 's ' time the distance had diminished to about one thousand and thirty miles ; consequently her average was about fourteen and one-eighth miles per hour .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 17]: Therefore the ` Eclipse 's ' was conspicuously the fastest time that has ever been made .

Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 15]: Chapter 17 Cut-offs and Stephen THESE dry details are of importance in one particular .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 26]: They give me an opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi 's oddest peculiarities , -- that of shortening its length from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 66]: If you will throw a long , pliant apple-paring over your shoulder , it will pretty fairly shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi River ; that is , the nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo , Illinois , southward to New Orleans , the same being wonderfully crooked , with a brief straight bit here and there at wide intervals .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 30]: The two hundred-mile stretch from Cairo northward to St. Louis is by no means so crooked , that being a rocky country which the river can not cut much .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 87]: The water cuts the alluvial banks of the ` lower ' river into deep horseshoe curves ; so deep , indeed , that in some places if you were to get ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and walk across the neck , half or three quarters of a mile , you could sit down and rest a couple of hours while your steamer was coming around the long elbow , at a speed of ten miles an hour , to take you aboard again .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 142]: When the river is rising fast , some scoundrel whose plantation is back in the country , and therefore of inferior value , has only to watch his chance , cut a little gutter across the narrow neck of land some dark night , and turn the water into it , and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has happened : to wit , the whole Mississippi has taken possession of that little ditch , and placed the countryman 's plantation on its bank -LRB- quadrupling its value -RRB- , and that other party 's formerly valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on a big island ; the old watercourse around it will soon shoal up , boats can not approach within ten miles of it , and down goes its value to a fourth of its former worth .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 41]: Watches are kept on those narrow necks , at needful times , and if a man happens to be caught cutting a ditch across them , the chances are all against his ever having another opportunity to cut a ditch .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 11]: Pray observe some of the effects of this ditching business .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 24]: Once there was a neck opposite Port Hudson , Louisiana , which was only half a mile across , in its narrowest place .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 32]: You could walk across there in fifteen minutes ; but if you made the journey around the cape on a raft , you traveled thirty-five miles to accomplish the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 21]: In 1722 the river darted through that neck , deserted its old bed , and thus shortened itself thirty-five miles .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 16]: In the same way it shortened itself twenty-five miles at Black Hawk Point in 1699 .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 20]: Below Red River Landing , Raccourci cut-off was made -LRB- forty or fifty years ago , I think -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 7]: This shortened the river twenty-eight miles .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 26]: In our day , if you travel by river from the southernmost of these three cut-offs to the northernmost , you go only seventy miles .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 22]: To do the same thing a hundred and seventy-six years ago , one had to go a hundred and fifty-eight miles !
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 10]: -- shortening of eighty-eight miles in that trifling distance .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 30]: At some forgotten time in the past , cut-offs were made above Vidalia , Louisiana ; at island 92 ; at island 84 ; and at Hale 's Point .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 12]: These shortened the river , in the aggregate , seventy-seven miles .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 34]: Since my own day on the Mississippi , cut-offs have been made at Hurricane Island ; at island 100 ; at Napoleon , Arkansas ; at Walnut Bend ; and at Council Bend .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 12]: These shortened the river , in the aggregate , sixty-seven miles .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 21]: In my own time a cut-off was made at American Bend , which shortened the river ten miles or more .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 23]: Therefore , the Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was twelve hundred and fifteen miles long one hundred and seventy-six years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 12]: It was eleven hundred and eighty after the cut-off of 1722 .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 12]: It was one thousand and forty after the American Bend cut-off .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 7]: It has lost sixty-seven miles since .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 13]: Consequently its length is only nine hundred and seventy-three miles at present .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 63]: Now , if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people , and ` let on ' to prove what had occurred in the remote past by what had occurred in a given time in the recent past , or what will occur in the far future by what has occurred in late years , what an opportunity is here !
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 15]: Geology never had such a chance , nor such exact data to argue from !
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 9]: Nor ` development of species , ' either !
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 13]: Glacial epochs are great things , but they are vague -- vague .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 25]: Please observe : -- In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 16]: That is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 59]: Therefore , any calm person , who is not blind or idiotic , can see that in the Old Oolitic Silurian Period , ' just a million years ago next November , the Lower Mississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred thousand miles long , and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 57]: And by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long , and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets together , and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 7]: There is something fascinating about science .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 16]: One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 27]: When the water begins to flow through one of those ditches I have been speaking of , it is time for the people thereabouts to move .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 10]: The water cleaves the banks away like a knife .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 31]: By the time the ditch has become twelve or fifteen feet wide , the calamity is as good as accomplished , for no power on earth can stop it now .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 22]: When the width has reached a hundred yards , the banks begin to peel off in slices half an acre wide .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 26]: The current flowing around the bend traveled formerly only five miles an hour ; now it is tremendously increased by the shortening of the distance .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 25]: I was on board the first boat that tried to go through the cut-off at American Bend , but we did not get through .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 21]: It was toward midnight , and a wild night it was -- thunder , lightning , and torrents of rain .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 46]: It was estimated that the current in the cut-off was making about fifteen or twenty miles an hour ; twelve or thirteen was the best our boat could do , even in tolerably slack water , therefore perhaps we were foolish to try the cut-off .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 13]: However , Mr. Brown was ambitious , and he kept on trying .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 67]: The eddy running up the bank , under the ` point , ' was about as swift as the current out in the middle ; so we would go flying up the shore like a lightning express train , get on a big head of steam , and ` stand by for a surge ' when we struck the current that was whirling by the point .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 7]: But all our preparations were useless .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 35]: The instant the current hit us it spun us around like a top , the water deluged the forecastle , and the boat careened so far over that one could hardly keep his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 22]: The next instant we were away down the river , clawing with might and main to keep out of the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 7]: We tried the experiment four times .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 10]: I stood on the forecastle companion way to see .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 29]: It was astonishing to observe how suddenly the boat would spin around and turn tail the moment she emerged from the eddy and the current struck her nose .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 22]: The sounding concussion and the quivering would have been about the same if she had come full speed against a sand-bank .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 32]: Under the lightning flashes one could see the plantation cabins and the goodly acres tumble into the river ; and the crash they made was not a bad effort at thunder .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 35]: Once , when we spun around , we only missed a house about twenty feet , that had a light burning in the window ; and in the same instant that house went overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 23]: Nobody could stay on our forecastle ; the water swept across it in a torrent every time we plunged athwart the current .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 29]: At the end of our fourth effort we brought up in the woods two miles below the cut-off ; all the country there was overflowed , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 30]: A day or two later the cut-off was three-quarters of a mile wide , and boats passed up through it without much difficulty , and so saved ten miles .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 12]: The old Raccourci cut-off reduced the river 's length twenty-eight miles .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 10]: There used to be a tradition connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 33]: It was said that a boat came along there in the night and went around the enormous elbow the usual way , the pilots not knowing that the cut-off had been made .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 16]: It was a grisly , hideous night , and all shapes were vague and distorted .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 26]: The old bend had already begun to fill up , and the boat got to running away from mysterious reefs , and occasionally hitting one .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 24]: The perplexed pilots fell to swearing , and finally uttered the entirely unnecessary wish that they might never get out of that place .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 18]: As always happens in such cases , that particular prayer was answered , and the others neglected .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 23]: So to this day that phantom steamer is still butting around in that deserted river , trying to find her way out .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 67]: More than one grave watchman has sworn to me that on drizzly , dismal nights , he has glanced fearfully down that forgotten river as he passed the head of the island , and seen the faint glow of the specter steamer 's lights drifting through the distant gloom , and heard the muffled cough of her ` scape-pipes and the plaintive cry of her leadsmen .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 22]: In the absence of further statistics , I beg to close this chapter with one more reminiscence of ` Stephen . '
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 23]: Most of the captains and pilots held Stephen 's note for borrowed sums , ranging from two hundred and fifty dollars upward .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 23]: Stephen never paid one of these notes , but he was very prompt and very zealous about renewing them every twelve months .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 38]: Of course there came a time , at last , when Stephen could no longer borrow of his ancient creditors ; so he was obliged to lie in wait for new men who did not know him .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 33]: Such a victim was good-hearted , simple natured young Yates -LRB- I use a fictitious name , but the real name began , as this one does , with a Y -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 43]: Young Yates graduated as a pilot , got a berth , and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the clerk 's office and received his two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new bills , Stephen was there !
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 24]: His silvery tongue began to wag , and in a very little while Yates 's two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 23]: The fact was soon known at pilot headquarters , and the amusement and satisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 23]: But innocent Yates never suspected that Stephen 's promise to pay promptly at the end of the week was a worthless one .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 21]: Yates called for his money at the stipulated time ; Stephen sweetened him up and put him off a week .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 20]: He called then , according to agreement , and came away sugar-coated again , but suffering under another postponement .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 6]: So the thing went on .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 18]: Yates haunted Stephen week after week , to no purpose , and at last gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 9]: And then straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates !
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 10]: Wherever Yates appeared , there was the inevitable Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 20]: And not only there , but beaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not being able to pay .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 46]: By and by , whenever poor Yates saw him coming , he would turn and fly , and drag his company with him , if he had company ; but it was of no use ; his debtor would run him down and corner him .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 43]: Panting and red-faced , Stephen would come , with outstretched hands and eager eyes , invade the conversation , shake both of Yates 's arms loose in their sockets , and begin -- ` My , what a race I 've had !
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 23]: I saw you did n't see me , and so I clapped on all steam for fear I 'd miss you entirely .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 5]: And here you are !
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 13]: there , just stand so , and let me look at you !
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 8]: just the same old noble countenance . '
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 12]: -LSB- To Yates 's friend :] ` Just look at him !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 4]: LOOK at him !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 10]: Ai n't it just GOOD to look at him !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 5]: AI N'T it now ?
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 7]: Ai n't he just a picture !
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 12]: SOME call him a picture ; I call him a panorama !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 10]: That 's what he is -- an entire panorama .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 6]: And now I 'm reminded !
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 13]: How I do wish I could have seen you an hour earlier !
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 23]: For twenty-four hours I 've been saving up that two hundred and fifty dollars for you ; been looking for you everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 34]: I waited at the Planter 's from six yesterday evening till two o'clock this morning , without rest or food ; my wife says , `` Where have you been all night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 13]: I said , `` This debt lies heavy on my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 24]: She says , `` In all my days I never saw a man take a debt to heart the way you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 16]: I said , `` It 's my nature ; how can I change it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 16]: She says , `` Well , do go to bed and get some rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 18]: I said , `` Not till that poor , noble young man has got his money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 37]: So I set up all night , and this morning out I shot , and the first man I struck told me you had shipped on the `` Grand Turk '' and gone to New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 15]: Well , sir , I had to lean up against a building and cry .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 11]: So help me goodness , I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 102]: The man that owned the place come out cleaning up with a rag , and said he did n't like to have people cry against his building , and then it seemed to me that the whole world had turned against me , and it was n't any use to live any more ; and coming along an hour ago , suffering no man knows what agony , I met Jim Wilson and paid him the two hundred and fifty dollars on account ; and to think that here you are , now , and I have n't got a cent !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 51]: But as sure as I am standing here on this ground on this particular brick , -- there , I 've scratched a mark on the brick to remember it by , -- I 'll borrow that money and pay it over to you at twelve o'clock sharp , tomorrow !
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 15]: Now , stand so ; let me look at you just once more . '
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 4]: And so on .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 9]: Yates 's life became a burden to him .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 21]: He could not escape his debtor and his debtor 's awful sufferings on account of not being able to pay .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 23]: He dreaded to show himself in the street , lest he should find Stephen lying in wait for him at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 14]: Bogart 's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in those days .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 14]: They met there about as much to exchange river news as to play .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 18]: One morning Yates was there ; Stephen was there , too , but kept out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 34]: But by and by , when about all the pilots had arrived who were in town , Stephen suddenly appeared in the midst , and rushed for Yates as for a long-lost brother .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 11]: ` OH , I am so glad to see you !
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 16]: Oh my soul , the sight of you is such a comfort to my eyes !
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 18]: Gentlemen , I owe all of you money ; among you I owe probably forty thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 17]: I want to pay it ; I intend to pay it every last cent of it .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 86]: You all know , without my telling you , what sorrow it has cost me to remain so long under such deep obligations to such patient and generous friends ; but the sharpest pang I suffer -- by far the sharpest -- is from the debt I owe to this noble young man here ; and I have come to this place this morning especially to make the announcement that I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off all my debts !
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 14]: And most especially I wanted HIM to be here when I announced it .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 16]: Yes , my faithful friend , -- my benefactor , I 've found the method !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 20]: I 've found the method to pay off all my debts , and you 'll get your money ! '
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 37]: Hope dawned in Yates 's eye ; then Stephen , beaming benignantly , and placing his hand upon Yates 's head , added , ' I am going to pay them off in alphabetical order ! '
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 6]: Then he turned and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 42]: The full significance of Stephen 's ` method ' did not dawn upon the perplexed and musing crowd for some two minutes ; and then Yates murmured with a sigh -- ` Well , the Y 's stand a gaudy chance .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 59]: He wo n't get any further than the C 's in THIS world , and I reckon that after a good deal of eternity has wasted away in the next one , I 'll still be referred to up there as `` that poor , ragged pilot that came here from St. Louis in the early days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 67]: Chapter 18 I Take a Few Extra Lessons DURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship , I served under many pilots , and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen and many varieties of steamboats ; for it was not always convenient for Mr. Bixby to have me with him , and in such cases he sent me with somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 47]: I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience ; for in that brief , sharp schooling , I got personally and familiarly acquainted with about all the different types of human nature that are to be found in fiction , biography , or history .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 30]: The fact is daily borne in upon me , that the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years to equip a man with this sort of an education .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 43]: When I say I am still profiting by this thing , I do not mean that it has constituted me a judge of men -- no , it has not done that ; for judges of men are born , not made .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 32]: My profit is various in kind and degree ; but the feature of it which I value most is the zest which that early experience has given to my later reading .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 37]: When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or biography , I generally take a warm personal interest in him , for the reason that I have known him before -- met him on the river .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 46]: The figure that comes before me oftenest , out of the shadows of that vanished time , is that of Brown , of the steamer ` Pennsylvania ' -- the man referred to in a former chapter , whose memory was so good and tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 29]: He was a middle-aged , long , slim , bony , smooth-shaven , horse-faced , ignorant , stingy , malicious , snarling , fault hunting , mote-magnifying tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 15]: I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 44]: No matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch below , and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft , my soul became lead in my body the moment I approached the pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 15]: I still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that man .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 44]: The boat had backed out from St. Louis and was ` straightening down ; ' I ascended to the pilot-house in high feather , and very proud to be semi-officially a member of the executive family of so fast and famous a boat .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 6]: Brown was at the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 23]: I paused in the middle of the room , all fixed to make my bow , but Brown did not look around .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 33]: I thought he took a furtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye , but as not even this notice was repeated , I judged I had been mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 41]: By this time he was picking his way among some dangerous ` breaks ' abreast the woodyards ; therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him ; so I stepped softly to the high bench and took a seat .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 37]: There was silence for ten minutes ; then my new boss turned and inspected me deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for about -- as it seemed to me -- a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 38]: After which he removed his countenance and I saw it no more for some seconds ; then it came around once more , and this question greeted me -- ` Are you Horace Bigsby 's cub ? '
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 10]: After this there was a pause and another inspection .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 9]: Then -- ` What 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 4]: I told him .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 6]: He repeated it after me .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 33]: It was probably the only thing he ever forgot ; for although I was with him many months he never addressed himself to me in any other way than ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 6]: and then his command followed .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 7]: ` Where was you born ? '
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 7]: ` In Florida , Missouri . '
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 3]: A pause .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 10]: Then -- ` Dern sight better staid there ! '
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 21]: By means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions , he pumped my family history out of me .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 11]: The leads were going now , in the first crossing .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 5]: This interrupted the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 21]: When the leads had been laid in , he resumed -- ` How long you been on the river ? '
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 4]: I told him .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 13]: After a pause -- ` Where 'd you get them shoes ? '
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 6]: I gave him the information .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 7]: ` Hold up your foot ! '
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 4]: I did so .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 41]: He stepped back , examined the shoe minutely and contemptuously , scratching his head thoughtfully , tilting his high sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation , then ejaculated , ` Well , I 'll be dod derned ! '
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 6]: and returned to his wheel .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 29]: What occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing which is still as much of a mystery to me now as it was then .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 34]: It must have been all of fifteen minutes -- fifteen minutes of dull , homesick silence -- before that long horse-face swung round upon me again -- and then , what a change !
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 15]: It was as red as fire , and every muscle in it was working .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 8]: Now came this shriek -- ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 10]: -- You going to set there all day ? '
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 19]: I lit in the middle of the floor , shot there by the electric suddenness of the surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 24]: As soon as I could get my voice I said , apologetically : -- ' I have had no orders , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 7]: ` You 've had no ORDERS !
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 9]: My , what a fine bird we are !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 5]: We must have ORDERS !
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 16]: Our father was a GENTLEMAN -- owned slaves -- and we 've been to SCHOOL .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 15]: Yes , WE are a gentleman , TOO , and got to have ORDERS !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 5]: ORDERS , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 6]: ORDERS is what you want !
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 22]: Dod dern my skin , I 'LL learn you to swell yourself up and blow around here about your dod-derned ORDERS !
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 6]: G'way from the wheel ! '
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: -LRB- I had approached it without knowing it . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 24]: I moved back a step or two , and stood as in a dream , all my senses stupefied by this frantic assault .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 7]: ` What you standing there for ?
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 22]: Take that ice-pitcher down to the texas-tender-come , move along , and do n't you be all day about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 15]: The moment I got back to the pilot-house , Brown said -- ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 12]: What was you doing down there all this time ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 19]: I could n't find the texas-tender ; I had to go all the way to the pantry . '
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 5]: ` Derned likely story !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 6]: Fill up the stove . '
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 6]: I proceeded to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 7]: He watched me like a cat .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 10]: Presently he shouted -- ` Put down that shovel !
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 19]: Deadest numskull I ever saw -- ai n't even got sense enough to load up a stove . '
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 11]: All through the watch this sort of thing went on .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 17]: Yes , and the subsequent watches were much like it , during a stretch of months .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 17]: As I have said , I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 40]: The moment I was in the presence , even in the darkest night , I could feel those yellow eyes upon me , and knew their owner was watching for a pretext to spit out some venom on me .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 8]: Preliminarily he would say -- ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 5]: Take the wheel . '
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 13]: Two minutes later -- ` WHERE in the nation you going to ?
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 4]: Pull her down !
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 5]: pull her down ! '
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 7]: After another moment -- ` Say !
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 8]: You going to hold her all day ?
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 7]: Let her go -- meet her !
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 4]: meet her ! '
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 28]: Then he would jump from the bench , snatch the wheel from me , and meet her himself , pouring out wrath upon me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 9]: George Ritchie was the other pilot 's cub .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 22]: He was having good times now ; for his boss , George Ealer , was as kindhearted as Brown was n't .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 27]: Ritchie had steeled for Brown the season before ; consequently he knew exactly how to entertain himself and plague me , all by the one operation .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 32]: Whenever I took the wheel for a moment on Ealer 's watch , Ritchie would sit back on the bench and play Brown , with continual ejaculations of ` Snatch her !
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 3]: snatch her !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 7]: Derndest mud-cat I ever saw ! '
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 5]: Where you going NOW ?
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 8]: Going to run over that snag ? '
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 5]: ` Pull her DOWN !
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 6]: Do n't you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 5]: Pull her DOWN ! '
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 5]: ` There she goes !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 5]: JUST as I expected !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 9]: I TOLD you not to cramp that reef .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: G'way from the wheel ! '
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 39]: So I always had a rough time of it , no matter whose watch it was ; and sometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie 's good-natured badgering was pretty nearly as aggravating as Brown 's dead-earnest nagging .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 13]: I often wanted to kill Brown , but this would not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 46]: A cub had to take everything his boss gave , in the way of vigorous comment and criticism ; and we all believed that there was a United States law making it a penitentiary offense to strike or threaten a pilot who was on duty .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 32]: However , I could IMAGINE myself killing Brown ; there was no law against that ; and that was the thing I used always to do the moment I was abed .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 25]: Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty , I threw business aside for pleasure , and killed Brown .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 41]: I killed Brown every night for months ; not in old , stale , commonplace ways , but in new and picturesque ones ; -- ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness of design and ghastliness of situation and environment .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 25]: Brown was ALWAYS watching for a pretext to find fault ; and if he could find no plausible pretext , he would invent one .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 56]: He would scold you for shaving a shore , and for not shaving it ; for hugging a bar , and for not hugging it ; for ` pulling down ' when not invited , and for not pulling down when not invited ; for firing up without orders , and for waiting FOR orders .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 40]: In a word , it was his invariable rule to find fault with EVERYTHING you did ; and another invariable rule of his was to throw all his remarks -LRB- to you -RRB- into the form of an insult .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 14]: One day we were approaching New Madrid , bound down and heavily laden .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 30]: Brown was at one side of the wheel , steering ; I was at the other , standing by to ` pull down ' or ` shove up . '
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 12]: He cast a furtive glance at me every now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 21]: I had long ago learned what that meant ; viz. , he was trying to invent a trap for me .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 10]: I wondered what shape it was going to take .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 20]: By and by he stepped back from the wheel and said in his usual snarly way -- ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 14]: -- See if you 've got gumption enough to round her to . '
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 46]: This was simply BOUND to be a success ; nothing could prevent it ; for he had never allowed me to round the boat to before ; consequently , no matter how I might do the thing , he could find free fault with it .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 131]: He stood back there with his greedy eye on me , and the result was what might have been foreseen : I lost my head in a quarter of a minute , and did n't know what I was about ; I started too early to bring the boat around , but detected a green gleam of joy in Brown 's eye , and corrected my mistake ; I started around once more while too high up , but corrected myself again in time ; I made other false moves , and still managed to save myself ; but at last I grew so confused and anxious that I tumbled into the very worst blunder of all -- I got too far down before beginning to fetch the boat around .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 6]: Brown 's chance was come .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 49]: His face turned red with passion ; he made one bound , hurled me across the house with a sweep of his arm , spun the wheel down , and began to pour out a stream of vituperation upon me which lasted till he was out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 41]: In the course of this speech he called me all the different kinds of hard names he could think of , and once or twice I thought he was even going to swear -- but he did n't this time .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 31]: ` Dod dern ' was the nearest he ventured to the luxury of swearing , for he had been brought up with a wholesome respect for future fire and brimstone .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 17]: That was an uncomfortable hour ; for there was a big audience on the hurricane deck .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 21]: When I went to bed that night , I killed Brown in seventeen different ways -- all of them new .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 17]: Chapter 19 Brown and I Exchange Compliments Two trips later , I got into serious trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 11]: Brown was steering ; I was ` pulling down . '
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 26]: My younger brother appeared on the hurricane deck , and shouted to Brown to stop at some landing or other a mile or so below .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 10]: Brown gave no intimation that he had heard anything .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 17]: But that was his way : he never condescended to take notice of an under clerk .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 30]: The wind was blowing ; Brown was deaf -LRB- although he always pretended he was n't -RRB- , and I very much doubted if he had heard the order .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 32]: If I had two heads , I would have spoken ; but as I had only one , it seemed judicious to take care of it ; so I kept still .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 12]: Presently , sure enough , we went sailing by that plantation .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 23]: Captain Klinefelter appeared on the deck , and said -- ` Let her come around , sir , let her come around .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 10]: Did n't Henry tell you to land here ? '
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 7]: ` NO , sir ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 10]: I sent him up to do , it . '
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 19]: ` He did come up ; and that 's all the good it done , the dod-derned fool .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 6]: He never said anything . '
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 8]: ` Did n't YOU hear him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 6]: asked the captain of me .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 33]: Of course I did n't want to be mixed up in this business , but there was no way to avoid it ; so I said -- ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 23]: I knew what Brown 's next remark would be , before he uttered it ; it was -- ` Shut your mouth !
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 9]: you never heard anything of the kind . '
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 8]: I closed my mouth according to instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 17]: An hour later , Henry entered the pilot-house , unaware of what had been going on .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 27]: He was a thoroughly inoffensive boy , and I was sorry to see him come , for I knew Brown would have no pity on him .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 8]: Brown began , straightway -- ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 17]: why did n't you tell me we 'd got to land at that plantation ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 9]: I did tell you , Mr. Brown . '
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 7]: ` It 's a lie ! '
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 9]: I said -- ` You lie , yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 6]: He did tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 39]: Brown glared at me in unaffected surprise ; and for as much as a moment he was entirely speechless ; then he shouted to me -- ` I 'll attend to your case in half a minute ! '
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 16]: then to Henry , ` And you leave the pilot-house ; out with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 10]: It was pilot law , and must be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 62]: The boy started out , and even had his foot on the upper step outside the door , when Brown , with a sudden access of fury , picked up a ten-pound lump of coal and sprang after him ; but I was between , with a heavy stool , and I hit Brown a good honest blow which stretched-him out .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 19]: I had committed the crime of crimes -- I had lifted my hand against a pilot on duty !
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 121]: I supposed I was booked for the penitentiary sure , and could n't be booked any surer if I went on and squared my long account with this person while I had the chance ; consequently I stuck to him and pounded him with my fists a considerable time -- I do not know how long , the pleasure of it probably made it seem longer than it really was ; -- but in the end he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel : a very natural solicitude , for , all this time , here was this steamboat tearing down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and nobody at the helm !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 34]: However , Eagle Bend was two miles wide at this bank-full stage , and correspondingly long and deep ; and the boat was steering herself straight down the middle and taking no chances .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 18]: Still , that was only luck -- a body MIGHT have found her charging into the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 39]: Perceiving , at a glance , that the ` Pennsylvania ' was in no danger , Brown gathered up the big spy-glass , war-club fashion , and ordered me out of the pilot-house with more than Comanche bluster .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 60]: But I was not afraid of him now ; so , instead of going , I tarried , and criticized his grammar ; I reformed his ferocious speeches for him , and put them into good English , calling his attention to the advantage of pure English over the bastard dialect of the Pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 54]: He could have done his part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere vituperation , of course ; but he was not equipped for this species of controversy ; so he presently laid aside his glass and took the wheel , muttering and shaking his head ; and I retired to the bench .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 28]: The racket had brought everybody to the hurricane deck , and I trembled when I saw the old captain looking up from the midst of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 13]: I said to myself , ` Now I AM done for ! '
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 39]: -- For although , as a rule , he was so fatherly and indulgent toward the boat 's family , and so patient of minor shortcomings , he could be stern enough when the fault was worth it .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 36]: I tried to imagine what he WOULD do to a cub pilot who had been guilty of such a crime as mine , committed on a boat guard-deep with costly freight and alive with passengers .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 6]: Our watch was nearly ended .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 17]: I thought I would go and hide somewhere till I got a chance to slide ashore .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 35]: So I slipped out of the pilot-house , and down the steps , and around to the texas door -- and was in the act of gliding within , when the captain confronted me !
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 26]: I dropped my head , and he stood over me in silence a moment or two , then said impressively -- ` Follow me . '
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 21]: I dropped into his wake ; he led the way to his parlor in the forward end of the texas .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 6]: We were alone , now .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 17]: He closed the after door ; then moved slowly to the forward one and closed that .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 9]: He sat down ; I stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 21]: He looked at me some little time , then said -- ` So you have been fighting Mr. Brown ? '
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 10]: I answered meekly -- ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 13]: ` Do you know that that is a very serious matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 23]: ` Are you aware that this boat was plowing down the river fully five minutes with no one at the wheel ? '
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 8]: ` Did you strike him first ? '
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 6]: ` What with ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 6]: A stool , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 4]: ` Hard ? '
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: ` Middling , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 8]: ` Did it knock him down ? '
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 9]: ` He -- he fell , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 7]: ` Did you follow it up ?
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 7]: Did you do anything further ? '
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 7]: ` What did you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 7]: ` Pounded him , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 5]: ` Pounded him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 7]: ` Did you pound him much ?
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 7]: -- that is , severely ? '
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 12]: ` One might call it that , sir , maybe . '
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 8]: ` I 'm deuced glad of it !
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 10]: Hark ye , never mention that I said that .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 24]: You have been guilty of a great crime ; and do n't you ever be guilty of it again , on this boat .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 7]: BUT -- lay for him ashore !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 11]: Give him a good sound thrashing , do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 6]: I 'll pay the expenses .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 15]: Now go -- and mind you , not a word of this to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 5]: Clear out with you !
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 14]: -- you 've been guilty of a great crime , you whelp ! '
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 36]: I slid out , happy with the sense of a close shave and a mighty deliverance ; and I heard him laughing to himself and slapping his fat thighs after I had closed his door .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 54]: When Brown came off watch he went straight to the captain , who was talking with some passengers on the boiler deck , and demanded that I be put ashore in New Orleans -- and added -- ` I 'll never turn a wheel on this boat again while that cub stays . '
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 21]: The captain said -- ` But he need n't come round when you are on watch , Mr. Brown . '
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 12]: I wo n't even stay on the same boat with him .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 10]: One of us has got to go ashore . '
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 24]: ` Very well , ' said the captain , ` let it be yourself ; ' and resumed his talk with the passengers .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 24]: During the brief remainder of the trip , I knew how an emancipated slave feels ; for I was an emancipated slave myself .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 61]: While we lay at landings , I listened to George Ealer 's flute ; or to his readings from his two bibles , that is to say , Goldsmith and Shakespeare ; or I played chess with him -- and would have beaten him sometimes , only he always took back his last move and ran the game out differently .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 43]: Chapter 20 A Catastrophe WE lay three days in New Orleans , but the captain did not succeed in finding another pilot ; so he proposed that I should stand a daylight watch , and leave the night watches to George Ealer .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 49]: But I was afraid ; I had never stood a watch of any sort by myself , and I believed I should be sure to get into trouble in the head of some chute , or ground the boat in a near cut through some bar or other .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 14]: Brown remained in his place ; but he would not travel with me .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 44]: So the captain gave me an order on the captain of the ` A. T. Lacey , ' for a passage to St. Louis , and said he would find a new pilot there and my steersman 's berth could then be resumed .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 17]: The ` Lacey ' was to leave a couple of days after the ` Pennsylvania . '
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 24]: The night before the ` Pennsylvania ' left , Henry and I sat chatting on a freight pile on the levee till midnight .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 22]: The subject of the chat , mainly , was one which I think we had not exploited before -- steamboat disasters .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 57]: One was then on its way to us , little as we suspected it ; the water which was to make the steam which should cause it , was washing past some point fifteen hundred miles up the river while we talked ; -- but it would arrive at the right time and the right place .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 63]: We doubted if persons not clothed with authority were of much use in cases of disaster and attendant panic ; still , they might be of SOME use ; so we decided that if a disaster ever fell within our experience we would at least stick to the boat , and give such minor service as chance might throw in the way .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 15]: Henry remembered this , afterward , when the disaster came , and acted accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 16]: The ` Lacey ' started up the river two days behind the ` Pennsylvania . '
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 38]: We touched at Greenville , Mississippi , a couple of days out , and somebody shouted -- ` The `` Pennsylvania '' is blown up at Ship Island , and a hundred and fifty lives lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 25]: At Napoleon , Arkansas , the same evening , we got an extra , issued by a Memphis paper , which gave some particulars .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 12]: It mentioned my brother , and said he was not hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 10]: Further up the river we got a later extra .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 15]: My brother was again mentioned ; but this time as being hurt beyond help .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 14]: We did not get full details of the catastrophe until we reached Memphis .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 16]: This is the sorrowful story -- It was six o'clock on a hot summer morning .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 33]: The ` Pennsylvania ' was creeping along , north of Ship Island , about sixty miles below Memphis on a half-head of steam , towing a wood-flat which was fast being emptied .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 86]: George Ealer was in the pilot-house-alone , I think ; the second engineer and a striker had the watch in the engine room ; the second mate had the watch on deck ; George Black , Mr. Wood , and my brother , clerks , were asleep , as were also Brown and the head engineer , the carpenter , the chief mate , and one striker ; Captain Klinefelter was in the barber 's chair , and the barber was preparing to shave him .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 34]: There were a good many cabin passengers aboard , and three or four hundred deck passengers -- so it was said at the time -- and not very many of them were astir .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 50]: The wood being nearly all out of the flat now , Ealer rang to ` come ahead ' full steam , and the next moment four of the eight boilers exploded with a thunderous crash , and the whole forward third of the boat was hoisted toward the sky !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 36]: The main part of the mass , with the chimneys , dropped upon the boat again , a mountain of riddled and chaotic rubbish -- and then , after a little , fire broke out .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 27]: Many people were flung to considerable distances , and fell in the river ; among these were Mr. Wood and my brother , and the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 19]: The carpenter was still stretched upon his mattress when he struck the water seventy-five feet from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 22]: Brown , the pilot , and George Black , chief clerk , were never seen or heard of after the explosion .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 64]: The barber 's chair , with Captain Klinefelter in it and unhurt , was left with its back overhanging vacancy -- everything forward of it , floor and all , had disappeared ; and the stupefied barber , who was also unhurt , stood with one toe projecting over space , still stirring his lather unconsciously , and saying , not a word .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 57]: When George Ealer saw the chimneys plunging aloft in front of him , he knew what the matter was ; so he muffled his face in the lapels of his coat , and pressed both hands there tightly to keep this protection in its place so that no steam could get to his nose or mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 17]: He had ample time to attend to these details while he was going up and returning .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 37]: He presently landed on top of the unexploded boilers , forty feet below the former pilot-house , accompanied by his wheel and a rain of other stuff , and enveloped in a cloud of scalding steam .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 14]: All of the many who breathed that steam , died ; none escaped .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 7]: But Ealer breathed none of it .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 49]: He made his way to the free air as quickly as he could ; and when the steam cleared away he returned and climbed up on the boilers again , and patiently hunted out each and every one of his chessmen and the several joints of his flute .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 10]: By this time the fire was beginning to threaten .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 7]: Shrieks and groans filled the air .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 35]: A great many persons had been scalded , a great many crippled ; the explosion had driven an iron crowbar through one man 's body -- I think they said he was a priest .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 14]: He did not die at once , and his sufferings were very dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 25]: A young French naval cadet , of fifteen , son of a French admiral , was fearfully scalded , but bore his tortures manfully .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 15]: Both mates were badly scalded , but they stood to their posts , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 32]: They drew the wood-boat aft , and they and the captain fought back the frantic herd of frightened immigrants till the wounded could be brought there and placed in safety first .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 42]: When Mr. Wood and Henry fell in the water , they struck out for shore , which was only a few hundred yards away ; but Henry presently said he believed he was not hurt -LRB- what an unaccountable error ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 15]: , and therefore would swim back to the boat and help save the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 8]: So they parted , and Henry returned .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 25]: By this time the fire was making fierce headway , and several persons who were imprisoned under the ruins were begging piteously for help .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 30]: All efforts to conquer the fire proved fruitless ; so the buckets were presently thrown aside and the officers fell-to with axes and tried to cut the prisoners out .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 55]: A striker was one of the captives ; he said he was not injured , but could not free himself ; and when he saw that the fire was likely to drive away the workers , he begged that some one would shoot him , and thus save him from the more dreadful death .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 29]: The fire did drive the axmen away , and they had to listen , helpless , to this poor fellow 's supplications till the flames ended his miseries .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 34]: The fire drove all into the wood-flat that could be accommodated there ; it was cut adrift , then , and it and the burning steamer floated down the river toward Ship Island .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 45]: They moored the flat at the head of the island , and there , unsheltered from the blazing sun , the half-naked occupants had to remain , without food or stimulants , or help for their hurts , during the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 25]: A steamer came along , finally , and carried the unfortunates to Memphis , and there the most lavish assistance was at once forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 7]: By this time Henry was insensible .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 25]: The physicians examined his injuries and saw that they were fatal , and naturally turned their main attention to patients who could be saved .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 23]: Forty of the wounded were placed upon pallets on the floor of a great public hall , and among these was Henry .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 31]: There the ladies of Memphis came every day , with flowers , fruits , and dainties and delicacies of all kinds , and there they remained and nursed the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 28]: All the physicians stood watches there , and all the medical students ; and the rest of the town furnished money , or whatever else was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 51]: And Memphis knew how to do all these things well ; for many a disaster like the ` Pennsylvania 's ' had happened near her doors , and she was experienced , above all other cities on the river , in the gracious office of the ` Good Samaritan . '
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 17]: The sight I saw when I entered that large hall was new and strange to me .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 27]: Two long rows of prostrate forms -- more than forty , in all -- and every face and head a shapeless wad of loose raw cotton .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 6]: It was a gruesome spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 16]: I watched there six days and nights , and a very melancholy experience it was .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 22]: There was one daily incident which was peculiarly depressing : this was the removal of the doomed to a chamber apart .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 27]: It was done in order that the MORALE of the other patients might not be injuriously affected by seeing one of their number in the death-agony .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 69]: The fated one was always carried out with as little stir as possible , and the stretcher was always hidden from sight by a wall of assistants ; but no matter : everybody knew what that cluster of bent forms , with its muffled step and its slow movement meant ; and all eyes watched it wistfully , and a shudder went abreast of it like a wave .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 19]: I saw many poor fellows removed to the ` death-room , ' and saw them no more afterward .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 12]: But I saw our chief mate carried thither more than once .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 9]: His hurts were frightful , especially his scalds .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 18]: He was clothed in linseed oil and raw cotton to his waist , and resembled nothing human .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 22]: He was often out of his mind ; and then his pains would make him rave and shout and sometimes shriek .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 57]: Then , after a period of dumb exhaustion , his disordered imagination would suddenly transform the great apartment into a forecastle , and the hurrying throng of nurses into the crew ; and he would come to a sitting posture and shout , ` Hump yourselves , HUMP yourselves , you petrifactions , snail-bellies , pall-bearers !
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 13]: going to be all DAY getting that hatful of freight out ? '
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 22]: and supplement this explosion with a firmament-obliterating irruption or profanity which nothing could stay or stop till his crater was empty .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 26]: And now and then while these frenzies possessed him , he would tear off handfuls of the cotton and expose his cooked flesh to view .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 4]: It was horrible .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 28]: It was bad for the others , of course -- this noise and these exhibitions ; so the doctors tried to give him morphine to quiet him .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 16]: But , in his mind or out of it , he would not take it .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 22]: He said his wife had been killed by that treacherous drug , and he would die before he would take it .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 27]: He suspected that the doctors were concealing it in his ordinary medicines and in his water -- so he ceased from putting either to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 65]: Once , when he had been without water during two sweltering days , he took the dipper in his hand , and the sight of the limpid fluid , and the misery of his thirst , tempted him almost beyond his strength ; but he mastered himself and threw it away , and after that he allowed no more to be brought near him .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 34]: Three times I saw him carried to the death-room , insensible and supposed to be dying ; but each time he revived , cursed his attendants , and demanded to be taken back .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 10]: He lived to be mate of a steamboat again .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 15]: But he was the only one who went to the death-room and returned alive .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 52]: Dr. Peyton , a principal physician , and rich in all the attributes that go to constitute high and flawless character , did all that educated judgment and trained skill could do for Henry ; but , as the newspapers had said in the beginning , his hurts were past help .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 28]: On the evening of the sixth day his wandering mind busied itself with matters far away , and his nerveless fingers ` picked at his coverlet . '
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 15]: His hour had struck ; we bore him to the death-room , poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 15]: Chapter 21 A Section in My Biography IN due course I got my license .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 9]: I was a pilot now , full fledged .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 20]: I dropped into casual employments ; no misfortunes resulting , intermittent work gave place to steady and protracted engagements .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 39]: Time drifted smoothly and prosperously on , and I supposed -- and hoped -- that I was going to follow the river the rest of my days , and die at the wheel when my mission was ended .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 17]: But by and by the war came , commerce was suspended , my occupation was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 7]: I had to seek another livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 86]: So I became a silver miner in Nevada ; next , a newspaper reporter ; next , a gold miner , in California ; next , a reporter in San Francisco ; next , a special correspondent in the Sandwich Islands ; next , a roving correspondent in Europe and the East ; next , an instructional torch-bearer on the lecture platform ; and , finally , I became a scribbler of books , and an immovable fixture among the other rocks of New England .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 28]: In so few words have I disposed of the twenty-one slow-drifting years that have come and gone since I last looked from the windows of a pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 6]: Let us resume , now .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 47]: Chapter 22 I Return to My Muttons AFTER twenty-one years ' absence , I felt a very strong desire to see the river again , and the steamboats , and such of the boys as might be left ; so I resolved to go out there .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 26]: I enlisted a poet for company , and a stenographer to ` take him down , ' and started westward about the middle of April .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 23]: As I proposed to make notes , with a view to printing , I took some thought as to methods of procedure .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 103]: I reflected that if I were recognized , on the river , I should not be as free to go and come , talk , inquire , and spy around , as I should be if unknown ; I remembered that it was the custom of steamboatmen in the old times to load up the confiding stranger with the most picturesque and admirable lies , and put the sophisticated friend off with dull and ineffectual facts : so I concluded , that , from a business point of view , it would be an advantage to disguise our party with fictitious names .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 47]: The idea was certainly good , but it bred infinite bother ; for although Smith , Jones , and Johnson are easy names to remember when there is no occasion to remember them , it is next to impossible to recollect them when they are wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 12]: How do criminals manage to keep a brand-new ALIAS in mind ?
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 6]: This is a great mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 54]: I was innocent ; and yet was seldom able to lay my hand on my new name when it was needed ; and it seemed to me that if I had had a crime on my conscience to further confuse me , I could never have kept the name by me at all .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 12]: We left per Pennsylvania Railroad , at 8 A.M. April 18 .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 3]: ` EVENING .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 4]: Speaking of dress .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 17]: Grace and picturesqueness drop gradually out of it as one travels away from New York . '
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 7]: I find that among my notes .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 15]: It makes no difference which direction you take , the fact remains the same .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 66]: Whether you move north , south , east , or west , no matter : you can get up in the morning and guess how far you have come , by noting what degree of grace and picturesqueness is by that time lacking in the costumes of the new passengers , -- I do not mean of the women alone , but of both sexes .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 67]: It may be that CARRIAGE is at the bottom of this thing ; and I think it is ; for there are plenty of ladies and gentlemen in the provincial cities whose garments are all made by the best tailors and dressmakers of New York ; yet this has no perceptible effect upon the grand fact : the educated eye never mistakes those people for New-Yorkers .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 26]: No , there is a godless grace , and snap , and style about a born and bred New-Yorker which mere clothing can not effect .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 4]: ` APRIL 19 .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 22]: This morning , struck into the region of full goatees -- sometimes accompanied by a mustache , but only occasionally . '
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 34]: It was odd to come upon this thick crop of an obsolete and uncomely fashion ; it was like running suddenly across a forgotten acquaintance whom you had supposed dead for a generation .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 37]: The goatee extends over a wide extent of country ; and is accompanied by an iron-clad belief in Adam and the biblical history of creation , which has not suffered from the assaults of the scientists .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 3]: ` AFTERNOON .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 34]: At the railway stations the loafers carry BOTH hands in their breeches pockets ; it was observable , heretofore , that one hand was sometimes out of doors , -- here , never .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 9]: This is an important fact in geography . '
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 20]: If the loafers determined the character of a country , it would be still more important , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 30]: ` Heretofore , all along , the station-loafer has been often observed to scratch one shin with the other foot ; here , these remains of activity are wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 7]: This has an ominous look . '
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 10]: By and by , we entered the tobacco-chewing region .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 11]: Fifty years ago , the tobacco-chewing region covered the Union .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 6]: It is greatly restricted now .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 7]: Next , boots began to appear .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 7]: Not in strong force , however .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 12]: Later -- away down the Mississippi -- they became the rule .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 30]: They disappeared from other sections of the Union with the mud ; no doubt they will disappear from the river villages , also , when proper pavements come in .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 10]: We reached St. Louis at ten o'clock at night .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 21]: At the counter of the hotel I tendered a hurriedly-invented fictitious name , with a miserable attempt at careless ease .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 45]: The clerk paused , and inspected me in the compassionate way in which one inspects a respectable person who is found in doubtful circumstances ; then he said -- ` It 's all right ; I know what sort of a room you want .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 13]: Used to clerk at the St. James , in New York . '
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 8]: An unpromising beginning for a fraudulent career .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 18]: We started to the supper room , and met two other men whom I had known elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 37]: How odd and unfair it is : wicked impostors go around lecturing under my NOM DE GUERRE and nobody suspects them ; but when an honest man attempts an imposture , he is exposed at once .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 47]: One thing seemed plain : we must start down the river the next day , if people who could not be deceived were going to crop up at this rate : an unpalatable disappointment , for we had hoped to have a week in St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 17]: The Southern was a good hotel , and we could have had a comfortable time there .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 29]: It is large , and well conducted , and its decorations do not make one cry , as do those of the vast Palmer House , in Chicago .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 42]: True , the billiard-tables were of the Old Silurian Period , and the cues and balls of the Post-Pliocene ; but there was refreshment in this , not discomfort ; for there is rest and healing in the contemplation of antiquities .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 17]: The most notable absence observable in the billiard-room , was the absence of the river man .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 16]: If he was there he had taken in his sign , he was in disguise .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 47]: I saw there none of the swell airs and graces , and ostentatious displays of money , and pompous squanderings of it , which used to distinguish the steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in the bygone days , in the thronged billiard-rooms of St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 30]: In those times , the principal saloons were always populous with river men ; given fifty players present , thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from the river .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 18]: But I suspected that the ranks were thin now , and the steamboatmen no longer an aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 33]: Why , in my time they used to call the ` barkeep ' Bill , or Joe , or Tom , and slap him on the shoulder ; I watched for that .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 8]: But none of these people did it .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 16]: Manifestly a glory that once was had dissolved and vanished away in these twenty-one years .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 19]: When I went up to my room , I found there the young man called Rogers , crying .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 54]: Rogers was not his name ; neither was Jones , Brown , Dexter , Ferguson , Bascom , nor Thompson ; but he answered to either of these that a body found handy in an emergency ; or to any other name , in fact , if he perceived that you meant him .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 19]: He said -- ` What is a person to do here when he wants a drink of water ?
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 6]: -- drink this slush ? '
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 9]: ` Ca n't you drink it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 14]: I could if I had some other water to wash it with . '
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 36]: Here was a thing which had not changed ; a score of years had not affected this water 's mulatto complexion in the least ; a score of centuries would succeed no better , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 24]: It comes out of the turbulent , bank-caving Missouri , and every tumblerful of it holds nearly an acre of land in solution .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 11]: I got this fact from the bishop of the diocese .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 45]: If you will let your glass stand half an hour , you can separate the land from the water as easy as Genesis ; and then you will find them both good : the one good to eat , the other good to drink .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 12]: The land is very nourishing , the water is thoroughly wholesome .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 10]: The one appeases hunger ; the other , thirst .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 17]: But the natives do not take them separately , but together , as nature mixed them .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 29]: When they find an inch of mud in the bottom of a glass , they stir it up , and then take the draught as they would gruel .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 25]: It is difficult for a stranger to get used to this batter , but once used to it he will prefer it to water .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 6]: This is really the case .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 23]: It is good for steamboating , and good to drink ; but it is worthless for all other purposes , except baptizing .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 11]: Next morning , we drove around town in the rain .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 7]: The city seemed but little changed .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 51]: It WAS greatly changed , but it did not seem so ; because in St. Louis , as in London and Pittsburgh , you ca n't persuade a new thing to look new ; the coal smoke turns it into an antiquity the moment you take your hand off it .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 44]: The place had just about doubled its size , since I was a resident of it , and was now become a city of 400,000 inhabitants ; still , in the solid business parts , it looked about as it had looked formerly .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 20]: Yet I am sure there is not as much smoke in St. Louis now as there used to be .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 23]: The smoke used to bank itself in a dense billowy black canopy over the town , and hide the sky from view .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 21]: This shelter is very much thinner now ; still , there is a sufficiency of smoke there , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 5]: I heard no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 15]: However , on the outskirts changes were apparent enough ; notably in dwelling-house architecture .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 11]: The fine new homes are noble and beautiful and modern .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 60]: They stand by themselves , too , with green lawns around them ; whereas the dwellings of a former day are packed together in blocks , and are all of one pattern , with windows all alike , set in an arched frame-work of twisted stone ; a sort of house which was handsome enough when it was rarer .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 9]: There was another change -- the Forest Park .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 6]: This was new to me .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 20]: It is beautiful and very extensive , and has the excellent merit of having been made mainly by nature .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 37]: There are other parks , and fine ones , notably Tower Grove and the Botanical Gardens ; for St. Louis interested herself in such improvements at an earlier day than did the most of our cities .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 34]: The first time I ever saw St. Louis , I could have bought it for six million dollars , and it was the mistake of my life that I did not do it .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 44]: It was bitter now to look abroad over this domed and steepled metropolis , this solid expanse of bricks and mortar stretching away on every hand into dim , measure-defying distances , and remember that I had allowed that opportunity to go by .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 36]: Why I should have allowed it to go by seems , of course , foolish and inexplicable to-day , at a first glance ; yet there were reasons at the time to justify this course .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 31]: A Scotchman , Hon. Charles Augustus Murray , writing some forty-five or fifty years ago , said -- ` The streets are narrow , ill paved and ill lighted . '
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 30]: Those streets are narrow still , of course ; many of them are ill paved yet ; but the reproach of ill lighting can not be repeated , now .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 91]: The ` Catholic New Church ' was the only notable building then , and Mr. Murray was confidently called upon to admire it , with its ` species of Grecian portico , surmounted by a kind of steeple , much too diminutive in its proportions , and surmounted by sundry ornaments ' which the unimaginative Scotchman found himself ` quite unable to describe ; ' and therefore was grateful when a German tourist helped him out with the exclamation -- ` By -- , they look exactly like bed-posts ! '
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 36]: St. Louis is well equipped with stately and noble public buildings now , and the little church , which the people used to be so proud of , lost its importance a long time ago .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 28]: Still , this would not surprise Mr. Murray , if he could come back ; for he prophesied the coming greatness of St. Louis with strong confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 49]: The further we drove in our inspection-tour , the more sensibly I realized how the city had grown since I had seen it last ; changes in detail became steadily more apparent and frequent than at first , too : changes uniformly evidencing progress , energy , prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 12]: But the change of changes was on the ` levee . '
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 9]: This time , a departure from the rule .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 17]: Half a dozen sound-asleep steamboats where I used to see a solid mile of wide-awake ones !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 8]: This was melancholy , this was woeful .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 14]: The absence of the pervading and jocund steamboatman from the billiard-saloon was explained .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 9]: He was absent because he is no more .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 31]: His occupation is gone , his power has passed away , he is absorbed into the common herd , he grinds at the mill , a shorn Samson and inconspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 37]: Half a dozen lifeless steamboats , a mile of empty wharves , a negro fatigued with whiskey stretched asleep , in a wide and soundless vacancy , where the serried hosts of commerce used to contend !
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 19]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- Capt. Marryat , writing forty-five years ago says : ` St. Louis has 20,000 inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 21]: THE RIVER ABREAST OF THE TOWN IS CROWDED WITH STEAMBOATS , LYING IN TWO OR THREE TIERS . ' -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 6]: Here was desolation , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 35]: ` The old , old sea , as one in tears , Comes murmuring , with foamy lips , And knocking at the vacant piers , Calls for his long-lost multitude of ships . '
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 17]: The towboat and the railroad had done their work , and done it well and completely .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 20]: The mighty bridge , stretching along over our heads , had done its share in the slaughter and spoliation .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 18]: Remains of former steamboatmen told me , with wan satisfaction , that the bridge does n't pay .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 35]: Still , it can be no sufficient compensation to a corpse , to know that the dynamite that laid him out was not of as good quality as it had been supposed to be .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 25]: The pavements along the river front were bad : the sidewalks were rather out of repair ; there was a rich abundance of mud .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 35]: All this was familiar and satisfying ; but the ancient armies of drays , and struggling throngs of men , and mountains of freight , were gone ; and Sabbath reigned in their stead .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 49]: The immemorial mile of cheap foul doggeries remained , but business was dull with them ; the multitudes of poison-swilling Irishmen had departed , and in their places were a few scattering handfuls of ragged negroes , some drinking , some drunk , some nodding , others asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 21]: St. Louis is a great and prosperous and advancing city ; but the river-edge of it seems dead past resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 32]: Mississippi steamboating was born about 1812 ; at the end of thirty years , it had grown to mighty proportions ; and in less than thirty more , it was dead !
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 10]: A strangely short life for so majestic a creature .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 42]: Of course it is not absolutely dead , neither is a crippled octogenarian who could once jump twenty-two feet on level ground ; but as contrasted with what it was in its prime vigor , Mississippi steamboating may be called dead .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 19]: It killed the old-fashioned keel-boating , by reducing the freight-trip to New Orleans to less than a week .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 61]: The railroads have killed the steamboat passenger traffic by doing in two or three days what the steamboats consumed a week in doing ; and the towing-fleets have killed the through-freight traffic by dragging six or seven steamer-loads of stuff down the river at a time , at an expense so trivial that steamboat competition was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 9]: Freight and passenger way-traffic remains to the steamers .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 59]: This is in the hands -- along the two thousand miles of river between St. Paul and New Orleans -- of two or three close corporations well fortified with capital ; and by able and thoroughly business-like management and system , these make a sufficiency of money out of what is left of the once prodigious steamboating industry .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 23]: I suppose that St. Louis and New Orleans have not suffered materially by the change , but alas for the wood-yard man !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 65]: He used to fringe the river all the way ; his close-ranked merchandise stretched from the one city to the other , along the banks , and he sold uncountable cords of it every year for cash on the nail ; but all the scattering boats that are left burn coal now , and the seldomest spectacle on the Mississippi to-day is a wood-pile .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 8]: Where now is the once wood-yard man ?
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 22]: Chapter 23 Traveling Incognito MY idea was , to tarry a while in every town between St. Louis and New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 20]: To do this , it would be necessary to go from place to place by the short packet lines .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 26]: It was an easy plan to make , and would have been an easy one to follow , twenty years ago -- but not now .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 10]: There are wide intervals between boats , these days .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 22]: I wanted to begin with the interesting old French settlements of St. Genevieve and Kaskaskia , sixty miles below St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 15]: There was only one boat advertised for that section -- a Grand Tower packet .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 16]: Still , one boat was enough ; so we went down to look at her .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 42]: She was a venerable rack-heap , and a fraud to boot ; for she was playing herself for personal property , whereas the good honest dirt was so thickly caked all over her that she was righteously taxable as real estate .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 21]: There are places in New England where her hurricane deck would be worth a hundred and fifty dollars an acre .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 24]: The soil on her forecastle was quite good -- the new crop of wheat was already springing from the cracks in protected places .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 27]: The companionway was of a dry sandy character , and would have been well suited for grapes , with a southern exposure and a little subsoiling .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 18]: The soil of the boiler deck was thin and rocky , but good enough for grazing purposes .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 12]: A colored boy was on watch here -- nobody else visible .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 35]: We gathered from him that this calm craft would go , as advertised , ` if she got her trip ; ' if she did n't get it , she would wait for it .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 10]: ` Has she got any of her trip ? '
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: ` Bless you , no , boss .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 7]: She ai n't unloadened , yit .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 9]: She only come in dis mawnin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 23]: He was uncertain as to when she might get her trip , but thought it might be to-morrow or maybe next day .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 24]: This would not answer at all ; so we had to give up the novelty of sailing down the river on a farm .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 26]: We had one more arrow in our quiver : a Vicksburg packet , the ` Gold Dust , ' was to leave at 5 P.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 24]: We took passage in her for Memphis , and gave up the idea of stopping off here and there , as being impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 9]: She was neat , clean , and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 17]: We camped on the boiler deck , and bought some cheap literature to kill time with .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 45]: The vender was a venerable Irishman with a benevolent face and a tongue that worked easily in the socket , and from him we learned that he had lived in St. Louis thirty-four years and had never been across the river during that period .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 48]: Then he wandered into a very flowing lecture , filled with classic names and allusions , which was quite wonderful for fluency until the fact became rather apparent that this was not the first time , nor perhaps the fiftieth , that the speech had been delivered .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 21]: He was a good deal of a character , and much better company than the sappy literature he was selling .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 26]: A random remark , connecting Irishmen and beer , brought this nugget of information out of him -- They do n't drink it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 8]: They ca n't drink it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 15]: Give an Irishman lager for a month , and he 's a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 13]: An Irishman is lined with copper , and the beer corrodes it .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 15]: But whiskey polishes the copper and is the saving of him , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 14]: At eight o'clock , promptly , we backed out and crossed the river .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 39]: As we crept toward the shore , in the thick darkness , a blinding glory of white electric light burst suddenly from our forecastle , and lit up the water and the warehouses as with a noon-day glare .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 24]: Another big change , this -- no more flickering , smoky , pitch-dripping , ineffectual torch-baskets , now : their day is past .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 73]: Next , instead of calling out a score of hands to man the stage , a couple of men and a hatful of steam lowered it from the derrick where it was suspended , launched it , deposited it in just the right spot , and the whole thing was over and done with before a mate in the olden time could have got his profanity-mill adjusted to begin the preparatory services .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 39]: Why this new and simple method of handling the stages was not thought of when the first steamboat was built , is a mystery which helps one to realize what a dull-witted slug the average human being is .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 75]: We finally got away at two in the morning , and when I turned out at six , we were rounding to at a rocky point where there was an old stone warehouse -- at any rate , the ruins of it ; two or three decayed dwelling-houses were near by , in the shelter of the leafy hills ; but there were no evidences of human or other animal life to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 47]: I wondered if I had forgotten the river ; for I had no recollection whatever of this place ; the shape of the river , too , was unfamiliar ; there was nothing in sight , anywhere , that I could remember ever having seen before .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 9]: I was surprised , disappointed , and annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 23]: We put ashore a well-dressed lady and gentleman , and two well-dressed , lady-like young girls , together with sundry Russia-leather bags .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 7]: A strange place for such folk !
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 5]: No carriage was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 21]: The party moved off as if they had not expected any , and struck down a winding country road afoot .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 43]: But the mystery was explained when we got under way again ; for these people were evidently bound for a large town which lay shut in behind a tow-head -LRB- i.e. , new island -RRB- a couple of miles below this landing .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 19]: I could n't remember that town ; I could n't place it , could n't call its name .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 8]: So I lost part of my temper .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 16]: I suspected that it might be St. Genevieve -- and so it proved to be .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 45]: Observe what this eccentric river had been about : it had built up this huge useless tow-head directly in front of this town , cut off its river communications , fenced it away completely , and made a ` country ' town of it .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 15]: It is a fine old place , too , and deserved a better fate .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 39]: It was settled by the French , and is a relic of a time when one could travel from the mouths of the Mississippi to Quebec and be on French territory and under French rule all the way .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 16]: Presently I ascended to the hurricane deck and cast a longing glance toward the pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 36]: Chapter 24 My Incognito is Exploded AFTER a close study of the face of the pilot on watch , I was satisfied that I had never seen him before ; so I went up there .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 10]: The pilot inspected me ; I re-inspected the pilot .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 24]: These customary preliminaries over , I sat down on the high bench , and he faced about and went on with his work .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 22]: Every detail of the pilot-house was familiar to me , with one exception , -- a large-mouthed tube under the breast-board .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 19]: I puzzled over that thing a considerable time ; then gave up and asked what it was for .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 8]: ` To hear the engine-bells through . '
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 16]: It was another good contrivance which ought to have been invented half a century sooner .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 21]: So I was thinking , when the pilot asked -- ` Do you know what this rope is for ? '
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 12]: I managed to get around this question , without committing myself .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 14]: ` Is this the first time you were ever in a pilot-house ? '
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 6]: I crept under that one .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 7]: ` Where are you from ? '
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 5]: ` New England . '
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 10]: ` First time you have ever been West ? '
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 6]: I climbed over this one .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 22]: ` If you take an interest in such things , I can tell you what all these things are for . '
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 7]: I said I should like it .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 74]: ` This , ' putting his hand on a backing-bell rope , ` is to sound the fire-alarm ; this , ' putting his hand on a go-ahead bell , ` is to call the texas-tender ; this one , ' indicating the whistle-lever , ` is to call the captain ' -- and so he went on , touching one object after another , and reeling off his tranquil spool of lies .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 10]: I had never felt so like a passenger before .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: I thanked him , with emotion , for each new fact , and wrote it down in my note-book .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 19]: The pilot warmed to his opportunity , and proceeded to load me up in the good old-fashioned way .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 27]: At times I was afraid he was going to rupture his invention ; but it always stood the strain , and he pulled through all right .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 31]: He drifted , by easy stages , into revealments of the river 's marvelous eccentricities of one sort and another , and backed them up with some pretty gigantic illustrations .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 17]: For instance -- ` Do you see that little boulder sticking out of the water yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 27]: well , when I first came on the river , that was a solid ridge of rock , over sixty feet high and two miles long .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 7]: All washed away but that . '
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 7]: -LSB- This with a sigh . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 29]: I had a mighty impulse to destroy him , but it seemed to me that killing , in any ordinary way , would be too good for him .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 56]: Once , when an odd-looking craft , with a vast coal-scuttle slanting aloft on the end of a beam , was steaming by in the distance , he indifferently drew attention to it , as one might to an object grown wearisome through familiarity , and observed that it was an ` alligator boat . '
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 5]: ` An alligator boat ?
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 6]: What 's it for ? '
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: ` To dredge out alligators with . '
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 11]: ` Are they so thick as to be troublesome ? '
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 13]: ` Well , not now , because the Government keeps them down .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 6]: But they used to be .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 37]: Not everywhere ; but in favorite places , here and there , where the river is wide and shoal-like Plum Point , and Stack Island , and so on -- places they call alligator beds . '
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 8]: ` Did they actually impede navigation ? '
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 29]: ` Years ago , yes , in very low water ; there was hardly a trip , then , that we did n't get aground on alligators . '
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 15]: It seemed to me that I should certainly have to get out my tomahawk .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 16]: However , I restrained myself and said -- ` It must have been dreadful . '
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 13]: ` Yes , it was one of the main difficulties about piloting .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 27]: It was so hard to tell anything about the water ; the damned things shift around so -- never lie still five minutes at a time .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 44]: You can tell a wind-reef , straight off , by the look of it ; you can tell a break ; you can tell a sand-reef -- that 's all easy ; but an alligator reef does n't show up , worth anything .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 43]: Nine times in ten you ca n't tell where the water is ; and when you do see where it is , like as not it ai n't there when YOU get there , the devils have swapped around so , meantime .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 52]: Of course there were some few pilots that could judge of alligator water nearly as well as they could of any other kind , but they had to have natural talent for it ; it was n't a thing a body could learn , you had to be born with it .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 51]: Let me see : there was Ben Thornburg , and Beck Jolly , and Squire Bell , and Horace Bixby , and Major Downing , and John Stevenson , and Billy Gordon , and Jim Brady , and George Ealer , and Billy Youngblood -- all A 1 alligator pilots .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 14]: THEY could tell alligator water as far as another Christian could tell whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 3]: Read it ?
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 9]: -- Ah , COULD N'T they , though !
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 21]: I only wish I had as many dollars as they could read alligator water a mile and a half off .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 12]: Yes , and it paid them to do it , too .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 13]: A good alligator pilot could always get fifteen hundred dollars a month .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 29]: Nights , other people had to lay up for alligators , but those fellows never laid up for alligators ; they never laid up for anything but fog .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 79]: They could SMELL the best alligator water it was said ; I do n't know whether it was so or not , and I think a body 's got his hands full enough if he sticks to just what he knows himself , without going around backing up other people 's say-so 's , though there 's a plenty that ai n't backward about doing it , as long as they can roust out something wonderful to tell .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 20]: Which is not the style of Robert Styles , by as much as three fathom -- maybe quarter-LESS . '
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 3]: -LSB- My !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 5]: Was this Rob Styles ?
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 7]: -- This mustached and stately figure ?
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 10]: - A slim enough cub , in my time .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 20]: How he has improved in comeliness in five-and-twenty year and in the noble art of inflating his facts . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 34]: After these musings , I said aloud -- ' I should think that dredging out the alligators would n't have done much good , because they could come back again right away . '
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 21]: ` If you had had as much experience of alligators as I have , you would n't talk like that .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 10]: You dredge an alligator once and he 's CONVINCED .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 9]: It 's the last you hear of HIM .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 8]: He would n't come back for pie .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 20]: If there 's one thing that an alligator is more down on than another , it 's being dredged .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 47]: Besides , they were not simply shoved out of the way ; the most of the scoopful were scooped aboard ; they emptied them into the hold ; and when they had got a trip , they took them to Orleans to the Government works . '
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 5]: ` What for ? '
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 11]: ` Why , to make soldier-shoes out of their hides .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 10]: All the Government shoes are made of alligator hide .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 9]: It makes the best shoes in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 12]: They last five years , and they wo n't absorb water .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 8]: The alligator fishery is a Government monopoly .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 12]: All the alligators are Government property -- just like the live-oaks .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 38]: You cut down a live-oak , and Government fines you fifty dollars ; you kill an alligator , and up you go for misprision of treason -- lucky duck if they do n't hang you , too .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 10]: And they will , if you 're a Democrat .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 37]: The buzzard is the sacred bird of the South , and you ca n't touch him ; the alligator is the sacred bird of the Government , and you 've got to let him alone . '
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 12]: ` Do you ever get aground on the alligators now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 5]: ` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 8]: it has n't happened for years . '
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 17]: ` Well , then , why do they still keep the alligator boats in service ? '
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 9]: ` Just for police duty -- nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 10]: They merely go up and down now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 32]: The present generation of alligators know them as easy as a burglar knows a roundsman ; when they see one coming , they break camp and go for the woods . '
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 93]: After rounding-out and finishing-up and polishing-off the alligator business , he dropped easily and comfortably into the historical vein , and told of some tremendous feats of half-a-dozen old-time steamboats of his acquaintance , dwelling at special length upon a certain extraordinary performance of his chief favorite among this distinguished fleet -- and then adding -- ` That boat was the `` Cyclone , '' -- last trip she ever made -- she sunk , that very trip -- captain was Tom Ballou , the most immortal liar that ever I struck .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 16]: He could n't ever seem to tell the truth , in any kind of weather .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 9]: Why , he would make you fairly shudder .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 7]: He WAS the most scandalous liar !
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 12]: I left him , finally ; I could n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 39]: The proverb says , `` like master , like man ; '' and if you stay with that kind of a man , you 'll come under suspicion by and by , just as sure as you live .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 19]: He paid first-class wages ; but said I , What 's wages when your reputation 's in danger ?
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 13]: So I let the wages go , and froze to my reputation .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 7]: And I 've never regretted it .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 9]: Reputation 's worth everything , ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 9]: That 's the way I look at it .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 29]: He had more selfish organs than any seven men in the world -- all packed in the stern-sheets of his skull , of course , where they belonged .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 20]: They weighed down the back of his head so that it made his nose tilt up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 15]: People thought it was vanity , but it was n't , it was malice .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 32]: If you only saw his foot , you 'd take him to be nineteen feet high , but he was n't ; it was because his foot was out of drawing .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 33]: He was intended to be nineteen feet high , no doubt , if his foot was made first , but he did n't get there ; he was only five feet ten .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 13]: That 's what he was , and that 's what he is .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 32]: You take the lies out of him , and he 'll shrink to the size of your hat ; you take the malice out of him , and he 'll disappear .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 22]: That `` Cyclone '' was a rattler to go , and the sweetest thing to steer that ever walked the waters .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 23]: Set her amidships , in a big river , and just let her go ; it was all you had to do .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 16]: She would hold herself on a star all night , if you let her alone .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 8]: You could n't ever feel her rudder .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 23]: It was n't any more labor to steer her than it is to count the Republican vote in a South Carolina election .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 47]: One morning , just at daybreak , the last trip she ever made , they took her rudder aboard to mend it ; I did n't know anything about it ; I backed her out from the wood-yard and went a-weaving down the river all serene .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 22]: When I had gone about twenty-three miles , and made four horribly crooked crossings -- ' ` Without any rudder ? '
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 31]: ` Yes -- old Capt. Tom appeared on the roof and began to find fault with me for running such a dark night -- ' ` Such a DARK NIGHT ?
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 53]: -- Why , you said -- ' ` Never mind what I said , -- 't was as dark as Egypt now , though pretty soon the moon began to rise , and -- ' ` You mean the SUN -- because you started out just at break of -- look here !
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 28]: Was this BEFORE you quitted the captain on account of his lying , or -- ' ` It was before -- oh , a long time before .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 27]: And as I was saying , he -- ' ` But was this the trip she sunk , or was -- ' ` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 4]: -- months afterward .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 41]: And so the old man , he -- ' ` Then she made TWO last trips , because you said -- ' He stepped back from the wheel , swabbing away his perspiration , and said -- ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 25]: -LRB- calling me by name -RRB- , ` YOU take her and lie a while -- you 're handier at it than I am .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 11]: Trying to play yourself for a stranger and an innocent !
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 28]: -- why , I knew you before you had spoken seven words ; and I made up my mind to find out what was your little game .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 7]: It was to DRAW ME OUT .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 10]: Well , I let you , did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 26]: Now take the wheel and finish the watch ; and next time play fair , and you wo n't have to work your passage . '
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 6]: Thus ended the fictitious-name business .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 9]: And not six hours out from St. Louis !
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 27]: but I had gained a privilege , any way , for I had been itching to get my hands on the wheel , from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 27]: I seemed to have forgotten the river , but I had n't forgotten how to steer a steamboat , nor how to enjoy it , either .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 24]: Chapter 25 From Cairo to Hickman THE scenery , from St. Louis to Cairo -- two hundred miles -- is varied and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 26]: The hills were clothed in the fresh foliage of spring now , and were a gracious and worthy setting for the broad river flowing between .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 29]: Our trip began auspiciously , with a perfect day , as to breeze and sunshine , and our boat threw the miles out behind her with satisfactory despatch .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 23]: We found a railway intruding at Chester , Illinois ; Chester has also a penitentiary now , and is otherwise marching on .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 17]: At Grand Tower , too , there was a railway ; and another at Cape Girardeau .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 53]: The former town gets its name from a huge , squat pillar of rock , which stands up out of the water on the Missouri side of the river -- a piece of nature 's fanciful handiwork -- and is one of the most picturesque features of the scenery of that region .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 84]: For nearer or remoter neighbors , the Tower has the Devil 's Bake Oven -- so called , perhaps , because it does not powerfully resemble anybody else 's bake oven ; and the Devil 's Tea Table -- this latter a great smooth-surfaced mass of rock , with diminishing wine-glass stem , perched some fifty or sixty feet above the river , beside a beflowered and garlanded precipice , and sufficiently like a tea-table to answer for anybody , Devil or Christian .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 32]: Away down the river we have the Devil 's Elbow and the Devil 's Race-course , and lots of other property of his which I can not now call to mind .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 38]: The Town of Grand Tower was evidently a busier place than it had been in old times , but it seemed to need some repairs here and there , and a new coat of whitewash all over .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 15]: Still , it was pleasant to me to see the old coat once more .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 28]: ` Uncle ' Mumford , our second officer , said the place had been suffering from high water , and consequently was not looking its best now .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 80]: But he said it was not strange that it did n't waste white-wash on itself , for more lime was made there , and of a better quality , than anywhere in the West ; and added -- ` On a dairy farm you never can get any milk for your coffee , nor any sugar for it on a sugar plantation ; and it is against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for white-wash . '
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 51]: In my own experience I knew the first two items to be true ; and also that people who sell candy do n't care for candy ; therefore there was plausibility in Uncle Mumford 's final observation that ` people who make lime run more to religion than whitewash . '
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 19]: Uncle Mumford said , further , that Grand Tower was a great coaling center and a prospering place .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 14]: Cape Girardeau is situated on a hillside , and makes a handsome appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 18]: There is a great Jesuit school for boys at the foot of the town by the river .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 18]: Uncle Mumford said it had as high a reputation for thoroughness as any similar institution in Missouri !
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 35]: There was another college higher up on an airy summit -- a bright new edifice , picturesquely and peculiarly towered and pinnacled -- a sort of gigantic casters , with the cruets all complete .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 35]: Uncle Mumford said that Cape Girardeau was the Athens of Missouri , and contained several colleges besides those already mentioned ; and all of them on a religious basis of one kind or another .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 48]: He directed my attention to what he called the ` strong and pervasive religious look of the town , ' but I could not see that it looked more religious than the other hill towns with the same slope and built of the same kind of bricks .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 10]: Partialities often make people see more than really exists .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 12]: Uncle Mumford has been thirty years a mate on the river .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 77]: He is a man of practical sense and a level head ; has observed ; has had much experience of one sort and another ; has opinions ; has , also , just a perceptible dash of poetry in his composition , an easy gift of speech , a thick growl in his voice , and an oath or two where he can get at them when the exigencies of his office require a spiritual lift .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 47]: He is a mate of the blessed old-time kind ; and goes gravely damning around , when there is work to the fore , in a way to mellow the ex-steamboatman 's heart with sweet soft longings for the vanished days that shall come no more .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 6]: ` GIT up there you !
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 6]: Going to be all day ?
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 18]: Why d' n't you SAY you was petrified in your hind legs , before you shipped ! '
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 26]: He is a steady man with his crew ; kind and just , but firm ; so they like him , and stay with him .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 62]: He is still in the slouchy garb of the old generation of mates ; but next trip the Anchor Line will have him in uniform -- a natty blue naval uniform , with brass buttons , along with all the officers of the line -- and then he will be a totally different style of scenery from what he is now .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 5]: Uniforms on the Mississippi !
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 12]: It beats all the other changes put together , for surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 16]: Still , there is another surprise -- that it was not made fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 19]: It is so manifestly sensible , that it might have been thought of earlier , one would suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 42]: During fifty years , out there , the innocent passenger in need of help and information , has been mistaking the mate for the cook , and the captain for the barber -- and being roughly entertained for it , too .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 7]: But his troubles are ended now .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 19]: And the greatly improved aspect of the boat 's staff is another advantage achieved by the dress-reform period .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 8]: Steered down the bend below Cape Girardeau .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 46]: They used to call it ` Steersman 's Bend ; ' plain sailing and plenty of water in it , always ; about the only place in the Upper River that a new cub was allowed to take a boat through , in low water .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 31]: Thebes , at the head of the Grand Chain , and Commerce at the foot of it , were towns easily rememberable , as they had not undergone conspicuous alteration .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 31]: Nor the Chain , either -- in the nature of things ; for it is a chain of sunken rocks admirably arranged to capture and kill steamboats on bad nights .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 47]: A good many steamboat corpses lie buried there , out of sight ; among the rest my first friend the ` Paul Jones ; ' she knocked her bottom out , and went down like a pot , so the historian told me -- Uncle Mumford .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 13]: He said she had a gray mare aboard , and a preacher .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 43]: To me , this sufficiently accounted for the disaster ; as it did , of course , to Mumford , who added -- ` But there are many ignorant people who would scoff at such a matter , and call it superstition .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 21]: But you will always notice that they are people who have never traveled with a gray mare and a preacher .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 10]: I went down the river once in such company .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 87]: We grounded at Bloody Island ; we grounded at Hanging Dog ; we grounded just below this same Commerce ; we jolted Beaver Dam Rock ; we hit one of the worst breaks in the ` Graveyard ' behind Goose Island ; we had a roustabout killed in a fight ; we burnt a boiler ; broke a shaft ; collapsed a flue ; and went into Cairo with nine feet of water in the hold -- may have been more , may have been less .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 9]: I remember it as if it were yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 8]: The men lost their heads with terror .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 26]: They painted the mare blue , in sight of town , and threw the preacher overboard , or we should not have arrived at all .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 8]: The preacher was fished out and saved .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 12]: He acknowledged , himself , that he had been to blame .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 12]: I remember it all , as if it were yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 41]: That this combination -- of preacher and gray mare -- should breed calamity , seems strange , and at first glance unbelievable ; but the fact is fortified by so much unassailable proof that to doubt is to dishonor reason .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 83]: I myself remember a case where a captain was warned by numerous friends against taking a gray mare and a preacher with him , but persisted in his purpose in spite of all that could be said ; and the same day -- it may have been the next , and some say it was , though I think it was the same day -- he got drunk and fell down the hatchway , and was borne to his home a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 5]: This is literally true .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 17]: No vestige of Hat Island is left now ; every shred of it is washed away .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 27]: I do not even remember what part of the river it used to be in , except that it was between St. Louis and Cairo somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 17]: It was a bad region -- all around and about Hat Island , in early days .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 26]: A farmer who lived on the Illinois shore there , said that twenty-nine steamboats had left their bones strung along within sight from his house .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 21]: Between St. Louis and Cairo the steamboat wrecks average one to the mile ; -- two hundred wrecks , altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 9]: I could recognize big changes from Commerce down .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 38]: Beaver Dam Rock was out in the middle of the river now , and throwing a prodigious ` break ; ' it used to be close to the shore , and boats went down outside of it .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 29]: A big island that used to be away out in mid-river , has retired to the Missouri shore , and boats do not go near it any more .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 20]: The island called Jacket Pattern is whittled down to a wedge now , and is booked for early destruction .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 15]: Goose Island is all gone but a little dab the size of a steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 35]: The perilous ` Graveyard , ' among whose numberless wrecks we used to pick our way so slowly and gingerly , is far away from the channel now , and a terror to nobody .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 92]: One of the islands formerly called the Two Sisters is gone entirely ; the other , which used to lie close to the Illinois shore , is now on the Missouri side , a mile away ; it is joined solidly to the shore , and it takes a sharp eye to see where the seam is -- but it is Illinois ground yet , and the people who live on it have to ferry themselves over and work the Illinois roads and pay Illinois taxes : singular state of things !
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 14]: Near the mouth of the river several islands were missing -- washed away .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 34]: Cairo was still there -- easily visible across the long , flat point upon whose further verge it stands ; but we had to steam a long way around to get to it .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 21]: Night fell as we were going out of the ` Upper River ' and meeting the floods of the Ohio .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 65]: We dashed along without anxiety ; for the hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has moved up stream a long distance out of the channel ; or rather , about one county has gone into the river from the Missouri point , and the Cairo point has ` made down ' and added to its long tongue of territory correspondingly .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 31]: The Mississippi is a just and equitable river ; it never tumbles one man 's farm overboard without building a new farm just like it for that man 's neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 6]: This keeps down hard feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 25]: Going into Cairo , we came near killing a steamboat which paid no attention to our whistle and then tried to cross our bows .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 24]: By doing some strong backing , we saved him ; which was a great loss , for he would have made good literature .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 38]: Cairo is a brisk town now ; and is substantially built , and has a city look about it which is in noticeable contrast to its former estate , as per Mr. Dickens 's portrait of it .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 31]: However , it was already building with bricks when I had seen it last -- which was when Colonel -LRB- now General -RRB- Grant was drilling his first command there .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 22]: Uncle Mumford says the libraries and Sunday-schools have done a good work in Cairo , as well as the brick masons .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 31]: Cairo has a heavy railroad and river trade , and her situation at the junction of the two great rivers is so advantageous that she can not well help prospering .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 31]: When I turned out , in the morning , we had passed Columbus , Kentucky , and were approaching Hickman , a pretty town , perched on a handsome hill .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 89]: Hickman is in a rich tobacco region , and formerly enjoyed a great and lucrative trade in that staple , collecting it there in her warehouses from a large area of country and shipping it by boat ; but Uncle Mumford says she built a railway to facilitate this commerce a little more , and he thinks it facilitated it the wrong way -- took the bulk of the trade out of her hands by ` collaring it along the line without gathering it at her doors . '
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 30]: Chapter 26 Under Fire TALK began to run upon the war now , for we were getting down into the upper edge of the former battle-stretch by this time .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 20]: Columbus was just behind us , so there was a good deal said about the famous battle of Belmont .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 15]: Several of the boat 's officers had seen active service in the Mississippi war-fleet .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 39]: I gathered that they found themselves sadly out of their element in that kind of business at first , but afterward got accustomed to it , reconciled to it , and more or less at home in it .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 25]: One of our pilots had his first war experience in the Belmont fight , as a pilot on a boat in the Confederate service .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 88]: I had often had a curiosity to know how a green hand might feel , in his maiden battle , perched all solitary and alone on high in a pilot house , a target for Tom , Dick and Harry , and nobody at his elbow to shame him from showing the white feather when matters grew hot and perilous around him ; so , to me his story was valuable -- it filled a gap for me which all histories had left till that time empty .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 15]: THE PILOT 'S FIRST BATTLE He said -- It was the 7th of November .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 9]: The fight began at seven in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 11]: I was on the ` R. H. W. Hill . '
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 9]: Took over a load of troops from Columbus .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 11]: Came back , and took over a battery of artillery .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 17]: My partner said he was going to see the fight ; wanted me to go along .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 19]: I said , no , I was n't anxious , I would look at it from the pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 10]: He said I was a coward , and left .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 7]: That fight was an awful sight .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 29]: General Cheatham made his men strip their coats off and throw them in a pile , and said , ` Now follow me to hell or victory ! '
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 22]: I heard him say that from the pilot-house ; and then he galloped in , at the head of his troops .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 29]: Old General Pillow , with his white hair , mounted on a white horse , sailed in , too , leading his troops as lively as a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 15]: By and by the Federals chased the rebels back , and here they came !
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 12]: tearing along , everybody for himself and Devil take the hindmost !
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 12]: and down under the bank they scrambled , and took shelter .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 13]: I was sitting with my legs hanging out of the pilot-house window .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 12]: All at once I noticed a whizzing sound passing my ear .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 6]: Judged it was a bullet .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 24]: I did n't stop to think about anything , I just tilted over backwards and landed on the floor , and staid there .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 6]: The balls came booming around .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 25]: Three cannon-balls went through the chimney ; one ball took off the corner of the pilot-house ; shells were screaming and bursting all around .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 11]: Mighty warm times -- I wished I had n't come .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 16]: I lay there on the pilot-house floor , while the shots came faster and faster .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 15]: I crept in behind the big stove , in the middle of the pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 19]: Presently a minie-ball came through the stove , and just grazed my head , and cut my hat .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 11]: I judged it was time to go away from there .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 17]: The captain was on the roof with a red-headed major from Memphis -- a fine-looking man .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 18]: I heard him say he wanted to leave here , but ` that pilot is killed . '
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 45]: I crept over to the starboard side to pull the bell to set her back ; raised up and took a look , and I saw about fifteen shot holes through the window panes ; had come so lively I had n't noticed them .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 16]: I glanced out on the water , and the spattering shot were like a hailstorm .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 10]: I thought best to get out of that place .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 34]: I went down the pilot-house guy , head first -- not feet first but head first -- slid down -- before I struck the deck , the captain said we must leave there .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 13]: So I climbed up the guy and got on the floor again .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 20]: About that time , they collared my partner and were bringing him up to the pilot-house between two soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 7]: Somebody had said I was killed .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 17]: He put his head in and saw me on the floor reaching for the backing bells .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 31]: He said , ` Oh , hell , he ai n't shot , ' and jerked away from the men who had him by the collar , and ran below .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 17]: We were there until three o'clock in the afternoon , and then got away all right .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 26]: The next time I saw my partner , I said , ` Now , come out , be honest , and tell me the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 13]: Where did you go when you went to see that battle ? '
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 12]: He says , ' I went down in the hold . '
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 11]: All through that fight I was scared nearly to death .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 20]: I hardly knew anything , I was so frightened ; but you see , nobody knew that but me .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 18]: Next day General Polk sent for me , and praised me for my bravery and gallant conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 12]: I never said anything , I let it go at that .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 19]: I judged it was n't so , but it was not for me to contradict a general officer .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 22]: Pretty soon after that I was sick , and used up , and had to go off to the Hot Springs .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 19]: When there , I got a good many letters from commanders saying they wanted me to come back .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 26]: I declined , because I was n't well enough or strong enough ; but I kept still , and kept the reputation I had made .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 38]: A plain story , straightforwardly told ; but Mumford told me that that pilot had ` gilded that scare of his , in spots ; ' that his subsequent career in the war was proof of it .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 35]: We struck down through the chute of Island No. 8 , and I went below and fell into conversation with a passenger , a handsome man , with easy carriage and an intelligent face .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 15]: We were approaching Island No. 10 , a place so celebrated during the war .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 13]: This gentleman 's home was on the main shore in its neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 49]: I had some talk with him about the war times ; but presently the discourse fell upon ` feuds , ' for in no part of the South has the vendetta flourished more briskly , or held out longer between warring families , than in this particular region .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 33]: This gentleman said -- ` There 's been more than one feud around here , in old times , but I reckon the worst one was between the Darnells and the Watsons .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 43]: Nobody do n't know now what the first quarrel was about , it 's so long ago ; the Darnells and the Watsons do n't know , if there 's any of them living , which I do n't think there is .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 39]: Some says it was about a horse or a cow -- anyway , it was a little matter ; the money in it was n't of no consequence -- none in the world -- both families was rich .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 19]: The thing could have been fixed up , easy enough ; but no , that would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 19]: Rough words had been passed ; and so , nothing but blood could fix it up after that .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 17]: That horse or cow , whichever it was , cost sixty years of killing and crippling !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 36]: Every year or so somebody was shot , on one side or the other ; and as fast as one generation was laid out , their sons took up the feud and kept it a-going .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 48]: And it 's just as I say ; they went on shooting each other , year in and year out -- making a kind of a religion of it , you see -- till they 'd done forgot , long ago , what it was all about .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 37]: Wherever a Darnell caught a Watson , or a Watson caught a Darnell , one of 'em was going to get hurt -- only question was , which of them got the drop on the other .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 15]: They 'd shoot one another down , right in the presence of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 20]: They did n't hunt for each other , but when they happened to meet , they puffed and begun .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 10]: Men would shoot boys , boys would shoot men .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 24]: A man shot a boy twelve years old -- happened on him in the woods , and did n't give him no chance .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 20]: If he HAD ` a ' given him a chance , the boy 'd ` a ' shot him .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 35]: Both families belonged to the same church -LRB- everybody around here is religious -RRB- ; through all this fifty or sixty years ' fuss , both tribes was there every Sunday , to worship .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 18]: They lived each side of the line , and the church was at a landing called Compromise .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 17]: Half the church and half the aisle was in Kentucky , the other half in Tennessee .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 108]: Sundays you 'd see the families drive up , all in their Sunday clothes , men , women , and children , and file up the aisle , and set down , quiet and orderly , one lot on the Tennessee side of the church and the other on the Kentucky side ; and the men and boys would lean their guns up against the wall , handy , and then all hands would join in with the prayer and praise ; though they say the man next the aisle did n't kneel down , along with the rest of the family ; kind of stood guard .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 26]: I do n't know ; never was at that church in my life ; but I remember that that 's what used to be said .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 23]: ` Twenty or twenty-five years ago , one of the feud families caught a young man of nineteen out and killed him .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 48]: Do n't remember whether it was the Darnells and Watsons , or one of the other feuds ; but anyway , this young man rode up -- steamboat laying there at the time -- and the first thing he saw was a whole gang of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 35]: He jumped down behind a wood-pile , but they rode around and begun on him , he firing back , and they galloping and cavorting and yelling and banging away with all their might .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 50]: Think he wounded a couple of them ; but they closed in on him and chased him into the river ; and as he swum along down stream , they followed along the bank and kept on shooting at him ; and when he struck shore he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 7]: Windy Marshall told me about it .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 4]: He saw it .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 7]: He was captain of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 25]: ` Years ago , the Darnells was so thinned out that the old man and his two sons concluded they 'd leave the country .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 39]: They started to take steamboat just above No. 10 ; but the Watsons got wind of it ; and they arrived just as the two young Darnells was walking up the companion-way with their wives on their arms .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 17]: The fight begun then , and they never got no further -- both of them killed .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 28]: After that , old Darnell got into trouble with the man that run the ferry , and the ferry-man got the worst of it -- and died .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 21]: But his friends shot old Darnell through and through -- filled him full of bullets , and ended him . '
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 28]: The country gentleman who told me these things had been reared in ease and comfort , was a man of good parts , and was college bred .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 13]: His loose grammar was the fruit of careless habit , not ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 45]: This habit among educated men in the West is not universal , but it is prevalent -- prevalent in the towns , certainly , if not in the cities ; and to a degree which one can not help noticing , and marveling at .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 31]: I heard a Westerner who would be accounted a highly educated man in any country , say ` never mind , it DO N'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE , anyway . '
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 17]: A life-long resident who was present heard it , but it made no impression upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 90]: She was able to recall the fact afterward , when reminded of it ; but she confessed that the words had not grated upon her ear at the time -- a confession which suggests that if educated people can hear such blasphemous grammar , from such a source , and be unconscious of the deed , the crime must be tolerably common -- so common that the general ear has become dulled by familiarity with it , and is no longer alert , no longer sensitive to such affronts .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 76]: No one in the world speaks blemishless grammar ; no one has ever written it -- NO one , either in the world or out of it -LRB- taking the Scriptures for evidence on the latter point -RRB- ; therefore it would not be fair to exact grammatical perfection from the peoples of the Valley ; but they and all other peoples may justly be required to refrain from KNOWINGLY and PURPOSELY debauching their grammar .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 11]: I found the river greatly changed at Island No. 10 .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 39]: The island which I remembered was some three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide , heavily timbered , and lay near the Kentucky shore -- within two hundred yards of it , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 14]: Now , however , one had to hunt for it with a spy-glass .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 34]: Nothing was left of it but an insignificant little tuft , and this was no longer near the Kentucky shore ; it was clear over against the opposite shore , a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 30]: In war times the island had been an important place , for it commanded the situation ; and , being heavily fortified , there was no getting by it .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 49]: It lay between the upper and lower divisions of the Union forces , and kept them separate , until a junction was finally effected across the Missouri neck of land ; but the island being itself joined to that neck now , the wide river is without obstruction .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 26]: In this region the river passes from Kentucky into Tennessee , back into Missouri , then back into Kentucky , and thence into Tennessee again .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 12]: So a mile or two of Missouri sticks over into Tennessee .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 20]: The town of New Madrid was looking very unwell ; but otherwise unchanged from its former condition and aspect .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 22]: Its blocks of frame-houses were still grouped in the same old flat plain , and environed by the same old forests .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 17]: It was as tranquil as formerly , and apparently had neither grown nor diminished in size .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 16]: It was said that the recent high water had invaded it and damaged its looks .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 34]: This was surprising news ; for in low water the river bank is very high there -LRB- fifty feet -RRB- , and in my day an overflow had always been considered an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 27]: This present flood of 1882 Will doubtless be celebrated in the river 's history for several generations before a deluge of like magnitude shall be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 55]: It put all the unprotected low lands under water , from Cairo to the mouth ; it broke down the levees in a great many places , on both sides of the river ; and in some regions south , when the flood was at its highest , the Mississippi was SEVENTY MILES wide !
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 15]: a number of lives were lost , and the destruction of property was fearful .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 57]: The crops were destroyed , houses washed away , and shelterless men and cattle forced to take refuge on scattering elevations here and there in field and forest , and wait in peril and suffering until the boats put in commission by the national and local governments and by newspaper enterprise could come and rescue them .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 30]: The properties of multitudes of people were under water for months , and the poorer ones must have starved by the hundred if succor had not been promptly afforded .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 53]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- For a detailed and interesting description of the great flood , written on board of the New Orleans TIMES-DEMOCRAT 'S relief-boat , see Appendix A -RSB- -RCB- The water had been falling during a considerable time now , yet as a rule we found the banks still under water .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 13]: Chapter 27 Some Imported Articles WE met two steamboats at New Madrid .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 7]: Two steamboats in sight at once !
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 9]: an infrequent spectacle now in the lonesome Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 14]: The loneliness of this solemn , stupendous flood is impressive -- and depressing .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 120]: League after league , and still league after league , it pours its chocolate tide along , between its solid forest walls , its almost untenanted shores , with seldom a sail or a moving object of any kind to disturb the surface and break the monotony of the blank , watery solitude ; and so the day goes , the night comes , and again the day -- and still the same , night after night and day after day -- majestic , unchanging sameness of serenity , repose , tranquillity , lethargy , vacancy -- symbol of eternity , realization of the heaven pictured by priest and prophet , and longed for by the good and thoughtless !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 49]: Immediately after the war of 1812 , tourists began to come to America , from England ; scattering ones at first , then a sort of procession of them -- a procession which kept up its plodding , patient march through the land during many , many years .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 37]: Each tourist took notes , and went home and published a book -- a book which was usually calm , truthful , reasonable , kind ; but which seemed just the reverse to our tender-footed progenitors .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 34]: A glance at these tourist-books shows us that in certain of its aspects the Mississippi has undergone no change since those strangers visited it , but remains to-day about as it was then .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 56]: The emotions produced in those foreign breasts by these aspects were not all formed on one pattern , of course ; they HAD to be various , along at first , because the earlier tourists were obliged to originate their emotions , whereas in older countries one can always borrow emotions from one 's predecessors .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 32]: And , mind you , emotions are among the toughest things in the world to manufacture out of whole cloth ; it is easier to manufacture seven facts than one emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 4]: Captain Basil Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 64]: R.N. , writing fifty-five years ago , says -- ` Here I caught the first glimpse of the object I had so long wished to behold , and felt myself amply repaid at that moment for all the trouble I had experienced in coming so far ; and stood looking at the river flowing past till it was too dark to distinguish anything .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 30]: But it was not till I had visited the same spot a dozen times , that I came to a right comprehension of the grandeur of the scene . '
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 7]: Following are Mrs. Trollope 's emotions .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 60]: She is writing a few months later in the same year , 1827 , and is coming in at the mouth of the Mississippi -- ` The first indication of our approach to land was the appearance of this mighty river pouring forth its muddy mass of waters , and mingling with the deep blue of the Mexican Gulf .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 15]: I never beheld a scene so utterly desolate as this entrance of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 17]: Had Dante seen it , he might have drawn images of another Borgia from its horrors .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 54]: One only object rears itself above the eddying waters ; this is the mast of a vessel long since wrecked in attempting to cross the bar , and it still stands , a dismal witness of the destruction that has been , and a boding prophet of that which is to come . '
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 57]: Emotions of Hon. Charles Augustus Murray -LRB- near St. Louis -RRB- , seven years later -- ` It is only when you ascend the mighty current for fifty or a hundred miles , and use the eye of imagination as well as that of nature , that you begin to understand all his might and majesty .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 99]: You see him fertilizing a boundless valley , bearing along in his course the trophies of his thousand victories over the shattered forest -- here carrying away large masses of soil with all their growth , and there forming islands , destined at some future period to be the residence of man ; and while indulging in this prospect , it is then time for reflection to suggest that the current before you has flowed through two or three thousand miles , and has yet to travel one thousand three hundred more before reaching its ocean destination . '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 66]: Receive , now , the emotions of Captain Marryat , R.N. author of the sea tales , writing in 1837 , three years after Mr. Murray -- ` Never , perhaps , in the records of nations , was there an instance of a century of such unvarying and unmitigated crime as is to be collected from the history of the turbulent and blood-stained Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 15]: The stream itself appears as if appropriate for the deeds which have been committed .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 49]: It is not like most rivers , beautiful to the sight , bestowing fertility in its course ; not one that the eye loves to dwell upon as it sweeps along , nor can you wander upon its banks , or trust yourself without danger to its stream .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 70]: It is a furious , rapid , desolating torrent , loaded with alluvial soil ; and few of those who are received into its waters ever rise again , -LCB- footnote -LSB- There was a foolish superstition of some little prevalence in that day , that the Mississippi would neither buoy up a swimmer , nor permit a drowned person 's body to rise to the surface . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 15]: or can support themselves long upon its surface without assistance from some friendly log .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 48]: It contains the coarsest and most uneatable of fish , such as the cat-fish and such genus , and as you descend , its banks are occupied with the fetid alligator , while the panther basks at its edge in the cane-brakes , almost impervious to man .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 173]: Pouring its impetuous waters through wild tracks covered with trees of little value except for firewood , it sweeps down whole forests in its course , which disappear in tumultuous confusion , whirled away by the stream now loaded with the masses of soil which nourished their roots , often blocking up and changing for a time the channel of the river , which , as if in anger at its being opposed , inundates and devastates the whole country round ; and as soon as it forces its way through its former channel , plants in every direction the uprooted monarchs of the forest -LRB- upon whose branches the bird will never again perch , or the raccoon , the opossum , or the squirrel climb -RRB- as traps to the adventurous navigators of its waters by steam , who , borne down upon these concealed dangers which pierce through the planks , very often have not time to steer for and gain the shore before they sink to the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 38]: There are no pleasing associations connected with the great common sewer of the Western America , which pours out its mud into the Mexican Gulf , polluting the clear blue sea for many miles beyond its mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 50]: It is a river of desolation ; and instead of reminding you , like other beautiful rivers , of an angel which has descended for the benefit of man , you imagine it a devil , whose energies have been only overcome by the wonderful power of steam . '
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 48]: It is pretty crude literature for a man accustomed to handling a pen ; still , as a panorama of the emotions sent weltering through this noted visitor 's breast by the aspect and traditions of the ` great common sewer , ' it has a value .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 38]: A value , though marred in the matter of statistics by inaccuracies ; for the catfish is a plenty good enough fish for anybody , and there are no panthers that are ` impervious to man . '
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 35]: Later still comes Alexander Mackay , of the Middle Temple , Barrister at Law , with a better digestion , and no catfish dinner aboard , and feels as follows -- ` The Mississippi !
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 15]: It was with indescribable emotions that I first felt myself afloat upon its waters .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 64]: How often in my schoolboy dreams , and in my waking visions afterwards , had my imagination pictured to itself the lordly stream , rolling with tumultuous current through the boundless region to which it has given its name , and gathering into itself , in its course to the ocean , the tributary waters of almost every latitude in the temperate zone !
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 19]: Here it was then in its reality , and I , at length , steaming against its tide .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 20]: I looked upon it with that reverence with which everyone must regard a great feature of external nature . '
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 6]: So much for the emotions .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 21]: The tourists , one and all , remark upon the deep , brooding loneliness and desolation of the vast river .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 29]: Captain Basil Hall , who saw it at flood-stage , says -- ` Sometimes we passed along distances of twenty or thirty miles without seeing a single habitation .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 23]: An artist , in search of hints for a painting of the deluge , would here have found them in abundance . '
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 63]: The first shall be last , etc. just two hundred years ago , the old original first and gallantest of all the foreign tourists , pioneer , head of the procession , ended his weary and tedious discovery-voyage down the solemn stretches of the great river -- La Salle , whose name will last as long as the river itself shall last .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 16]: We quote from Mr. Parkman -- ` And now they neared their journey 's end .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 15]: On the sixth of April , the river divided itself into three broad channels .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 22]: La Salle followed that of the west , and D'Autray that of the east ; while Tonty took the middle passage .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 35]: As he drifted down the turbid current , between the low and marshy shores , the brackish water changed to brine , and the breeze grew fresh with the salt breath of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 40]: Then the broad bosom of the great Gulf opened on his sight , tossing its restless billows , limitless , voiceless , lonely as when born of chaos , without a sail , without a sign of life . '
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 60]: Then , on a spot of solid ground , La Salle reared a column ` bearing the arms of France ; the Frenchmen were mustered under arms ; and while the New England Indians and their squaws looked on in wondering silence , they chanted the TE DEUM , THE EXAUDIAT , and the DOMINE SALVUM FAC REGEM . '
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 48]: Then , whilst the musketry volleyed and rejoicing shouts burst forth , the victorious discoverer planted the column , and made proclamation in a loud voice , taking formal possession of the river and the vast countries watered by it , in the name of the King .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 25]: The column bore this inscription -- LOUIS LE GRAND , ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE , REGNE ; LE NEUVIEME AVRIL , 1682 .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 52]: New Orleans intended to fittingly celebrate , this present year , the bicentennial anniversary of this illustrious event ; but when the time came , all her energies and surplus money were required in other directions , for the flood was upon the land then , making havoc and devastation everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 23]: Chapter 28 Uncle Mumford Unloads ALL day we swung along down the river , and had the stream almost wholly to ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 64]: Formerly , at such a stage of the water , we should have passed acres of lumber rafts , and dozens of big coal barges ; also occasional little trading-scows , peddling along from farm to farm , with the peddler 's family on board ; possibly , a random scow , bearing a humble Hamlet and Co. on an itinerant dramatic trip .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 6]: But these were all absent .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 18]: Far along in the day , we saw one steamboat ; just one , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 18]: She was lying at rest in the shade , within the wooded mouth of the Obion River .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 23]: The spy-glass revealed the fact that she was named for me -- or HE was named for me , whichever you prefer .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 42]: As this was the first time I had ever encountered this species of honor , it seems excusable to mention it , and at the same time call the attention of the authorities to the tardiness of my recognition of it .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 12]: Noted a big change in the river , at Island 21 .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 35]: It was a very large island , and used to be out toward mid-stream ; but it is joined fast to the main shore now , and has retired from business as an island .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 25]: As we approached famous and formidable Plum Point , darkness fell , but that was nothing to shudder about -- in these modern times .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 17]: For now the national government has turned the Mississippi into a sort of two-thousand-mile torchlight procession .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 24]: In the head of every crossing , and in the foot of every crossing , the government has set up a clear-burning lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 29]: You are never entirely in the dark , now ; there is always a beacon in sight , either before you , or behind you , or abreast .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 11]: One might almost say that lamps have been squandered there .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 51]: Dozens of crossings are lighted which were not shoal when they were created , and have never been shoal since ; crossings so plain , too , and also so straight , that a steamboat can take herself through them without any help , after she has been through once .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 76]: Lamps in such places are of course not wasted ; it is much more convenient and comfortable for a pilot to hold on them than on a spread of formless blackness that wo n't stay still ; and money is saved to the boat , at the same time , for she can of course make more miles with her rudder amidships than she can with it squared across her stern and holding her back .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 16]: But this thing has knocked the romance out of piloting , to a large extent .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 17]: It , and some other things together , have knocked all the romance out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 15]: For instance , the peril from snags is not now what it once was .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 45]: The government 's snag-boats go patrolling up and down , in these matter-of-fact days , pulling the river 's teeth ; they have rooted out all the old clusters which made many localities so formidable ; and they allow no new ones to collect .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 83]: Formerly , if your boat got away from you , on a black night , and broke for the woods , it was an anxious time with you ; so was it also , when you were groping your way through solidified darkness in a narrow chute ; but all that is changed now -- you flash out your electric light , transform night into day in the twinkling of an eye , and your perils and anxieties are at an end .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 34]: Horace Bixby and George Ritchie have charted the crossings and laid out the courses by compass ; they have invented a lamp to go with the chart , and have patented the whole .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 26]: With these helps , one may run in the fog now , with considerable security , and with a confidence unknown in the old days .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 66]: With these abundant beacons , the banishment of snags , plenty of daylight in a box and ready to be turned on whenever needed , and a chart and compass to fight the fog with , piloting , at a good stage of water , is now nearly as safe and simple as driving stage , and is hardly more than three times as romantic .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 33]: And now in these new days , these days of infinite change , the Anchor Line have raised the captain above the pilot by giving him the bigger wages of the two .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 12]: This was going far , but they have not stopped there .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 32]: They have decreed that the pilot shall remain at his post , and stand his watch clear through , whether the boat be under way or tied up to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 51]: We , that were once the aristocrats of the river , ca n't go to bed now , as we used to do , and sleep while a hundred tons of freight are lugged aboard ; no , we must sit in the pilot-house ; and keep awake , too .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 13]: Verily we are being treated like a parcel of mates and engineers .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 21]: The Government has taken away the romance of our calling ; the Company has taken away its state and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 74]: Plum Point looked as it had always looked by night , with the exception that now there were beacons to mark the crossings , and also a lot of other lights on the Point and along its shore ; these latter glinting from the fleet of the United States River Commission , and from a village which the officials have built on the land for offices and for the employees of the service .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 34]: The military engineers of the Commission have taken upon their shoulders the job of making the Mississippi over again -- a job transcended in size by only the original job of creating it .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 89]: They are building wing-dams here and there , to deflect the current ; and dikes to confine it in narrower bounds ; and other dikes to make it stay there ; and for unnumbered miles along the Mississippi , they are felling the timber-front for fifty yards back , with the purpose of shaving the bank down to low-water mark with the slant of a house roof , and ballasting it with stones ; and in many places they have protected the wasting shores with rows of piles .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 97]: One who knows the Mississippi will promptly aver -- not aloud , but to himself -- that ten thousand River Commissions , with the mines of the world at their back , can not tame that lawless stream , can not curb it or confine it , can not say to it , Go here , or Go there , and make it obey ; can not save a shore which it has sentenced ; can not bar its path with an obstruction which it will not tear down , dance over , and laugh at .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 76]: But a discreet man will not put these things into spoken words ; for the West Point engineers have not their superiors anywhere ; they know all that can be known of their abstruse science ; and so , since they conceive that they can fetter and handcuff that river and boss him , it is but wisdom for the unscientific man to keep still , lie low , and wait till they do it .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 36]: Captain Eads , with his jetties , has done a work at the mouth of the Mississippi which seemed clearly impossible ; so we do not feel full confidence now to prophesy against like impossibilities .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 37]: Otherwise one would pipe out and say the Commission might as well bully the comets in their courses and undertake to make them behave , as try to bully the Mississippi into right and reasonable conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 64]: I consulted Uncle Mumford concerning this and cognate matters ; and I give here the result , stenographically reported , and therefore to be relied on as being full and correct ; except that I have here and there left out remarks which were addressed to the men , such as ` where in blazes are you going with that barrel now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 25]: and which seemed to me to break the flow of the written statement , without compensating by adding to its information or its clearness .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 42]: Not that I have ventured to strike out all such interjections ; I have removed only those which were obviously irrelevant ; wherever one occurred which I felt any question about , I have judged it safest to let it remain .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 32]: UNCLE MUMFORD 'S IMPRESSIONS Uncle Mumford said -- ` As long as I have been mate of a steamboat -- thirty years -- I have watched this river and studied it .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 31]: Maybe I could have learnt more about it at West Point , but if I believe it I wish I may be WHAT ARE YOU SUCKING YOUR FINGERS THERE FOR ?
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 7]: -- COLLAR THAT KAG OF NAILS !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 33]: Four years at West Point , and plenty of books and schooling , will learn a man a good deal , I reckon , but it wo n't learn him the river .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 80]: You turn one of those little European rivers over to this Commission , with its hard bottom and clear water , and it would just be a holiday job for them to wall it , and pile it , and dike it , and tame it down , and boss it around , and make it go wherever they wanted it to , and stay where they put it , and do just as they said , every time .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 10]: But this ai n't that kind of a river .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 25]: They have started in here with big confidence , and the best intentions in the world ; but they are going to get left .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 5]: What does Ecclesiastes vii .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 3]: 13 say ?
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 13]: Says enough to knock THEIR little game galley-west , do n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 8]: Now you look at their methods once .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 27]: There at Devil 's Island , in the Upper River , they wanted the water to go one way , the water wanted to go another .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 8]: So they put up a stone wall .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 11]: But what does the river care for a stone wall ?
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 11]: When it got ready , it just bulged through it .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 23]: Maybe they can build another that will stay ; that is , up there -- but not down here they ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 44]: Down here in the Lower River , they drive some pegs to turn the water away from the shore and stop it from slicing off the bank ; very well , do n't it go straight over and cut somebody else 's bank ?
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 9]: Are they going to peg all the banks ?
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 13]: Why , they could buy ground and build a new Mississippi cheaper .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 7]: They are pegging Bulletin Tow-head now .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 7]: It wo n't do any good .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 22]: If the river has got a mortgage on that island , it will foreclose , sure , pegs or no pegs .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 38]: Away down yonder , they have driven two rows of piles straight through the middle of a dry bar half a mile long , which is forty foot out of the water when the river is low .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 8]: What do you reckon that is for ?
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 18]: If I know , I wish I may land in-HUMP YOURSELF , YOU SON OF AN UNDERTAKER !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 12]: -- OUT WITH THAT COAL-OIL , NOW , LIVELY , LIVELY !
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 17]: And just look at what they are trying to do down there at Milliken 's Bend .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 18]: There 's been a cut-off in that section , and Vicksburg is left out in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 7]: It 's a country town now .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 22]: The river strikes in below it ; and a boat ca n't go up to the town except in high water .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 84]: Well , they are going to build wing-dams in the bend opposite the foot of 103 , and throw the water over and cut off the foot of the island and plow down into an old ditch where the river used to be in ancient times ; and they think they can persuade the water around that way , and get it to strike in above Vicksburg , as it used to do , and fetch the town back into the world again .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 25]: That is , they are going to take this whole Mississippi , and twist it around and make it run several miles UP STREAM .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 38]: Well you 've got to admire men that deal in ideas of that size and can tote them around without crutches ; but you have n't got to believe they can DO such miracles , have you !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 13]: And yet you ai n't absolutely obliged to believe they ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 38]: I reckon the safe way , where a man can afford it , is to copper the operation , and at the same time buy enough property in Vicksburg to square you up in case they win .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 18]: Government is doing a deal for the Mississippi , now -- spending loads of money on her .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 92]: When there used to be four thousand steamboats and ten thousand acres of coal-barges , and rafts and trading scows , there was n't a lantern from St. Paul to New Orleans , and the snags were thicker than bristles on a hog 's back ; and now when there 's three dozen steamboats and nary barge or raft , Government has snatched out all the snags , and lit up the shores like Broadway , and a boat 's as safe on the river as she 'd be in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 81]: And I reckon that by the time there ai n't any boats left at all , the Commission will have the old thing all reorganized , and dredged out , and fenced in , and tidied up , to a degree that will make navigation just simply perfect , and absolutely safe and profitable ; and all the days will be Sundays , and all the mates will be Sunday-school su-WHAT-IN-THE-NATION-YOU-FOOLING-AROUND-THERE-FOR , YOU SONS OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS , HEIRS OF PERDITION !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 11]: GOING TO BE A YEAR GETTING THAT HOGSHEAD ASHORE ? '
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 34]: During our trip to New Orleans and back , we had many conversations with river men , planters , journalists , and officers of the River Commission -- with conflicting and confusing results .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 6]: To wit : -- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 26]: Some believed in the Commission 's scheme to arbitrarily and permanently confine -LRB- and thus deepen -RRB- the channel , preserve threatened shores , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 22]: Some believed that the Commission 's money ought to be spent only on building and repairing the great system of levees .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 29]: Some believed that the higher you build your levee , the higher the river 's bottom will rise ; and that consequently the levee system is a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 25]: Some believed in the scheme to relieve the river , in flood-time , by turning its surplus waters off into Lake Borgne , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 2]: 5 .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 16]: Some believed in the scheme of northern lake-reservoirs to replenish the Mississippi in low-water seasons .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 70]: Wherever you find a man down there who believes in one of these theories you may turn to the next man and frame your talk upon the hypothesis that he does not believe in that theory ; and after you have had experience , you do not take this course doubtfully , or hesitatingly , but with the confidence of a dying murderer -- converted one , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 36]: For you will have come to know , with a deep and restful certainty , that you are not going to meet two people sick of the same theory , one right after the other .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 16]: No , there will always be one or two with the other diseases along between .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 15]: And as you proceed , you will find out one or two other things .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 28]: You will find out that there is no distemper of the lot but is contagious ; and you can not go where it is without catching it .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 58]: You may vaccinate yourself with deterrent facts as much as you please -- it will do no good ; it will seem to ` take , ' but it does n't ; the moment you rub against any one of those theorists , make up your mind that it is time to hang out your yellow flag .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 44]: Yes , you are his sure victim : yet his work is not all to your hurt -- only part of it ; for he is like your family physician , who comes and cures the mumps , and leaves the scarlet-fever behind .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 57]: If your man is a Lake-Borgne-relief theorist , for instance , he will exhale a cloud of deadly facts and statistics which will lay you out with that disease , sure ; but at the same time he will cure you of any other of the five theories that may have previously got into your system .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 44]: I have had all the five ; and had them ` bad ; ' but ask me not , in mournful numbers , which one racked me hardest , or which one numbered the biggest sick list , for I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 11]: In truth , no one can answer the latter question .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 10]: Mississippi Improvement is a mighty topic , down yonder .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 66]: Every man on the river banks , south of Cairo , talks about it every day , during such moments as he is able to spare from talking about the war ; and each of the several chief theories has its host of zealous partisans ; but , as I have said , it is not possible to determine which cause numbers the most recruits .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 23]: All were agreed upon one point , however : if Congress would make a sufficient appropriation , a colossal benefit would result .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 23]: Very well ; since then the appropriation has been made -- possibly a sufficient one , certainly not too large a one .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 11]: Let us hope that the prophecy will be amply fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 43]: One thing will be easily granted by the reader ; that an opinion from Mr. Edward Atkinson , upon any vast national commercial matter , comes as near ranking as authority , as can the opinion of any individual in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 16]: What he has to say about Mississippi River Improvement will be found in the Appendix .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 49]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- See Appendix B. -RSB- -RCB- Sometimes , half a dozen figures will reveal , as with a lightning-flash , the importance of a subject which ten thousand labored words , with the same purpose in view , had left at last but dim and uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 74]: Here is a case of the sort -- paragraph from the ` Cincinnati Commercial ' -- ` The towboat `` Jos. B. Williams '' is on her way to New Orleans with a tow of thirty-two barges , containing six hundred thousand bushels -LRB- seventy-six pounds to the bushel -RRB- of coal exclusive of her own fuel , being the largest tow ever taken to New Orleans or anywhere else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 15]: Her freight bill , at 3 cents a bushel , amounts to $ 18,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 24]: It would take eighteen hundred cars , of three hundred and thirty-three bushels to the car , to transport this amount of coal .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 43]: At $ 10 per ton , or $ 100 per car , which would be a fair price for the distance by rail , the freight bill would amount to $ 180,000 , or $ 162,000 more by rail than by river .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 16]: The tow will be taken from Pittsburg to New Orleans in fourteen or fifteen days .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 52]: It would take one hundred trains of eighteen cars to the train to transport this one tow of six hundred thousand bushels of coal , and even if it made the usual speed of fast freight lines , it would take one whole summer to put it through by rail . '
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 46]: When a river in good condition can enable one to save $ 162,000 and a whole summer 's time , on a single cargo , the wisdom of taking measures to keep the river in good condition is made plain to even the uncommercial mind .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 42]: Chapter 29 A Few Specimen Bricks WE passed through the Plum Point region , turned Craighead 's Point , and glided unchallenged by what was once the formidable Fort Pillow , memorable because of the massacre perpetrated there during the war .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 48]: Massacres are sprinkled with some frequency through the histories of several Christian nations , but this is almost the only one that can be found in American history ; perhaps it is the only one which rises to a size correspondent to that huge and somber title .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 63]: We have the ` Boston Massacre , ' where two or three people were killed ; but we must bunch Anglo-Saxon history together to find the fellow to the Fort Pillow tragedy ; and doubtless even then we must travel back to the days and the performances of Coeur de Lion , that fine ` hero , ' before we accomplish it .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 7]: More of the river 's freaks .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 23]: In times past , the channel used to strike above Island 37 , by Brandywine Bar , and down towards Island 39 .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 58]: Afterward , changed its course and went from Brandywine down through Vogelman 's chute in the Devil 's Elbow , to Island 39 -- part of this course reversing the old order ; the river running UP four or five miles , instead of down , and cutting off , throughout , some fifteen miles of distance .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 4]: This in 1876 .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 9]: All that region is now called Centennial Island .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 24]: There is a tradition that Island 37 was one of the principal abiding places of the once celebrated ` Murel 's Gang . '
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 28]: This was a colossal combination of robbers , horse-thieves , negro-stealers , and counterfeiters , engaged in business along the river some fifty or sixty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 54]: While our journey across the country towards St. Louis was in progress we had had no end of Jesse James and his stirring history ; for he had just been assassinated by an agent of the Governor of Missouri , and was in consequence occupying a good deal of space in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 11]: Cheap histories of him were for sale by train boys .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 18]: According to these , he was the most marvelous creature of his kind that had ever existed .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 5]: It was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 41]: Murel was his equal in boldness ; in pluck ; in rapacity ; in cruelty , brutality , heartlessness , treachery , and in general and comprehensive vileness and shamelessness ; and very much his superior in some larger aspects .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 10]: James was a retail rascal ; Murel , wholesale .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 52]: James 's modest genius dreamed of no loftier flight than the planning of raids upon cars , coaches , and country banks ; Murel projected negro insurrections and the capture of New Orleans ; and furthermore , on occasion , this Murel could go into a pulpit and edify the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 41]: What are James and his half-dozen vulgar rascals compared with this stately old-time criminal , with his sermons , his meditated insurrections and city-captures , and his majestic following of ten hundred men , sworn to do his evil will !
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 38]: Here is a paragraph or two concerning this big operator , from a now forgotten book which was published half a century ago -- He appears to have been a most dexterous as well as consummate villain .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 53]: When he traveled , his usual disguise was that of an itinerant preacher ; and it is said that his discourses were very ` soul-moving ' -- interesting the hearers so much that they forgot to look after their horses , which were carried away by his confederates while he was preaching .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 47]: But the stealing of horses in one State , and selling them in another , was but a small portion of their business ; the most lucrative was the enticing slaves to run away from their masters , that they might sell them in another quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 65]: This was arranged as follows ; they would tell a negro that if he would run away from his master , and allow them to sell him , he should receive a portion of the money paid for him , and that upon his return to them a second time they would send him to a free State , where he would be safe .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 105]: The poor wretches complied with this request , hoping to obtain money and freedom ; they would be sold to another master , and run away again , to their employers ; sometimes they would be sold in this manner three or four times , until they had realized three or four thousand dollars by them ; but as , after this , there was fear of detection , the usual custom was to get rid of the only witness that could be produced against them , which was the negro himself , by murdering him , and throwing his body into the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 52]: Even if it was established that they had stolen a negro , before he was murdered , they were always prepared to evade punishment ; for they concealed the negro who had run away , until he was advertised , and a reward offered to any man who would catch him .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 16]: An advertisement of this kind warrants the person to take the property , if found .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 62]: And then the negro becomes a property in trust , when , therefore , they sold the negro , it only became a breach of trust , not stealing ; and for a breach of trust , the owner of the property can only have redress by a civil action , which was useless , as the damages were never paid .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 54]: It may be inquired , how it was that Murel escaped Lynch law under such circumstances This will be easily understood when it is stated that he had MORE THAN A THOUSAND SWORN CONFEDERATES , all ready at a moment 's notice to support any of the gang who might be in trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 23]: The names of all the principal confederates of Murel were obtained from himself , in a manner which I shall presently explain .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 34]: The gang was composed of two classes : the Heads or Council , as they were called , who planned and concerted , but seldom acted ; they amounted to about four hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 22]: The other class were the active agents , and were termed strikers , and amounted to about six hundred and fifty .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 61]: These were the tools in the hands of the others ; they ran all the risk , and received but a small portion of the money ; they were in the power of the leaders of the gang , who would sacrifice them at any time by handing them over to justice , or sinking their bodies in the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 28]: The general rendezvous of this gang of miscreants was on the Arkansas side of the river , where they concealed their negroes in the morasses and cane-brakes .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 39]: The depredations of this extensive combination were severely felt ; but so well were their plans arranged , that although Murel , who was always active , was everywhere suspected , there was no proof to be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 54]: It so happened , however , that a young man of the name of Stewart , who was looking after two slaves which Murel had decoyed away , fell in with him and obtained his confidence , took the oath , and was admitted into the gang as one of the General Council .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 132]: By this means all was discovered ; for Stewart turned traitor , although he had taken the oath , and having obtained every information , exposed the whole concern , the names of all the parties , and finally succeeded in bringing home sufficient evidence against Murel , to procure his conviction and sentence to the Penitentiary -LRB- Murel was sentenced to fourteen years ' imprisonment -RRB- ; so many people who were supposed to be honest , and bore a respectable name in the different States , were found to be among the list of the Grand Council as published by Stewart , that every attempt was made to throw discredit upon his assertions -- his character was vilified , and more than one attempt was made to assassinate him .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 11]: He was obliged to quit the Southern States in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 38]: It is , however , now well ascertained to have been all true ; and although some blame Mr. Stewart for having violated his oath , they no longer attempt to deny that his revelations were correct .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 24]: I will quote one or two portions of Murel 's confessions to Mr. Stewart , made to him when they were journeying together .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 60]: I ought to have observed , that the ultimate intentions of Murel and his associates were , by his own account , on a very extended scale ; having no less an object in view than RAISING THE BLACKS AGAINST THE WHITES , TAKING POSSESSION OF , AND PLUNDERING NEW ORLEANS , AND MAKING THEMSELVES POSSESSORS OF THE TERRITORY .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 68]: The following are a few extracts : -- ' I collected all my friends about New Orleans at one of our friends ' houses in that place , and we sat in council three days before we got all our plans to our notion ; we then determined to undertake the rebellion at every hazard , and make as many friends as we could for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 34]: Every man 's business being assigned him , I started to Natchez on foot , having sold my horse in New Orleans , -- with the intention of stealing another after I started .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 16]: I walked four days , and no opportunity offered for me to get a horse .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 26]: The fifth day , about twelve , I had become tired , and stopped at a creek to get some water and rest a little .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 30]: While I was sitting on a log , looking down the road the way that I had come , a man came in sight riding on a good-looking horse .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 25]: The very moment I saw him , I was determined to have his horse , if he was in the garb of a traveler .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 16]: He rode up , and I saw from his equipage that he was a traveler .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 16]: I arose and drew an elegant rifle pistol on him and ordered him to dismount .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 26]: He did so , and I took his horse by the bridle and pointed down the creek , and ordered him to walk before me .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 9]: He went a few hundred yards and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 29]: I hitched his horse , and then made him undress himself , all to his shirt and drawers , and ordered him to turn his back to me .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 35]: He said , ` If you are determined to kill me , let me have time to pray before I die , ' I told him I had no time to hear him pray .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 20]: He turned around and dropped on his knees , and I shot him through the back of the head .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 18]: I ripped open his belly and took out his entrails , and sunk him in the creek .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 29]: I then searched his pockets , and found four hundred dollars and thirty-seven cents , and a number of papers that I did not take time to examine .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 14]: I sunk the pocket-book and papers and his hat , in the creek .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 29]: His boots were brand-new , and fitted me genteelly ; and I put them on and sunk my old shoes in the creek , to atone for them .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 22]: I rolled up his clothes and put them into his portmanteau , as they were brand-new cloth of the best quality .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 31]: I mounted as fine a horse as ever I straddled , and directed my course for Natchez in much better style than I had been for the last five days .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 19]: ` Myself and a fellow by the name of Crenshaw gathered four good horses and started for Georgia .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 26]: We got in company with a young South Carolinian just before we got to Cumberland Mountain , and Crenshaw soon knew all about his business .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 29]: He had been to Tennessee to buy a drove of hogs , but when he got there pork was dearer than he calculated , and he declined purchasing .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 7]: We concluded he was a prize .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 10]: Crenshaw winked at me ; I understood his idea .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 105]: Crenshaw had traveled the road before , but I never had ; we had traveled several miles on the mountain , when he passed near a great precipice ; just before we passed it Crenshaw asked me for my whip , which had a pound of lead in the butt ; I handed it to him , and he rode up by the side of the South Carolinian , and gave him a blow on the side of the head and tumbled him from his horse ; we lit from our horses and fingered his pockets ; we got twelve hundred and sixty-two dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 72]: Crenshaw said he knew a place to hide him , and he gathered him under his arms , and I by his feet , and conveyed him to a deep crevice in the brow of the precipice , and tumbled him into it , and he went out of sight ; we then tumbled in his saddle , and took his horse with us , which was worth two hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 57]: ` We were detained a few days , and during that time our friend went to a little village in the neighborhood and saw the negro advertised -LRB- a negro in our possession -RRB- , and a description of the two men of whom he had been purchased , and giving his suspicions of the men .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 42]: It was rather squally times , but any port in a storm : we took the negro that night on the bank of a creek which runs by the farm of our friend , and Crenshaw shot him through the head .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 12]: We took out his entrails and sunk him in the creek .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 79]: ` He had sold the other negro the third time on Arkansaw River for upwards of five hundred dollars ; and then stole him and delivered him into the hand of his friend , who conducted him to a swamp , and veiled the tragic scene , and got the last gleanings and sacred pledge of secrecy ; as a game of that kind will not do unless it ends in a mystery to all but the fraternity .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 82]: He sold the negro , first and last , for nearly two thousand dollars , and then put him for ever out of the reach of all pursuers ; and they can never graze him unless they can find the negro ; and that they can not do , for his carcass has fed many a tortoise and catfish before this time , and the frogs have sung this many a long day to the silent repose of his skeleton . '
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 31]: We were approaching Memphis , in front of which city , and witnessed by its people , was fought the most famous of the river battles of the Civil War .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 38]: Two men whom I had served under , in my river days , took part in that fight : Mr. Bixby , head pilot of the Union fleet , and Montgomery , Commodore of the Confederate fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 21]: Both saw a great deal of active service during the war , and achieved high reputations for pluck and capacity .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 30]: As we neared Memphis , we began to cast about for an excuse to stay with the ` Gold Dust ' to the end of her course -- Vicksburg .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 16]: We were so pleasantly situated , that we did not wish to make a change .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 28]: I had an errand of considerable importance to do at Napoleon , Arkansas , but perhaps I could manage it without quitting the ` Gold Dust . '
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 14]: I said as much ; so we decided to stick to present quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 13]: The boat was to tarry at Memphis till ten the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 16]: It is a beautiful city , nobly situated on a commanding bluff overlooking the river .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 18]: The streets are straight and spacious , though not paved in a way to incite distempered admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 55]: No , the admiration must be reserved for the town 's sewerage system , which is called perfect ; a recent reform , however , for it was just the other way , up to a few years ago -- a reform resulting from the lesson taught by a desolating visitation of the yellow-fever .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 43]: In those awful days the people were swept off by hundreds , by thousands ; and so great was the reduction caused by flight and by death together , that the population was diminished three-fourths , and so remained for a time .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 14]: Business stood nearly still , and the streets bore an empty Sunday aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 31]: Here is a picture of Memphis , at that disastrous time , drawn by a German tourist who seems to have been an eye-witness of the scenes which he describes .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 25]: It is from Chapter VII , of his book , just published , in Leipzig , ` Mississippi-Fahrten , von Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg . '
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 12]: -- ` In August the yellow-fever had reached its extremest height .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 11]: Daily , hundreds fell a sacrifice to the terrible epidemic .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 39]: The city was become a mighty graveyard , two-thirds of the population had deserted the place , and only the poor , the aged and the sick , remained behind , a sure prey for the insidious enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 21]: The houses were closed : little lamps burned in front of many -- a sign that here death had entered .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 17]: Often , several lay dead in a single house ; from the windows hung black crape .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 15]: The stores were shut up , for their owners were gone away or dead .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 4]: ` Fearful evil !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 16]: In the briefest space it struck down and swept away even the most vigorous victim .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 21]: A slight indisposition , then an hour of fever , then the hideous delirium , then -- the Yellow Death !
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 28]: On the street corners , and in the squares , lay sick men , suddenly overtaken by the disease ; and even corpses , distorted and rigid .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 3]: Food failed .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 17]: Meat spoiled in a few hours in the fetid and pestiferous air , and turned black .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 42]: ` Fearful clamors issue from many houses ; then after a season they cease , and all is still : noble , self-sacrificing men come with the coffin , nail it up , and carry it away , to the graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 6]: In the night stillness reigns .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 53]: Only the physicians and the hearses hurry through the streets ; and out of the distance , at intervals , comes the muffled thunder of the railway train , which with the speed of the wind , and as if hunted by furies , flies by the pest-ridden city without halting . '
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 8]: But there is life enough there now .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 17]: The population exceeds forty thousand and is augmenting , and trade is in a flourishing condition .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 41]: We drove about the city ; visited the park and the sociable horde of squirrels there ; saw the fine residences , rose-clad and in other ways enticing to the eye ; and got a good breakfast at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 45]: A thriving place is the Good Samaritan City of the Mississippi : has a great wholesale jobbing trade ; foundries , machine shops ; and manufactories of wagons , carriages , and cotton-seed oil ; and is shortly to have cotton mills and elevators .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 21]: Her cotton receipts reached five hundred thousand bales last year -- an increase of sixty thousand over the year before .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 20]: Out from her healthy commercial heart issue five trunk lines of railway ; and a sixth is being added .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 28]: This is a very different Memphis from the one which the vanished and unremembered procession of foreign tourists used to put into their books long time ago .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 53]: In the days of the now forgotten but once renowned and vigorously hated Mrs. Trollope , Memphis seems to have consisted mainly of one long street of log-houses , with some outlying cabins sprinkled around rearward toward the woods ; and now and then a pig , and no end of mud .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 6]: That was fifty-five years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 6]: She stopped at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 12]: Plainly it was not the one which gave us our breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 17]: She says -- ` The table was laid for fifty persons , and was nearly full .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 75]: They ate in perfect silence , and with such astonishing rapidity that their dinner was over literally before ours was begun ; the only sounds heard were those produced by the knives and forks , with the unceasing chorus of coughing , ETC. ' ` Coughing , etc. ' The ` etc. ' stands for an unpleasant word there , a word which she does not always charitably cover up , but sometimes prints .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 179]: You will find it in the following description of a steamboat dinner which she ate in company with a lot of aristocratic planters ; wealthy , well-born , ignorant swells they were , tinselled with the usual harmless military and judicial titles of that old day of cheap shams and windy pretense -- ` The total want of all the usual courtesies of the table ; the voracious rapidity with which the viands were seized and devoured ; the strange uncouth phrases and pronunciation ; the loathsome spitting , from the contamination of which it was absolutely impossible to protect our dresses ; the frightful manner of feeding with their knives , till the whole blade seemed to enter into the mouth ; and the still more frightful manner of cleaning the teeth afterward with a pocket knife , soon forced us to feel that we were not surrounded by the generals , colonels , and majors of the old world ; and that the dinner hour was to be anything rather than an hour of enjoyment . '
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 88]: Chapter 30 Sketches by the Way IT was a big river , below Memphis ; banks brimming full , everywhere , and very frequently more than full , the waters pouring out over the land , flooding the woods and fields for miles into the interior ; and in places , to a depth of fifteen feet ; signs , all about , of men 's hard work gone to ruin , and all to be done over again , with straitened means and a weakened courage .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 16]: A melancholy picture , and a continuous one ; -- hundreds of miles of it .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 62]: Sometimes the beacon lights stood in water three feet deep , in the edge of dense forests which extended for miles without farm , wood-yard , clearing , or break of any kind ; which meant that the keeper of the light must come in a skiff a great distance to discharge his trust , -- and often in desperate weather .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 33]: Yet I was told that the work is faithfully performed , in all weathers ; and not always by men , sometimes by women , if the man is sick or absent .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 19]: The Government furnishes oil , and pays ten or fifteen dollars a month for the lighting and tending .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 12]: A Government boat distributes oil and pays wages once a month .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 12]: The Ship Island region was as woodsy and tenantless as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 31]: The island has ceased to be an island ; has joined itself compactly to the main shore , and wagons travel , now , where the steamboats used to navigate .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 12]: No signs left of the wreck of the ` Pennsylvania . '
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 20]: Some farmer will turn up her bones with his plow one day , no doubt , and be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 11]: We were getting down now into the migrating negro region .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 20]: These poor people could never travel when they were slaves ; so they make up for the privation now .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 26]: They stay on a plantation till the desire to travel seizes them ; then they pack up , hail a steamboat , and clear out .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 21]: Not for any particular place ; no , nearly any place will answer ; they only want to be moving .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 16]: The amount of money on hand will answer the rest of the conundrum for them .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 16]: If it will take them fifty miles , very well ; let it be fifty .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: If not , a shorter flight will do .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 12]: During a couple of days , we frequently answered these hails .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 63]: Sometimes there was a group of high-water-stained , tumble-down cabins , populous with colored folk , and no whites visible ; with grassless patches of dry ground here and there ; a few felled trees , with skeleton cattle , mules , and horses , eating the leaves and gnawing the bark -- no other food for them in the flood-wasted land .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 76]: Sometimes there was a single lonely landing-cabin ; near it the colored family that had hailed us ; little and big , old and young , roosting on the scant pile of household goods ; these consisting of a rusty gun , some bed-ticks , chests , tinware , stools , a crippled looking-glass , a venerable arm-chair , and six or eight base-born and spiritless yellow curs , attached to the family by strings .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 13]: They must have their dogs ; ca n't go without their dogs .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 65]: Yet the dogs are never willing ; they always object ; so , one after another , in ridiculous procession , they are dragged aboard ; all four feet braced and sliding along the stage , head likely to be pulled off ; but the tugger marching determinedly forward , bending to his work , with the rope over his shoulder for better purchase .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 16]: Sometimes a child is forgotten and left on the bank ; but never a dog .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 9]: The usual river-gossip going on in the pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 23]: Island No. 63 -- an island with a lovely ` chute , ' or passage , behind it in the former times .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 46]: They said Jesse Jamieson , in the ` Skylark , ' had a visiting pilot with him one trip -- a poor old broken-down , superannuated fellow -- left him at the wheel , at the foot of 63 , to run off the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 67]: The ancient mariner went up through the chute , and down the river outside ; and up the chute and down the river again ; and yet again and again ; and handed the boat over to the relieving pilot , at the end of three hours of honest endeavor , at the same old foot of the island where he had originally taken the wheel !
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 44]: A darkey on shore who had observed the boat go by , about thirteen times , said , ` clar to gracious , I would n't be s ` prised if dey 's a whole line o ' dem Sk ` ylarks ! '
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 12]: Anecdote illustrative of influence of reputation in the changing of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 10]: The ` Eclipse ' was renowned for her swiftness .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 26]: One day she passed along ; an old darkey on shore , absorbed in his own matters , did not notice what steamer it was .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 11]: Presently someone asked -- ` Any boat gone up ? '
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 6]: ` Yes , sah . '
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 7]: ` Was she going fast ? '
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 10]: ` Oh , so-so -- loafin ' along . '
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 12]: ` Now , do you know what boat that was ? '
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 6]: ` No , sah . '
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 13]: ` Why , uncle , that was the `` Eclipse . '' '
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 4]: Is dat so ?
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 18]: Well , I bet it was -- cause she jes ' went by here a-SPARKLIN ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 52]: Piece of history illustrative of the violent style of some of the people down along here , During the early weeks of high water , A 's fence rails washed down on B 's ground , and B 's rails washed up in the eddy and landed on A 's ground .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 22]: A said , ` Let the thing remain so ; I will use your rails , and you use mine . '
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: But B objected -- would n't have it so .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 15]: One day , A came down on B 's ground to get his rails .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 10]: B said , ` I 'll kill you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 8]: and proceeded for him with his revolver .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 10]: A said , ` I 'm not armed . '
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 47]: So B , who wished to do only what was right , threw down his revolver ; then pulled a knife , and cut A 's throat all around , but gave his principal attention to the front , and so failed to sever the jugular .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 28]: Struggling around , A managed to get his hands on the discarded revolver , and shot B dead with it -- and recovered from his own injuries .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 50]: Further gossip ; -- after which , everybody went below to get afternoon coffee , and left me at the wheel , alone , Something presently reminded me of our last hour in St. Louis , part of which I spent on this boat 's hurricane deck , aft .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 45]: I was joined there by a stranger , who dropped into conversation with me -- a brisk young fellow , who said he was born in a town in the interior of Wisconsin , and had never seen a steamboat until a week before .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 36]: Also said that on the way down from La Crosse he had inspected and examined his boat so diligently and with such passionate interest that he had mastered the whole thing from stem to rudder-blade .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 7]: Asked me where I was from .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 6]: I answered , New England .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 7]: ` Oh , a Yank ! '
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 16]: said he ; and went chatting straight along , without waiting for assent or denial .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 26]: He immediately proposed to take me all over the boat and tell me the names of her different parts , and teach me their uses .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 58]: Before I could enter protest or excuse , he was already rattling glibly away at his benevolent work ; and when I perceived that he was misnaming the things , and inhospitably amusing himself at the expense of an innocent stranger from a far country , I held my peace , and let him have his way .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 31]: He gave me a world of misinformation ; and the further he went , the wider his imagination expanded , and the more he enjoyed his cruel work of deceit .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 44]: Sometimes , after palming off a particularly fantastic and outrageous lie upon me , he was so ` full of laugh ' that he had to step aside for a minute , upon one pretext or another , to keep me from suspecting .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 11]: I staid faithfully by him until his comedy was finished .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 40]: Then he remarked that he had undertaken to ` learn ' me all about a steamboat , and had done it ; but that if he had overlooked anything , just ask him and he would supply the lack .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 29]: ` Anything about this boat that you do n't know the name of or the purpose of , you come to me and I 'll tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 26]: I said I would , and took my departure ; disappeared , and approached him from another quarter , whence he could not see me .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 24]: There he sat , all alone , doubling himself up and writhing this way and that , in the throes of unappeasable laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 18]: He must have made himself sick ; for he was not publicly visible afterward for several days .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 10]: Meantime , the episode dropped out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 43]: The thing that reminded me of it now , when I was alone at the wheel , was the spectacle of this young fellow standing in the pilot-house door , with the knob in his hand , silently and severely inspecting me .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 16]: I do n't know when I have seen anybody look so injured as he did .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 17]: He did not say anything -- simply stood there and looked ; reproachfully looked and pondered .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 62]: Finally he shut the door , and started away ; halted on the texas a minute ; came slowly back and stood in the door again , with that grieved look in his face ; gazed upon me awhile in meek rebuke , then said -- ` You let me learn you all about a steamboat , did n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' I confessed .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 11]: ` Yes , you did -- DID N'T you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 13]: ` You are the feller that -- that -- ' Language failed .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 27]: Pause -- impotent struggle for further words -- then he gave it up , choked out a deep , strong oath , and departed for good .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 22]: Afterward I saw him several times below during the trip ; but he was cold -- would not look at me .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 46]: Idiot , if he had not been in such a sweat to play his witless practical joke upon me , in the beginning , I would have persuaded his thoughts into some other direction , and saved him from committing that wanton and silly impoliteness .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 25]: I had myself called with the four o'clock watch , mornings , for one can not see too many summer sunrises on the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 4]: They are enchanting .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 16]: First , there is the eloquence of silence ; for a deep hush broods everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 22]: Next , there is the haunting sense of loneliness , isolation , remoteness from the worry and bustle of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 64]: The dawn creeps in stealthily ; the solid walls of black forest soften to gray , and vast stretches of the river open up and reveal themselves ; the water is glass-smooth , gives off spectral little wreaths of white mist , there is not the faintest breath of wind , nor stir of leaf ; the tranquillity is profound and infinitely satisfying .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 21]: Then a bird pipes up , another follows , and soon the pipings develop into a jubilant riot of music .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 21]: You see none of the birds ; you simply move through an atmosphere of song which seems to sing itself .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 20]: When the light has become a little stronger , you have one of the fairest and softest pictures imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 92]: You have the intense green of the massed and crowded foliage near by ; you see it paling shade by shade in front of you ; upon the next projecting cape , a mile off or more , the tint has lightened to the tender young green of spring ; the cape beyond that one has almost lost color , and the furthest one , miles away under the horizon , sleeps upon the water a mere dim vapor , and hardly separable from the sky above it and about it .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 31]: And all this stretch of river is a mirror , and you have the shadowy reflections of the leafage and the curving shores and the receding capes pictured in it .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 57]: Well , that is all beautiful ; soft and rich and beautiful ; and when the sun gets well up , and distributes a pink flush here and a powder of gold yonder and a purple haze where it will yield the best effect , you grant that you have seen something that is worth remembering .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 41]: We had the Kentucky Bend country in the early morning -- scene of a strange and tragic accident in the old times , Captain Poe had a small stern-wheel boat , for years the home of himself and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 33]: One night the boat struck a snag in the head of Kentucky Bend , and sank with astonishing suddenness ; water already well above the cabin floor when the captain got aft .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 45]: So he cut into his wife 's state-room from above with an ax ; she was asleep in the upper berth , the roof a flimsier one than was supposed ; the first blow crashed down through the rotten boards and clove her skull .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 44]: This bend is all filled up now -- result of a cut-off ; and the same agent has taken the great and once much-frequented Walnut Bend , and set it away back in a solitude far from the accustomed track of passing steamers .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 24]: Helena we visited , and also a town I had not heard of before , it being of recent birth -- Arkansas City .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 21]: It was born of a railway ; the Little Rock , Mississippi River and Texas Railroad touches the river there .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 15]: We asked a passenger who belonged there what sort of a place it was .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 35]: ` Well , ' said he , after considering , and with the air of one who wishes to take time and be accurate , ` It 's a hell of a place . '
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 8]: A description which was photographic for exactness .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 39]: There were several rows and clusters of shabby frame-houses , and a supply of mud sufficient to insure the town against a famine in that article for a hundred years ; for the overflow had but lately subsided .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 47]: There were stagnant ponds in the streets , here and there , and a dozen rude scows were scattered about , lying aground wherever they happened to have been when the waters drained off and people could do their visiting and shopping on foot once more .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 35]: Still , it is a thriving place , with a rich country behind it , an elevator in front of it , and also a fine big mill for the manufacture of cotton-seed oil .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 11]: I had never seen this kind of a mill before .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 29]: Cotton-seed was comparatively valueless in my time ; but it is worth $ 12 or $ 13 a ton now , and none of it is thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 17]: The oil made from it is colorless , tasteless , and almost if not entirely odorless .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 39]: It is claimed that it can , by proper manipulation , be made to resemble and perform the office of any and all oils , and be produced at a cheaper rate than the cheapest of the originals .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 21]: Sagacious people shipped it to Italy , doctored it , labeled it , and brought it back as olive oil .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 30]: This trade grew to be so formidable that Italy was obliged to put a prohibitory impost upon it to keep it from working serious injury to her oil industry .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 11]: Helena occupies one of the prettiest situations on the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 21]: Her perch is the last , the southernmost group of hills which one sees on that side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 56]: In its normal condition it is a pretty town ; but the flood -LRB- or possibly the seepage -RRB- had lately been ravaging it ; whole streets of houses had been invaded by the muddy water , and the outsides of the buildings were still belted with a broad stain extending upwards from the foundations .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 71]: Stranded and discarded scows lay all about ; plank sidewalks on stilts four feet high were still standing ; the board sidewalks on the ground level were loose and ruinous , -- a couple of men trotting along them could make a blind man think a cavalry charge was coming ; everywhere the mud was black and deep , and in many places malarious pools of stagnant water were standing .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 15]: A Mississippi inundation is the next most wasting and desolating infliction to a fire .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 24]: We had an enjoyable time here , on this sunny Sunday : two full hours ' liberty ashore while the boat discharged freight .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 55]: In the back streets but few white people were visible , but there were plenty of colored folk -- mainly women and girls ; and almost without exception upholstered in bright new clothes of swell and elaborate style and cut -- a glaring and hilarious contrast to the mournful mud and the pensive puddles .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 20]: Helena is the second town in Arkansas , in point of population -- which is placed at five thousand .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 8]: The country about it is exceptionally productive .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 48]: Helena has a good cotton trade ; handles from forty to sixty thousand bales annually ; she has a large lumber and grain commerce ; has a foundry , oil mills , machine shops and wagon factories -- in brief has $ 1,000,000 invested in manufacturing industries .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 17]: She has two railways , and is the commercial center of a broad and prosperous region .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 25]: Her gross receipts of money , annually , from all sources , are placed by the New Orleans ` Times-Democrat ' at $ 4,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 16]: Chapter 31 A Thumb-print and What Came of It WE were approaching Napoleon , Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 10]: So I began to think about my errand there .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 9]: Time , noonday ; and bright and sunny .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 22]: This was bad -- not best , anyway ; for mine was not -LRB- preferably -RRB- a noonday kind of errand .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 23]: The more I thought , the more that fact pushed itself upon me -- now in one form , now in another .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 47]: Finally , it took the form of a distinct question : is it good common sense to do the errand in daytime , when , by a little sacrifice of comfort and inclination , you can have night for it , and no inquisitive eyes around .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 4]: This settled it .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 14]: Plain question and plain answer make the shortest road out of most perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 39]: I got my friends into my stateroom , and said I was sorry to create annoyance and disappointment , but that upon reflection it really seemed best that we put our luggage ashore and stop over at Napoleon .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 11]: Their disapproval was prompt and loud ; their language mutinous .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 73]: Their main argument was one which has always been the first to come to the surface , in such cases , since the beginning of time : ` But you decided and AGREED to stick to this boat , etc. ; as if , having determined to do an unwise thing , one is thereby bound to go ahead and make TWO unwise things of it , by carrying out that determination .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 74]: I tried various mollifying tactics upon them , with reasonably good success : under which encouragement , I increased my efforts ; and , to show them that I had not created this annoying errand , and was in no way to blame for it , I presently drifted into its history -- substantially as follows : Toward the end of last year , I spent a few months in Munich , Bavaria .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 38]: In November I was living in Fraulein Dahlweiner 's PENSION , 1a , Karlstrasse ; but my working quarters were a mile from there , in the house of a widow who supported herself by taking lodgers .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 21]: She and her two young children used to drop in every morning and talk German to me -- by request .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 41]: One day , during a ramble about the city , I visited one of the two establishments where the Government keeps and watches corpses until the doctors decide that they are permanently dead , and not in a trance state .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 10]: It was a grisly place , that spacious room .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 41]: There were thirty-six corpses of adults in sight , stretched on their backs on slightly slanted boards , in three long rows -- all of them with wax-white , rigid faces , and all of them wrapped in white shrouds .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 42]: Along the sides of the room were deep alcoves , like bay windows ; and in each of these lay several marble-visaged babes , utterly hidden and buried under banks of fresh flowers , all but their faces and crossed hands .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 95]: Around a finger of each of these fifty still forms , both great and small , was a ring ; and from the ring a wire led to the ceiling , and thence to a bell in a watch-room yonder , where , day and night , a watchman sits always alert and ready to spring to the aid of any of that pallid company who , waking out of death , shall make a movement -- for any , even the slightest , movement will twitch the wire and ring that fearful bell .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 42]: I imagined myself a death-sentinel drowsing there alone , far in the dragging watches of some wailing , gusty night , and having in a twinkling all my body stricken to quivering jelly by the sudden clamor of that awful summons !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 12]: So I inquired about this thing ; asked what resulted usually ?
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 22]: if the watchman died , and the restored corpse came and did what it could to make his last moments easy .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 31]: But I was rebuked for trying to feed an idle and frivolous curiosity in so solemn and so mournful a place ; and went my way with a humbled crest .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 19]: Next morning I was telling the widow my adventure , when she exclaimed -- ` Come with me !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 14]: I have a lodger who shall tell you all you want to know .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 8]: He has been a night-watchman there . '
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 13]: He was a living man , but he did not look it .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 44]: He was abed , and had his head propped high on pillows ; his face was wasted and colorless , his deep-sunken eyes were shut ; his hand , lying on his breast , was talon-like , it was so bony and long-fingered .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 8]: The widow began her introduction of me .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 35]: The man 's eyes opened slowly , and glittered wickedly out from the twilight of their caverns ; he frowned a black frown ; he lifted his lean hand and waved us peremptorily away .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 23]: But the widow kept straight on , till she had got out the fact that I was a stranger and an American .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 25]: The man 's face changed at once ; brightened , became even eager -- and the next moment he and I were alone together .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 24]: I opened up in cast-iron German ; he responded in quite flexible English ; thereafter we gave the German language a permanent rest .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 8]: This consumptive and I became good friends .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 12]: I visited him every day , and we talked about everything .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 10]: At least , about everything but wives and children .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 116]: Let anybody 's wife or anybody 's child be mentioned , and three things always followed : the most gracious and loving and tender light glimmered in the man 's eyes for a moment ; faded out the next , and in its place came that deadly look which had flamed there the first time I ever saw his lids unclose ; thirdly , he ceased from speech , there and then for that day ; lay silent , abstracted , and absorbed ; apparently heard nothing that I said ; took no notice of my good-byes , and plainly did not know , by either sight or hearing , when I left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 32]: When I had been this Karl Ritter 's daily and sole intimate during two months , he one day said , abruptly -- ' I will tell you my story . '
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 22]: A DYING MAN S CONFESSION Then he went on as follows : -- I have never given up , until now .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 7]: But now I have given up .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 6]: I am going to die .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 18]: I made up my mind last night that it must be , and very soon , too .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 17]: You say you are going to revisit your river , by-and-bye , when you find opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 67]: Very well ; that , together with a certain strange experience which fell to my lot last night , determines me to tell you my history -- for you will see Napoleon , Arkansas ; and for my sake you will stop there , and do a certain thing for me -- a thing which you will willingly undertake after you shall have heard my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 18]: Let us shorten the story wherever we can , for it will need it , being long .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 25]: You already know how I came to go to America , and how I came to settle in that lonely region in the South .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 11]: But you do not know that I had a wife .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 20]: My wife was young , beautiful , loving , and oh , so divinely good and blameless and gentle !
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 10]: And our little girl was her mother in miniature .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 8]: It was the happiest of happy households .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 35]: One night -- it was toward the close of the war -- I woke up out of a sodden lethargy , and found myself bound and gagged , and the air tainted with chloroform !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 76]: I saw two men in the room , and one was saying to the other , in a hoarse whisper , ' I told her I would , if she made a noise , and as for the child -- ' The other man interrupted in a low , half-crying voice -- ` You said we 'd only gag them and rob them , not hurt them ; or I would n't have come . '
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 37]: ` Shut up your whining ; had to change the plan when they waked up ; you done all you could to protect them , now let that satisfy you ; come , help rummage . '
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 42]: Both men were masked , and wore coarse , ragged ` nigger ' clothes ; they had a bull 's - eye lantern , and by its light I noticed that the gentler robber had no thumb on his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 37]: They rummaged around my poor cabin for a moment ; the head bandit then said , in his stage whisper -- ` It 's a waste of time -- he shall tell where it 's hid .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 10]: Undo his gag , and revive him up . '
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 13]: The other said -- ` All right -- provided no clubbing . '
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 14]: ` No clubbing it is , then -- provided he keeps still . '
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 47]: They approached me ; just then there was a sound outside ; a sound of voices and trampling hoofs ; the robbers held their breath and listened ; the sounds came slowly nearer and nearer ; then came a shout -- ` HELLO , the house !
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 9]: Show a light , we want water . '
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 11]: ` The captain 's voice , by G -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 28]: said the stage-whispering ruffian , and both robbers fled by the way of the back door , shutting off their bull 's - eye as they ran .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 27]: The strangers shouted several times more , then rode by -- there seemed to be a dozen of the horses -- and I heard nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 12]: I struggled , but could not free myself from my bonds .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 18]: I tried to speak , but the gag was effective ; I could not make a sound .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 33]: I listened for my wife 's voice and my child 's -- listened long and intently , but no sound came from the other end of the room where their bed was .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 16]: This silence became more and more awful , more and more ominous , every moment .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 13]: Could you have endured an hour of it , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 11]: Pity me , then , who had to endure three .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 4]: Three hours -- ?
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 5]: it was three ages !
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 20]: Whenever the clock struck , it seemed as if years had gone by since I had heard it last .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 31]: All this time I was struggling in my bonds ; and at last , about dawn , I got myself free , and rose up and stretched my stiff limbs .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 9]: I was able to distinguish details pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 18]: The floor was littered with things thrown there by the robbers during their search for my savings .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 30]: The first object that caught my particular attention was a document of mine which I had seen the rougher of the two ruffians glance at and then cast away .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 6]: It had blood on it !
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 10]: I staggered to the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 19]: Oh , poor unoffending , helpless ones , there they lay , their troubles ended , mine begun !
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 9]: Did I appeal to the law -- I ?
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 14]: Does it quench the pauper 's thirst if the King drink for him ?
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 17]: Oh , no , no , no -- I wanted no impertinent interference of the law .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 15]: Laws and the gallows could not pay the debt that was owing to me !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 25]: Let the laws leave the matter in my hands , and have no fears : I would find the debtor and collect the debt .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 8]: How accomplish this , do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 36]: How accomplish it , and feel so sure about it , when I had neither seen the robbers ' faces , nor heard their natural voices , nor had any idea who they might be ?
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 12]: Nevertheless , I WAS sure -- quite sure , quite confident .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 38]: I had a clue -- a clue which you would not have valued -- a clue which would not have greatly helped even a detective , since he would lack the secret of how to apply it .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 12]: I shall come to that , presently -- you shall see .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: Let us go on , now , taking things in their due order .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 69]: There was one circumstance which gave me a slant in a definite direction to begin with : Those two robbers were manifestly soldiers in tramp disguise ; and not new to military service , but old in it -- regulars , perhaps ; they did not acquire their soldierly attitude , gestures , carriage , in a day , nor a month , nor yet in a year .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 8]: So I thought , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 18]: And one of them had said , ` the captain 's voice , by G -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 9]: -- the one whose life I would have .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 17]: Two miles away , several regiments were in camp , and two companies of U.S. cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 37]: When I learned that Captain Blakely , of Company C had passed our way , that night , with an escort , I said nothing , but in that company I resolved to seek my man .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 32]: In conversation I studiously and persistently described the robbers as tramps , camp followers ; and among this class the people made useless search , none suspecting the soldiers but me .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 38]: Working patiently , by night , in my desolated home , I made a disguise for myself out of various odds and ends of clothing ; in the nearest village I bought a pair of blue goggles .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 41]: By-and-bye , when the military camp broke up , and Company C was ordered a hundred miles north , to Napoleon , I secreted my small hoard of money in my belt , and took my departure in the night .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 12]: When Company C arrived in Napoleon , I was already there .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 13]: Yes , I was there , with a new trade -- fortune-teller .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 30]: Not to seem partial , I made friends and told fortunes among all the companies garrisoned there ; but I gave Company C the great bulk of my attentions .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 28]: I made myself limitlessly obliging to these particular men ; they could ask me no favor , put upon me no risk , which I would decline .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 19]: I became the willing butt of their jokes ; this perfected my popularity ; I became a favorite .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 17]: I early found a private who lacked a thumb -- what joy it was to me !
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 33]: And when I found that he alone , of all the company , had lost a thumb , my last misgiving vanished ; I was SURE I was on the right track .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 10]: This man 's name was Kruger , a German .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 8]: There were nine Germans in the company .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 20]: I watched , to see who might be his intimates ; but he seemed to have no especial intimates .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 16]: But I was his intimate ; and I took care to make the intimacy grow .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 42]: Sometimes I so hungered for my revenge that I could hardly restrain myself from going on my knees and begging him to point out the man who had murdered my wife and child ; but I managed to bridle my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 15]: I bided my time , and went on telling fortunes , as opportunity offered .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 16]: My apparatus was simple : a little red paint and a bit of white paper .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 33]: I painted the ball of the client 's thumb , took a print of it on the paper , studied it that night , and revealed his fortune to him next day .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 8]: What was my idea in this nonsense ?
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 75]: It was this : When I was a youth , I knew an old Frenchman who had been a prison-keeper for thirty years , and he told me that there was one thing about a person which never changed , from the cradle to the grave -- the lines in the ball of the thumb ; and he said that these lines were never exactly alike in the thumbs of any two human beings .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 53]: In these days , we photograph the new criminal , and hang his picture in the Rogues ' Gallery for future reference ; but that Frenchman , in his day , used to take a print of the ball of a new prisoner 's thumb and put that away for future reference .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 37]: He always said that pictures were no good -- future disguises could make them useless ; ` The thumb 's the only sure thing , ' said he ; ` you ca n't disguise that . '
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 20]: And he used to prove his theory , too , on my friends and acquaintances ; it always succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 6]: I went on telling fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 20]: Every night I shut myself in , all alone , and studied the day 's thumb-prints with a magnifying-glass .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 47]: Imagine the devouring eagerness with which I pored over those mazy red spirals , with that document by my side which bore the right-hand thumb-and-finger-marks of that unknown murderer , printed with the dearest blood -- to me -- that was ever shed on this earth !
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 23]: And many and many a time I had to repeat the same old disappointed remark , ` will they NEVER correspond ! '
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 7]: But my reward came at last .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 24]: It was the print of the thumb of the forty-third man of Company C whom I had experimented on -- Private Franz Adler .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 33]: An hour before , I did not know the murderer 's name , or voice , or figure , or face , or nationality ; but now I knew all these things !
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 18]: I believed I might feel sure ; the Frenchman 's repeated demonstrations being so good a warranty .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 10]: Still , there was a way to MAKE sure .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 10]: I had an impression of Kruger 's left thumb .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 58]: In the morning I took him aside when he was off duty ; and when we were out of sight and hearing of witnesses , I said , impressively -- ' A part of your fortune is so grave , that I thought it would be better for you if I did not tell it in public .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 27]: You and another man , whose fortune I was studying last night , -- Private Adler , -- have been murdering a woman and a child !
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 16]: You are being dogged : within five days both of you will be assassinated . '
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 86]: He dropped on his knees , frightened out of his wits ; and for five minutes he kept pouring out the same set of words , like a demented person , and in the same half-crying way which was one of my memories of that murderous night in my cabin -- ' I did n't do it ; upon my soul I did n't do it ; and I tried to keep HIM from doing it ; I did , as God is my witness .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 6]: He did it alone . '
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 6]: This was all I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 27]: And I tried to get rid of the fool ; but no , he clung to me , imploring me to save him from the assassin .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 40]: He said -- ' I have money -- ten thousand dollars -- hid away , the fruit of loot and thievery ; save me -- tell me what to do , and you shall have it , every penny .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 16]: Two-thirds of it is my cousin Adler 's ; but you can take it all .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 9]: We hid it when we first came here .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 21]: But I hid it in a new place yesterday , and have not told him -- shall not tell him .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 13]: I was going to desert , and get away with it all .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 77]: It is gold , and too heavy to carry when one is running and dodging ; but a woman who has been gone over the river two days to prepare my way for me is going to follow me with it ; and if I got no chance to describe the hiding-place to her I was going to slip my silver watch into her hand , or send it to her , and she would understand .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 18]: There 's a piece of paper in the back of the case , which tells it all .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 13]: Here , take the watch -- tell me what to do ! '
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 34]: He was trying to press his watch upon me , and was exposing the paper and explaining it to me , when Adler appeared on the scene , about a dozen yards away .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 18]: I said to poor Kruger -- ` Put up your watch , I do n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 8]: You sha n't come to any harm .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 11]: Go , now ; I must tell Adler his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 21]: Presently I will tell you how to escape the assassin ; meantime I shall have to examine your thumbmark again .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 14]: Say nothing to Adler about this thing -- say nothing to anybody . '
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 12]: He went away filled with fright and gratitude , poor devil .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 56]: I told Adler a long fortune -- purposely so long that I could not finish it ; promised to come to him on guard , that night , and tell him the really important part of it -- the tragical part of it , I said -- so must be out of reach of eavesdroppers .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 23]: They always kept a picket-watch outside the town -- mere discipline and ceremony -- no occasion for it , no enemy around .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 27]: Toward midnight I set out , equipped with the countersign , and picked my way toward the lonely region where Adler was to keep his watch .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 22]: It was so dark that I stumbled right on a dim figure almost before I could get out a protecting word .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 13]: The sentinel hailed and I answered , both at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 13]: I added , ` It 's only me -- the fortune-teller . '
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 22]: Then I slipped to the poor devil 's side , and without a word I drove my dirk into his heart !
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 17]: YA WOHL , laughed I , it WAS the tragedy part of his fortune , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 36]: As he fell from his horse , he clutched at me , and my blue goggles remained in his hand ; and away plunged the beast dragging him , with his foot in the stirrup .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 25]: I fled through the woods , and made good my escape , leaving the accusing goggles behind me in that dead man 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 8]: This was fifteen or sixteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 81]: Since then I have wandered aimlessly about the earth , sometimes at work , sometimes idle ; sometimes with money , sometimes with none ; but always tired of life , and wishing it was done , for my mission here was finished , with the act of that night ; and the only pleasure , solace , satisfaction I had , in all those tedious years , was in the daily reflection , ' I have killed him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 10]: Four years ago , my health began to fail .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 11]: I had wandered into Munich , in my purposeless way .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 39]: Being out of money , I sought work , and got it ; did my duty faithfully about a year , and was then given the berth of night watchman yonder in that dead-house which you visited lately .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 6]: The place suited my mood .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 4]: I liked it .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 13]: I liked being with the dead -- liked being alone with them .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 20]: I used to wander among those rigid corpses , and peer into their austere faces , by the hour .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 17]: The later the time , the more impressive it was ; I preferred the late time .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 37]: Sometimes I turned the lights low : this gave perspective , you see ; and the imagination could play ; always , the dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one with weird and fascinating fancies .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 75]: Two years ago -- I had been there a year then -- I was sitting all alone in the watch-room , one gusty winter 's night , chilled , numb , comfortless ; drowsing gradually into unconsciousness ; the sobbing of the wind and the slamming of distant shutters falling fainter and fainter upon my dulling ear each moment , when sharp and suddenly that dead-bell rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my head !
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 20]: The shock of it nearly paralyzed me ; for it was the first time I had ever heard it .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 10]: I gathered myself together and flew to the corpse-room .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 29]: About midway down the outside rank , a shrouded figure was sitting upright , wagging its head slowly from one side to the other -- a grisly spectacle !
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 6]: Its side was toward me .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 10]: I hurried to it and peered into its face .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 6]: Heavens , it was Adler !
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 9]: Can you divine what my first thought was ?
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 29]: Put into words , it was this : ` It seems , then , you escaped me once : there will be a different result this time ! '
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 8]: Evidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 29]: Think what it must have been to wake up in the midst of that voiceless hush , and , look out over that grim congregation of the dead !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 17]: What gratitude shone in his skinny white face when he saw a living form before him !
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 25]: And how the fervency of this mute gratitude was augmented when his eyes fell upon the life-giving cordials which I carried in my hands !
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 34]: Then imagine the horror which came into this pinched face when I put the cordials behind me , and said mockingly -- ` Speak up , Franz Adler -- call upon these dead .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 18]: Doubtless they will listen and have pity ; but here there is none else that will . '
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 24]: He tried to speak , but that part of the shroud which bound his jaws , held firm and would not let him .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 17]: He tried to lift imploring hands , but they were crossed upon his breast and tied .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 22]: I said -- ` Shout , Franz Adler ; make the sleepers in the distant streets hear you and bring help .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 14]: Shout -- and lose no time , for there is little to lose .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 6]: What , you can not ?
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 18]: That is a pity ; but it is no matter -- it does not always bring help .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 27]: When you and your cousin murdered a helpless woman and child in a cabin in Arkansas -- my wife , it was , and my child !
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 28]: -- they shrieked for help , you remember ; but it did no good ; you remember that it did no good , is it not so ?
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 11]: Your teeth chatter -- then why can not you shout ?
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 11]: Loosen the bandages with your hands -- then you can .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 16]: Ah , I see -- your hands are tied , they can not aid you .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 22]: How strangely things repeat themselves , after long years ; for MY hands were tied , that night , you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 14]: Yes , tied much as yours are now -- how odd that is .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 6]: I could not pull free .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 20]: It did not occur to you to untie me ; it does not occur to me to untie you .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 3]: Sh -- !
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 6]: there 's a late footstep .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 6]: It is coming this way .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 7]: Hark , how near it is !
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 12]: One can count the footfalls -- one -- two -- three .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 7]: There -- it is just outside .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 5]: Now is the time !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 6]: Shout , man , shout !
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 12]: -- it is the one sole chance between you and eternity !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 15]: Ah , you see you have delayed too long -- it is gone by .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 7]: There -- it is dying out .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 4]: It is gone !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 19]: Think of it -- reflect upon it -- you have heard a human footstep for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 30]: How curious it must be , to listen to so common a sound as that , and know that one will never hear the fellow to it again . '
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 16]: Oh , my friend , the agony in that shrouded face was ecstasy to see !
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 47]: I thought of a new torture , and applied it -- assisting myself with a trifle of lying invention -- ` That poor Kruger tried to save my wife and child , and I did him a grateful good turn for it when the time came .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 25]: I persuaded him to rob you ; and I and a woman helped him to desert , and got him away in safety . '
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 19]: A look as of surprise and triumph shone out dimly through the anguish in my victim 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 6]: I was disturbed , disquieted .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 14]: I said -- ` What , then -- did n't he escape ? '
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 7]: A negative shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 3]: ` No ?
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 6]: What happened , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 10]: The satisfaction in the shrouded face was still plainer .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 47]: The man tried to mumble out some words -- could not succeed ; tried to express something with his obstructed hands -- failed ; paused a moment , then feebly tilted his head , in a meaning way , toward the corpse that lay nearest him .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 4]: ` Dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 5]: ` Failed to escape ?
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 9]: -- caught in the act and shot ? '
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 6]: Negative shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: ` How , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 11]: Again the man tried to do something with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 11]: I watched closely , but could not guess the intent .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 9]: I bent over and watched still more intently .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 16]: He had twisted a thumb around and was weakly punching at his breast with it .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 10]: ` Ah -- stabbed , do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 39]: Affirmative nod , accompanied by a spectral smile of such peculiar devilishness , that it struck an awakening light through my dull brain , and I cried -- ` Did I stab him , mistaking him for you ?
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 12]: -- for that stroke was meant for none but you . '
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 22]: The affirmative nod of the re-dying rascal was as joyous as his failing strength was able to put into its expression .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 35]: ` O , miserable , miserable me , to slaughter the pitying soul that , stood a friend to my darlings when they were helpless , and would have saved them if he could !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 10]: miserable , oh , miserable , miserable me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 12]: I fancied I heard the muffled gurgle of a mocking laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 20]: I took my face out of my hands , and saw my enemy sinking back upon his inclined board .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 8]: He was a satisfactory long time dying .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 10]: He had a wonderful vitality , an astonishing constitution .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: Yes , he was a pleasant long time at it .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 16]: I got a chair and a newspaper , and sat down by him and read .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 8]: Occasionally I took a sip of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 10]: This was necessary , on account of the cold .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 31]: But I did it partly because I saw , that along at first , whenever I reached for the bottle , he thought I was going to give him some .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 32]: I read aloud : mainly imaginary accounts of people snatched from the grave 's threshold and restored to life and vigor by a few spoonsful of liquor and a warm bath .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 26]: Yes , he had a long , hard death of it -- three hours and six minutes , from the time he rang his bell .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 32]: It is believed that in all these eighteen years that have elapsed since the institution of the corpse-watch , no shrouded occupant of the Bavarian dead-houses has ever rung its bell .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 8]: Well , it is a harmless belief .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: Let it stand at that .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 10]: The chill of that death-room had penetrated my bones .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 27]: It revived and fastened upon me the disease which had been afflicting me , but which , up to that night , had been steadily disappearing .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 23]: That man murdered my wife and my child ; and in three days hence he will have added me to his list .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 5]: No matter -- God !
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 7]: how delicious the memory of it !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 16]: -- I caught him escaping from his grave , and thrust him back into it .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 42]: After that night , I was confined to my bed for a week ; but as soon as I could get about , I went to the dead-house books and got the number of the house which Adler had died in .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 7]: A wretched lodging-house , it was .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 33]: It was my idea that he would naturally have gotten hold of Kruger 's effects , being his cousin ; and I wanted to get Kruger 's watch , if I could .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 31]: But while I was sick , Adler 's things had been sold and scattered , all except a few old letters , and some odds and ends of no value .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 20]: However , through those letters , I traced out a son of Kruger 's , the only relative left .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 29]: He is a man of thirty now , a shoemaker by trade , and living at No. 14 Konigstrasse , Mannheim -- widower , with several small children .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 17]: Without explaining to him why , I have furnished two-thirds of his support , ever since .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 13]: Now , as to that watch -- see how strangely things happen !
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 28]: I traced it around and about Germany for more than a year , at considerable cost in money and vexation ; and at last I got it .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 17]: Got it , and was unspeakably glad ; opened it , and found nothing in it !
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 21]: Why , I might have known that that bit of paper was not going to stay there all this time .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 37]: Of course I gave up that ten thousand dollars then ; gave it up , and dropped it out of my mind : and most sorrowfully , for I had wanted it for Kruger 's son .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 19]: Last night , when I consented at last that I must die , I began to make ready .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 31]: I proceeded to burn all useless papers ; and sure enough , from a batch of Adler 's , not previously examined with thoroughness , out dropped that long-desired scrap !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 7]: I recognized it in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 27]: Here it is -- I will translate it : ` Brick livery stable , stone foundation , middle of town , corner of Orleans and Market .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 4]: Corner toward Court-house .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 6]: Third stone , fourth row .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 12]: Stick notice there , saying how many are to come . '
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 9]: There -- take it , and preserve it .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 33]: Kruger explained that that stone was removable ; and that it was in the north wall of the foundation , fourth row from the top , and third stone from the west .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 7]: The money is secreted behind it .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 21]: He said the closing sentence was a blind , to mislead in case the paper should fall into wrong hands .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 8]: It probably performed that office for Adler .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 41]: Now I want to beg that when you make your intended journey down the river , you will hunt out that hidden money , and send it to Adam Kruger , care of the Mannheim address which I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 65]: It will make a rich man of him , and I shall sleep the sounder in my grave for knowing that I have done what I could for the son of the man who tried to save my wife and child -- albeit my hand ignorantly struck him down , whereas the impulse of my heart would have been to shield and serve him .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 22]: Chapter 32 The Disposal of a Bonanza ` SUCH was Ritter 's narrative , ' said I to my two friends .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 57]: There was a profound and impressive silence , which lasted a considerable time ; then both men broke into a fusillade of exciting and admiring ejaculations over the strange incidents of the tale ; and this , along with a rattling fire of questions , was kept up until all hands were about out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 24]: Then my friends began to cool down , and draw off , under shelter of occasional volleys , into silence and abysmal reverie .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 9]: For ten minutes now , there was stillness .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 11]: Then Rogers said dreamily -- ` Ten thousand dollars . '
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 11]: Adding , after a considerable pause -- ` Ten thousand .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 8]: It is a heap of money . '
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 18]: Presently the poet inquired -- ` Are you going to send it to him right away ? '
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 8]: ` It is a queer question . '
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 3]: No reply .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 14]: After a little , Rogers asked , hesitatingly : ` ALL of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 16]: -- That is -- I mean -- ' ` Certainly , all of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 23]: I was going to say more , but stopped -- was stopped by a train of thought which started up in me .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 18]: Thompson spoke , but my mind was absent , and I did not catch what he said .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 15]: But I heard Rogers answer -- ` Yes , it seems so to me .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 19]: It ought to be quite sufficient ; for I do n't see that he has done anything . '
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 20]: Presently the poet said -- ` When you come to look at it , it is more than sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 9]: Just look at it -- five thousand dollars !
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 11]: Why , he could n't spend it in a lifetime !
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 19]: And it would injure him , too ; perhaps ruin him -- you want to look at that .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 69]: In a little while he would throw his last away , shut up his shop , maybe take to drinking , maltreat his motherless children , drift into other evil courses , go steadily from bad to worse -- ' ` Yes , that 's it , ' interrupted Rogers , fervently , ` I 've seen it a hundred times -- yes , more than a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 79]: You put money into the hands of a man like that , if you want to destroy him , that 's all ; just put money into his hands , it 's all you 've got to do ; and if it do n't pull him down , and take all the usefulness out of him , and all the self-respect and everything , then I do n't know human nature -- ai n't that so , Thompson ?
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 34]: And even if we were to give him a THIRD of it ; why , in less than six months -- ' ` Less than six WEEKS , you 'd better say ! '
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 9]: said I , warming up and breaking in .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 93]: ` Unless he had that three thousand dollars in safe hands where he could n't touch it , he would no more last you six weeks than -- ' ` Of COURSE he would n't , ' said Thompson ; ` I 've edited books for that kind of people ; and the moment they get their hands on the royalty -- maybe it 's three thousand , maybe it 's two thousand -- ' ` What business has that shoemaker with two thousand dollars , I should like to know ? '
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 7]: broke in Rogers , earnestly . '
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 46]: A man perhaps perfectly contented now , there in Mannheim , surrounded by his own class , eating his bread with the appetite which laborious industry alone can give , enjoying his humble life , honest , upright , pure in heart ; and BLEST !
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 7]: -- yes , I say blest !
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 30]: blest above all the myriads that go in silk attire and walk the empty artificial round of social folly -- but just you put that temptation before him once !
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 22]: just you lay fifteen hundred dollars before a man like that , and say -- ' ` Fifteen hundred devils ! '
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 46]: cried I , ` FIVE hundred would rot his principles , paralyze his industry , drag him to the rumshop , thence to the gutter , thence to the almshouse , thence to -- ' ` WHY put upon ourselves this crime , gentlemen ? '
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 7]: interrupted the poet earnestly and appealingly .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 13]: ` He is happy where he is , and AS he is .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 30]: Every sentiment of honor , every sentiment of charity , every sentiment of high and sacred benevolence warns us , beseeches us , commands us to leave him undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 10]: That is real friendship , that is true friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 27]: We could follow other courses that would be more showy ; but none that would be so truly kind and wise , depend upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 28]: After some further talk , it became evident that each of us , down in his heart , felt some misgivings over this settlement of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 17]: It was manifest that we all felt that we ought to send the poor shoemaker SOMETHING .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 20]: There was long and thoughtful discussion of this point ; and we finally decided to send him a chromo .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 37]: Well , now that everything seemed to be arranged satisfactorily to everybody concerned , a new trouble broke out : it transpired that these two men were expecting to share equally in the money with me .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 6]: That was not my idea .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 17]: I said that if they got half of it between them they might consider themselves lucky .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 17]: Rogers said -- ` Who would have had ANY if it had n't been for me ?
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 20]: I flung out the first hint -- but for that it would all have gone to the shoemaker . '
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 20]: Thompson said that he was thinking of the thing himself at the very moment that Rogers had originally spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 20]: I retorted that the idea would have occurred to me plenty soon enough , and without anybody 's help .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 13]: I was slow about thinking , maybe , but I was sure .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 21]: This matter warmed up into a quarrel ; then into a fight ; and each man got pretty badly battered .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 25]: As soon as I had got myself mended up after a fashion , I ascended to the hurricane deck in a pretty sour humor .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 27]: I found Captain McCord there , and said , as pleasantly as my humor would permit -- ' I have come to say good-bye , captain .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 9]: I wish to go ashore at Napoleon . '
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 6]: ` Go ashore where ? '
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 4]: ` Napoleon . '
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 27]: The captain laughed ; but seeing that I was not in a jovial mood , stopped that and said -- ` But are you serious ? '
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 3]: ` Serious ?
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 5]: I certainly am . '
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 20]: The captain glanced up at the pilot-house and said -- ` He wants to get off at Napoleon ! '
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 4]: ` Napoleon ? '
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 8]: ` That 's what he says . '
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 7]: ` Great Caesar 's ghost ! '
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 7]: Uncle Mumford approached along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 21]: The captain said -- ` Uncle , here 's a friend of yours wants to get off at Napoleon ! '
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 7]: ` Well , by -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 12]: I said -- ` Come , what is all this about ?
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 14]: Ca n't a man go ashore at Napoleon if he wants to ? '
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 11]: ` Why , hang it , do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 8]: There IS N'T any Napoleon any more .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 8]: Has n't been for years and years .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 21]: The Arkansas River burst through it , tore it all to rags , and emptied it into the Mississippi ! '
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 7]: ` Carried the WHOLE town away ?
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 21]: - banks , churches , jails , newspaper-offices , court-house , theater , fire department , livery stable EVERYTHING ? '
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 3]: ` Everything .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 6]: just a fifteen-minute job . '
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 5]: or such a matter .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 24]: Did n't leave hide nor hair , shred nor shingle of it , except the fag-end of a shanty and one brick chimney .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 29]: This boat is paddling along right now , where the dead-center of that town used to be ; yonder is the brick chimney-all that 's left of Napoleon .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 16]: These dense woods on the right used to be a mile back of the town .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 21]: Take a look behind you -- up-stream -- now you begin to recognize this country , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 9]: ` Yes , I do recognize it now .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 23]: It is the most wonderful thing I ever heard of ; by a long shot the most wonderful -- and unexpected . '
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 25]: Mr. Thompson and Mr. Rogers had arrived , meantime , with satchels and umbrellas , and had silently listened to the captain 's news .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 20]: Thompson put a half-dollar in my hand and said softly -- ` For my share of the chromo . '
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 4]: Rogers followed suit .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 34]: Yes , it was an astonishing thing to see the Mississippi rolling between unpeopled shores and straight over the spot where I used to see a good big self-complacent town twenty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 105]: Town that was county-seat of a great and important county ; town with a big United States marine hospital ; town of innumerable fights -- an inquest every day ; town where I had used to know the prettiest girl , and the most accomplished in the whole Mississippi Valley ; town where we were handed the first printed news of the ` Pennsylvania 's ' mournful disaster a quarter of a century ago ; a town no more -- swallowed up , vanished , gone to feed the fishes ; nothing left but a fragment of a shanty and a crumbling brick chimney !
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 43]: Chapter 33 Refreshments and Ethics IN regard to Island 74 , which is situated not far from the former Napoleon , a freak of the river here has sorely perplexed the laws of men and made them a vanity and a jest .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 24]: When the State of Arkansas was chartered , she controlled ` to the center of the river ' -- a most unstable line .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 17]: The State of Mississippi claimed ` to the channel ' -- another shifty and unstable line .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 6]: No. 74 belonged to Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 19]: By and by a cut-off threw this big island out of Arkansas , and yet not within Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 19]: ` Middle of the river ' on one side of it , ` channel ' on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 8]: That is as I understand the problem .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 55]: Whether I have got the details right or wrong , this FACT remains : that here is this big and exceedingly valuable island of four thousand acres , thrust out in the cold , and belonging to neither the one State nor the other ; paying taxes to neither , owing allegiance to neither .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 19]: One man owns the whole island , and of right is ` the man without a country . '
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 6]: Island 92 belongs to Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 11]: The river moved it over and joined it to Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 33]: A chap established a whiskey shop there , without a Mississippi license , and enriched himself upon Mississippi custom under Arkansas protection -LRB- where no license was in those days required -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 19]: We glided steadily down the river in the usual privacy -- steamboat or other moving thing seldom seen .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 22]: Scenery as always : stretch upon stretch of almost unbroken forest , on both sides of the river ; soundless solitude .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 47]: Here and there a cabin or two , standing in small openings on the gray and grassless banks -- cabins which had formerly stood a quarter or half-mile farther to the front , and gradually been pulled farther and farther back as the shores caved in .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 48]: As at Pilcher 's Point , for instance , where the cabins had been moved back three hundred yards in three months , so we were told ; but the caving banks had already caught up with them , and they were being conveyed rearward once more .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 63]: Napoleon had but small opinion of Greenville , Mississippi , in the old times ; but behold , Napoleon is gone to the cat-fishes , and here is Greenville full of life and activity , and making a considerable flourish in the Valley ; having three thousand inhabitants , it is said , and doing a gross trade of $ 2,500,000 annually .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 4]: A growing town .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 23]: There was much talk on the boat about the Calhoun Land Company , an enterprise which is expected to work wholesome results .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 41]: Colonel Calhoun , a grandson of the statesman , went to Boston and formed a syndicate which purchased a large tract of land on the river , in Chicot County , Arkansas -- some ten thousand acres -- for cotton-growing .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 60]: The purpose is to work on a cash basis : buy at first hands , and handle their own product ; supply their negro laborers with provisions and necessaries at a trifling profit , say 8 or 10 per cent. ; furnish them comfortable quarters , etc. , and encourage them to save money and remain on the place .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 35]: If this proves a financial success , as seems quite certain , they propose to establish a banking-house in Greenville , and lend money at an unburdensome rate of interest -- 6 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 4]: is spoken of .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 42]: The trouble heretofore has been -- I am quoting remarks of planters and steamboatmen -- that the planters , although owning the land , were without cash capital ; had to hypothecate both land and crop to carry on the business .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 30]: Consequently , the commission dealer who furnishes the money takes some risk and demands big interest -- usually 10 per cent. , and 2 -LCB- half -RCB- per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: for negotiating the loan .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 18]: The planter has also to buy his supplies through the same dealer , paying commissions and profits .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 17]: Then when he ships his crop , the dealer adds his commissions , insurance , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 27]: So , taking it by and large , and first and last , the dealer 's share of that crop is about 25 per cent . '
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 61]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- ` But what can the State do where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent. , and are also under the necessity of purchasing their crops in advance even of planting , at these rates , for the privilege of purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 3]: profit ? '
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 6]: -- EDWARD ATKINSON . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 60]: A cotton-planter 's estimate of the average margin of profit on planting , in his section : One man and mule will raise ten acres of cotton , giving ten bales cotton , worth , say , $ 500 ; cost of producing , say $ 350 ; net profit , $ 150 , or $ 15 per acre .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 23]: There is also a profit now from the cotton-seed , which formerly had little value -- none where much transportation was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 36]: In sixteen hundred pounds crude cotton four hundred are lint , worth , say , ten cents a pound ; and twelve hundred pounds of seed , worth $ 12 or $ 13 per ton .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 12]: Maybe in future even the stems will not be thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 80]: Mr. Edward Atkinson says that for each bale of cotton there are fifteen hundred pounds of stems , and that these are very rich in phosphate of lime and potash ; that when ground and mixed with ensilage or cotton-seed meal -LRB- which is too rich for use as fodder in large quantities -RRB- , the stem mixture makes a superior food , rich in all the elements needed for the production of milk , meat , and bone .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 9]: Heretofore the stems have been considered a nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 213]: Complaint is made that the planter remains grouty toward the former slave , since the war ; will have nothing but a chill business relation with him , no sentiment permitted to intrude , will not keep a ` store ' himself , and supply the negro 's wants and thus protect the negro 's pocket and make him able and willing to stay on the place and an advantage to him to do it , but lets that privilege to some thrifty Israelite , who encourages the thoughtless negro and wife to buy all sorts of things which they could do without -- buy on credit , at big prices , month after month , credit based on the negro 's share of the growing crop ; and at the end of the season , the negro 's share belongs to the Israelite , ' the negro is in debt besides , is discouraged , dissatisfied , restless , and both he and the planter are injured ; for he will take steamboat and migrate , and the planter must get a stranger in his place who does not know him , does not care for him , will fatten the Israelite a season , and follow his predecessor per steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 48]: It is hoped that the Calhoun Company will show , by its humane and protective treatment of its laborers , that its method is the most profitable for both planter and negro ; and it is believed that a general adoption of that method will then follow .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 15]: And where so many are saying their say , shall not the barkeeper testify ?
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 25]: He is thoughtful , observant , never drinks ; endeavors to earn his salary , and WOULD earn it if there were custom enough .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 38]: He says the people along here in Mississippi and Louisiana will send up the river to buy vegetables rather than raise them , and they will come aboard at the landings and buy fruits of the barkeeper .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 32]: Thinks they ` do n't know anything but cotton ; ' believes they do n't know how to raise vegetables and fruit -- ` at least the most of them . '
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 43]: Says ' a nigger will go to H for a watermelon ' -LRB- ` H ' is all I find in the stenographer 's report -- means Halifax probably , though that seems a good way to go for a watermelon -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 19]: Barkeeper buys watermelons for five cents up the river , brings them down and sells them for fifty .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 19]: ` Why does he mix such elaborate and picturesque drinks for the nigger hands on the boat ? '
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 8]: Because they wo n't have any other .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 26]: ` They want a big drink ; do n't make any difference what you make it of , they want the worth of their money .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 19]: You give a nigger a plain gill of half-a-dollar brandy for five cents -- will he touch it ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 7]: Ai n't size enough to it .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 45]: But you put up a pint of all kinds of worthless rubbish , and heave in some red stuff to make it beautiful -- red 's the main thing -- and he would n't put down that glass to go to a circus . '
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 15]: All the bars on this Anchor Line are rented and owned by one firm .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 18]: They furnish the liquors from their own establishment , and hire the barkeepers ` on salary . '
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 3]: Good liquors ?
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 24]: Yes , on some of the boats , where there are the kind of passengers that want it and can pay for it .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 5]: On the other boats ?
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 11]: Nobody but the deck hands and firemen to drink it .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 3]: ` Brandy ?
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 27]: Yes , I 've got brandy , plenty of it ; but you do n't want any of it unless you 've made your will . '
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 13]: It is n't as it used to be in the old times .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 15]: Then everybody traveled by steamboat , everybody drank , and everybody treated everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 16]: ` Now most everybody goes by railroad , and the rest do n't drink . '
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 42]: In the old times the barkeeper owned the bar himself , ` and was gay and smarty and talky and all jeweled up , and was the toniest aristocrat on the boat ; used to make $ 2,000 on a trip .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 15]: A father who left his son a steamboat bar , left him a fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 21]: Now he leaves him board and lodging ; yes , and washing , if a shirt a trip will do .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 8]: Yes , indeedy , times are changed .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 26]: Why , do you know , on the principal line of boats on the Upper Mississippi , they do n't have any bar at all !
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 12]: Sounds like poetry , but it 's the petrified truth . '
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 7]: Chapter 34 Tough Yarns STACK ISLAND .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 62]: I remembered Stack Island ; also Lake Providence , Louisiana -- which is the first distinctly Southern-looking town you come to , downward-bound ; lies level and low , shade-trees hung with venerable gray beards of Spanish moss ; ` restful , pensive , Sunday aspect about the place , ' comments Uncle Mumford , with feeling -- also with truth .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 31]: A Mr. H. furnished some minor details of fact concerning this region which I would have hesitated to believe if I had not known him to be a steamboat mate .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 27]: He was a passenger of ours , a resident of Arkansas City , and bound to Vicksburg to join his boat , a little Sunflower packet .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 20]: He was an austere man , and had the reputation of being singularly unworldly , for a river man .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 23]: Among other things , he said that Arkansas had been injured and kept back by generations of exaggerations concerning the mosquitoes here .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 66]: One may smile , said he , and turn the matter off as being a small thing ; but when you come to look at the effects produced , in the way of discouragement of immigration , and diminished values of property , it was quite the opposite of a small thing , or thing in any wise to be coughed down or sneered at .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 53]: These mosquitoes had been persistently represented as being formidable and lawless ; whereas ` the truth is , they are feeble , insignificant in size , diffident to a fault , sensitive ' -- and so on , and so on ; you would have supposed he was talking about his family .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 39]: But if he was soft on the Arkansas mosquitoes , he was hard enough on the mosquitoes of Lake Providence to make up for it -- ` those Lake Providence colossi , ' as he finely called them .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 42]: He said that two of them could whip a dog , and that four of them could hold a man down ; and except help come , they would kill him -- ` butcher him , ' as he expressed it .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 40]: Referred in a sort of casual way -- and yet significant way -- to ` the fact that the life policy in its simplest form is unknown in Lake Providence -- they take out a mosquito policy besides . '
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 10]: He told many remarkable things about those lawless insects .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 12]: Among others , said he had seen them try to vote .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 47]: Noticing that this statement seemed to be a good deal of a strain on us , he modified it a little : said he might have been mistaken , as to that particular , but knew he had seen them around the polls ` canvassing . '
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 32]: There was another passenger -- friend of H. 's -- who backed up the harsh evidence against those mosquitoes , and detailed some stirring adventures which he had had with them .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 30]: The stories were pretty sizable , merely pretty sizable ; yet Mr. H. was continually interrupting with a cold , inexorable ` Wait -- knock off twenty-five per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 132]: of that ; now go on ; ' or , ` Wait -- you are getting that too strong ; cut it down , cut it down -- you get a leetle too much costumery on to your statements : always dress a fact in tights , never in an ulster ; ' or , ` Pardon , once more : if you are going to load anything more on to that statement , you want to get a couple of lighters and tow the rest , because it 's drawing all the water there is in the river already ; stick to facts -- just stick to the cold facts ; what these gentlemen want for a book is the frozen truth -- ai n't that so , gentlemen ? '
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 43]: He explained privately that it was necessary to watch this man all the time , and keep him within bounds ; it would not do to neglect this precaution , as he , Mr. H. , ` knew to his sorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 62]: Said he , ' I will not deceive you ; he told me such a monstrous lie once , that it swelled my left ear up , and spread it so that I was actually not able to see out around it ; it remained so for months , and people came miles to see me fan myself with it . '
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 27]: Chapter 35 Vicksburg During the Trouble WE used to plow past the lofty hill-city , Vicksburg , down-stream ; but we can not do that now .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 20]: A cut-off has made a country town of it , like Osceola , St. Genevieve , and several others .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 16]: There is currentless water -- also a big island -- in front of Vicksburg now .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 45]: You come down the river the other side of the island , then turn and come up to the town ; that is , in high water : in low water you ca n't come up , but must land some distance below it .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 32]: Signs and scars still remain , as reminders of Vicksburg 's tremendous war experiences ; earthworks , trees crippled by the cannon balls , cave-refuges in the clay precipices , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 23]: The caves did good service during the six weeks ' bombardment of the city -- May 8 to July 4 , 1863 .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 29]: They were used by the non-combatants -- mainly by the women and children ; not to live in constantly , but to fly to for safety on occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 23]: They were mere holes , tunnels , driven into the perpendicular clay bank , then branched Y shape , within the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 367]: Life in Vicksburg , during the six weeks was perhaps -- but wait ; here are some materials out of which to reproduce it : -- Population , twenty-seven thousand soldiers and three thousand non-combatants ; the city utterly cut off from the world -- walled solidly in , the frontage by gunboats , the rear by soldiers and batteries ; hence , no buying and selling with the outside ; no passing to and fro ; no God-speeding a parting guest , no welcoming a coming one ; no printed acres of world-wide news to be read at breakfast , mornings -- a tedious dull absence of such matter , instead ; hence , also , no running to see steamboats smoking into view in the distance up or down , and plowing toward the town -- for none came , the river lay vacant and undisturbed ; no rush and turmoil around the railway station , no struggling over bewildered swarms of passengers by noisy mobs of hackmen -- all quiet there ; flour two hundred dollars a barrel , sugar thirty , corn ten dollars a bushel , bacon five dollars a pound , rum a hundred dollars a gallon ; other things in proportion : consequently , no roar and racket of drays and carriages tearing along the streets ; nothing for them to do , among that handful of non-combatants of exhausted means ; at three o'clock in the morning , silence ; silence so dead that the measured tramp of a sentinel can be heard a seemingly impossible distance ; out of hearing of this lonely sound , perhaps the stillness is absolute : all in a moment come ground-shaking thunder-crashes of artillery , the sky is cobwebbed with the crisscrossing red lines streaming from soaring bomb-shells , and a rain of iron fragments descends upon the city ; descends upon the empty streets : streets which are not empty a moment later , but mottled with dim figures of frantic women and children scurrying from home and bed toward the cave dungeons -- encouraged by the humorous grim soldiery , who shout ` Rats , to your holes ! '
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 3]: and laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 142]: The cannon-thunder rages , shells scream and crash overhead , the iron rain pours down , one hour , two hours , three , possibly six , then stops ; silence follows , but the streets are still empty ; the silence continues ; by-and-bye a head projects from a cave here and there and yonder , and reconnoitres , cautiously ; the silence still continuing , bodies follow heads , and jaded , half smothered creatures group themselves about , stretch their cramped limbs , draw in deep draughts of the grateful fresh air , gossip with the neighbors from the next cave ; maybe straggle off home presently , or take a lounge through the town , if the stillness continues ; and will scurry to the holes again , by-and-bye , when the war-tempest breaks forth once more .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 50]: There being but three thousand of these cave-dwellers -- merely the population of a village -- would they not come to know each other , after a week or two , and familiarly ; insomuch that the fortunate or unfortunate experiences of one would be of interest to all ?
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 8]: Those are the materials furnished by history .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 17]: From them might not almost anybody reproduce for himself the life of that time in Vicksburg ?
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 29]: Could you , who did not experience it , come nearer to reproducing it to the imagination of another non-participant than could a Vicksburger who did experience it ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 16]: It seems impossible ; and yet there are reasons why it might not really be .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 48]: When one makes his first voyage in a ship , it is an experience which multitudinously bristles with striking novelties ; novelties which are in such sharp contrast with all this person 's former experiences that they take a seemingly deathless grip upon his imagination and memory .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 29]: By tongue or pen he can make a landsman live that strange and stirring voyage over with him ; make him see it all and feel it all .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 5]: But if he wait ?
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 11]: If he make ten voyages in succession -- what then ?
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 17]: Why , the thing has lost color , snap , surprise ; and has become commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 15]: The man would have nothing to tell that would quicken a landsman 's pulse .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 19]: Years ago , I talked with a couple of the Vicksburg non-combatants -- a man and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 21]: Left to tell their story in their own way , those people told it without fire , almost without interest .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 52]: A week of their wonderful life there would have made their tongues eloquent for ever perhaps ; but they had six weeks of it , and that wore the novelty all out ; they got used to being bomb-shelled out of home and into the ground ; the matter became commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 19]: After that , the possibility of their ever being startlingly interesting in their talks about it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 20]: What the man said was to this effect : -- ` It got to be Sunday all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 11]: Seven Sundays in the week -- to us , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 12]: We had n't anything to do , and time hung heavy .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 38]: Seven Sundays , and all of them broken up at one time or another , in the day or in the night , by a few hours of the awful storm of fire and thunder and iron .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 18]: At first we used to shin for the holes a good deal faster than we did afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 16]: The first time , I forgot the children , and Maria fetched them both along .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 11]: When she was all safe in the cave she fainted .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 56]: Two or three weeks afterwards , when she was running for the holes , one morning , through a shell-shower , a big shell burst near her , and covered her all over with dirt , and a piece of the iron carried away her game-bag of false hair from the back of her head .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 14]: Well , she stopped to get that game-bag before she shoved along again !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 10]: Was getting used to things already , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 31]: We all got so that we could tell a good deal about shells ; and after that we did n't always go under shelter if it was a light shower .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 20]: Us men would loaf around and talk ; and a man would say , ` There she goes ! '
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 28]: and name the kind of shell it was from the sound of it , and go on talking -- if there was n't any danger from it .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 29]: If a shell was bursting close over us , we stopped talking and stood still ; -- uncomfortable , yes , but it was n't safe to move .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 25]: When it let go , we went on talking again , if nobody hurt -- maybe saying , ` That was a ripper ! '
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 27]: or some such commonplace comment before we resumed ; or , maybe , we would see a shell poising itself away high in the air overhead .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 20]: In that case , every fellow just whipped out a sudden , ` See you again , gents ! '
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 3]: and shoved .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 76]: Often and often I saw gangs of ladies promenading the streets , looking as cheerful as you please , and keeping an eye canted up watching the shells ; and I 've seen them stop still when they were uncertain about what a shell was going to do , and wait and make certain ; and after that they sa ` ntered along again , or lit out for shelter , according to the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 24]: Streets in some towns have a litter of pieces of paper , and odds and ends of one sort or another lying around .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 9]: Ours had n't ; they had IRON litter .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 37]: Sometimes a man would gather up all the iron fragments and unbursted shells in his neighborhood , and pile them into a kind of monument in his front yard -- a ton of it , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 18]: No glass left ; glass could n't stand such a bombardment ; it was all shivered out .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 13]: Windows of the houses vacant -- looked like eye-holes in a skull .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 8]: WHOLE panes were as scarce as news .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 6]: ` We had church Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 14]: Not many there , along at first ; but by-and-bye pretty good turnouts .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 57]: I 've seen service stop a minute , and everybody sit quiet -- no voice heard , pretty funeral-like then -- and all the more so on account of the awful boom and crash going on outside and overhead ; and pretty soon , when a body could be heard , service would go on again .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 18]: Organs and church-music mixed up with a bombardment is a powerful queer combination -- along at first .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 24]: Coming out of church , one morning , we had an accident -- the only one that happened around me on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 44]: I was just having a hearty handshake with a friend I had n't seen for a while , and saying , ` Drop into our cave to-night , after bombardment ; we 've got hold of a pint of prime wh -- . '
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 16]: Whiskey , I was going to say , you know , but a shell interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 19]: A chunk of it cut the man 's arm off , and left it dangling in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 37]: And do you know the thing that is going to stick the longest in my memory , and outlast everything else , little and big , I reckon , is the mean thought I had then ?
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 9]: It was ` the whiskey IS SAVED . '
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 38]: And yet , do n't you know , it was kind of excusable ; because it was as scarce as diamonds , and we had only just that little ; never had another taste during the siege .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 14]: ` Sometimes the caves were desperately crowded , and always hot and close .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 34]: Sometimes a cave had twenty or twenty-five people packed into it ; no turning-room for anybody ; air so foul , sometimes , you could n't have made a candle burn in it .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 28]: A child was born in one of those caves one night , Think of that ; why , it was like having it born in a trunk .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 20]: ` Twice we had sixteen people in our cave ; and a number of times we had a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 5]: Pretty suffocating in there .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 9]: We always had eight ; eight belonged there .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 37]: Hunger and misery and sickness and fright and sorrow , and I do n't know what all , got so loaded into them that none of them were ever rightly their old selves after the siege .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 13]: They all died but three of us within a couple of years .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 19]: One night a shell burst in front of the hole and caved it in and stopped it up .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 12]: It was lively times , for a while , digging out .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 7]: Some of us came near smothering .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 16]: After that we made two openings -- ought to have thought of it at first .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 4]: ` Mule meat .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 14]: No , we only got down to that the last day or two .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 14]: Of course it was good ; anything is good when you are starving .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 11]: This man had kept a diary during -- six weeks ?
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 8]: No , only the first six days .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 58]: The first day , eight close pages ; the second , five ; the third , one -- loosely written ; the fourth , three or four lines ; a line or two the fifth and sixth days ; seventh day , diary abandoned ; life in terrific Vicksburg having now become commonplace and matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 23]: The war history of Vicksburg has more about it to interest the general reader than that of any other of the river-towns .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 15]: It is full of variety , full of incident , full of the picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 44]: Vicksburg held out longer than any other important river-town , and saw warfare in all its phases , both land and water -- the siege , the mine , the assault , the repulse , the bombardment , sickness , captivity , famine .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 11]: The most beautiful of all the national cemeteries is here .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 28]: Over the great gateway is this inscription : -- `` HERE REST IN PEACE 16,600 WHO DIED FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE YEARS 1861 TO 1865 . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 19]: The grounds are nobly situated ; being very high and commanding a wide prospect of land and river .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 56]: They are tastefully laid out in broad terraces , with winding roads and paths ; and there is profuse adornment in the way of semi-tropical shrubs and flowers , ' and in one part is a piece of native wild-wood , left just as it grew , and , therefore , perfect in its charm .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 12]: Everything about this cemetery suggests the hand of the national Government .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 16]: The Government 's work is always conspicuous for excellence , solidity , thoroughness , neatness .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 18]: The Government does its work well in the first place , and then takes care of it .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 50]: By winding-roads -- which were often cut to so great a depth between perpendicular walls that they were mere roofless tunnels -- we drove out a mile or two and visited the monument which stands upon the scene of the surrender of Vicksburg to General Grant by General Pemberton .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 35]: Its metal will preserve it from the hackings and chippings which so defaced its predecessor , which was of marble ; but the brick foundations are crumbling , and it will tumble down by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 24]: It overlooks a picturesque region of wooded hills and ravines ; and is not unpicturesque itself , being well smothered in flowering weeds .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 15]: The battered remnant of the marble monument has been removed to the National Cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 41]: On the road , a quarter of a mile townward , an aged colored man showed us , with pride , an unexploded bomb-shell which has lain in his yard since the day it fell there during the siege . '
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 86]: I was a-stannin ' heah , an ' de dog was a-stannin ' heah ; de dog he went for de shell , gwine to pick a fuss wid it ; but I did n't ; I says , `` Jes ' make you ` seff at home heah ; lay still whah you is , or bust up de place , jes ' as you 's a mind to , but I 's got business out in de woods , I has ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 45]: Vicksburg is a town of substantial business streets and pleasant residences ; it commands the commerce of the Yazoo and Sunflower Rivers ; is pushing railways in several directions , through rich agricultural regions , and has a promising future of prosperity and importance .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 31]: Apparently , nearly all the river towns , big and little , have made up their minds that they must look mainly to railroads for wealth and upbuilding , henceforth .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 7]: They are acting upon this idea .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 44]: The signs are , that the next twenty years will bring about some noteworthy changes in the Valley , in the direction of increased population and wealth , and in the intellectual advancement and the liberalizing of opinion which go naturally with these .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 34]: And yet , if one may judge by the past , the river towns will manage to find and use a chance , here and there , to cripple and retard their progress .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 34]: They kept themselves back in the days of steamboating supremacy , by a system of wharfage-dues so stupidly graded as to prohibit what may be called small RETAIL traffic in freights and passengers .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 25]: Boats were charged such heavy wharfage that they could not afford to land for one or two passengers or a light lot of freight .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 19]: Instead of encouraging the bringing of trade to their doors , the towns diligently and effectively discouraged it .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 21]: They could have had many boats and low rates ; but their policy rendered few boats and high rates compulsory .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 17]: It was a policy which extended -- and extends -- from New Orleans to St. Paul .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 76]: We had a strong desire to make a trip up the Yazoo and the Sunflower -- an interesting region at any time , but additionally interesting at this time , because up there the great inundation was still to be seen in force -- but we were nearly sure to have to wait a day or more for a New Orleans boat on our return ; so we were obliged to give up the project .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 15]: Here is a story which I picked up on board the boat that night .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 25]: I insert it in this place merely because it is a good story , not because it belongs here -- for it does n't .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 76]: It was told by a passenger -- a college professor -- and was called to the surface in the course of a general conversation which began with talk about horses , drifted into talk about astronomy , then into talk about the lynching of the gamblers in Vicksburg half a century ago , then into talk about dreams and superstitions ; and ended , after midnight , in a dispute over free trade and protection .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 13]: Chapter 36 The Professor 's Yarn IT was in the early days .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 8]: I was not a college professor then .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 23]: I was a humble-minded young land-surveyor , with the world before me -- to survey , in case anybody wanted it done .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 34]: I had a contract to survey a route for a great mining-ditch in California , and I was on my way thither , by sea -- a three or four weeks ' voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 35]: There were a good many passengers , but I had very little to say to them ; reading and dreaming were my passions , and I avoided conversation in order to indulge these appetites .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 13]: There were three professional gamblers on board -- rough , repulsive fellows .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 60]: I never had any talk with them , yet I could not help seeing them with some frequency , for they gambled in an upper-deck stateroom every day and night , and in my promenades I often had glimpses of them through their door , which stood a little ajar to let out the surplus tobacco smoke and profanity .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 20]: They were an evil and hateful presence , but I had to put up with it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 52]: There was one other passenger who fell under my eye a good deal , for he seemed determined to be friendly with me , and I could not have gotten rid of him without running some chance of hurting his feelings , and I was far from wishing to do that .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 15]: Besides , there was something engaging in his countrified simplicity and his beaming good-nature .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 77]: The first time I saw this Mr. John Backus , I guessed , from his clothes and his looks , that he was a grazier or farmer from the backwoods of some western State -- doubtless Ohio -- and afterward when he dropped into his personal history and I discovered that he WAS a cattle-raiser from interior Ohio , I was so pleased with my own penetration that I warmed toward him for verifying my instinct .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 63]: He got to dropping alongside me every day , after breakfast , to help me make my promenade ; and so , in the course of time , his easy-working jaw had told me everything about his business , his prospects , his family , his relatives , his politics -- in fact everything that concerned a Backus , living or dead .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 31]: And meantime I think he had managed to get out of me everything I knew about my trade , my tribe , my purposes , my prospects , and myself .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 25]: He was a gentle and persuasive genius , and this thing showed it ; for I was not given to talking about my matters .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 40]: I said something about triangulation , once ; the stately word pleased his ear ; he inquired what it meant ; I explained ; after that he quietly and inoffensively ignored my name , and always called me Triangle .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 8]: What an enthusiast he was in cattle !
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 24]: At the bare name of a bull or a cow , his eye would light and his eloquent tongue would turn itself loose .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 34]: As long as I would walk and listen , he would walk and talk ; he knew all breeds , he loved all breeds , he caressed them all with his affectionate tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 61]: I tramped along in voiceless misery whilst the cattle question was up ; when I could endure it no longer , I used to deftly insert a scientific topic into the conversation ; then my eye fired and his faded ; my tongue fluttered , his stopped ; life was a joy to me , and a sadness to him .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 40]: One day he said , a little hesitatingly , and with somewhat of diffidence -- ` Triangle , would you mind coming down to my stateroom a minute , and have a little talk on a certain matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 7]: I went with him at once .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 25]: Arrived there , he put his head out , glanced up and down the saloon warily , then closed the door and locked it .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 42]: He sat down on the sofa , and he said -- ` I 'm a-going to make a little proposition to you , and if it strikes you favorable , it 'll be a middling good thing for both of us .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 23]: You ai n't a-going out to Californy for fun , nuther am I -- it 's business , ai n't that so ?
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 21]: Well , you can do me a good turn , and so can I you , if we see fit .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 22]: I 've raked and scraped and saved , a considerable many years , and I 've got it all here . '
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 36]: He unlocked an old hair trunk , tumbled a chaos of shabby clothes aside , and drew a short stout bag into view for a moment , then buried it again and relocked the trunk .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 47]: Dropping his voice to a cautious low tone , he continued , ` She 's all there -- a round ten thousand dollars in yellow-boys ; now this is my little idea : What I do n't know about raising cattle , ai n't worth knowing .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 11]: There 's mints of money in it , in Californy .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 42]: Well , I know , and you know , that all along a line that 's being surveyed , there 's little dabs of land that they call `` gores , '' that fall to the surveyor free gratis for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 81]: All you 've got to do , on your side , is to survey in such a way that the `` gores '' will fall on good fat land , then you turn 'em over to me , I stock 'em with cattle , in rolls the cash , I plank out your share of the dollars regular , right along , and -- ' I was sorry to wither his blooming enthusiasm , but it could not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 17]: I interrupted , and said severely -- ' I am not that kind of a surveyor .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 10]: Let us change the subject , Mr. Backus . '
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 15]: It was pitiful to see his confusion and hear his awkward and shamefaced apologies .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 27]: I was as much distressed as he was -- especially as he seemed so far from having suspected that there was anything improper in his proposition .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 23]: So I hastened to console him and lead him on to forget his mishap in a conversational orgy about cattle and butchery .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 31]: We were lying at Acapulco ; and , as we went on deck , it happened luckily that the crew were just beginning to hoist some beeves aboard in slings .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 16]: Backus 's melancholy vanished instantly , and with it the memory of his late mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 8]: ` Now only look at that ! '
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 18]: cried he ; ` My goodness , Triangle , what WOULD they say to it in OHIO .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 14]: Would n't their eyes bug out , to see 'em handled like that ?
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 8]: -- would n't they , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 29]: All the passengers were on deck to look -- even the gamblers -- and Backus knew them all , and had afflicted them all with his pet topic .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 25]: As I moved away , I saw one of the gamblers approach and accost him ; then another of them ; then the third .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 34]: I halted ; waited ; watched ; the conversation continued between the four men ; it grew earnest ; Backus drew gradually away ; the gamblers followed , and kept at his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 4]: I was uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 64]: However , as they passed me presently , I heard Backus say , with a tone of persecuted annoyance -- ` But it ai n't any use , gentlemen ; I tell you again , as I 've told you a half a dozen times before , I war n't raised to it , and I ai n't a-going to resk it . '
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 4]: I felt relieved .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 16]: ` His level head will be his sufficient protection , ' I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 32]: During the fortnight 's run from Acapulco to San Francisco I several times saw the gamblers talking earnestly with Backus , and once I threw out a gentle warning to him .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: He chuckled comfortably and said -- ` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 52]: they tag around after me considerable -- want me to play a little , just for amusement , they say -- but laws-a-me , if my folks have told me once to look out for that sort of live-stock , they 've told me a thousand times , I reckon . '
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 12]: By-and-bye , in due course , we were approaching San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 20]: It was an ugly black night , with a strong wind blowing , but there was not much sea .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 7]: I was on deck , alone .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: Toward ten I started below .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 15]: A figure issued from the gamblers ' den , and disappeared in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 13]: I experienced a shock , for I was sure it was Backus .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 39]: I flew down the companion-way , looked about for him , could not find him , then returned to the deck just in time to catch a glimpse of him as he re-entered that confounded nest of rascality .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 6]: Had he yielded at last ?
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 4]: I feared it .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: What had he gone below for ?
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 6]: -- His bag of coin ?
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 2]: Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 10]: I drew near the door , full of bodings .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 38]: It was a-crack , and I glanced in and saw a sight that made me bitterly wish I had given my attention to saving my poor cattle-friend , instead of reading and dreaming my foolish time away .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 4]: He was gambling .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 19]: Worse still , he was being plied with champagne , and was already showing some effect from it .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 51]: He praised the ` cider , ' as he called it , and said now that he had got a taste of it he almost believed he would drink it if it was spirits , it was so good and so ahead of anything he had ever run across before .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 44]: Surreptitious smiles , at this , passed from one rascal to another , and they filled all the glasses , and whilst Backus honestly drained his to the bottom they pretended to do the same , but threw the wine over their shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 26]: I could not bear the scene , so I wandered forward and tried to interest myself in the sea and the voices of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 34]: But no , my uneasy spirit kept dragging me back at quarter-hour intervals ; and always I saw Backus drinking his wine -- fairly and squarely , and the others throwing theirs away .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 9]: It was the painfullest night I ever spent .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 22]: The only hope I had was that we might reach our anchorage with speed -- that would break up the game .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 12]: I helped the ship along all I could with my prayers .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 17]: At last we went booming through the Golden Gate , and my pulses leaped for joy .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 10]: I hurried back to that door and glanced in .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 42]: Alas , there was small room for hope -- Backus 's eyes were heavy and bloodshot , his sweaty face was crimson , his speech maudlin and thick , his body sawed drunkenly about with the weaving motion of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 15]: He drained another glass to the dregs , whilst the cards were being dealt .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 19]: He took his hand , glanced at it , and his dull eyes lit up for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 14]: The gamblers observed it , and showed their gratification by hardly perceptible signs .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 6]: ` How many cards ? '
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 4]: ` None ! '
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 3]: said Backus .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 16]: One villain -- named Hank Wiley -- discarded one card , the others three each .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 4]: The betting began .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 39]: Heretofore the bets had been trifling -- a dollar or two ; but Backus started off with an eagle now , Wiley hesitated a moment , then ` saw it ' and ` went ten dollars better . '
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 8]: The other two threw up their hands .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 5]: Backus went twenty better .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 16]: Wiley said -- ' I see that , and go you a hundred better ! '
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 8]: then smiled and reached for the money .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 13]: ` Let it alone , ' said Backus , with drunken gravity .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 12]: you mean to say you 're going to cover it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 4]: ` Cover it ?
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 19]: Well , I reckon I am -- and lay another hundred on top of it , too . '
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 12]: He reached down inside his overcoat and produced the required sum .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 12]: ` Oh , that 's your little game , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 12]: I see your raise , and raise it five hundred ! '
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 3]: said Wiley .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 6]: ` Five hundred better . '
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 17]: said the foolish bull-driver , and pulled out the amount and showered it on the pile .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 10]: The three conspirators hardly tried to conceal their exultation .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 26]: All diplomacy and pretense were dropped now , and the sharp exclamations came thick and fast , and the yellow pyramid grew higher and higher .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 9]: At last ten thousand dollars lay in view .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 37]: Wiley cast a bag of coin on the table , and said with mocking gentleness -- ` Five thousand dollars better , my friend from the rural districts -- what do you say NOW ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 5]: I CALL you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 11]: said Backus , heaving his golden shot-bag on the pile .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 7]: ` What have you got ? '
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 11]: ` Four kings , you d -- d fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 14]: and Wiley threw down his cards and surrounded the stakes with his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 8]: ` Four ACES , you ass ! '
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 11]: thundered Backus , covering his man with a cocked revolver .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 21]: ` I 'M A PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER MYSELF , AND I 'VE BEEN LAYING FOR YOU DUFFERS ALL THIS VOYAGE ! '
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 7]: Down went the anchor , rumbledy-dum-dum !
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 7]: and the long trip was ended .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 10]: Well -- well , it is a sad world .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 12]: One of the three gamblers was Backus 's ` pal . '
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 9]: It was he that dealt the fateful hands .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 25]: According to an understanding with the two victims , he was to have given Backus four queens , but alas , he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 20]: A week later , I stumbled upon Backus -- arrayed in the height of fashion -- in Montgomery Street .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 23]: He said , cheerily , as we were parting -- ` Ah , by-the-way , you need n't mind about those gores .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 30]: I do n't really know anything about cattle , except what I was able to pick up in a week 's apprenticeship over in Jersey just before we sailed .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 18]: My cattle-culture and cattle-enthusiasm have served their turn -- I sha n't need them any more . '
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 29]: Next day we reluctantly parted from the ` Gold Dust ' and her officers , hoping to see that boat and all those officers again , some day .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 11]: A thing which the fates were to render tragically impossible !
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 41]: Chapter 37 The End of the ` Gold Dust ' FOR , three months later , August 8 , while I was writing one of these foregoing chapters , the New York papers brought this telegram -- A TERRIBLE DISASTER .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 14]: SEVENTEEN PERSONS KILLED BY AN EXPLOSION ON THE STEAMER ` GOLD DUST . '
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 6]: ` NASHVILLE , Aug. 7 .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 30]: -- A despatch from Hickman , Ky. , says -- ` The steamer `` Gold Dust '' exploded her boilers at three o'clock to-day , just after leaving Hickman .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 9]: Forty-seven persons were scalded and seventeen are missing .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 44]: The boat was landed in the eddy just above the town , and through the exertions of the citizens the cabin passengers , officers , and part of the crew and deck passengers were taken ashore and removed to the hotels and residences .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 29]: Twenty-four of the injured were lying in Holcomb 's dry-goods store at one time , where they received every attention before being removed to more comfortable places . '
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 58]: A list of the names followed , whereby it appeared that of the seventeen dead , one was the barkeeper ; and among the forty-seven wounded , were the captain , chief mate , second mate , and second and third clerks ; also Mr. Lem S. Gray , pilot , and several members of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 21]: In answer to a private telegram , we learned that none of these was severely hurt , except Mr. Gray .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 19]: Letters received afterward confirmed this news , and said that Mr. Gray was improving and would get well .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 17]: Later letters spoke less hopefully of his case ; and finally came one announcing his death .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 18]: A good man , a most companionable and manly man , and worthy of a kindlier fate .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 41]: Chapter 38 The House Beautiful WE took passage in a Cincinnati boat for New Orleans ; or on a Cincinnati boat -- either is correct ; the former is the eastern form of putting it , the latter the western .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 47]: Mr. Dickens declined to agree that the Mississippi steamboats were ` magnificent , ' or that they were ` floating palaces , ' -- terms which had always been applied to them ; terms which did not over-express the admiration with which the people viewed them .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 17]: Mr. Dickens 's position was unassailable , possibly ; the people 's position was certainly unassailable .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 44]: If Mr. Dickens was comparing these boats with the crown jewels ; or with the Taj , or with the Matterhorn ; or with some other priceless or wonderful thing which he had seen , they were not magnificent -- he was right .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 38]: The people compared them with what they had seen ; and , thus measured , thus judged , the boats were magnificent -- the term was the correct one , it was not at all too strong .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 10]: The people were as right as was Mr. Dickens .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 9]: The steamboats were finer than anything on shore .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 22]: Compared with superior dwelling-houses and first-class hotels in the Valley , they were indubitably magnificent , they were ` palaces . '
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 67]: To a few people living in New Orleans and St. Louis , they were not magnificent , perhaps ; not palaces ; but to the great majority of those populations , and to the entire populations spread over both banks between Baton Rouge and St. Louis , they were palaces ; they tallied with the citizen 's dream of what magnificence was , and satisfied it .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 32]: Every town and village along that vast stretch of double river-frontage had a best dwelling , finest dwelling , mansion , -- the home of its wealthiest and most conspicuous citizen .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 87]: It is easy to describe it : large grassy yard , with paling fence painted white -- in fair repair ; brick walk from gate to door ; big , square , two-story ` frame ' house , painted white and porticoed like a Grecian temple -- with this difference , that the imposing fluted columns and Corinthian capitals were a pathetic sham , being made of white pine , and painted ; iron knocker ; brass door knob -- discolored , for lack of polishing .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 224]: Within , an uncarpeted hall , of planed boards ; opening out of it , a parlor , fifteen feet by fifteen -- in some instances five or ten feet larger ; ingrain carpet ; mahogany center-table ; lamp on it , with green-paper shade -- standing on a gridiron , so to speak , made of high-colored yarns , by the young ladies of the house , and called a lamp-mat ; several books , piled and disposed , with cast-iron exactness , according to an inherited and unchangeable plan ; among them , Tupper , much penciled ; also , ` Friendship 's Offering , ' and ` Affection 's Wreath , ' with their sappy inanities illustrated in die-away mezzotints ; also , Ossian ; ` Alonzo and Melissa : ' maybe ` Ivanhoe : ' also ` Album , ' full of original ` poetry ' of the Thou-hast-wounded-the-spirit-that-loved-thee breed ; two or three goody-goody works -- ` Shepherd of Salisbury Plain , ' etc. ; current number of the chaste and innocuous Godey 's ` Lady 's Book , ' with painted fashion-plate of wax-figure women with mouths all alike -- lips and eyelids the same size -- each five-foot woman with a two-inch wedge sticking from under her dress and letting-on to be half of her foot .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 25]: Polished air-tight stove -LRB- new and deadly invention -RRB- , with pipe passing through a board which closes up the discarded good old fireplace .

Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 60]: Over middle of mantel , engraving -- Washington Crossing the Delaware ; on the wall by the door , copy of it done in thunder-and-lightning crewels by one of the young ladies -- work of art which would have made Washington hesitate about crossing , if he could have foreseen what advantage was going to be taken of it .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 148]: Piano -- kettle in disguise -- with music , bound and unbound , piled on it , and on a stand near by : Battle of Prague ; Bird Waltz ; Arkansas Traveler ; Rosin the Bow ; Marseilles Hymn ; On a Lone Barren Isle -LRB- St. Helena -RRB- ; The Last Link is Broken ; She wore a Wreath of Roses the Night when last we met ; Go , forget me , Why should Sorrow o'er that Brow a Shadow fling ; Hours there were to Memory Dearer ; Long , Long Ago ; Days of Absence ; A Life on the Ocean Wave , a Home on the Rolling Deep ; Bird at Sea ; and spread open on the rack , where the plaintive singer has left it , RO-holl on , silver MOO-hoon , guide the TRAV-el-lerr his WAY , etc. .

Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 13]: These persons all fresh , raw , and red -- apparently skinned .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 34]: Opposite , in gilt frame , grandpa and grandma , at thirty and twenty-two , stiff , old-fashioned , high-collared , puff-sleeved , glaring pallidly out from a background of solid Egyptian night .

Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 85]: Pyramidal what-not in the corner , the shelves occupied chiefly with bric-a-brac of the period , disposed with an eye to best effect : shell , with the Lord 's Prayer carved on it ; another shell -- of the long-oval sort , narrow , straight orifice , three inches long , running from end to end -- portrait of Washington carved on it ; not well done ; the shell had Washington 's mouth , originally -- artist should have built to that .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 17]: These two are memorials of the long-ago bridal trip to New Orleans and the French Market .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 314]: Other bric-a-brac : Californian ` specimens ' -- quartz , with gold wart adhering ; old Guinea-gold locket , with circlet of ancestral hair in it ; Indian arrow-heads , of flint ; pair of bead moccasins , from uncle who crossed the Plains ; three ` alum ' baskets of various colors -- being skeleton-frame of wire , clothed-on with cubes of crystallized alum in the rock-candy style -- works of art which were achieved by the young ladies ; their doubles and duplicates to be found upon all what-nots in the land ; convention of desiccated bugs and butterflies pinned to a card ; painted toy-dog , seated upon bellows-attachment -- drops its under jaw and squeaks when pressed upon ; sugar-candy rabbit -- limbs and features merged together , not strongly defined ; pewter presidential-campaign medal ; miniature card-board wood-sawyer , to be attached to the stove-pipe and operated by the heat ; small Napoleon , done in wax ; spread-open daguerreotypes of dim children , parents , cousins , aunts , and friends , in all attitudes but customary ones ; no templed portico at back , and manufactured landscape stretching away in the distance -- that came in later , with the photograph ; all these vague figures lavishly chained and ringed -- metal indicated and secured from doubt by stripes and splashes of vivid gold bronze ; all of them too much combed , too much fixed up ; and all of them uncomfortable in inflexible Sunday-clothes of a pattern which the spectator can not realize could ever have been in fashion ; husband and wife generally grouped together -- husband sitting , wife standing , with hand on his shoulder -- and both preserving , all these fading years , some traceable effect of the daguerreotypist 's brisk ` Now smile , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 30]: Bracketed over what-not -- place of special sacredness -- an outrage in water-color , done by the young niece that came on a visit long ago , and died .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 14]: Pity , too ; for she might have repented of this in time .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 12]: Horse-hair chairs , horse-hair sofa which keeps sliding from under you .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 19]: Window shades , of oil stuff , with milk-maids and ruined castles stenciled on them in fierce colors .

Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 6]: Nothing else in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 20]: Not a bathroom in the house ; and no visitor likely to come along who has ever seen one .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 25]: That was the residence of the principal citizen , all the way from the suburbs of New Orleans to the edge of St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 161]: When he stepped aboard a big fine steamboat , he entered a new and marvelous world : chimney-tops cut to counterfeit a spraying crown of plumes -- and maybe painted red ; pilot-house , hurricane deck , boiler-deck guards , all garnished with white wooden filigree work of fanciful patterns ; gilt acorns topping the derricks ; gilt deer-horns over the big bell ; gaudy symbolical picture on the paddle-box , possibly ; big roomy boiler-deck , painted blue , and furnished with Windsor armchairs ; inside , a far-receding snow-white ` cabin ; ' porcelain knob and oil-picture on every stateroom door ; curving patterns of filigree-work touched up with gilding , stretching overhead all down the converging vista ; big chandeliers every little way , each an April shower of glittering glass-drops ; lovely rainbow-light falling everywhere from the colored glazing of the skylights ; the whole a long-drawn , resplendent tunnel , a bewildering and soul-satisfying spectacle !
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 27]: In the ladies ' cabin a pink and white Wilton carpet , as soft as mush , and glorified with a ravishing pattern of gigantic flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 39]: Then the Bridal Chamber -- the animal that invented that idea was still alive and unhanged , at that day -- Bridal Chamber whose pretentious flummery was necessarily overawing to the now tottering intellect of that hosannahing citizen .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 83]: Every state-room had its couple of cozy clean bunks , and perhaps a looking-glass and a snug closet ; and sometimes there was even a washbowl and pitcher , and part of a towel which could be told from mosquito netting by an expert -- though generally these things were absent , and the shirt-sleeved passengers cleansed themselves at a long row of stationary bowls in the barber shop , where were also public towels , public combs , and public soap .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 30]: Take the steamboat which I have just described , and you have her in her highest and finest , and most pleasing , and comfortable , and satisfactory estate .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 24]: Now cake her over with a layer of ancient and obdurate dirt , and you have the Cincinnati steamer awhile ago referred to .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 20]: Not all over -- only inside ; for she was ably officered in all departments except the steward 's .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 47]: But wash that boat and repaint her , and she would be about the counterpart of the most complimented boat of the old flush times : for the steamboat architecture of the West has undergone no change ; neither has steamboat furniture and ornamentation undergone any .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 41]: Chapter 39 Manufactures and Miscreants WHERE the river , in the Vicksburg region , used to be corkscrewed , it is now comparatively straight -- made so by cut-off ; a former distance of seventy miles is reduced to thirty-five .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 27]: It is a change which threw Vicksburg 's neighbor , Delta , Louisiana , out into the country and ended its career as a river town .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 36]: Its whole river-frontage is now occupied by a vast sand-bar , thickly covered with young trees -- a growth which will magnify itself into a dense forest by-and-bye , and completely hide the exiled town .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 45]: In due time we passed Grand Gulf and Rodney , of war fame , and reached Natchez , the last of the beautiful hill-cities -- for Baton Rouge , yet to come , is not on a hill , but only on high ground .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 44]: Famous Natchez-under-the-hill has not changed notably in twenty years ; in outward aspect -- judging by the descriptions of the ancient procession of foreign tourists -- it has not changed in sixty ; for it is still small , straggling , and shabby .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 40]: It had a desperate reputation , morally , in the old keel-boating and early steamboating times -- plenty of drinking , carousing , fisticuffing , and killing there , among the riff-raff of the river , in those days .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 10]: But Natchez-on-top-of-the-hill is attractive ; has always been attractive .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 37]: Even Mrs. Trollope -LRB- 1827 -RRB- had to confess its charms : ` At one or two points the wearisome level line is relieved by bluffs , as they call the short intervals of high ground .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 14]: The town of Natchez is beautifully situated on one of those high spots .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 53]: The contrast that its bright green hill forms with the dismal line of black forest that stretches on every side , the abundant growth of the pawpaw , palmetto and orange , the copious variety of sweet-scented flowers that flourish there , all make it appear like an oasis in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 24]: Natchez is the furthest point to the north at which oranges ripen in the open air , or endure the winter without shelter .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 24]: With the exception of this sweet spot , I thought all the little towns and villages we passed wretched-looking in the extreme . '
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 37]: Natchez , like her near and far river neighbors , has railways now , and is adding to them -- pushing them hither and thither into all rich outlying regions that are naturally tributary to her .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 21]: And like Vicksburg and New Orleans , she has her ice-factory : she makes thirty tons of ice a day .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 21]: In Vicksburg and Natchez , in my time , ice was jewelry ; none but the rich could wear it .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 9]: But anybody and everybody can have it now .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 28]: I visited one of the ice-factories in New Orleans , to see what the polar regions might look like when lugged into the edge of the tropics .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 12]: But there was nothing striking in the aspect of the place .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 27]: It was merely a spacious house , with some innocent steam machinery in one end of it and some big porcelain pipes running here and there .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 38]: No , not porcelain -- they merely seemed to be ; they were iron , but the ammonia which was being breathed through them had coated them to the thickness of your hand with solid milk-white ice .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 32]: It ought to have melted ; for one did not require winter clothing in that atmosphere : but it did not melt ; the inside of the pipe was too cold .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 24]: Sunk into the floor were numberless tin boxes , a foot square and two feet long , and open at the top end .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 52]: These were full of clear water ; and around each box , salt and other proper stuff was packed ; also , the ammonia gases were applied to the water in some way which will always remain a secret to me , because I was not able to understand the process .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 29]: While the water in the boxes gradually froze , men gave it a stir or two with a stick occasionally -- to liberate the air-bubbles , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 14]: Other men were continually lifting out boxes whose contents had become hard frozen .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 44]: They gave the box a single dip into a vat of boiling water , to melt the block of ice free from its tin coffin , then they shot the block out upon a platform car , and it was ready for market .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 11]: These big blocks were hard , solid , and crystal-clear .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 30]: In certain of them , big bouquets of fresh and brilliant tropical flowers had been frozen-in ; in others , beautiful silken-clad French dolls , and other pretty objects .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 46]: These blocks were to be set on end in a platter , in the center of dinner-tables , to cool the tropical air ; and also to be ornamental , for the flowers and things imprisoned in them could be seen as through plate glass .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 38]: I was told that this factory could retail its ice , by wagon , throughout New Orleans , in the humblest dwelling-house quantities , at six or seven dollars a ton , and make a sufficient profit .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 38]: This being the case , there is business for ice-factories in the North ; for we get ice on no such terms there , if one take less than three hundred and fifty pounds at a delivery .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 23]: The Rosalie Yarn Mill , of Natchez , has a capacity of 6,000 spindles and 160 looms , and employs 100 hands .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 37]: The Natchez Cotton Mills Company began operations four years ago in a two-story building of 50 x 190 feet , with 4,000 spindles and 128 looms ; capital $ 105,000 , all subscribed in the town .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 42]: Two years later , the same stockholders increased their capital to $ 225,000 ; added a third story to the mill , increased its length to 317 feet ; added machinery to increase the capacity to 10,300 spindles and 304 looms .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 15]: The company now employ 250 operatives , many of whom are citizens of Natchez .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 34]: ` The mill works 5,000 bales of cotton annually and manufactures the best standard quality of brown shirtings and sheetings and drills , turning out 5,000,000 yards of these goods per year . '
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 14]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- New Orleans Times-Democrat , 26 Aug , 1882 . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 18]: A close corporation -- stock held at $ 5,000 per share , but none in the market .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 39]: The changes in the Mississippi River are great and strange , yet were to be expected ; but I was not expecting to live to see Natchez and these other river towns become manufacturing strongholds and railway centers .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 25]: Speaking of manufactures reminds me of a talk upon that topic which I heard -- which I overheard -- on board the Cincinnati boat .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 18]: I awoke out of a fretted sleep , with a dull confusion of voices in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 16]: I listened -- two men were talking ; subject , apparently , the great inundation .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 8]: I looked out through the open transom .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 18]: The two men were eating a late breakfast ; sitting opposite each other ; nobody else around .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 29]: They closed up the inundation with a few words -- having used it , evidently , as a mere ice-breaker and acquaintanceship-breeder -- then they dropped into business .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 19]: It soon transpired that they were drummers -- one belonging in Cincinnati , the other in New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 21]: Brisk men , energetic of movement and speech ; the dollar their god , how to get it their religion .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 45]: ` Now as to this article , ' said Cincinnati , slashing into the ostensible butter and holding forward a slab of it on his knife-blade , ` it 's from our house ; look at it -- smell of it -- taste it .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 9]: Put any test on it you want to .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 12]: Take your own time -- no hurry -- make it thorough .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 8]: There now -- what do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 6]: butter , ai n't it .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 10]: Not by a thundering sight -- it 's oleomargarine !
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 12]: Yes , sir , that 's what it is -- oleomargarine .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 16]: You ca n't tell it from butter ; by George , an EXPERT ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 6]: It 's from our house .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 22]: We supply most of the boats in the West ; there 's hardly a pound of butter on one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 13]: We are crawling right along -- JUMPING right along is the word .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 9]: We are going to have that entire trade .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 9]: Yes , and the hotel trade , too .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 41]: You are going to see the day , pretty soon , when you ca n't find an ounce of butter to bless yourself with , in any hotel in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys , outside of the biggest cities .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 14]: Why , we are turning out oleomargarine NOW by the thousands of tons .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 25]: And we can sell it so dirt-cheap that the whole country has GOT to take it -- ca n't get around it you see .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 15]: Butter do n't stand any show -- there ai n't any chance for competition .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 17]: Butter 's had its DAY -- and from this out , butter goes to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 19]: There 's more money in oleomargarine than -- why , you ca n't imagine the business we do .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 25]: I 've stopped in every town from Cincinnati to Natchez ; and I 've sent home big orders from every one of them . '
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 16]: And so-forth and so-on , for ten minutes longer , in the same fervid strain .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 33]: Then New Orleans piped up and said -- Yes , it 's a first-rate imitation , that 's a certainty ; but it ai n't the only one around that 's first-rate .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 23]: For instance , they make olive-oil out of cotton-seed oil , nowadays , so that you ca n't tell them apart . '
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 22]: ` Yes , that 's so , ' responded Cincinnati , ` and it was a tip-top business for a while .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 52]: They sent it over and brought it back from France and Italy , with the United States custom-house mark on it to indorse it for genuine , and there was no end of cash in it ; but France and Italy broke up the game -- of course they naturally would .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 23]: Cracked on such a rattling impost that cotton-seed olive-oil could n't stand the raise ; had to hang up and quit . '
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 9]: ` Oh , it DID , did it ?
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 7]: You wait here a minute . '
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 39]: Goes to his state-room , brings back a couple of long bottles , and takes out the corks -- says : ` There now , smell them , taste them , examine the bottles , inspect the labels .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 17]: One of 'm 's from Europe , the other 's never been out of this country .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 12]: One 's European olive-oil , the other 's American cotton-seed olive-oil .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 4]: Tell 'm apart ?
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 6]: ` Course you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 3]: Nobody can .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 37]: People that want to , can go to the expense and trouble of shipping their oils to Europe and back -- it 's their privilege ; but our firm knows a trick worth six of that .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 28]: We turn out the whole thing -- clean from the word go -- in our factory in New Orleans : labels , bottles , oil , everything .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 17]: Well , no , not labels : been buying them abroad -- get them dirt-cheap there .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 78]: You see , there 's just one little wee speck , essence , or whatever it is , in a gallon of cotton-seed oil , that give it a smell , or a flavor , or something -- get that out , and you 're all right -- perfectly easy then to turn the oil into any kind of oil you want to , and there ai n't anybody that can detect the true from the false .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 22]: Well , we know how to get that one little particle out -- and we 're the only firm that does .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 14]: And we turn out an olive-oil that is just simply perfect -- undetectable !
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 22]: We are doing a ripping trade , too -- as I could easily show you by my order-book for this trip .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 32]: Maybe you 'll butter everybody 's bread pretty soon , but we 'll cotton-seed his salad for him from the Gulf to Canada , and that 's a dead-certain thing . '
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 7]: Cincinnati glowed and flashed with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 9]: The two scoundrels exchanged business-cards , and rose .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 22]: As they left the table , Cincinnati said -- ` But you have to have custom-house marks , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 7]: How do you manage that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 7]: I did not catch the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 75]: We passed Port Hudson , scene of two of the most terrific episodes of the war -- the night-battle there between Farragut 's fleet and the Confederate land batteries , April 14th , 1863 ; and the memorable land battle , two months later , which lasted eight hours -- eight hours of exceptionally fierce and stubborn fighting -- and ended , finally , in the repulse of the Union forces with great slaughter .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 26]: Chapter 40 Castles and Culture BATON ROUGE was clothed in flowers , like a bride -- no , much more so ; like a greenhouse .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 19]: For we were in the absolute South now -- no modifications , no compromises , no half-way measures .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 21]: The magnolia-trees in the Capitol grounds were lovely and fragrant , with their dense rich foliage and huge snow-ball blossoms .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 22]: The scent of the flower is very sweet , but you want distance on it , because it is so powerful .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 15]: They are not good bedroom blossoms -- they might suffocate one in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 40]: We were certainly in the South at last ; for here the sugar region begins , and the plantations -- vast green levels , with sugar-mill and negro quarters clustered together in the middle distance -- were in view .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 15]: And there was a tropical sun overhead and a tropical swelter in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 43]: And at this point , also , begins the pilot 's paradise : a wide river hence to New Orleans , abundance of water from shore to shore , and no bars , snags , sawyers , or wrecks in his road .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 46]: Sir Walter Scott is probably responsible for the Capitol building ; for it is not conceivable that this little sham castle would ever have been built if he had not run the people mad , a couple of generations ago , with his medieval romances .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 14]: The South has not yet recovered from the debilitating influence of his books .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 53]: Admiration of his fantastic heroes and their grotesque ` chivalry ' doings and romantic juvenilities still survives here , in an atmosphere in which is already perceptible the wholesome and practical nineteenth-century smell of cotton-factories and locomotives ; and traces of its inflated language and other windy humbuggeries survive along with it .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 89]: It is pathetic enough , that a whitewashed castle , with turrets and things -- materials all ungenuine within and without , pretending to be what they are not -- should ever have been built in this otherwise honorable place ; but it is much more pathetic to see this architectural falsehood undergoing restoration and perpetuation in our day , when it would have been so easy to let dynamite finish what a charitable fire began , and then devote this restoration-money to the building of something genuine .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 17]: Baton Rouge has no patent on imitation castles , however , and no monopoly of them .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 18]: Here is a picture from the advertisement of the ` Female Institute ' of Columbia ; Tennessee .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 26]: The following remark is from the same advertisement -- ` The Institute building has long been famed as a model of striking and beautiful architecture .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 27]: Visitors are charmed with its resemblance to the old castles of song and story , with its towers , turreted walls , and ivy-mantled porches . '
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 19]: Keeping school in a castle is a romantic thing ; as romantic as keeping hotel in a castle .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 58]: By itself the imitation castle is doubtless harmless , and well enough ; but as a symbol and breeder and sustainer of maudlin Middle-Age romanticism here in the midst of the plainest and sturdiest and infinitely greatest and worthiest of all the centuries the world has seen , it is necessarily a hurtful thing and a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 15]: Here is an extract from the prospectus of a Kentucky ` Female College . '
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 99]: Female college sounds well enough ; but since the phrasing it in that unjustifiable way was done purely in the interest of brevity , it seems to me that she-college would have been still better -- because shorter , and means the same thing : that is , if either phrase means anything at all -- ` The president is southern by birth , by rearing , by education , and by sentiment ; the teachers are all southern in sentiment , and with the exception of those born in Europe were born and raised in the south .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 53]: Believing the southern to be the highest type of civilization this continent has seen , the young ladies are trained according to the southern ideas of delicacy , refinement , womanhood , religion , and propriety ; hence we offer a first-class female college for the south and solicit southern patronage .

Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 32]: -- This morning a few minutes after ten o'clock , General Joseph A. Mabry , Thomas O'Connor , and Joseph A. Mabry , Jr. , were killed in a shooting affray .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 17]: The difficulty began yesterday afternoon by General Mabry attacking Major O'Connor and threatening to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 22]: This was at the fair grounds , and O'Connor told Mabry that it was not the place to settle their difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 9]: Mabry then told O'Connor he should not live .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 11]: It seems that Mabry was armed and O'Connor was not .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 20]: The cause of the difficulty was an old feud about the transfer of some property from Mabry to O'Connor .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 17]: Later in the afternoon Mabry sent word to O'Connor that he would kill him on sight .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 22]: This morning Major O'Connor was standing in the door of the Mechanics ' National Bank , of which he was president .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 17]: General Mabry and another gentleman walked down Gay Street on the opposite side from the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 20]: O'Connor stepped into the bank , got a shot gun , took deliberate aim at General Mabry and fired .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 11]: Mabry fell dead , being shot in the left side .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 16]: As he fell O'Connor fired again , the shot taking effect in Mabry 's thigh .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 12]: O'Connor then reached into the bank and got another shot gun .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 54]: About this time Joseph A. Mabry , Jr. , son of General Mabry , came rushing down the street , unseen by O'Connor until within forty feet , when the young man fired a pistol , the shot taking effect in O'Connor 's right breast , passing through the body near the heart .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 23]: The instant Mabry shot , O'Connor turned and fired , the load taking effect in young Mabry 's right breast and side .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 17]: Mabry fell pierced with twenty buckshot , and almost instantly O'Connor fell dead without a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 10]: Mabry tried to rise , but fell back dead .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 19]: The whole tragedy occurred within two minutes , and neither of the three spoke after he was shot .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: General Mabry had about thirty buckshot in his body .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 20]: A bystander was painfully wounded in the thigh with a buckshot , and another was wounded in the arm .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 10]: Four other men had their clothing pierced by buckshot .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 16]: The affair caused great excitement , and Gay Street was thronged with thousands of people .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 35]: General Mabry and his son Joe were acquitted only a few days ago of the murder of Moses Lusby and Don Lusby , father and son , whom they killed a few weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: Will Mabry was killed by Don Lusby last Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 22]: Major Thomas O'Connor was President of the Mechanics ' National Bank here , and was the wealthiest man in the State .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 5]: -- ASSOCIATED PRESS TELEGRAM .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 41]: One day last month , Professor Sharpe , of the Somerville , Tenn. , Female College , ' a quiet and gentlemanly man , ' was told that his brother-in-law , a Captain Burton , had threatened to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 17]: Burton , t seems , had already killed one man and driven his knife into another .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 32]: The Professor armed himself with a double-barreled shot gun , started out in search of his brother-in-law , found him playing billiards in a saloon , and blew his brains out .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 43]: The ` Memphis Avalanche ' reports that the Professor 's course met with pretty general approval in the community ; knowing that the law was powerless , in the actual condition of public sentiment , to protect him , he protected himself .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 24]: About the same time , two young men in North Carolina quarreled about a girl , and ` hostile messages ' were exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 14]: Friends tried to reconcile them , but had their labor for their pains .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 12]: On the 24th the young men met in the public highway .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 16]: One of them had a heavy club in his hand , the other an ax .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 21]: The man with the club fought desperately for his life , but it was a hopeless fight from the first .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 22]: A well-directed blow sent his club whirling out of his grasp , and the next moment he was a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 30]: About the same time , two ` highly connected ' young Virginians , clerks in a hardware store at Charlottesville , while ` skylarking , ' came to blows .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 53]: Peter Dick threw pepper in Charles Roads 's eyes ; Roads demanded an apology ; Dick refused to give it , and it was agreed that a duel was inevitable , but a difficulty arose ; the parties had no pistols , and it was too late at night to procure them .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 41]: One of them suggested that butcher-knives would answer the purpose , and the other accepted the suggestion ; the result was that Roads fell to the floor with a gash in his abdomen that may or may not prove fatal .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 13]: If Dick has been arrested , the news has not reached us .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 33]: He ` expressed deep regret , ' and we are told by a Staunton correspondent of the PHILADELPHIA PRESS that ` every effort has been made to hush the matter up . '

Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 6]: What , warder , ho !
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 19]: the man that can blow so complacent a blast as that , probably blows it from a castle .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 38]: From Baton Rouge to New Orleans , the great sugar plantations border both sides of the river all the way , and stretch their league-wide levels back to the dim forest-walls of bearded cypress in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 5]: Shores lonely no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 37]: Plenty of dwellings all the way , on both banks -- standing so close together , for long distances , that the broad river lying between the two rows , becomes a sort of spacious street .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 7]: A most home-like and happy-looking region .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 17]: And now and then you see a pillared and porticoed great manor-house , embowered in trees .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 22]: Here is testimony of one or two of the procession of foreign tourists that filed along here half a century ago .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 62]: Mrs. Trollope says -- ` The unbroken flatness of the banks of the Mississippi continued unvaried for many miles above New Orleans ; but the graceful and luxuriant palmetto , the dark and noble ilex , and the bright orange , were everywhere to be seen , and it was many days before we were weary of looking at them . '
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 60]: Captain Basil Hall -- ` The district of country which lies adjacent to the Mississippi , in the lower parts of Louisiana , is everywhere thickly peopled by sugar planters , whose showy houses , gay piazzas , trig gardens , and numerous slave-villages , all clean and neat , gave an exceedingly thriving air to the river scenery .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 12]: All the procession paint the attractive picture in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 38]: The descriptions of fifty years ago do not need to have a word changed in order to exactly describe the same region as it appears to-day -- except as to the ` trigness ' of the houses .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 39]: The whitewash is gone from the negro cabins now ; and many , possibly most , of the big mansions , once so shining white , have worn out their paint and have a decayed , neglected look .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 8]: It is the blight of the war .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 30]: Twenty-one years ago everything was trim and trig and bright along the ` coast , ' just as it had been in 1827 , as described by those tourists .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 3]: Unfortunate tourists !
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 21]: People humbugged them with stupid and silly lies , and then laughed at them for believing and printing the same .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 53]: They told Mrs. Trollope that the alligators -- or crocodiles , as she calls them -- were terrible creatures ; and backed up the statement with a blood-curdling account of how one of these slandered reptiles crept into a squatter cabin one night , and ate up a woman and five children .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 27]: The woman , by herself , would have satisfied any ordinarily-impossible alligator ; but no , these liars must make him gorge the five children besides .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 18]: One would not imagine that jokers of this robust breed would be sensitive -- but they were .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 41]: It is difficult , at this day , to understand , and impossible to justify , the reception which the book of the grave , honest , intelligent , gentle , manly , charitable , well-meaning Capt. Basil Hall got .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 20]: Chapter 41 The Metropolis of the South THE approaches to New Orleans were familiar ; general aspects were unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 45]: When one goes flying through London along a railway propped in the air on tall arches , he may inspect miles of upper bedrooms through the open windows , but the lower half of the houses is under his level and out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 63]: Similarly , in high-river stage , in the New Orleans region , the water is up to the top of the enclosing levee-rim , the flat country behind it lies low -- representing the bottom of a dish -- and as the boat swims along , high on the flood , one looks down upon the houses and into the upper windows .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 15]: There is nothing but that frail breastwork of earth between the people and destruction .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 114]: The old brick salt-warehouses clustered at the upper end of the city looked as they had always looked ; warehouses which had had a kind of Aladdin 's lamp experience , however , since I had seen them ; for when the war broke out the proprietor went to bed one night leaving them packed with thousands of sacks of vulgar salt , worth a couple of dollars a sack , and got up in the morning and found his mountain of salt turned into a mountain of gold , so to speak , so suddenly and to so dizzy a height had the war news sent up the price of the article .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 41]: The vast reach of plank wharves remained unchanged , and there were as many ships as ever : but the long array of steamboats had vanished ; not altogether , of course , but not much of it was left .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 11]: The city itself had not changed -- to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 19]: It had greatly increased in spread and population , but the look of the town was not altered .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 66]: The dust , waste-paper-littered , was still deep in the streets ; the deep , trough-like gutters alongside the curbstones were still half full of reposeful water with a dusty surface ; the sidewalks were still -- in the sugar and bacon region -- encumbered by casks and barrels and hogsheads ; the great blocks of austerely plain commercial houses were as dusty-looking as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 48]: Canal Street was finer , and more attractive and stirring than formerly , with its drifting crowds of people , its several processions of hurrying street-cars , and -- toward evening -- its broad second-story verandas crowded with gentlemen and ladies clothed according to the latest mode .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 33]: Not that there is any ` architecture ' in Canal Street : to speak in broad , general terms , there is no architecture in New Orleans , except in the cemeteries .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 29]: It seems a strange thing to say of a wealthy , far-seeing , and energetic city of a quarter of a million inhabitants , but it is true .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 25]: There is a huge granite U.S. Custom-house -- costly enough , genuine enough , but as a decoration it is inferior to a gasometer .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 7]: It looks like a state prison .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 8]: But it was built before the war .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 14]: Architecture in America may be said to have been born since the war .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 30]: New Orleans , I believe , has had the good luck -- and in a sense the bad luck -- to have had no great fire in late years .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 5]: It must be so .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 33]: If the opposite had been the case , I think one would be able to tell the ` burnt district ' by the radical improvement in its architecture over the old forms .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 9]: One can do this in Boston and Chicago .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 45]: The ` burnt district ' of Boston was commonplace before the fire ; but now there is no commercial district in any city in the world that can surpass it -- or perhaps even rival it -- in beauty , elegance , and tastefulness .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 16]: However , New Orleans has begun -- just this moment , as one may say .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 35]: When completed , the new Cotton Exchange will be a stately and beautiful building ; massive , substantial , full of architectural graces ; no shams or false pretenses or uglinesses about it anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 20]: To the city , it will be worth many times its cost , for it will breed its species .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 27]: What has been lacking hitherto , was a model to build toward ; something to educate eye and taste ; a SUGGESTER , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 16]: The city is well outfitted with progressive men -- thinking , sagacious , long-headed men .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 22]: The contrast between the spirit of the city and the city 's architecture is like the contrast between waking and sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 15]: Apparently there is a ` boom ' in everything but that one dead feature .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 52]: The water in the gutters used to be stagnant and slimy , and a potent disease-breeder ; but the gutters are flushed now , two or three times a day , by powerful machinery ; in many of the gutters the water never stands still , but has a steady current .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 37]: Other sanitary improvements have been made ; and with such effect that New Orleans claims to be -LRB- during the long intervals between the occasional yellow-fever assaults -RRB- one of the healthiest cities in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 14]: There 's plenty of ice now for everybody , manufactured in the town .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 19]: It is a driving place commercially , and has a great river , ocean , and railway business .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 20]: At the date of our visit , it was the best lighted city in the Union , electrically speaking .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 19]: The New Orleans electric lights were more numerous than those of New York , and very much better .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 27]: One had this modified noonday not only in Canal and some neighboring chief streets , but all along a stretch of five miles of river frontage .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 28]: There are good clubs in the city now -- several of them but recently organized -- and inviting modern-style pleasure resorts at West End and Spanish Fort .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 5]: The telephone is everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 10]: One of the most notable advances is in journalism .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 14]: The newspapers , as I remember them , were not a striking feature .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 4]: Now they are .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 10]: Money is spent upon them with a free hand .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 12]: They get the news , let it cost what it may .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 10]: The editorial work is not hack-grinding , but literature .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 54]: As an example of New Orleans journalistic achievement , it may be mentioned that the ` Times-Democrat ' of August 26 , 1882 , contained a report of the year 's business of the towns of the Mississippi Valley , from New Orleans all the way to St. Paul -- two thousand miles .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 41]: That issue of the paper consisted of forty pages ; seven columns to the page ; two hundred and eighty columns in all ; fifteen hundred words to the column ; an aggregate of four hundred and twenty thousand words .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 21]: That is to say , not much short of three times as many words as there are in this book .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 13]: One may with sorrow contrast this with the architecture of New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 9]: I have been speaking of public architecture only .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 17]: The domestic article in New Orleans is reproachless , notwithstanding it remains as it always was .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 25]: All the dwellings are of wood -- in the American part of the town , I mean -- and all have a comfortable look .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 26]: Those in the wealthy quarter are spacious ; painted snow-white usually , and generally have wide verandas , or double-verandas , supported by ornamental columns .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 32]: These mansions stand in the center of large grounds , and rise , garlanded with roses , out of the midst of swelling masses of shining green foliage and many-colored blossoms .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 25]: No houses could well be in better harmony with their surroundings , or more pleasing to the eye , or more home-like and comfortable-looking .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 35]: One even becomes reconciled to the cistern presently ; this is a mighty cask , painted green , and sometimes a couple of stories high , which is propped against the house-corner on stilts .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 15]: There is a mansion-and-brewery suggestion about the combination which seems very incongruous at first .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 14]: But the people can not have wells , and so they take rain-water .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 45]: Neither can they conveniently have cellars , or graves , -LCB- footnote -LSB- The Israelites are buried in graves -- by permission , I take it , not requirement ; but none else , except the destitute , who are buried at public expense .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 12]: The graves are but three or four feet deep . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 29]: the town being built upon ` made ' ground ; so they do without both , and few of the living complain , and none of the others .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 16]: Chapter 42 Hygiene and Sentiment THEY bury their dead in vaults , above the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 81]: These vaults have a resemblance to houses -- sometimes to temples ; are built of marble , generally ; are architecturally graceful and shapely ; they face the walks and driveways of the cemetery ; and when one moves through the midst of a thousand or so of them and sees their white roofs and gables stretching into the distance on every hand , the phrase ` city of the dead ' has all at once a meaning to him .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 14]: Many of the cemeteries are beautiful , and are kept in perfect order .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 67]: When one goes from the levee or the business streets near it , to a cemetery , he observes to himself that if those people down there would live as neatly while they are alive as they do after they are dead , they would find many advantages in it ; and besides , their quarter would be the wonder and admiration of the business world .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 41]: Fresh flowers , in vases of water , are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults : placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children , husbands and wives , and renewed daily .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 63]: A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible ` immortelle ' -- which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem , made of rosettes of black linen , with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross 's bars -- kind of sorrowful breast-pin , so to say .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 51]: The immortelle requires no attention : you just hang it up , and there you are ; just leave it alone , it will take care of your grief for you , and keep it in mind better than you can ; stands weather first-rate , and lasts like boiler-iron .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 26]: On sunny days , pretty little chameleons -- gracefullest of legged reptiles -- creep along the marble fronts of the vaults , and catch flies .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 18]: Their changes of color -- as to variety -- are not up to the creature 's reputation .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 26]: They change color when a person comes along and hangs up an immortelle ; but that is nothing : any right-feeling reptile would do that .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 9]: I will gradually drop this subject of graveyards .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 24]: I have been trying all I could to get down to the sentimental part of it , but I can not accomplish it .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 11]: I think there is no genuinely sentimental part to it .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 9]: It is all grotesque , ghastly , horrible .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 85]: Graveyards may have been justifiable in the bygone ages , when nobody knew that for every dead body put into the ground , to glut the earth and the plant-roots , and the air with disease-germs , five or fifty , or maybe a hundred persons must die before their proper time ; but they are hardly justifiable now , when even the children know that a dead saint enters upon a century-long career of assassination the moment the earth closes over his corpse .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 9]: It is a grim sort of a thought .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 27]: The relics of St. Anne , up in Canada , have now , after nineteen hundred years , gone to curing the sick by the dozen .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 27]: But it is merest matter-of-course that these same relics , within a generation after St. Anne 's death and burial , MADE several thousand people sick .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 10]: Therefore these miracle-performances are simply compensation , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 53]: St. Anne is somewhat slow pay , for a Saint , it is true ; but better a debt paid after nineteen hundred years , and outlawed by the statute of limitations , than not paid at all ; and most of the knights of the halo do not pay at all .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 25]: Where you find one that pays -- like St. Anne -- you find a hundred and fifty that take the benefit of the statute .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 26]: And none of them pay any more than the principal of what they owe -- they pay none of the interest either simple or compound .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 32]: A Saint can never QUITE return the principal , however ; for his dead body KILLS people , whereas his relics HEAL only -- they never restore the dead to life .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 10]: That part of the account is always left unsettled .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 66]: ` Dr. F. Julius Le Moyne , after fifty years of medical practice , wrote : `` The inhumation of human bodies , dead from infectious diseases , results in constantly loading the atmosphere , and polluting the waters , with not only the germs that rise from simply putrefaction , but also with the SPECIFIC germs of the diseases from which death resulted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 39]: ` The gases -LRB- from buried corpses -RRB- will rise to the surface through eight or ten feet of gravel , just as coal-gas will do , and there is practically no limit to their power of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 38]: ` During the epidemic in New Orleans in 1853 , Dr. E. H. Barton reported that in the Fourth District the mortality was four hundred and fifty-two per thousand -- more than double that of any other .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 23]: In this district were three large cemeteries , in which during the previous year more than three thousand bodies had been buried .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 13]: In other districts the proximity of cemeteries seemed to aggravate the disease .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 37]: ` In 1828 Professor Bianchi demonstrated how the fearful reappearance of the plague at Modena was caused by excavations in ground where , THREE HUNDRED YEARS PREVIOUSLY , the victims of the pestilence had been buried .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 30]: Mr. Cooper , in explaining the causes of some epidemics , remarks that the opening of the plague burial-grounds at Eyam resulted in an immediate outbreak of disease . '
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 10]: -- NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW , NO. 3 , VOL .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 2]: 135 .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 63]: In an address before the Chicago Medical Society , in advocacy of cremation , Dr. Charles W. Purdy made some striking comparisons to show what a burden is laid upon society by the burial of the dead : -- ` One and one-fourth times more money is expended annually in funerals in the United States than the Government expends for public-school purposes .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 41]: Funerals cost this country in 1880 enough money to pay the liabilities of all the commercial failures in the United States during the same year , and give each bankrupt a capital of $ 8,630 with which to resume business .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 24]: Funerals cost annually more money than the value of the combined gold and silver yield of the United States in the year 1880 !
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 31]: These figures do not include the sums invested in burial-grounds and expended in tombs and monuments , nor the loss from depreciation of property in the vicinity of cemeteries . '
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 59]: For the rich , cremation would answer as well as burial ; for the ceremonies connected with it could be made as costly and ostentatious as a Hindu suttee ; while for the poor , cremation would be better than burial , because so cheap -LCB- footnote -LSB- Four or five dollars is the minimum cost . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 18]: -- so cheap until the poor got to imitating the rich , which they would do by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 40]: The adoption of cremation would relieve us of a muck of threadbare burial-witticisms ; but , on the other hand , it would resurrect a lot of mildewed old cremation-jokes that have had a rest for two thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 17]: I have a colored acquaintance who earns his living by odd jobs and heavy manual labor .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 40]: He never earns above four hundred dollars in a year , and as he has a wife and several young children , the closest scrimping is necessary to get him through to the end of the twelve months debtless .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 12]: To such a man a funeral is a colossal financial disaster .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 17]: While I was writing one of the preceding chapters , this man lost a little child .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 20]: He walked the town over with a friend , trying to find a coffin that was within his means .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 15]: He bought the very cheapest one he could find , plain wood , stained .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 6]: It cost him twenty-six dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 21]: It would have cost less than four , probably , if it had been built to put something useful into .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 13]: He and his family will feel that outlay a good many months .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 37]: Chapter 43 The Art of Inhumation ABOUT the same time , I encountered a man in the street , whom I had not seen for six or seven years ; and something like this talk followed .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 18]: I said -- ` But you used to look sad and oldish ; you do n't now .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 11]: Where did you get all this youth and bubbling cheerfulness ?
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 6]: Give me the address . '
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 45]: He chuckled blithely , took off his shining tile , pointed to a notched pink circlet of paper pasted into its crown , with something lettered on it , and went on chuckling while I read , ` J. B -- , UNDERTAKER . '
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 27]: Then he clapped his hat on , gave it an irreverent tilt to leeward , and cried out -- ` That 's what 's the matter !
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 22]: It used to be rough times with me when you knew me -- insurance-agency business , you know ; mighty irregular .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 24]: Big fire , all right -- brisk trade for ten days while people scared ; after that , dull policy-business till next fire .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 25]: Town like this do n't have fires often enough -- a fellow strikes so many dull weeks in a row that he gets discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 10]: But you bet you , this is the business !
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 9]: People do n't wait for examples to die .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 21]: No , sir , they drop off right along -- there ai n't any dull spots in the undertaker line .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 23]: I just started in with two or three little old coffins and a hired hearse , and now look at the thing !
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 20]: I 've worked up a business here that would satisfy any man , do n't care who he is .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 28]: Five years ago , lodged in an attic ; live in a swell house now , with a mansard roof , and all the modern inconveniences . '
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 8]: ` Does a coffin pay so well .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 9]: Is there much profit on a coffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 3]: ` Go-way !
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 5]: How you talk ! '
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 41]: Then , with a confidential wink , a dropping of the voice , and an impressive laying of his hand on my arm ; ` Look here ; there 's one thing in this world which is n't ever cheap .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 5]: That 's a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 20]: There 's one thing in this world which a person do n't ever try to jew you down on .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 5]: That 's a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 40]: There 's one thing in this world which a person do n't say -- `` I 'll look around a little , and if I find I ca n't do better I 'll come back and take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 5]: That 's a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 53]: There 's one thing in this world which a person wo n't take in pine if he can go walnut ; and wo n't take in walnut if he can go mahogany ; and wo n't take in mahogany if he can go an iron casket with silver door-plate and bronze handles .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: That 's a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 26]: And there 's one thing in this world which you do n't have to worry around after a person to get him to pay for .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 6]: And that 's a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 2]: Undertaking ?
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 14]: -- why it 's the dead-surest business in Christendom , and the nobbiest .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 8]: ` Why , just look at it .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 37]: A rich man wo n't have anything but your very best ; and you can just pile it on , too -- pile it on and sock it to him -- he wo n't ever holler .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 23]: And you take in a poor man , and if you work him right he 'll bust himself on a single lay-out .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 5]: Or especially a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 20]: F ' r instance : Mrs. O'Flaherty comes in -- widow -- wiping her eyes and kind of moaning .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 27]: Unhandkerchiefs one eye , bats it around tearfully over the stock ; says -- ' `` And fhat might ye ask for that wan ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 44]: `` Thirty-nine dollars , madam , '' says I. ' `` It 's a foine big price , sure , but Pat shall be buried like a gintleman , as he was , if I have to work me fingers off for it .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 10]: I 'll have that wan , sor . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 46]: `` Yes , madam , '' says I , `` and it is a very good one , too ; not costly , to be sure , but in this life we must cut our garment to our clothes , as the saying is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 82]: And as she starts out , I heave in , kind of casually , `` This one with the white satin lining is a beauty , but I am afraid -- well , sixty-five dollars is a rather -- rather -- but no matter , I felt obliged to say to Mrs. O'Shaughnessy -- '' ' `` D'ye mane to soy that Bridget O'Shaughnessy bought the mate to that joo-ul box to ship that dhrunken divil to Purgatory in ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 7]: `` Yes , madam . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 44]: `` Then Pat shall go to heaven in the twin to it , if it takes the last rap the O'Flaherties can raise ; and moind you , stick on some extras , too , and I 'll give ye another dollar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 48]: ` And as I lay-in with the livery stables , of course I do n't forget to mention that Mrs. O'Shaughnessy hired fifty-four dollars ' worth of hacks and flung as much style into Dennis 's funeral as if he had been a duke or an assassin .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 18]: And of course she sails in and goes the O'Shaughnessy about four hacks and an omnibus better .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 20]: That used to be , but that 's all played now ; that is , in this particular town .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 37]: The Irish got to piling up hacks so , on their funerals , that a funeral left them ragged and hungry for two years afterward ; so the priest pitched in and broke it all up .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 18]: He do n't allow them to have but two hacks now , and sometimes only one . '
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 28]: ` Well , ' said I , ` if you are so light-hearted and jolly in ordinary times , what must you be in an epidemic ? '
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: ` No , you 're off , there .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 9]: We do n't like to see an epidemic .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 6]: An epidemic do n't pay .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 24]: Well , of course I do n't mean that , exactly ; but it do n't pay in proportion to the regular thing .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 10]: Do n't it occur to you , why ? '
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 5]: ` Think . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 5]: I ca n't imagine .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 5]: What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 8]: ` It 's just two things . '
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 8]: ` Well , what are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 6]: ` One 's Embamming . '
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 8]: ` And what 's the other ? '
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 4]: ` Ice . '
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 6]: ` How is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 34]: ` Well , in ordinary times , a person dies , and we lay him up in ice ; one day two days , maybe three , to wait for friends to come .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 9]: Takes a lot of it -- melts fast .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 13]: We charge jewelry rates for that ice , and war-prices for attendance .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 26]: Well , do n't you know , when there 's an epidemic , they rush 'em to the cemetery the minute the breath 's out .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 8]: No market for ice in an epidemic .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 4]: Same with Embamming .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 18]: You take a family that 's able to embam , and you 've got a soft thing .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 42]: You can mention sixteen different ways to do it -- though there AI N'T only one or two ways , when you come down to the bottom facts of it -- and they 'll take the highest-priced way , every time .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 10]: It 's human nature -- human nature in grief .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 8]: It do n't reason , you see .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 10]: Time being , it do n't care a dam .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 18]: All it wants is physical immortality for deceased , and they 're willing to pay for it .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 23]: All you 've got to do is to just be ca 'm and stack it up -- they 'll stand the racket .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 49]: Why , man , you can take a defunct that you could n't GIVE away ; and get your embamming traps around you and go to work ; and in a couple of hours he is worth a cool six hundred -- that 's what HE 'S worth .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 19]: There ai n't anything equal to it but trading rats for di ` monds in time of famine .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 20]: Well , do n't you see , when there 's an epidemic , people do n't wait to embam .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 28]: No , indeed they do n't ; and it hurts the business like hell-th , as we say -- hurts it like hell-th , HEALTH , see ?
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 8]: -- Our little joke in the trade .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 7]: Well , I must be going .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 21]: Give me a call whenever you need any -- I mean , when you 're going by , sometime . '
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 18]: In his joyful high spirits , he did the exaggerating himself , if any has been done .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 7]: I have not enlarged on him .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 14]: With the above brief references to inhumation , let us leave the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 10]: As for me , I hope to be cremated .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 38]: I made that remark to my pastor once , who said , with what he seemed to think was an impressive manner -- ' I would n't worry about that , if I had your chances . '
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 14]: Much he knew about it -- the family all so opposed to it .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 39]: Chapter 44 City Sights THE old French part of New Orleans -- anciently the Spanish part -- bears no resemblance to the American end of the city : the American end which lies beyond the intervening brick business-center .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 50]: The houses are massed in blocks ; are austerely plain and dignified ; uniform of pattern , with here and there a departure from it with pleasant effect ; all are plastered on the outside , and nearly all have long , iron-railed verandas running along the several stories .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 22]: Their chief beauty is the deep , warm , varicolored stain with which time and the weather have enriched the plaster .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 24]: It harmonizes with all the surroundings , and has as natural a look of belonging there as has the flush upon sunset clouds .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 19]: This charming decoration can not be successfully imitated ; neither is it to be found elsewhere in America .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 9]: The iron railings are a specialty , also .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 37]: The pattern is often exceedingly light and dainty , and airy and graceful -- with a large cipher or monogram in the center , a delicate cobweb of baffling , intricate forms , wrought in steel .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 15]: The ancient railings are hand-made , and are now comparatively rare and proportionately valuable .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 5]: They are become BRIC-A-BRAC .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 30]: The party had the privilege of idling through this ancient quarter of New Orleans with the South 's finest literary genius , the author of ` the Grandissimes . '
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 17]: In him the South has found a masterly delineator of its interior life and its history .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 43]: In truth , I find by experience , that the untrained eye and vacant mind can inspect it , and learn of it , and judge of it , more clearly and profitably in his books than by personal contact with it .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 27]: With Mr. Cable along to see for you , and describe and explain and illuminate , a jog through that old quarter is a vivid pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 71]: And you have a vivid sense as of unseen or dimly seen things -- vivid , and yet fitful and darkling ; you glimpse salient features , but lose the fine shades or catch them imperfectly through the vision of the imagination : a case , as it were , of ignorant near-sighted stranger traversing the rim of wide vague horizons of Alps with an inspired and enlightened long-sighted native .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 14]: We visited the old St. Louis Hotel , now occupied by municipal offices .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 48]: There is nothing strikingly remarkable about it ; but one can say of it as of the Academy of Music in New York , that if a broom or a shovel has ever been used in it there is no circumstantial evidence to back up the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 47]: It is curious that cabbages and hay and things do not grow in the Academy of Music ; but no doubt it is on account of the interruption of the light by the benches , and the impossibility of hoeing the crop except in the aisles .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 30]: The fact that the ushers grow their buttonhole-bouquets on the premises shows what might be done if they had the right kind of an agricultural head to the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 114]: We visited also the venerable Cathedral , and the pretty square in front of it ; the one dim with religious light , the other brilliant with the worldly sort , and lovely with orange-trees and blossomy shrubs ; then we drove in the hot sun through the wilderness of houses and out on to the wide dead level beyond , where the villas are , and the water wheels to drain the town , and the commons populous with cows and children ; passing by an old cemetery where we were told lie the ashes of an early pirate ; but we took him on trust , and did not visit him .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 72]: He was a pirate with a tremendous and sanguinary history ; and as long as he preserved unspotted , in retirement , the dignity of his name and the grandeur of his ancient calling , homage and reverence were his from high and low ; but when at last he descended into politics and became a paltry alderman , the public ` shook ' him , and turned aside and wept .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 35]: When he died , they set up a monument over him ; and little by little he has come into respect again ; but it is respect for the pirate , not the alderman .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 18]: To-day the loyal and generous remember only what he was , and charitably forget what he became .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 80]: Thence , we drove a few miles across a swamp , along a raised shell road , with a canal on one hand and a dense wood on the other ; and here and there , in the distance , a ragged and angular-limbed and moss-bearded cypress , top standing out , clear cut against the sky , and as quaint of form as the apple-trees in Japanese pictures -- such was our course and the surroundings of it .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 36]: There was an occasional alligator swimming comfortably along in the canal , and an occasional picturesque colored person on the bank , flinging his statue-rigid reflection upon the still water and watching for a bite .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 39]: And by-and-bye we reached the West End , a collection of hotels of the usual light summer-resort pattern , with broad verandas all around , and the waves of the wide and blue Lake Pontchartrain lapping the thresholds .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 29]: We had dinner on a ground-veranda over the water -- the chief dish the renowned fish called the pompano , delicious as the less criminal forms of sin .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 53]: Thousands of people come by rail and carriage to West End and to Spanish Fort every evening , and dine , listen to the bands , take strolls in the open air under the electric lights , go sailing on the lake , and entertain themselves in various and sundry other ways .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 15]: We had opportunities on other days and in other places to test the pompano .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 15]: Notably , at an editorial dinner at one of the clubs in the city .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 14]: He was in his last possible perfection there , and justified his fame .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 27]: In his suite was a tall pyramid of scarlet cray-fish -- large ones ; as large as one 's thumb -- delicate , palatable , appetizing .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 23]: Also deviled whitebait ; also shrimps of choice quality ; and a platter of small soft-shell crabs of a most superior breed .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 35]: The other dishes were what one might get at Delmonico 's , or Buckingham Palace ; those I have spoken of can be had in similar perfection in New Orleans only , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 15]: In the West and South they have a new institution -- the Broom Brigade .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 27]: It is composed of young ladies who dress in a uniform costume , and go through the infantry drill , with broom in place of musket .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 11]: It is a very pretty sight , on private view .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 26]: When they perform on the stage of a theater , in the blaze of colored fires , it must be a fine and fascinating spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 17]: I saw them go through their complex manual with grace , spirit , and admirable precision .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 19]: I saw them do everything which a human being can possibly do with a broom , except sweep .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 7]: I did not see them sweep .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 7]: But I know they could learn .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 8]: What they have already learned proves that .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 38]: And if they ever should learn , and should go on the war-path down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other streets around there , those thoroughfares would bear a greatly improved aspect in a very few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 17]: But the girls themselves would n't ; so nothing would be really gained , after all .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 9]: The drill was in the Washington Artillery building .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 12]: In this building we saw many interesting relics of the war .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 14]: Also a fine oil-painting representing Stonewall Jackson 's last interview with General Lee .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 6]: Both men are on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 11]: Jackson has just ridden up , and is accosting Lee .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 16]: The picture is very valuable , on account of the portraits , which are authentic .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 15]: But , like many another historical picture , it means nothing without its label .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 18]: And one label will fit it as well as another -- First Interview between Lee and Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 7]: Last Interview between Lee and Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 6]: Jackson Introducing Himself to Lee .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 8]: Jackson Accepting Lee 's Invitation to Dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 11]: Jackson Declining Lee 's Invitation to Dinner -- with Thanks .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 7]: Jackson Apologizing for a Heavy Defeat .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 6]: Jackson Reporting a Great Victory .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 7]: Jackson Asking Lee for a Match .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 27]: It tells ONE story , and a sufficient one ; for it says quite plainly and satisfactorily , ` Here are Lee and Jackson together . '
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 23]: The artist would have made it tell that this is Lee and Jackson 's last interview if he could have done it .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 15]: But he could n't , for there was n't any way to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 23]: A good legible label is usually worth , for information , a ton of significant attitude and expression in a historical picture .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 27]: In Rome , people with fine sympathetic natures stand up and weep in front of the celebrated ` Beatrice Cenci the Day before her Execution . '
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 8]: It shows what a label can do .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 34]: If they did not know the picture , they would inspect it unmoved , and say , ` Young girl with hay fever ; young girl with her head in a bag . '
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 19]: I found the half-forgotten Southern intonations and elisions as pleasing to my ear as they had formerly been .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 5]: A Southerner talks music .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 17]: At least it is music to me , but then I was born in the South .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 18]: The educated Southerner has no use for an r , except at the beginning of a word .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 30]: He says ` honah , ' and ` dinnah , ' and ` Gove ` nuh , ' and ` befo ' the waw , ' and so on .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 20]: The words may lack charm to the eye , in print , but they have it to the ear .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 17]: When did the r disappear from Southern speech , and how did it come to disappear ?
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 17]: The custom of dropping it was not borrowed from the North , nor inherited from England .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 19]: Many Southerners -- most Southerners -- put a y into occasional words that begin with the k sound .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 26]: For instance , they say Mr. K'yahtah -LRB- Carter -RRB- and speak of playing k ` yahds or of riding in the k ` yahs .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 25]: And they have the pleasant custom -- long ago fallen into decay in the North -- of frequently employing the respectful ` Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 25]: Instead of the curt Yes , and the abrupt No , they say ` Yes , Suh ' , ` No , Suh . '
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 6]: But there are some infelicities .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 24]: Such as ` like ' for ` as , ' and the addition of an ` at ' where it is n't needed .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 14]: I heard an educated gentleman say , ` Like the flag-officer did . '
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 16]: His cook or his butler would have said , ` Like the flag-officer done . '
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 13]: You hear gentlemen say , ` Where have you been at ? '
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 32]: And here is the aggravated form -- heard a ragged street Arab say it to a comrade : ' I was a-ask 'n' Tom whah you was a-sett 'n' at . '
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 42]: The very elect carelessly say ` will ' when they mean ` shall ' ; and many of them say , ' I did n't go to do it , ' meaning ' I did n't mean to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 36]: The Northern word ` guess ' -- imported from England , where it used to be common , and now regarded by satirical Englishmen as a Yankee original -- is but little used among Southerners .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 6]: They say ` reckon . '
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 20]: They have n't any ` does n't ' in their language ; they say ` do n't ' instead .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 12]: The unpolished often use ` went ' for ` gone . '
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 14]: It is nearly as bad as the Northern ` had n't ought . '
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 37]: This reminds me that a remark of a very peculiar nature was made here in my neighborhood -LRB- in the North -RRB- a few days ago : ` He had n't ought to have went . '
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 4]: How is that ?
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 10]: Is n't that a good deal of a triumph ?
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 21]: One knows the orders combined in this half-breed 's architecture without inquiring : one parent Northern , the other Southern .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 14]: To-day I heard a schoolmistress ask , ` Where is John gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 37]: This form is so common -- so nearly universal , in fact -- that if she had used ` whither ' instead of ` where , ' I think it would have sounded like an affectation .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 30]: We picked up one excellent word -- a word worth traveling to New Orleans to get ; a nice limber , expressive , handy word -- ` lagniappe . '
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 5]: They pronounce it lanny-yap .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 8]: It is Spanish -- so they said .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 47]: We discovered it at the head of a column of odds and ends in the Picayune , the first day ; heard twenty people use it the second ; inquired what it meant the third ; adopted it and got facility in swinging it the fourth .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 20]: It has a restricted meaning , but I think the people spread it out a little when they choose .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 16]: It is the equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a ` baker 's dozen . '
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 12]: It is something thrown in , gratis , for good measure .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 11]: The custom originated in the Spanish quarter of the city .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 40]: When a child or a servant buys something in a shop -- or even the mayor or the governor , for aught I know -- he finishes the operation by saying -- ` Give me something for lagniappe . '
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 43]: The shopman always responds ; gives the child a bit of licorice-root , gives the servant a cheap cigar or a spool of thread , gives the governor -- I do n't know what he gives the governor ; support , likely .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 27]: When you are invited to drink , and this does occur now and then in New Orleans -- and you say , ` What , again ?
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 28]: -- no , I 've had enough ; ' the other party says , ` But just this one time more -- this is for lagniappe . '
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 64]: When the beau perceives that he is stacking his compliments a trifle too high , and sees by the young lady 's countenance that the edifice would have been better with the top compliment left off , he puts his ' I beg pardon -- no harm intended , ' into the briefer form of ` Oh , that 's for lagniappe . '
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 38]: If the waiter in the restaurant stumbles and spills a gill of coffee down the back of your neck , he says ` For lagniappe , sah , ' and gets you another cup without extra charge .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 46]: Chapter 45 Southern Sports IN the North one hears the war mentioned , in social conversation , once a month ; sometimes as often as once a week ; but as a distinct subject for talk , it has long ago been relieved of duty .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 7]: There are sufficient reasons for this .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 30]: Given a dinner company of six gentlemen to-day , it can easily happen that four of them -- and possibly five -- were not in the field at all .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 50]: So the chances are four to two , or five to one , that the war will at no time during the evening become the topic of conversation ; and the chances are still greater that if it become the topic it will remain so but a little while .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 51]: If you add six ladies to the company , you have added six people who saw so little of the dread realities of the war that they ran out of talk concerning them years ago , and now would soon weary of the war topic if you brought it up .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 9]: The case is very different in the South .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 20]: There , every man you meet was in the war ; and every lady you meet saw the war .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 10]: The war is the great chief topic of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 17]: The interest in it is vivid and constant ; the interest in other topics is fleeting .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 24]: Mention of the war will wake up a dull company and set their tongues going , when nearly any other topic would fail .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 17]: In the South , the war is what A.D. is elsewhere : they date from it .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 54]: All day long you hear things ` placed ' as having happened since the waw ; or du'in ' the waw ; or befo ' the waw ; or right aftah the waw ; or ` bout two yeahs or five yeahs or ten yeahs befo ' the waw or aftah the waw .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 19]: It shows how intimately every individual was visited , in his own person , by that tremendous episode .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 29]: It gives the inexperienced stranger a better idea of what a vast and comprehensive calamity invasion is than he can ever get by reading books at the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 35]: At a club one evening , a gentleman turned to me and said , in an aside -- ` You notice , of course , that we are nearly always talking about the war .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 25]: It is n't because we have n't anything else to talk about , but because nothing else has so strong an interest for us .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 67]: And there is another reason : In the war , each of us , in his own person , seems to have sampled all the different varieties of human experience ; as a consequence , you ca n't mention an outside matter of any sort but it will certainly remind some listener of something that happened during the war -- and out he comes with it .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 11]: Of course that brings the talk back to the war .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 90]: You may try all you want to , to keep other subjects before the house , and we may all join in and help , but there can be but one result : the most random topic would load every man up with war reminiscences , and shut him up , too ; and talk would be likely to stop presently , because you ca n't talk pale inconsequentialities when you 've got a crimson fact or fancy in your head that you are burning to fetch out . '
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 20]: The poet was sitting some little distance away ; and presently he began to speak -- about the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 61]: The gentleman who had been talking to me remarked in an ` aside : ' ` There , the moon is far enough from the seat of war , but you will see that it will suggest something to somebody about the war ; in ten minutes from now the moon , as a topic , will be shelved . '
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 71]: The poet was saying he had noticed something which was a surprise to him ; had had the impression that down here , toward the equator , the moonlight was much stronger and brighter than up North ; had had the impression that when he visited New Orleans , many years ago , the moon -- Interruption from the other end of the room -- ` Let me explain that .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 6]: Reminds me of an anecdote .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 34]: Everything is changed since the war , for better or for worse ; but you 'll find people down here born grumblers , who see no change except the change for the worse .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 10]: There was an old negro woman of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 19]: A young New-Yorker said in her presence , `` What a wonderful moon you have down here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 28]: She sighed and said , `` Ah , bless yo ' heart , honey , you ought to seen dat moon befo ' de waw ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 7]: The new topic was dead already .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 13]: But the poet resurrected it , and gave it a new start .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 22]: A brief dispute followed , as to whether the difference between Northern and Southern moonlight really existed or was only imagined .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 13]: Moonlight talk drifted easily into talk about artificial methods of dispelling darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 65]: Then somebody remembered that when Farragut advanced upon Port Hudson on a dark night -- and did not wish to assist the aim of the Confederate gunners -- he carried no battle-lanterns , but painted the decks of his ships white , and thus created a dim but valuable light , which enabled his own men to grope their way around with considerable facility .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 18]: At this point the war got the floor again -- the ten minutes not quite up yet .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 39]: I was not sorry , for war talk by men who have been in a war is always interesting ; whereas moon talk by a poet who has not been in the moon is likely to be dull .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 13]: We went to a cockpit in New Orleans on a Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 8]: I had never seen a cock-fight before .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 20]: There were men and boys there of all ages and all colors , and of many languages and nationalities .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 15]: But I noticed one quite conspicuous and surprising absence : the traditional brutal faces .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 6]: There were no brutal faces .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 41]: With no cock-fighting going on , you could have played the gathering on a stranger for a prayer-meeting ; and after it began , for a revival -- provided you blindfolded your stranger -- for the shouting was something prodigious .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 15]: A negro and a white man were in the ring ; everybody else outside .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 36]: The cocks were brought in in sacks ; and when time was called , they were taken out by the two bottle-holders , stroked , caressed , poked toward each other , and finally liberated .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 21]: The big black cock plunged instantly at the little gray one and struck him on the head with his spur .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: The gray responded with spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 14]: Then the Babel of many-tongued shoutings broke out , and ceased not thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 37]: When the cocks had been fighting some little time , I was expecting them momently to drop dead , for both were blind , red with blood , and so exhausted that they frequently fell down .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 12]: Yet they would not give up , neither would they die .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 55]: The negro and the white man would pick them up every few seconds , wipe them off , blow cold water on them in a fine spray , and take their heads in their mouths and hold them there a moment -- to warm back the perishing life perhaps ; I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 36]: Then , being set down again , the dying creatures would totter gropingly about , with dragging wings , find each other , strike a guesswork blow or two , and fall exhausted once more .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 10]: I did not see the end of the battle .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 33]: I forced myself to endure it as long as I could , but it was too pitiful a sight ; so I made frank confession to that effect , and we retired .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 18]: We heard afterward that the black cock died in the ring , and fighting to the last .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 22]: Evidently there is abundant fascination about this ` sport ' for such as have had a degree of familiarity with it .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 14]: I never saw people enjoy anything more than this gathering enjoyed this fight .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 14]: The case was the same with old gray-heads and with boys of ten .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 8]: They lost themselves in frenzies of delight .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 57]: The ` cocking-main ' is an inhuman sort of entertainment , there is no question about that ; still , it seems a much more respectable and far less cruel sport than fox-hunting -- for the cocks like it ; they experience , as well as confer enjoyment ; which is not the fox 's case .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 16]: We assisted -- in the French sense -- at a mule race , one day .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 13]: I believe I enjoyed this contest more than any other mule there .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 17]: I enjoyed it more than I remember having enjoyed any other animal race I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 15]: The grand-stand was well filled with the beauty and the chivalry of New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 8]: That phrase is not original with me .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 7]: It is the Southern reporter 's .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 8]: He has used it for two generations .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 27]: He uses it twenty times a day , or twenty thousand times a day ; or a million times a day -- according to the exigencies .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 40]: He is obliged to use it a million times a day , if he have occasion to speak of respectable men and women that often ; for he has no other phrase for such service except that single one .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 15]: He never tires of it ; it always has a fine sound to him .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 19]: There is a kind of swell medieval bulliness and tinsel about it that pleases his gaudy barbaric soul .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 26]: If he had been in Palestine in the early times , we should have had no references to ` much people ' out of him .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 24]: No , he would have said ` the beauty and the chivalry of Galilee ' assembled to hear the Sermon on the Mount .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 38]: It is likely that the men and women of the South are sick enough of that phrase by this time , and would like a change , but there is no immediate prospect of their getting it .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 24]: The New Orleans editor has a strong , compact , direct , unflowery style ; wastes no words , and does not gush .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 7]: Not so with his average correspondent .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 28]: In the Appendix I have quoted a good letter , penned by a trained hand ; but the average correspondent hurls a style which differs from that .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 19]: For instance -- The ` Times-Democrat ' sent a relief-steamer up one of the bayous , last April .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 30]: This steamer landed at a village , up there somewhere , and the Captain invited some of the ladies of the village to make a short trip with him .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 15]: They accepted and came aboard , and the steamboat shoved out up the creek .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 10]: That was all there was ` to it . '
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 19]: And that is all that the editor of the ` Times-Democrat ' would have got out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 20]: There was nothing in the thing but statistics , and he would have got nothing else out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 22]: He would probably have even tabulated them , partly to secure perfect clearness of statement , and partly to save space .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 11]: But his special correspondent knows other methods of handling statistics .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 45]: He just throws off all restraint and wallows in them -- ` On Saturday , early in the morning , the beauty of the place graced our cabin , and proud of her fair freight the gallant little boat glided up the bayou . '
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 35]: Twenty-two words to say the ladies came aboard and the boat shoved out up the creek , is a clean waste of ten good words , and is also destructive of compactness of statement .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 10]: The trouble with the Southern reporter is -- Women .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 11]: They unsettle him ; they throw him off his balance .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 17]: He is plain , and sensible , and satisfactory , until a woman heaves in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 17]: Then he goes all to pieces ; his mind totters , he becomes flowery and idiotic .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 30]: From reading the above extract , you would imagine that this student of Sir Walter Scott is an apprentice , and knows next to nothing about handling a pen .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 37]: On the contrary , he furnishes plenty of proofs , in his long letter , that he knows well enough how to handle it when the women are not around to give him the artificial-flower complaint .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 32]: For instance -- ` At 4 o'clock ominous clouds began to gather in the south-east , and presently from the Gulf there came a blow which increased in severity every moment .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 16]: It was not safe to leave the landing then , and there was a delay .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 36]: The oaks shook off long tresses of their mossy beards to the tugging of the wind , and the bayou in its ambition put on miniature waves in mocking of much larger bodies of water .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 21]: A lull permitted a start , and homewards we steamed , an inky sky overhead and a heavy wind blowing .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 19]: As darkness crept on , there were few on board who did not wish themselves nearer home . '
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 8]: There is nothing the matter with that .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 8]: It is good description , compactly put .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 14]: Yet there was great temptation , there , to drop into lurid writing .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 8]: But let us return to the mule .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 18]: Since I left him , I have rummaged around and found a full report of the race .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 44]: In it I find confirmation of the theory which I broached just now -- namely , that the trouble with the Southern reporter is Women : Women , supplemented by Walter Scott and his knights and beauty and chivalry , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 16]: This is an excellent report , as long as the women stay out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 36]: But when they intrude , we have this frantic result -- ` It will be probably a long time before the ladies ' stand presents such a sea of foam-like loveliness as it did yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 43]: The New Orleans women are always charming , but never so much so as at this time of the year , when in their dainty spring costumes they bring with them a breath of balmy freshness and an odor of sanctity unspeakable .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 55]: The stand was so crowded with them that , walking at their feet and seeing no possibility of approach , many a man appreciated as he never did before the Peri 's feeling at the Gates of Paradise , and wondered what was the priceless boon that would admit him to their sacred presence .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 46]: Sparkling on their white-robed breasts or shoulders were the colors of their favorite knights , and were it not for the fact that the doughty heroes appeared on unromantic mules , it would have been easy to imagine one of King Arthur 's gala-days . '
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 28]: There were thirteen mules in the first heat ; all sorts of mules , they were ; all sorts of complexions , gaits , dispositions , aspects .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 69]: Some were handsome creatures , some were not ; some were sleek , some had n't had their fur brushed lately ; some were innocently gay and frisky ; some were full of malice and all unrighteousness ; guessing from looks , some of them thought the matter on hand was war , some thought it was a lark , the rest took it for a religious occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 9]: And each mule acted according to his convictions .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 24]: The result was an absence of harmony well compensated by a conspicuous presence of variety -- variety of a picturesque and entertaining sort .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 10]: All the riders were young gentlemen in fashionable society .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 30]: If the reader has been wondering why it is that the ladies of New Orleans attend so humble an orgy as a mule-race , the thing is explained now .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 14]: It is a fashion-freak ; all connected with it are people of fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 9]: It is great fun , and cordially liked .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 12]: The mule-race is one of the marked occasions of the year .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 11]: It has brought some pretty fast mules to the front .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 36]: One of these had to be ruled out , because he was so fast that he turned the thing into a one-mule contest , and robbed it of one of its best features -- variety .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 23]: But every now and then somebody disguises him with a new name and a new complexion , and rings him in again .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 16]: The riders dress in full jockey costumes of bright-colored silks , satins , and velvets .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 23]: The thirteen mules got away in a body , after a couple of false starts , and scampered off with prodigious spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 82]: As each mule and each rider had a distinct opinion of his own as to how the race ought to be run , and which side of the track was best in certain circumstances , and how often the track ought to be crossed , and when a collision ought to be accomplished , and when it ought to be avoided , these twenty-six conflicting opinions created a most fantastic and picturesque confusion , and the resulting spectacle was killingly comical .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 6]: Mile heat ; time 2:22 .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 7]: Eight of the thirteen mules distanced .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 18]: I had a bet on a mule which would have won if the procession had been reversed .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 34]: The second heat was good fun ; and so was the ` consolation race for beaten mules , ' which followed later ; but the first heat was the best in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 29]: I think that much the most enjoyable of all races is a steamboat race ; but , next to that , I prefer the gay and joyous mule-rush .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 75]: Two red-hot steamboats raging along , neck-and-neck , straining every nerve -- that is to say , every rivet in the boilers -- quaking and shaking and groaning from stem to stern , spouting white steam from the pipes , pouring black smoke from the chimneys , raining down sparks , parting the river into long breaks of hissing foam -- this is sport that makes a body 's very liver curl with enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 10]: A horse-race is pretty tame and colorless in comparison .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 25]: Still , a horse-race might be well enough , in its way , perhaps , if it were not for the tiresome false starts .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 8]: But then , nobody is ever killed .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 14]: At least , nobody was ever killed when I was at a horse-race .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 17]: They have been crippled , it is true ; but this is little to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 27]: Chapter 46 Enchantments and Enchanters THE largest annual event in New Orleans is a something which we arrived too late to sample -- the Mardi-Gras festivities .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 111]: I saw the procession of the Mystic Crew of Comus there , twenty-four years ago -- with knights and nobles and so on , clothed in silken and golden Paris-made gorgeousnesses , planned and bought for that single night 's use ; and in their train all manner of giants , dwarfs , monstrosities , and other diverting grotesquerie -- a startling and wonderful sort of show , as it filed solemnly and silently down the street in the light of its smoking and flickering torches ; but it is said that in these latter days the spectacle is mightily augmented , as to cost , splendor , and variety .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 33]: There is a chief personage -- ` Rex ; ' and if I remember rightly , neither this king nor any of his great following of subordinates is known to any outsider .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 46]: All these people are gentlemen of position and consequence ; and it is a proud thing to belong to the organization ; so the mystery in which they hide their personality is merely for romance 's sake , and not on account of the police .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 30]: Mardi-Gras is of course a relic of the French and Spanish occupation ; but I judge that the religious feature has been pretty well knocked out of it now .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 20]: Sir Walter has got the advantage of the gentlemen of the cowl and rosary , and he will stay .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 70]: His medieval business , supplemented by the monsters and the oddities , and the pleasant creatures from fairy-land , is finer to look at than the poor fantastic inventions and performances of the reveling rabble of the priest 's day , and serves quite as well , perhaps , to emphasize the day and admonish men that the grace-line between the worldly season and the holy one is reached .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 13]: This Mardi-Gras pageant was the exclusive possession of New Orleans until recently .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 13]: But now it has spread to Memphis and St. Louis and Baltimore .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 7]: It has probably reached its limit .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 33]: It is a thing which could hardly exist in the practical North ; would certainly last but a very brief time ; as brief a time as it would last in London .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 16]: For the soul of it is the romantic , not the funny and the grotesque .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 25]: Take away the romantic mysteries , the kings and knights and big-sounding titles , and Mardi-Gras would die , down there in the South .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 24]: The very feature that keeps it alive in the South -- girly-girly romance -- would kill it in the North or in London .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 30]: Puck and Punch , and the press universal , would fall upon it and make merciless fun of it , and its first exhibition would be also its last .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 101]: Against the crimes of the French Revolution and of Bonaparte may be set two compensating benefactions : the Revolution broke the chains of the ANCIEN REGIME and of the Church , and made of a nation of abject slaves a nation of freemen ; and Bonaparte instituted the setting of merit above birth , and also so completely stripped the divinity from royalty , that whereas crowned heads in Europe were gods before , they are only men , since , and can never be gods again , but only figureheads , and answerable for their acts like common clay .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 37]: Such benefactions as these compensate the temporary harm which Bonaparte and the Revolution did , and leave the world in debt to them for these great and permanent services to liberty , humanity , and progress .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 75]: Then comes Sir Walter Scott with his enchantments , and by his single might checks this wave of progress , and even turns it back ; sets the world in love with dreams and phantoms ; with decayed and swinish forms of religion ; with decayed and degraded systems of government ; with the sillinesses and emptinesses , sham grandeurs , sham gauds , and sham chivalries of a brainless and worthless long-vanished society .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 21]: He did measureless harm ; more real and lasting harm , perhaps , than any other individual that ever wrote .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 31]: Most of the world has now outlived good part of these harms , though by no means all of them ; but in our South they flourish pretty forcefully still .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 15]: Not so forcefully as half a generation ago , perhaps , but still forcefully .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 70]: There , the genuine and wholesome civilization of the nineteenth century is curiously confused and commingled with the Walter Scott Middle-Age sham civilization ; and so you have practical , common-sense , progressive ideas , and progressive works ; mixed up with the duel , the inflated speech , and the jejune romanticism of an absurd past that is dead , and out of charity ought to be buried .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 54]: But for the Sir Walter disease , the character of the Southerner -- or Southron , according to Sir Walter 's starchier way of phrasing it -- would be wholly modern , in place of modern and medieval mixed , and the South would be fully a generation further advanced than it is .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 44]: It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in the South a Major or a Colonel , or a General or a Judge , before the war ; and it was he , also , that made these gentlemen value these bogus decorations .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 27]: For it was he that created rank and caste down there , and also reverence for rank and caste , and pride and pleasure in them .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 18]: Enough is laid on slavery , without fathering upon it these creations and contributions of Sir Walter .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 30]: Sir Walter had so large a hand in making Southern character , as it existed before the war , that he is in great measure responsible for the war .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 44]: It seems a little harsh toward a dead man to say that we never should have had any war but for Sir Walter ; and yet something of a plausible argument might , perhaps , be made in support of that wild proposition .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 31]: The Southerner of the American Revolution owned slaves ; so did the Southerner of the Civil War : but the former resembles the latter as an Englishman resembles a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 25]: The change of character can be traced rather more easily to Sir Walter 's influence than to that of any other thing or person .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 22]: One may observe , by one or two signs , how deeply that influence penetrated , and how strongly it holds .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 60]: If one take up a Northern or Southern literary periodical of forty or fifty years ago , he will find it filled with wordy , windy , flowery ` eloquence , ' romanticism , sentimentality -- all imitated from Sir Walter , and sufficiently badly done , too -- innocent travesties of his style and methods , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 48]: This sort of literature being the fashion in both sections of the country , there was opportunity for the fairest competition ; and as a consequence , the South was able to show as many well-known literary names , proportioned to population , as the North could .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 21]: But a change has come , and there is no opportunity now for a fair competition between North and South .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 36]: For the North has thrown out that old inflated style , whereas the Southern writer still clings to it -- clings to it and has a restricted market for his wares , as a consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 53]: There is as much literary talent in the South , now , as ever there was , of course ; but its work can gain but slight currency under present conditions ; the authors write for the past , not the present ; they use obsolete forms , and a dead language .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 71]: But when a Southerner of genius writes modern English , his book goes upon crutches no longer , but upon wings ; and they carry it swiftly all about America and England , and through the great English reprint publishing houses of Germany -- as witness the experience of Mr. Cable and Uncle Remus , two of the very few Southern authors who do not write in the Southern style .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 31]: Instead of three or four widely-known literary names , the South ought to have a dozen or two -- and will have them when Sir Walter 's time is out .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 33]: A curious exemplification of the power of a single book for good or harm is shown in the effects wrought by ` Don Quixote ' and those wrought by ` Ivanhoe . '
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 21]: The first swept the world 's admiration for the medieval chivalry-silliness out of existence ; and the other restored it .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 31]: As far as our South is concerned , the good work done by Cervantes is pretty nearly a dead letter , so effectually has Scott 's pernicious work undermined it .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 36]: Chapter 47 Uncle Remus and Mr. Cable MR. JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS -LRB- ` Uncle Remus ' -RRB- was to arrive from Atlanta at seven o'clock Sunday morning ; so we got up and received him .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 32]: We were able to detect him among the crowd of arrivals at the hotel-counter by his correspondence with a description of him which had been furnished us from a trustworthy source .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 13]: He was said to be undersized , red-haired , and somewhat freckled .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 17]: He was the only man in the party whose outside tallied with this bill of particulars .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 8]: He was said to be very shy .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 6]: He is a shy man .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 7]: Of this there is no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 14]: It may not show on the surface , but the shyness is there .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 20]: After days of intimacy one wonders to see that it is still in about as strong force as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 37]: There is a fine and beautiful nature hidden behind it , as all know who have read the Uncle Remus book ; and a fine genius , too , as all know by the same sign .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 34]: I seem to be talking quite freely about this neighbor ; but in talking to the public I am but talking to his personal friends , and these things are permissible among friends .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 32]: He deeply disappointed a number of children who had flocked eagerly to Mr. Cable 's house to get a glimpse of the illustrious sage and oracle of the nation 's nurseries .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 11]: They said -- ` Why , he 's white ! '
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 6]: They were grieved about it .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 41]: So , to console them , the book was brought , that they might hear Uncle Remus 's Tar-Baby story from the lips of Uncle Remus himself -- or what , in their outraged eyes , was left of him .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 23]: But it turned out that he had never read aloud to people , and was too shy to venture the attempt now .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 42]: Mr. Cable and I read from books of ours , to show him what an easy trick it was ; but his immortal shyness was proof against even this sagacious strategy , so we had to read about Brer Rabbit ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 33]: Mr. Harris ought to be able to read the negro dialect better than anybody else , for in the matter of writing it he is the only master the country has produced .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 25]: Mr. Cable is the only master in the writing of French dialects that the country has produced ; and he reads them in perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 48]: It was a great treat to hear him read about Jean-ah Poquelin , and about Innerarity and his famous ` pigshoo ' representing ` Louisihanna RIF-fusing to Hanter the Union , ' along with passages of nicely-shaded German dialect from a novel which was still in manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 42]: It came out in conversation , that in two different instances Mr. Cable got into grotesque trouble by using , in his books , next-to-impossible French names which nevertheless happened to be borne by living and sensitive citizens of New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 55]: His names were either inventions or were borrowed from the ancient and obsolete past , I do not now remember which ; but at any rate living bearers of them turned up , and were a good deal hurt at having attention directed to themselves and their affairs in so excessively public a manner .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 23]: Mr. Warner and I had an experience of the same sort when we wrote the book called ` The Gilded Age . '
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: There is a character in it called ` Sellers . '
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 29]: I do not remember what his first name was , in the beginning ; but anyway , Mr. Warner did not like it , and wanted it improved .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 17]: He asked me if I was able to imagine a person named ` Eschol Sellers . '
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 11]: Of course I said I could not , without stimulants .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 33]: He said that away out West , once , he had met , and contemplated , and actually shaken hands with a man bearing that impossible name -- ` Eschol Sellers . '
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 34]: He added -- ` It was twenty years ago ; his name has probably carried him off before this ; and if it has n't , he will never see the book anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 6]: We will confiscate his name .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 44]: The name you are using is common , and therefore dangerous ; there are probably a thousand Sellerses bearing it , and the whole horde will come after us ; but Eschol Sellers is a safe name -- it is a rock . '
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 76]: So we borrowed that name ; and when the book had been out about a week , one of the stateliest and handsomest and most aristocratic looking white men that ever lived , called around , with the most formidable libel suit in his pocket that ever -- well , in brief , we got his permission to suppress an edition of ten million -LCB- footnote -LSB- Figures taken from memory , and probably incorrect .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 7]: Think it was more . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 17]: copies of the book and change that name to ` Mulberry Sellers ' in future editions .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 65]: Chapter 48 Sugar and Postage ONE day , on the street , I encountered the man whom , of all men , I most wished to see -- Horace Bixby ; formerly pilot under me -- or rather , over me -- now captain of the great steamer ` City of Baton Rouge , ' the latest and swiftest addition to the Anchor Line .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 59]: The same slender figure , the same tight curls , the same springy step , the same alertness , the same decision of eye and answering decision of hand , the same erect military bearing ; not an inch gained or lost in girth , not an ounce gained or lost in weight , not a hair turned .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 30]: It is a curious thing , to leave a man thirty-five years old , and come back at the end of twenty-one years and find him still only thirty-five .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 14]: I have not had an experience of this kind before , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 21]: There were some crow 's - feet , but they counted for next to nothing , since they were inconspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 6]: His boat was just in .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 18]: I had been waiting several days for her , purposing to return to St. Louis in her .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 37]: The captain and I joined a party of ladies and gentlemen , guests of Major Wood , and went down the river fifty-four miles , in a swift tug , to ex-Governor Warmouth 's sugar plantation .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 28]: Strung along below the city , were a number of decayed , ram-shackly , superannuated old steamboats , not one of which had I ever seen before .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 20]: They had all been built , and worn out , and thrown aside , since I was here last .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 20]: This gives one a realizing sense of the frailness of a Mississippi boat and the briefness of its life .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 49]: Six miles below town a fat and battered brick chimney , sticking above the magnolias and live-oaks , was pointed out as the monument erected by an appreciative nation to celebrate the battle of New Orleans -- Jackson 's victory over the British , January 8 , 1815 .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 22]: The war had ended , the two nations were at peace , but the news had not yet reached New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 39]: If we had had the cable telegraph in those days , this blood would not have been spilt , those lives would not have been wasted ; and better still , Jackson would probably never have been president .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 27]: We have gotten over the harms done us by the war of 1812 , but not over some of those done us by Jackson 's presidency .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 25]: The Warmouth plantation covers a vast deal of ground , and the hospitality of the Warmouth mansion is graduated to the same large scale .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 13]: We saw steam-plows at work , here , for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 49]: The traction engine travels about on its own wheels , till it reaches the required spot ; then it stands still and by means of a wire rope pulls the huge plow toward itself two or three hundred yards across the field , between the rows of cane .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 15]: The thing cuts down into the black mold a foot and a half deep .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 15]: The plow looks like a fore-and-aft brace of a Hudson river steamer , inverted .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 28]: When the negro steersman sits on one end of it , that end tilts down near the ground , while the other sticks up high in air .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 26]: This great see-saw goes rolling and pitching like a ship at sea , and it is not every circus rider that could stay on it .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 29]: The plantation contains two thousand six hundred acres ; six hundred and fifty are in cane ; and there is a fruitful orange grove of five thousand trees .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 31]: The cane is cultivated after a modern and intricate scientific fashion , too elaborate and complex for me to attempt to describe ; but it lost $ 40,000 last year .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 6]: I forget the other details .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 25]: However , this year 's crop will reach ten or twelve hundred tons of sugar , consequently last year 's loss will not matter .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 43]: These troublesome and expensive scientific methods achieve a yield of a ton and a half and from that to two tons , to the acre ; which is three or four times what the yield of an acre was in my time .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 13]: The drainage-ditches were everywhere alive with little crabs -- ` fiddlers . '
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 15]: One saw them scampering sidewise in every direction whenever they heard a disturbing noise .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 17]: Expensive pests , these crabs ; for they bore into the levees , and ruin them .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 22]: The great sugar-house was a wilderness of tubs and tanks and vats and filters , pumps , pipes , and machinery .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 9]: The process of making sugar is exceedingly interesting .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 65]: First , you heave your cane into the centrifugals and grind out the juice ; then run it through the evaporating pan to extract the fiber ; then through the bone-filter to remove the alcohol ; then through the clarifying tanks to discharge the molasses ; then through the granulating pipe to condense it ; then through the vacuum pan to extract the vacuum .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 7]: It is now ready for market .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 9]: I have jotted these particulars down from memory .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 7]: The thing looks simple and easy .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 5]: Do not deceive yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 15]: To make sugar is really one of the most difficult things in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 11]: And to make it right , is next to impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 40]: If you will examine your own supply every now and then for a term of years , and tabulate the result , you will find that not two men in twenty can make sugar without getting sand into it .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 63]: We could have gone down to the mouth of the river and visited Captain Eads ' great work , the ` jetties , ' where the river has been compressed between walls , and thus deepened to twenty-six feet ; but it was voted useless to go , since at this stage of the water everything would be covered up and invisible .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 66]: We could have visited that ancient and singular burg , ` Pilot-town , ' which stands on stilts in the water -- so they say ; where nearly all communication is by skiff and canoe , even to the attending of weddings and funerals ; and where the littlest boys and girls are as handy with the oar as unamphibious children are with the velocipede .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 22]: We could have done a number of other things ; but on account of limited time , we went back home .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 49]: The sail up the breezy and sparkling river was a charming experience , and would have been satisfyingly sentimental and romantic but for the interruptions of the tug 's pet parrot , whose tireless comments upon the scenery and the guests were always this-worldly , and often profane .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 34]: He had also a superabundance of the discordant , ear-splitting , metallic laugh common to his breed -- a machine-made laugh , a Frankenstein laugh , with the soul left out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 14]: He applied it to every sentimental remark , and to every pathetic song .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 37]: He cackled it out with hideous energy after ` Home again , home again from a foreign shore , ' and said he ` would n't give a damn for a tug-load of such rot . '
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 33]: Romance and sentiment can not long survive this sort of discouragement ; so the singing and talking presently ceased ; which so delighted the parrot that he cursed himself hoarse for joy .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 17]: Then the male members of the party moved to the forecastle , to smoke and gossip .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 30]: There were several old steamboatmen along , and I learned from them a great deal of what had been happening to my former river friends during my long absence .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 71]: I learned that a pilot whom I used to steer for is become a spiritualist , and for more than fifteen years has been receiving a letter every week from a deceased relative , through a New York spiritualist medium named Manchester -- postage graduated by distance : from the local post-office in Paradise to New York , five dollars ; from New York to St. Louis , three cents .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 7]: I remember Mr. Manchester very well .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 27]: I called on him once , ten years ago , with a couple of friends , one of whom wished to inquire after a deceased uncle .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 47]: This uncle had lost his life in a peculiarly violent and unusual way , half a dozen years before : a cyclone blew him some three miles and knocked a tree down with him which was four feet through at the butt and sixty-five feet high .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 7]: He did not survive this triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 38]: At the seance just referred to , my friend questioned his late uncle , through Mr. Manchester , and the late uncle wrote down his replies , using Mr. Manchester 's hand and pencil for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 36]: The following is a fair example of the questions asked , and also of the sloppy twaddle in the way of answers , furnished by Manchester under the pretense that it came from the specter .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 19]: If this man is not the paltriest fraud that lives , I owe him an apology -- QUESTION .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 4]: Where are you ?
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 2]: ANSWER .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 5]: In the spirit world .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 5]: Q. Are you happy ?
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 4]: A. Very happy .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 3]: Perfectly happy .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 7]: Q. How do you amuse yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 9]: A. Conversation with friends , and other spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 3]: What else ?
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 4]: A. Nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 5]: Nothing else is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 6]: What do you talk about ?
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 24]: About how happy we are ; and about friends left behind in the earth , and how to influence them for their good .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 22]: When your friends in the earth all get to the spirit land , what shall you have to talk about then ?
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 10]: -- nothing but about how happy you all are ?
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 3]: No reply .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 11]: It is explained that spirits will not answer frivolous questions .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 33]: Q. How is it that spirits that are content to spend an eternity in frivolous employments , and accept it as happiness , are so fastidious about frivolous questions upon the subject ?
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 3]: No reply .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 8]: Q. Would you like to come back ?
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 3]: A. No .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 8]: Q. Would you say that under oath ?
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 3]: A. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 6]: What do you eat there ?
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 5]: We do not eat .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 5]: What do you drink ?
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 5]: We do not drink .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 5]: What do you smoke ?
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 5]: We do not smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 5]: What do you read ?
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 5]: We do not read .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 11]: Q. Do all the good people go to your place ?
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 3]: A. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 8]: You know my present way of life .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 25]: Can you suggest any additions to it , in the way of crime , that will reasonably insure my going to some other place .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 4]: A. No reply .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 5]: When did you die ?
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 10]: A. I did not die , I passed away .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 12]: Q. Very well , then , when did you pass away ?
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 10]: How long have you been in the spirit land ?
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 8]: We have no measurements of time here .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 30]: Q. Though you may be indifferent and uncertain as to dates and times in your present condition and environment , this has nothing to do with your former condition .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 5]: You had dates then .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 9]: One of these is what I ask for .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 11]: You departed on a certain day in a certain year .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 5]: Is not this true ?
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 3]: A. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 8]: Then name the day of the month .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 29]: -LRB- Much fumbling with pencil , on the part of the medium , accompanied by violent spasmodic jerkings of his head and body , for some little time .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 21]: Finally , explanation to the effect that spirits often forget dates , such things being without importance to them . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 16]: Then this one has actually forgotten the date of its translation to the spirit land ?
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 8]: This was granted to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 5]: This is very curious .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 9]: Well , then , what year was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 16]: -LRB- More fumbling , jerking , idiotic spasms , on the part of the medium .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 15]: Finally , explanation to the effect that the spirit has forgotten the year . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 2]: Q .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 5]: This is indeed stupendous .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 74]: Let me put one more question , one last question , to you , before we part to meet no more ; -- for even if I fail to avoid your asylum , a meeting there will go for nothing as a meeting , since by that time you will easily have forgotten me and my name : did you die a natural death , or were you cut off by a catastrophe ?
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 12]: A. -LRB- After long hesitation and many throes and spasms . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 3]: NATURAL DEATH .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 5]: This ended the interview .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 70]: My friend told the medium that when his relative was in this poor world , he was endowed with an extraordinary intellect and an absolutely defectless memory , and it seemed a great pity that he had not been allowed to keep some shred of these for his amusement in the realms of everlasting contentment , and for the amazement and admiration of the rest of the population there .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 11]: This man had plenty of clients -- has plenty yet .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 27]: He receives letters from spirits located in every part of the spirit world , and delivers them all over this country through the United States mail .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 32]: These letters are filled with advice -- advice from ` spirits ' who do n't know as much as a tadpole -- and this advice is religiously followed by the receivers .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 31]: One of these clients was a man whom the spirits -LRB- if one may thus plurally describe the ingenious Manchester -RRB- were teaching how to contrive an improved railway car-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 27]: It is coarse employment for a spirit , but it is higher and wholesomer activity than talking for ever about ` how happy we are . '
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 40]: Chapter 49 Episodes in Pilot Life IN the course of the tug-boat gossip , it came out that out of every five of my former friends who had quitted the river , four had chosen farming as an occupation .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 39]: Of course this was not because they were peculiarly gifted , agriculturally , and thus more likely to succeed as farmers than in other industries : the reason for their choice must be traced to some other source .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 22]: Doubtless they chose farming because that life is private and secluded from irruptions of undesirable strangers -- like the pilot-house hermitage .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 80]: And doubtless they also chose it because on a thousand nights of black storm and danger they had noted the twinkling lights of solitary farm-houses , as the boat swung by , and pictured to themselves the serenity and security and coziness of such refuges at such times , and so had by-and-bye come to dream of that retired and peaceful life as the one desirable thing to long for , anticipate , earn , and at last enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 17]: But I did not learn that any of these pilot-farmers had astonished anybody with their successes .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 12]: Their farms do not support them : they support their farms .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 23]: The pilot-farmer disappears from the river annually , about the breaking of spring , and is seen no more till next frost .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 26]: Then he appears again , in damaged homespun , combs the hayseed out of his hair , and takes a pilot-house berth for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 17]: In this way he pays the debts which his farming has achieved during the agricultural season .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 23]: So his river bondage is but half broken ; he is still the river 's slave the hardest half of the year .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 15]: One of these men bought a farm , but did not retire to it .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 9]: He knew a trick worth two of that .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 17]: He did not propose to pauperize his farm by applying his personal ignorance to working it .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 37]: No , he put the farm into the hands of an agricultural expert to be worked on shares -- out of every three loads of corn the expert to have two and the pilot the third .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 13]: But at the end of the season the pilot received no corn .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 10]: The expert explained that his share was not reached .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 7]: The farm produced only two loads .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 24]: Some of the pilots whom I had known had had adventures -- the outcome fortunate , sometimes , but not in all cases .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 52]: Captain Montgomery , whom I had steered for when he was a pilot , commanded the Confederate fleet in the great battle before Memphis ; when his vessel went down , he swam ashore , fought his way through a squad of soldiers , and made a gallant and narrow escape .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 13]: He was always a cool man ; nothing could disturb his serenity .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 36]: Once when he was captain of the ` Crescent City , ' I was bringing the boat into port at New Orleans , and momently expecting orders from the hurricane deck , but received none .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 14]: I had stopped the wheels , and there my authority and responsibility ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 38]: It was evening -- dim twilight -- the captain 's hat was perched upon the big bell , and I supposed the intellectual end of the captain was in it , but such was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 18]: The captain was very strict ; therefore I knew better than to touch a bell without orders .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 27]: My duty was to hold the boat steadily on her calamitous course , and leave the consequences to take care of themselves -- which I did .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 50]: So we went plowing past the sterns of steamboats and getting closer and closer -- the crash was bound to come very soon -- and still that hat never budged ; for alas , the captain was napping in the texas ... Things were becoming exceedingly nervous and uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 19]: It seemed to me that the captain was not going to appear in time to see the entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 4]: But he did .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 65]: Just as we were walking into the stern of a steamboat , he stepped out on deck , and said , with heavenly serenity , ` Set her back on both ' -- which I did ; but a trifle late , however , for the next moment we went smashing through that other boat 's flimsy outer works with a most prodigious racket .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 41]: The captain never said a word to me about the matter afterwards , except to remark that I had done right , and that he hoped I would not hesitate to act in the same way again in like circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 21]: One of the pilots whom I had known when I was on the river had died a very honorable death .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 19]: His boat caught fire , and he remained at the wheel until he got her safe to land .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 22]: Then he went out over the breast-board with his clothing in flames , and was the last person to get ashore .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 22]: He died from his injuries in the course of two or three hours , and his was the only life lost .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 69]: The history of Mississippi piloting affords six or seven instances of this sort of martyrdom , and half a hundred instances of escapes from a like fate which came within a second or two of being fatally too late ; BUT THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF A PILOT DESERTING HIS POST TO SAVE HIS LIFE WHILE BY REMAINING AND SACRIFICING IT HE MIGHT SECURE OTHER LIVES FROM DESTRUCTION .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 24]: It is well worth while to set down this noble fact , and well worth while to put it in italics , too .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 46]: The ` cub ' pilot is early admonished to despise all perils connected with a pilot 's calling , and to prefer any sort of death to the deep dishonor of deserting his post while there is any possibility of his being useful in it .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 32]: And so effectively are these admonitions inculcated , that even young and but half-tried pilots can be depended upon to stick to the wheel , and die there when occasion requires .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 32]: In a Memphis graveyard is buried a young fellow who perished at the wheel a great many years ago , in White River , to save the lives of other men .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 49]: He said to the captain that if the fire would give him time to reach a sand bar , some distance away , all could be saved , but that to land against the bluff bank of the river would be to insure the loss of many lives .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 33]: He reached the bar and grounded the boat in shallow water ; but by that time the flames had closed around him , and in escaping through them he was fatally burned .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 24]: He had been urged to fly sooner , but had replied as became a pilot to reply -- ' I will not go .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 21]: If I go , nobody will be saved ; if I stay , no one will be lost but me .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 5]: I will stay . '
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 18]: There were two hundred persons on board , and no life was lost but the pilot 's .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 16]: There used to be a monument to this young fellow , in that Memphis graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 37]: While we tarried in Memphis on our down trip , I started out to look for it , but our time was so brief that I was obliged to turn back before my object was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 132]: The tug-boat gossip informed me that Dick Kennet was dead -- blown up , near Memphis , and killed ; that several others whom I had known had fallen in the war -- one or two of them shot down at the wheel ; that another and very particular friend , whom I had steered many trips for , had stepped out of his house in New Orleans , one night years ago , to collect some money in a remote part of the city , and had never been seen again -- was murdered and thrown into the river , it was thought ; that Ben Thornburgh was dead long ago ; also his wild ` cub ' whom I used to quarrel with , all through every daylight watch .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 18]: A heedless , reckless creature he was , and always in hot water , always in mischief .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 23]: An Arkansas passenger brought an enormous bear aboard , one day , and chained him to a life-boat on the hurricane deck .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 27]: Thornburgh 's ` cub ' could not rest till he had gone there and unchained the bear , to ` see what he would do . '
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 5]: He was promptly gratified .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 44]: The bear chased him around and around the deck , for miles and miles , with two hundred eager faces grinning through the railings for audience , and finally snatched off the lad 's coat-tail and went into the texas to chew it .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 15]: The off-watch turned out with alacrity , and left the bear in sole possession .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 11]: He presently grew lonesome , and started out for recreation .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 61]: He ranged the whole boat -- visited every part of it , with an advance guard of fleeing people in front of him and a voiceless vacancy behind him ; and when his owner captured him at last , those two were the only visible beings anywhere ; everybody else was in hiding , and the boat was a solitude .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 22]: I was told that one of my pilot friends fell dead at the wheel , from heart disease , in 1869 .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 10]: The captain was on the roof at the time .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 29]: He saw the boat breaking for the shore ; shouted , and got no answer ; ran up , and found the pilot lying dead on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 22]: Mr. Bixby had been blown up , in Madrid bend ; was not injured , but the other pilot was lost .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 20]: George Ritchie had been blown up near Memphis -- blown into the river from the wheel , and disabled .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 41]: The water was very cold ; he clung to a cotton bale -- mainly with his teeth -- and floated until nearly exhausted , when he was rescued by some deck hands who were on a piece of the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 27]: They tore open the bale and packed him in the cotton , and warmed the life back into him , and got him safe to Memphis .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 15]: He is one of Bixby 's pilots on the ` Baton Rouge ' now .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 26]: Into the life of a steamboat clerk , now dead , had dropped a bit of romance -- somewhat grotesque romance , but romance nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 36]: When I knew him he was a shiftless young spendthrift , boisterous , goodhearted , full of careless generosities , and pretty conspicuously promising to fool his possibilities away early , and come to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 33]: In a Western city lived a rich and childless old foreigner and his wife ; and in their family was a comely young girl -- sort of friend , sort of servant .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 54]: The young clerk of whom I have been speaking -- whose name was not George Johnson , but who shall be called George Johnson for the purposes of this narrative -- got acquainted with this young girl , and they sinned ; and the old foreigner found them out , and rebuked them .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 19]: Being ashamed , they lied , and said they were married ; that they had been privately married .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 16]: Then the old foreigner 's hurt was healed , and he forgave and blessed them .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 13]: After that , they were able to continue their sin without concealment .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 14]: By-and-bye the foreigner 's wife died ; and presently he followed after her .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 18]: Friends of the family assembled to mourn ; and among the mourners sat the two young sinners .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 8]: The will was opened and solemnly read .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 16]: It bequeathed every penny of that old man 's great wealth to MRS. GEORGE JOHNSON !
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 7]: And there was no such person .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 32]: The young sinners fled forth then , and did a very foolish thing : married themselves before an obscure Justice of the Peace , and got him to antedate the thing .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 7]: That did no sort of good .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 53]: The distant relatives flocked in and exposed the fraudful date with extreme suddenness and surprising ease , and carried off the fortune , leaving the Johnsons very legitimately , and legally , and irrevocably chained together in honorable marriage , but with not so much as a penny to bless themselves withal .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 19]: Such are the actual facts ; and not all novels have for a base so telling a situation .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 21]: Chapter 50 The ` Original Jacobs ' WE had some talk about Captain Isaiah Sellers , now many years dead .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 20]: He was a fine man , a high-minded man , and greatly respected both ashore and on the river .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 65]: He was very tall , well built , and handsome ; and in his old age -- as I remember him -- his hair was as black as an Indian 's , and his eye and hand were as strong and steady and his nerve and judgment as firm and clear as anybody 's , young or old , among the fraternity of pilots .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 45]: He was the patriarch of the craft ; he had been a keelboat pilot before the day of steamboats ; and a steamboat pilot before any other steamboat pilot , still surviving at the time I speak of , had ever turned a wheel .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 25]: Consequently his brethren held him in the sort of awe in which illustrious survivors of a bygone age are always held by their associates .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 31]: He knew how he was regarded , and perhaps this fact added some trifle of stiffening to his natural dignity , which had been sufficiently stiff in its original state .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 39]: He left a diary behind him ; but apparently it did not date back to his first steamboat trip , which was said to be 1811 , the year the first steamboat disturbed the waters of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 71]: At the time of his death a correspondent of the ` St. Louis Republican ' culled the following items from the diary -- ` In February , 1825 , he shipped on board the steamer `` Rambler , '' at Florence , Ala. , and made during that year three trips to New Orleans and back -- this on the `` Gen. Carrol , '' between Nashville and New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 47]: It was during his stay on this boat that Captain Sellers introduced the tap of the bell as a signal to heave the lead , previous to which time it was the custom for the pilot to speak to the men below when soundings were wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 31]: The proximity of the forecastle to the pilot-house , no doubt , rendered this an easy matter ; but how different on one of our palaces of the present day .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 31]: ` In 1827 we find him on board the `` President , '' a boat of two hundred and eighty-five tons burden , and plying between Smithland and New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 35]: Thence he joined the `` Jubilee '' in 1828 , and on this boat he did his first piloting in the St. Louis trade ; his first watch extending from Herculaneum to St. Genevieve .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 41]: On May 26 , 1836 , he completed and left Pittsburgh in charge of the steamer `` Prairie , '' a boat of four hundred tons , and the first steamer with a STATE-ROOM CABIN ever seen at St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 38]: In 1857 he introduced the signal for meeting boats , and which has , with some slight change , been the universal custom of this day ; in fact , is rendered obligatory by act of Congress .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 41]: ` As general items of river history , we quote the following marginal notes from his general log -- ` In March , 1825 , Gen. Lafayette left New Orleans for St. Louis on the low-pressure steamer `` Natchez . ''
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 26]: ` In January , 1828 , twenty-one steamers left the New Orleans wharf to celebrate the occasion of Gen. Jackson 's visit to that city .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 28]: ` In 1830 the `` North American '' made the run from New Orleans to Memphis in six days -- best time on record to that date .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 12]: It has since been made in two days and ten hours .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 9]: ` In 1831 the Red River cut-off formed .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 26]: ` In 1832 steamer `` Hudson '' made the run from White River to Helena , a distance of seventy-five miles , in twelve hours .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 14]: This was the source of much talk and speculation among parties directly interested .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 8]: ` In 1839 Great Horseshoe cut-off formed .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 59]: ` Up to the present time , a term of thirty-five years , we ascertain , by reference to the diary , he has made four hundred and sixty round trips to New Orleans , which gives a distance of one million one hundred and four thousand miles , or an average of eighty-six miles a day . '
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 19]: Whenever Captain Sellers approached a body of gossiping pilots , a chill fell there , and talking ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 114]: For this reason : whenever six pilots were gathered together , there would always be one or two newly fledged ones in the lot , and the elder ones would be always ` showing off ' before these poor fellows ; making them sorrowfully feel how callow they were , how recent their nobility , and how humble their degree , by talking largely and vaporously of old-time experiences on the river ; always making it a point to date everything back as far as they could , so as to make the new men feel their newness to the sharpest degree possible , and envy the old stagers in the like degree .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 41]: And how these complacent baldheads WOULD swell , and brag , and lie , and date back -- ten , fifteen , twenty years , -- and how they did enjoy the effect produced upon the marveling and envying youngsters !
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 35]: And perhaps just at this happy stage of the proceedings , the stately figure of Captain Isaiah Sellers , that real and only genuine Son of Antiquity , would drift solemnly into the midst .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 13]: Imagine the size of the silence that would result on the instant .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 63]: And imagine the feelings of those bald-heads , and the exultation of their recent audience when the ancient captain would begin to drop casual and indifferent remarks of a reminiscent nature -- about islands that had disappeared , and cutoffs that had been made , a generation before the oldest bald-head in the company had ever set his foot in a pilot-house !
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 26]: Many and many a time did this ancient mariner appear on the scene in the above fashion , and spread disaster and humiliation around him .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 58]: If one might believe the pilots , he always dated his islands back to the misty dawn of river history ; and he never used the same island twice ; and never did he employ an island that still existed , or give one a name which anybody present was old enough to have heard of before .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 97]: If you might believe the pilots , he was always conscientiously particular about little details ; never spoke of ` the State of Mississippi , ' for instance -- no , he would say , ` When the State of Mississippi was where Arkansas now is , ' and would never speak of Louisiana or Missouri in a general way , and leave an incorrect impression on your mind -- no , he would say , ` When Louisiana was up the river farther , ' or ` When Missouri was on the Illinois side . '
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 46]: The old gentleman was not of literary turn or capacity , but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river , and sign them ` MARK TWAIN , ' and give them to the ` New Orleans Picayune . '
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 26]: They related to the stage and condition of the river , and were accurate and valuable ; and thus far , they contained no poison .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 84]: But in speaking of the stage of the river to-day , at a given point , the captain was pretty apt to drop in a little remark about this being the first time he had seen the water so high or so low at that particular point for forty-nine years ; and now and then he would mention Island So-and-so , and follow it , in parentheses , with some such observation as ` disappeared in 1807 , if I remember rightly . '
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 29]: In these antique interjections lay poison and bitterness for the other old pilots , and they used to chaff the ` Mark Twain ' paragraphs with unsparing mockery .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 34]: It so chanced that one of these paragraphs -- -LCB- footnote -LSB- The original MS. of it , in the captain 's own hand , has been sent to me from New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 11]: It reads as follows -- VICKSBURG May 4 , 1859 .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 27]: ` My opinion for the benefit of the citizens of New Orleans : The water is higher this far up than it has been since 8 .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 20]: My opinion is that the water will be feet deep in Canal street before the first of next June .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 24]: Mrs. Turner 's plantation at the head of Big Black Island is all under water , and it has not been since 1815 .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 7]: ` I. Sellers . ' -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 9]: became the text for my first newspaper article .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 23]: I burlesqued it broadly , very broadly , stringing my fantastics out to the extent of eight hundred or a thousand words .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 10]: I was a ` cub ' at the time .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 24]: I showed my performance to some pilots , and they eagerly rushed it into print in the ` New Orleans True Delta . '
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 27]: It was a great pity ; for it did nobody any worthy service , and it sent a pang deep into a good man 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 15]: There was no malice in my rubbish ; but it laughed at the captain .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 17]: It laughed at a man to whom such a thing was new and strange and dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 35]: I did not know then , though I do now , that there is no suffering comparable with that which a private person feels when he is for the first time pilloried in print .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 15]: Captain Sellers did me the honor to profoundly detest me from that day forth .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 16]: When I say he did me the honor , I am not using empty words .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 34]: It was a very real honor to be in the thoughts of so great a man as Captain Sellers , and I had wit enough to appreciate it and be proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 44]: It was distinction to be loved by such a man ; but it was a much greater distinction to be hated by him , because he loved scores of people ; but he did n't sit up nights to hate anybody but me .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 21]: He never printed another paragraph while he lived , and he never again signed ` Mark Twain ' to anything .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 20]: At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death , I was on the Pacific coast .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 78]: I was a fresh new journalist , and needed a nom de guerre ; so I confiscated the ancient mariner 's discarded one , and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands -- a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth ; how I have succeeded , it would not be modest in me to say .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 16]: The captain had an honorable pride in his profession and an abiding love for it .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 18]: He ordered his monument before he died , and kept it near him until he did die .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 14]: It stands over his grave now , in Bellefontaine cemetery , St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 48]: It is his image , in marble , standing on duty at the pilot wheel ; and worthy to stand and confront criticism , for it represents a man who in life would have stayed there till he burned to a cinder , if duty required it .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 22]: The finest thing we saw on our whole Mississippi trip , we saw as we approached New Orleans in the steam-tug .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 22]: This was the curving frontage of the crescent city lit up with the white glare of five miles of electric lights .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 10]: It was a wonderful sight , and very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 35]: Chapter 51 Reminiscences WE left for St. Louis in the ` City of Baton Rouge , ' on a delightfully hot day , but with the main purpose of my visit but lamely accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 43]: I had hoped to hunt up and talk with a hundred steamboatmen , but got so pleasantly involved in the social life of the town that I got nothing more than mere five-minute talks with a couple of dozen of the craft .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 51]: I was on the bench of the pilot-house when we backed out and ` straightened up ' for the start -- the boat pausing for a ` good ready , ' in the old-fashioned way , and the black smoke piling out of the chimneys equally in the old-fashioned way .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 17]: Then we began to gather momentum , and presently were fairly under way and booming along .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 27]: It was all as natural and familiar -- and so were the shoreward sights -- as if there had been no break in my river life .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 22]: There was a ` cub , ' and I judged that he would take the wheel now ; and he did .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 7]: Captain Bixby stepped into the pilot-house .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 11]: Presently the cub closed up on the rank of steamships .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 20]: He made me nervous , for he allowed too much water to show between our boat and the ships .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 24]: I knew quite well what was going to happen , because I could date back in my own life and inspect the record .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 34]: The captain looked on , during a silent half-minute , then took the wheel himself , and crowded the boat in , till she went scraping along within a hand-breadth of the ships .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 38]: It was exactly the favor which he had done me , about a quarter of a century before , in that same spot , the first time I ever steamed out of the port of New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 22]: It was a very great and sincere pleasure to me to see the thing repeated -- with somebody else as victim .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 29]: We made Natchez -LRB- three hundred miles -RRB- in twenty-two hours and a half -- much the swiftest passage I have ever made over that piece of water .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 40]: The next morning I came on with the four o'clock watch , and saw Ritchie successfully run half a dozen crossings in a fog , using for his guidance the marked chart devised and patented by Bixby and himself .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 10]: This sufficiently evidenced the great value of the chart .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 44]: By and by , when the fog began to clear off , I noticed that the reflection of a tree in the smooth water of an overflowed bank , six hundred yards away , was stronger and blacker than the ghostly tree itself .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 19]: The faint spectral trees , dimly glimpsed through the shredding fog , were very pretty things to see .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 21]: We had a heavy thunder-storm at Natchez , another at Vicksburg , and still another about fifty miles below Memphis .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 13]: They had an old-fashioned energy which had long been unfamiliar to me .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 10]: This third storm was accompanied by a raging wind .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 21]: We tied up to the bank when we saw the tempest coming , and everybody left the pilot-house but me .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 79]: The wind bent the young trees down , exposing the pale underside of the leaves ; and gust after gust followed , in quick succession , thrashing the branches violently up and down , and to this side and that , and creating swift waves of alternating green and white according to the side of the leaf that was exposed , and these waves raced after each other as do their kind over a wind-tossed field of oats .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 24]: No color that was visible anywhere was quite natural -- all tints were charged with a leaden tinge from the solid cloud-bank overhead .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 34]: The river was leaden ; all distances the same ; and even the far-reaching ranks of combing white-caps were dully shaded by the dark , rich atmosphere through which their swarming legions marched .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 68]: The thunder-peals were constant and deafening ; explosion followed explosion with but inconsequential intervals between , and the reports grew steadily sharper and higher-keyed , and more trying to the ear ; the lightning was as diligent as the thunder , and produced effects which enchanted the eye and sent electric ecstasies of mixed delight and apprehension shivering along every nerve in the body in unintermittent procession .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 63]: The rain poured down in amazing volume ; the ear-splitting thunder-peals broke nearer and nearer ; the wind increased in fury and began to wrench off boughs and tree-tops and send them sailing away through space ; the pilot-house fell to rocking and straining and cracking and surging , and I went down in the hold to see what time it was .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 38]: People boast a good deal about Alpine thunderstorms ; but the storms which I have had the luck to see in the Alps were not the equals of some which I have seen in the Mississippi Valley .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 28]: I may not have seen the Alps do their best , of course , and if they can beat the Mississippi , I do n't wish to .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 28]: On this up trip I saw a little towhead -LRB- infant island -RRB- half a mile long , which had been formed during the past nineteen years .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 41]: Since there was so much time to spare that nineteen years of it could be devoted to the construction of a mere towhead , where was the use , originally , in rushing this whole globe through in six days ?
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 36]: It is likely that if more time had been taken , in the first place , the world would have been made right , and this ceaseless improving and repairing would not be necessary now .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 60]: But if you hurry a world or a house , you are nearly sure to find out by and by that you have left out a towhead , or a broom-closet , or some other little convenience , here and there , which has got to be supplied , no matter how much expense and vexation it may cost .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 80]: We had a succession of black nights , going up the river , and it was observable that whenever we landed , and suddenly inundated the trees with the intense sunburst of the electric light , a certain curious effect was always produced : hundreds of birds flocked instantly out from the masses of shining green foliage , and went careering hither and thither through the white rays , and often a song-bird tuned up and fell to singing .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 14]: We judged that they mistook this superb artificial day for the genuine article .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 20]: We had a delightful trip in that thoroughly well-ordered steamer , and regretted that it was accomplished so speedily .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 18]: By means of diligence and activity , we managed to hunt out nearly all the old friends .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 20]: One was missing , however ; he went to his reward , whatever it was , two years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 8]: But I found out all about him .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 18]: His case helped me to realize how lasting can be the effect of a very trifling occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 60]: When he was an apprentice-blacksmith in our village , and I a schoolboy , a couple of young Englishmen came to the town and sojourned a while ; and one day they got themselves up in cheap royal finery and did the Richard III swordfight with maniac energy and prodigious powwow , in the presence of the village boys .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 14]: This blacksmith cub was there , and the histrionic poison entered his bones .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 15]: This vast , lumbering , ignorant , dull-witted lout was stage-struck , and irrecoverably .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 11]: He disappeared , and presently turned up in St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 10]: I ran across him there , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 63]: He was standing musing on a street corner , with his left hand on his hip , the thumb of his right supporting his chin , face bowed and frowning , slouch hat pulled down over his forehead -- imagining himself to be Othello or some such character , and imagining that the passing crowd marked his tragic bearing and were awestruck .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 20]: I joined him , and tried to get him down out of the clouds , but did not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 44]: However , he casually informed me , presently , that he was a member of the Walnut Street theater company -- and he tried to say it with indifference , but the indifference was thin , and a mighty exultation showed through it .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 26]: He said he was cast for a part in Julius Caesar , for that night , and if I should come I would see him .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 5]: IF I should come !
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 12]: I said I would n't miss it if I were dead .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 18]: I went away stupefied with astonishment , and saying to myself , ` How strange it is !
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 43]: WE always thought this fellow a fool ; yet the moment he comes to a great city , where intelligence and appreciation abound , the talent concealed in this shabby napkin is at once discovered , and promptly welcomed and honored . '
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 32]: But I came away from the theater that night disappointed and offended ; for I had had no glimpse of my hero , and his name was not in the bills .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 26]: I met him on the street the next morning , and before I could speak , he asked -- ` Did you see me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 9]: ` No , you were n't there . '
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 6]: He looked surprised and disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 9]: He said -- ` Yes , I was .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 4]: Indeed I was .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 7]: I was a Roman soldier . '
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 5]: ` Which one ? '
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 27]: ` Why did n't you see them Roman soldiers that stood back there in a rank , and sometimes marched in procession around the stage ? '
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 8]: ` Do you mean the Roman army ?
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 35]: -- those six sandaled roustabouts in nightshirts , with tin shields and helmets , that marched around treading on each other 's heels , in charge of a spider-legged consumptive dressed like themselves ? '
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 5]: ` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 4]: that 's it !
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 8]: I was one of them Roman soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 9]: I was the next to the last one .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 21]: A half a year ago I used to always be the last one ; but I 've been promoted . '
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 23]: Well , they told me that that poor fellow remained a Roman soldier to the last -- a matter of thirty-four years .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 17]: Sometimes they cast him for a ` speaking part , ' but not an elaborate one .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 44]: He could be trusted to go and say , ` My lord , the carriage waits , ' but if they ventured to add a sentence or two to this , his memory felt the strain and he was likely to miss fire .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 39]: Yet , poor devil , he had been patiently studying the part of Hamlet for more than thirty years , and he lived and died in the belief that some day he would be invited to play it !
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 22]: And this is what came of that fleeting visit of those young Englishmen to our village such ages and ages ago !
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 24]: What noble horseshoes this man might have made , but for those Englishmen ; and what an inadequate Roman soldier he DID make !
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 64]: A day or two after we reached St. Louis , I was walking along Fourth Street when a grizzly-headed man gave a sort of start as he passed me , then stopped , came back , inspected me narrowly , with a clouding brow , and finally said with deep asperity -- ` Look here , HAVE YOU GOT THAT DRINK YET ? '
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 9]: A maniac , I judged , at first .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 9]: But all in a flash I recognized him .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 46]: I made an effort to blush that strained every muscle in me , and answered as sweetly and winningly as ever I knew how -- ` Been a little slow , but am just this minute closing in on the place where they keep it .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 6]: Come in and help . '
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 16]: He softened , and said make it a bottle of champagne and he was agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 55]: He said he had seen my name in the papers , and had put all his affairs aside and turned out , resolved to find me or die ; and make me answer that question satisfactorily , or kill me ; though the most of his late asperity had been rather counterfeit than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 16]: This meeting brought back to me the St. Louis riots of about thirty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 26]: I spent a week there , at that time , in a boarding-house , and had this young fellow for a neighbor across the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 48]: We saw some of the fightings and killings ; and by and by we went one night to an armory where two hundred young men had met , upon call , to be armed and go forth against the rioters , under command of a military man .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 34]: We drilled till about ten o'clock at night ; then news came that the mob were in great force in the lower end of the town , and were sweeping everything before them .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 6]: Our column moved at once .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 14]: It was a very hot night , and my musket was very heavy .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 25]: We marched and marched ; and the nearer we approached the seat of war , the hotter I grew and the thirstier I got .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 26]: I was behind my friend ; so , finally , I asked him to hold my musket while I dropped out and got a drink .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 8]: Then I branched off and went home .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 33]: I was not feeling any solicitude about him of course , because I knew he was so well armed , now , that he could take care of himself without any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 18]: If I had had any doubts about that , I would have borrowed another musket for him .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 65]: I left the city pretty early the next morning , and if this grizzled man had not happened to encounter my name in the papers the other day in St. Louis , and felt moved to seek me out , I should have carried to my grave a heart-torturing uncertainty as to whether he ever got out of the riots all right or not .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 14]: I ought to have inquired , thirty years ago ; I know that .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 31]: And I would have inquired , if I had had the muskets ; but , in the circumstances , he seemed better fixed to conduct the investigations than I was .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 53]: One Monday , near the time of our visit to St. Louis , the ` Globe-Democrat ' came out with a couple of pages of Sunday statistics , whereby it appeared that 119,448 St. Louis people attended the morning and evening church services the day before , and 23,102 children attended Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 19]: Thus 142,550 persons , out of the city 's total of 400,000 population , respected the day religious-wise .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 22]: I found these statistics , in a condensed form , in a telegram of the Associated Press , and preserved them .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 25]: They made it apparent that St. Louis was in a higher state of grace than she could have claimed to be in my time .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 17]: But now that I canvass the figures narrowly , I suspect that the telegraph mutilated them .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 24]: It can not be that there are more than 150,000 Catholics in the town ; the other 250,000 must be classified as Protestants .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 32]: Out of these 250,000 , according to this questionable telegram , only 26,362 attended church and Sunday-school , while out of the 150,000 Catholics , 116,188 went to church and Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 25]: Chapter 52 A Burning Brand ALL at once the thought came into my mind , ' I have not sought out Mr. Brown . '
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 21]: Upon that text I desire to depart from the direct line of my subject , and make a little excursion .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 21]: I wish to reveal a secret which I have carried with me nine years , and which has become burdensome .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 52]: Upon a certain occasion , nine years ago , I had said , with strong feeling , ` If ever I see St. Louis again , I will seek out Mr. Brown , the great grain merchant , and ask of him the privilege of shaking him by the hand . '
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 9]: The occasion and the circumstances were as follows .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 40]: A friend of mine , a clergyman , came one evening and said -- ' I have a most remarkable letter here , which I want to read to you , if I can do it without breaking down .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 10]: I must preface it with some explanations , however .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 49]: The letter is written by an ex-thief and ex-vagabond of the lowest origin and basest rearing , a man all stained with crime and steeped in ignorance ; but , thank God , with a mine of pure gold hidden away in him , as you shall see .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 25]: His letter is written to a burglar named Williams , who is serving a nine-year term in a certain State prison , for burglary .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 61]: Williams was a particularly daring burglar , and plied that trade during a number of years ; but he was caught at last and jailed , to await trial in a town where he had broken into a house at night , pistol in hand , and forced the owner to hand over to him $ 8,000 in government bonds .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 29]: Williams was not a common sort of person , by any means ; he was a graduate of Harvard College , and came of good New England stock .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 6]: His father was a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 18]: While lying in jail , his health began to fail , and he was threatened with consumption .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 22]: This fact , together with the opportunity for reflection afforded by solitary confinement , had its effect -- its natural effect .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 25]: He fell into serious thought ; his early training asserted itself with power , and wrought with strong influence upon his mind and heart .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 14]: He put his old life behind him , and became an earnest Christian .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 33]: Some ladies in the town heard of this , visited him , and by their encouraging words supported him in his good resolutions and strengthened him to continue in his new life .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 25]: The trial ended in his conviction and sentence to the State prison for the term of nine years , as I have before said .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 34]: In the prison he became acquainted with the poor wretch referred to in the beginning of my talk , Jack Hunt , the writer of the letter which I am going to read .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 11]: You will see that the acquaintanceship bore fruit for Hunt .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 24]: When Hunt 's time was out , he wandered to St. Louis ; and from that place he wrote his letter to Williams .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 27]: The letter got no further than the office of the prison warden , of course ; prisoners are not often allowed to receive letters from outside .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 13]: The prison authorities read this letter , but did not destroy it .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 9]: They had not the heart to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 25]: They read it to several persons , and eventually it fell into the hands of those ladies of whom I spoke a while ago .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 27]: The other day I came across an old friend of mine -- a clergyman -- who had seen this letter , and was full of it .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 20]: The mere remembrance of it so moved him that he could not talk of it without his voice breaking .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 29]: He promised to get a copy of it for me ; and here it is -- an exact copy , with all the imperfections of the original preserved .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 35]: It has many slang expressions in it -- thieves ' argot -- but their meaning has been interlined , in parentheses , by the prison authorities ' -- St. Louis , June 9th 1872 .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 38]: Mr. W -- friend Charlie if i may call you so : i no you are surprised to get a letter from me , but i hope you wo n't be mad at my writing to you .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 85]: i want to tell you my thanks for the way you talked to me when i was in prison -- it has led me to try and be a better man ; i guess you thought i did not cair for what you said , & at the first go off I did n't , but i noed you was a man who had don big work with good men & want no sucker , nor want gasing & all the boys knod it .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 74]: I used to think at nite what you said , & for it i nocked off swearing months before my time was up , for i saw it want no good , nohow -- the day my time was up you told me if i would shake the cross -LRB- QUIT STEALING -RRB- & live on the square for months , it would be the best job i ever done in my life .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 32]: The state agent give me a ticket to here , & on the car i thought more of what you said to me , but did n't make up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 112]: When we got to Chicago on the cars from there to here , I pulled off an old woman 's leather ; -LRB- ROBBED HER OF HER POCKETBOOK -RRB- i had n't no more than got it off when i wished i had n't done it , for awhile before that i made up my mind to be a square bloke , for months on your word , but forgot it when i saw the leather was a grip -LRB- EASY TO GET -RRB- -- but i kept clos to her & when she got out of the cars at a way place i said , marm have you lost anything .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 56]: & she tumbled -LRB- DISCOVERED -RRB- her leather was off -LRB- GONE -RRB- -- is this it says i , giving it to her -- well if you aint honest , says she , but i had n't got cheak enough to stand that sort of talk , so i left her in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 212]: When i got here i had $ 1 and 25 cents left & i did n't get no work for 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust about on a steam bote -LRB- FOR A DECK HAND -RRB- -- The afternoon of the 3rd day I spent my last 10 cts for moons -LRB- LARGE , ROUND SEA-BISCUIT -RRB- & cheese & i felt pretty rough & was thinking i would have to go on the dipe -LRB- PICKING POCKETS -RRB- again , when i thought of what you once said about a fellows calling on the Lord when he was in hard luck , & i thought i would try it once anyhow , but when i tryed it i got stuck on the start , & all i could get off wos , Lord give a poor fellow a chance to square it for 3 months for Christ 's sake , amen ; & i kept a thinking , of it over and over as i went along -- about an hour after that i was in 4th St. & this is what happened & is the cause of my being where i am now & about which i will tell you before i get done writing .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 171]: As i was walking along herd a big noise & saw a horse running away with a carriage with 2 children in it , & I grabed up a peace of box cover from the side walk & run in the middle of the street , & when the horse came up i smashed him over the head as hard as i could drive -- the bord split to peces & the horse checked up a little & I grabbed the reigns & pulled his head down until he stopped -- the gentleman what owned him came running up & soon as he saw the children were all rite , he shook hands with me and gave me a $ 50 green back , & my asking the Lord to help me come into my head , & i was so thunderstruck i could n't drop the reigns nor say nothing -- he saw something was up , & coming back to me said , my boy are you hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 102]: & the thought come into my head just then to ask him for work ; & i asked him to take back the bill and give me a job -- says he , jump in here & lets talk about it , but keep the money -- he asked me if i could take care of horses & i said yes , for i used to hang round livery stables & often would help clean & drive horses , he told me he wanted a man for that work , & would give me $ 16 a month & bord me .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 9]: You bet i took that chance at once .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 113]: that nite in my little room over the stable i sat a long time thinking over my past life & of what had just happened & i just got down on my nees & thanked the Lord for the job & to help me to square it , & to bless you for putting me up to it , & the next morning i done it again & got me some new togs -LRB- CLOTHES -RRB- & a bible for i made up my mind after what the Lord had done for me i would read the bible every nite and morning , & ask him to keep an eye on me .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 315]: When I had been there about a week Mr. Brown -LRB- that 's his name -RRB- came in my room one nite and saw me reading the bible -- he asked me if i was a Christian & i told him no -- he asked me how it was i read the bible instead of papers & books -- Well Charlie i thought i had better give him a square deal in the start , so i told him all about my being in prison & about you , & how i had almost done give up looking for work & how the Lord got me the job when I asked him ; & the only way i had to pay him back was to read the bible & square it , & i asked him to give me a chance for 3 months -- he talked to me like a father for a long time , & told me i could stay & then i felt better than ever i had done in my life , for i had given Mr. Brown a fair start with me & now i did n't fear no one giving me a back cap -LRB- EXPOSING HIS PAST LIFE -RRB- & running me off the job -- the next morning he called me into the library & gave me another square talk , & advised me to study some every day , & he would help me one or 2 hours every nite , & he gave me a Arithmetic , a spelling book , a Geography & a writing book , & he hers me every nite -- he lets me come into the house to prayers every morning , & got me put in a bible class in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it helps me to understand my bible better .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 410]: Now , Charlie the 3 months on the square are up 2 months ago , & as you said , it is the best job i ever did in my life , & i commenced another of the same sort right away , only it is to God helping me to last a lifetime Charlie -- i wrote this letter to tell you I do think God has forgiven my sins & herd your prayers , for you told me you should pray for me -- i no i love to read his word & tell him all my troubles & he helps me i know for i have plenty of chances to steal but i do n't feel to as i once did & now i take more pleasure in going to church than to the theater & that wasnt so once -- our minister and others often talk with me & a month ago they wanted me to join the church , but I said no , not now , i may be mistaken in my feelings , i will wait awhile , but now i feel that God has called me & on the first Sunday in July i will join the church -- dear friend i wish i could write to you as i feel , but i cant do it yet -- you no i learned to read and write while prisons & i aint got well enough along to write as i would talk ; i no i aint spelled all the words rite in this & lots of other mistakes but you will excuse it i no , for you no i was brought up in a poor house until i run away , & that i never new who my father and mother was & i dont no my right name , & i hope you wont be mad at me , but i have as much rite to one name as another & i have taken your name , for you wont use it when you get out i no , & you are the man i think most of in the world ; so i hope you wont be mad -- I am doing well , i put $ 10 a month in bank with $ 25 of the $ 50 -- if you ever want any or all of it let me know , & it is yours .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 11]: i wish you would let me send you some now .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 155]: I send you with this a receipt for a year of Littles Living Age , i did n't know what you would like & i told Mr. Brown & he said he thought you would like it -- i wish i was nere you so i could send you chuck -LRB- REFRESHMENTS -RRB- on holidays ; it would spoil this weather from here , but i will send you a box next thanksgiving any way -- next week Mr. Brown takes me into his store as lite porter & will advance me as soon as i know a little more -- he keeps a big granary store , wholesale -- i forgot to tell you of my mission school , sunday school class -- the school is in the sunday afternoon , i went out two sunday afternoons , and picked up seven kids -LRB- LITTLE BOYS -RRB- & got them to come in .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 23]: two of them new as much as i did & i had them put in a class where they could learn something .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 19]: i dont no much myself , but as these kids cant read i get on nicely with them .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 24]: i make sure of them by going after them every Sunday hour before school time , I also got 4 girls to come .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 26]: tell Mack and Harry about me , if they will come out here when their time is up i will get them jobs at once .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 119]: i hope you will excuse this long letter & all mistakes , i wish i could see you for i cant write as i would talk -- i hope the warm weather is doing your lungs good -- i was afraid when you was bleeding you would die -- give my respects to all the boys and tell them how i am doing -- i am doing well and every one here treats me as kind as they can -- Mr. Brown is going to write to you sometime -- i hope some day you will write to me , this letter is from your very true friend C -- W -- who you know as Jack Hunt .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 8]: I send you Mr. Brown 's card .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 6]: Send my letter to him .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 20]: Here was true eloquence ; irresistible eloquence ; and without a single grace or ornament to help it out .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 13]: I have seldom been so deeply stirred by any piece of writing .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 40]: The reader of it halted , all the way through , on a lame and broken voice ; yet he had tried to fortify his feelings by several private readings of the letter before venturing into company with it .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 33]: He was practising upon me to see if there was any hope of his being able to read the document to his prayer-meeting with anything like a decent command over his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 6]: The result was not promising .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 11]: However , he determined to risk it ; and did .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 22]: He got through tolerably well ; but his audience broke down early , and stayed in that condition to the end .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 10]: The fame of the letter spread through the town .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 38]: A brother minister came and borrowed the manuscript , put it bodily into a sermon , preached the sermon to twelve hundred people on a Sunday morning , and the letter drowned them in their own tears .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 18]: Then my friend put it into a sermon and went before his Sunday morning congregation with it .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 5]: It scored another triumph .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 7]: The house wept as one individual .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 34]: My friend went on summer vacation up into the fishing regions of our northern British neighbors , and carried this sermon with him , since he might possibly chance to need a sermon .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 9]: He was asked to preach , one day .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 6]: The little church was full .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 44]: Among the people present were the late Dr. J. G. Holland , the late Mr. Seymour of the ` New York Times , ' Mr. Page , the philanthropist and temperance advocate , and , I think , Senator Frye , of Maine .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 47]: The marvelous letter did its wonted work ; all the people were moved , all the people wept ; the tears flowed in a steady stream down Dr. Holland 's cheeks , and nearly the same can be said with regard to all who were there .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 46]: Mr. Page was so full of enthusiasm over the letter that he said he would not rest until he made pilgrimage to that prison , and had speech with the man who had been able to inspire a fellow-unfortunate to write so priceless a tract .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 6]: Ah , that unlucky Page !
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 5]: -- and another man .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 64]: If they had only been in Jericho , that letter would have rung through the world and stirred all the hearts of all the nations for a thousand years to come , and nobody might ever have found out that it was the confoundedest , brazenest , ingeniousest piece of fraud and humbuggery that was ever concocted to fool poor confiding mortals with !
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 13]: The letter was a pure swindle , and that is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 15]: And take it by and large , it was without a compeer among swindles .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 14]: It was perfect , it was rounded , symmetrical , complete , colossal !
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 26]: The reader learns it at this point ; but we did n't learn it till some miles and weeks beyond this stage of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 87]: My friend came back from the woods , and he and other clergymen and lay missionaries began once more to inundate audiences with their tears and the tears of said audiences ; I begged hard for permission to print the letter in a magazine and tell the watery story of its triumphs ; numbers of people got copies of the letter , with permission to circulate them in writing , but not in print ; copies were sent to the Sandwich Islands and other far regions .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 20]: Charles Dudley Warner was at church , one day , when the worn letter was read and wept over .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 33]: At the church door , afterward , he dropped a peculiarly cold iceberg down the clergyman 's back with the question -- ` Do you know that letter to be genuine ? '
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 27]: It was the first suspicion that had ever been voiced ; but it had that sickening effect which first-uttered suspicions against one 's idol always have .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 19]: Some talk followed -- ` Why -- what should make you suspect that it is n't genuine ? '
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 33]: ` Nothing that I know of , except that it is too neat , and compact , and fluent , and nicely put together for an ignorant person , an unpractised hand .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 11]: I think it was done by an educated man . '
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 9]: The literary artist had detected the literary machinery .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 22]: If you will look at the letter now , you will detect it yourself -- it is observable in every line .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 62]: Straightway the clergyman went off , with this seed of suspicion sprouting in him , and wrote to a minister residing in that town where Williams had been jailed and converted ; asked for light ; and also asked if a person in the literary line -LRB- meaning me -RRB- might be allowed to print the letter and tell its history .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 33]: He presently received this answer -- Rev. -- -- MY DEAR FRIEND , -- In regard to that ` convict 's letter ' there can be no doubt as to its genuineness .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 50]: ` Williams , ' to whom it was written , lay in our jail and professed to have been converted , and Rev. Mr. -- , the chaplain , had great faith in the genuineness of the change -- as much as one can have in any such case .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 34]: The letter was sent to one of our ladies , who is a Sunday-school teacher , -- sent either by Williams himself , or the chaplain of the State 's prison , probably .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 27]: She has been greatly annoyed in having so much publicity , lest it might seem a breach of confidence , or be an injury to Williams .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 41]: In regard to its publication , I can give no permission ; though if the names and places were omitted , and especially if sent out of the country , I think you might take the responsibility and do it .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 21]: It is a wonderful letter , which no Christian genius , much less one unsanctified , could ever have written .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 41]: As showing the work of grace in a human heart , and in a very degraded and wicked one , it proves its own origin and reproves our weak faith in its power to cope with any form of wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 17]: ` Mr. Brown ' of St. Louis , some one said , was a Hartford man .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 13]: Do all whom you send from Hartford serve their Master as well ?
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 24]: P.S. -- Williams is still in the State 's prison , serving out a long sentence -- of nine years , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 18]: He has been sick and threatened with consumption , but I have not inquired after him lately .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 23]: This lady that I speak of corresponds with him , I presume , and will be quite sure to look after him .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 20]: This letter arrived a few days after it was written -- and up went Mr. Williams 's stock again .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 19]: Mr. Warner 's low-down suspicion was laid in the cold , cold grave , where it apparently belonged .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 75]: It was a suspicion based upon mere internal evidence , anyway ; and when you come to internal evidence , it 's a big field and a game that two can play at : as witness this other internal evidence , discovered by the writer of the note above quoted , that ` it is a wonderful letter -- which no Christian genius , much less one unsanctified , could ever have written . '
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 22]: I had permission now to print -- provided I suppressed names and places and sent my narrative out of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 27]: So I chose an Australian magazine for vehicle , as being far enough out of the country , and set myself to work on my article .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 17]: And the ministers set the pumps going again , with the letter to work the handles .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 8]: But meantime Brother Page had been agitating .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 32]: He had not visited the penitentiary , but he had sent a copy of the illustrious letter to the chaplain of that institution , and accompanied it with -- apparently inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 30]: He got an answer , dated four days later than that other Brother 's reassuring epistle ; and before my article was complete , it wandered into my hands .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 14]: The original is before me , now , and I here append it .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 27]: It is pretty well loaded with internal evidence of the most solid description -- STATE 'S PRISON , CHAPLAIN 'S OFFICE , July 11 , 1873 .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 3]: DEAR BRO .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 12]: PAGE , -- Herewith please find the letter kindly loaned me .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 10]: I am afraid its genuineness can not be established .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 10]: It purports to be addressed to some prisoner here .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 10]: No such letter ever came to a prisoner here .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 30]: All letters received are carefully read by officers of the prison before they go into the hands of the convicts , and any such letter could not be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 26]: Again , Charles Williams is not a Christian man , but a dissolute , cunning prodigal , whose father is a minister of the gospel .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 7]: His name is an assumed one .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 9]: I am glad to have made your acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 23]: I am preparing a lecture upon life seen through prison bars , and should like to deliver the same in your vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 7]: And so ended that little drama .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 57]: My poor article went into the fire ; for whereas the materials for it were now more abundant and infinitely richer than they had previously been , there were parties all around me , who , although longing for the publication before , were a unit for suppression at this stage and complexion of the game .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 15]: They said : ` Wait -- the wound is too fresh , yet . '
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 29]: All the copies of the famous letter except mine disappeared suddenly ; and from that time onward , the aforetime same old drought set in in the churches .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 41]: As a rule , the town was on a spacious grin for a while , but there were places in it where the grin did not appear , and where it was dangerous to refer to the ex-convict 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 5]: A word of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 17]: ` Jack Hunt , ' the professed writer of the letter , was an imaginary person .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 97]: The burglar Williams -- Harvard graduate , son of a minister -- wrote the letter himself , to himself : got it smuggled out of the prison ; got it conveyed to persons who had supported and encouraged him in his conversion -- where he knew two things would happen : the genuineness of the letter would not be doubted or inquired into ; and the nub of it would be noticed , and would have valuable effect -- the effect , indeed , of starting a movement to get Mr. Williams pardoned out of prison .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 93]: That ` nub ' is so ingeniously , so casually , flung in , and immediately left there in the tail of the letter , undwelt upon , that an indifferent reader would never suspect that it was the heart and core of the epistle , if he even took note of it at all , This is the ` nub ' -- ' i hope the warm weather is doing your lungs good -- I WAS AFRAID WHEN YOU WAS BLEEDING YOU WOULD DIE -- give my respects , ' etc. .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 18]: That is all there is of it -- simply touch and go -- no dwelling upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 45]: Nevertheless it was intended for an eye that would be swift to see it ; and it was meant to move a kind heart to try to effect the liberation of a poor reformed and purified fellow lying in the fell grip of consumption .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 29]: When I for the first time heard that letter read , nine years ago , I felt that it was the most remarkable one I had ever encountered .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 44]: And it so warmed me toward Mr. Brown of St. Louis that I said that if ever I visited that city again , I would seek out that excellent man and kiss the hem of his garment if it was a new one .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 20]: Well , I visited St. Louis , but I did not hunt for Mr. Brown ; for , alas !
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 45]: the investigations of long ago had proved that the benevolent Brown , like ` Jack Hunt , ' was not a real person , but a sheer invention of that gifted rascal , Williams -- burglar , Harvard graduate , son of a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 31]: Chapter 53 My Boyhood 's Home WE took passage in one of the fast boats of the St. Louis and St. Paul Packet Company , and started up the river .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 82]: When I , as a boy , first saw the mouth of the Missouri River , it was twenty-two or twenty-three miles above St. Louis , according to the estimate of pilots ; the wear and tear of the banks have moved it down eight miles since then ; and the pilots say that within five years the river will cut through and move the mouth down five miles more , which will bring it within ten miles of St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 52]: About nightfall we passed the large and flourishing town of Alton , Illinois ; and before daylight next morning the town of Louisiana , Missouri , a sleepy village in my day , but a brisk railway center now ; however , all the towns out there are railway centers now .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 8]: I could not clearly recognize the place .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 56]: This seemed odd to me , for when I retired from the rebel army in '61 I retired upon Louisiana in good order ; at least in good enough order for a person who had not yet learned how to retreat according to the rules of war , and had to trust to native genius .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 18]: It seemed to me that for a first attempt at a retreat it was not badly done .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 17]: I had done no advancing in all that campaign that was at all equal to it .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 23]: There was a railway bridge across the river here well sprinkled with glowing lights , and a very beautiful sight it was .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 17]: At seven in the morning we reached Hannibal , Missouri , where my boyhood was spent .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 28]: I had had a glimpse of it fifteen years ago , and another glimpse six years earlier , but both were so brief that they hardly counted .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 30]: The only notion of the town that remained in my mind was the memory of it as I had known it when I first quitted it twenty-nine years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 16]: That picture of it was still as clear and vivid to me as a photograph .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 16]: I stepped ashore with the feeling of one who returns out of a dead-and-gone generation .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 45]: I had a sort of realizing sense of what the Bastille prisoners must have felt when they used to come out and look upon Paris after years of captivity , and note how curiously the familiar and the strange were mixed together before them .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 46]: I saw the new houses -- saw them plainly enough -- but they did not affect the older picture in my mind , for through their solid bricks and mortar I saw the vanished houses , which had formerly stood there , with perfect distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 11]: It was Sunday morning , and everybody was abed yet .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 50]: So I passed through the vacant streets , still seeing the town as it was , and not as it is , and recognizing and metaphorically shaking hands with a hundred familiar objects which no longer exist ; and finally climbed Holiday 's Hill to get a comprehensive view .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 22]: The whole town lay spread out below me then , and I could mark and fix every locality , every detail .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 9]: Naturally , I was a good deal moved .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 35]: I said , ` Many of the people I once knew in this tranquil refuge of my childhood are now in heaven ; some , I trust , are in the other place . '
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 101]: The things about me and before me made me feel like a boy again -- convinced me that I was a boy again , and that I had simply been dreaming an unusually long dream ; but my reflections spoiled all that ; for they forced me to say , ' I see fifty old houses down yonder , into each of which I could enter and find either a man or a woman who was a baby or unborn when I noticed those houses last , or a grandmother who was a plump young bride at that time . '
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 67]: From this vantage ground the extensive view up and down the river , and wide over the wooded expanses of Illinois , is very beautiful -- one of the most beautiful on the Mississippi , I think ; which is a hazardous remark to make , for the eight hundred miles of river between St. Louis and St. Paul afford an unbroken succession of lovely pictures .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 26]: It may be that my affection for the one in question biases my judgment in its favor ; I can not say as to that .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 86]: No matter , it was satisfyingly beautiful to me , and it had this advantage over all the other friends whom I was about to greet again : it had suffered no change ; it was as young and fresh and comely and gracious as ever it had been ; whereas , the faces of the others would be old , and scarred with the campaigns of life , and marked with their griefs and defeats , and would give me no upliftings of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 27]: An old gentleman , out on an early morning walk , came along , and we discussed the weather , and then drifted into other matters .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 7]: I could not remember his face .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 10]: He said he had been living here twenty-eight years .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 16]: So he had come after my time , and I had never seen him before .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 21]: I asked him various questions ; first about a mate of mine in Sunday school -- what became of him ?
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 41]: ` He graduated with honor in an Eastern college , wandered off into the world somewhere , succeeded at nothing , passed out of knowledge and memory years ago , and is supposed to have gone to the dogs . '
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 15]: ` He was bright , and promised well when he was a boy . '
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 16]: ` Yes , but the thing that happened is what became of it all . '
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 19]: I asked after another lad , altogether the brightest in our village school when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 43]: ` He , too , was graduated with honors , from an Eastern college ; but life whipped him in every battle , straight along , and he died in one of the Territories , years ago , a defeated man . '
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 9]: I asked after another of the bright boys .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 18]: ` He is a success , always has been , always will be , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 24]: I inquired after a young fellow who came to the town to study for one of the professions when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 102]: ` He went at something else before he got through -- went from medicine to law , or from law to medicine -- then to some other new thing ; went away for a year , came back with a young wife ; fell to drinking , then to gambling behind the door ; finally took his wife and two young children to her father 's , and went off to Mexico ; went from bad to worse , and finally died there , without a cent to buy a shroud , and without a friend to attend the funeral . '
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 21]: ` Pity , for he was the best-natured , and most cheery and hopeful young fellow that ever was . '
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 5]: I named another boy .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 8]: ` Oh , he is all right .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 15]: Lives here yet ; has a wife and children , and is prospering . '
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 6]: Same verdict concerning other boys .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 5]: I named three school-girls .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 24]: ` The first two live here , are married and have children ; the other is long ago dead -- never married . '
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 12]: I named , with emotion , one of my early sweethearts .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 6]: ` She is all right .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 31]: Been married three times ; buried two husbands , divorced from the third , and I hear she is getting ready to marry an old fellow out in Colorado somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 14]: She 's got children scattered around here and there , most everywheres . '
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 18]: The answer to several other inquiries was brief and simple -- ` Killed in the war . '
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 5]: I named another boy .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 10]: ` Well , now , his case is curious !
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 32]: There was n't a human being in this town but knew that that boy was a perfect chucklehead ; perfect dummy ; just a stupid ass , as you may say .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 9]: Everybody knew it , and everybody said it .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 24]: Well , if that very boy is n't the first lawyer in the State of Missouri to-day , I 'm a Democrat ! '
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 6]: ` Is that so ? '
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 6]: ` It 's actually so .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 8]: I 'm telling you the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 9]: ` How do you account for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 5]: ` Account for it ?
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 38]: There ai n't any accounting for it , except that if you send a damned fool to St. Louis , and you do n't tell them he 's a damned fool they 'll never find it out .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 41]: There 's one thing sure -- if I had a damned fool I should know what to do with him : ship him to St. Louis -- it 's the noblest market in the world for that kind of property .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 33]: Well , when you come to look at it all around , and chew at it and think it over , do n't it just bang anything you ever heard of ? '
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 10]: ` Well , yes , it does seem to .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 26]: But do n't you think maybe it was the Hannibal people who were mistaken about the boy , and not the St. Louis people . '
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 5]: ` Oh , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 28]: The people here have known him from the very cradle -- they knew him a hundred times better than the St. Louis idiots could have known him .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 27]: No , if you have got any damned fools that you want to realize on , take my advice -- send them to St. Louis . '
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 13]: I mentioned a great number of people whom I had formerly known .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 49]: Some were dead , some were gone away , some had prospered , some had come to naught ; but as regarded a dozen or so of the lot , the answer was comforting : ` Prosperous -- live here yet -- town littered with their children . '
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 6]: I asked about Miss -- .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 40]: Died in the insane asylum three or four years ago -- never was out of it from the time she went in ; and was always suffering , too ; never got a shred of her mind back . '
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 14]: If he spoke the truth , here was a heavy tragedy , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 15]: Thirty-six years in a madhouse , that some young fools might have some fun !
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 33]: I was a small boy , at the time ; and I saw those giddy young ladies come tiptoeing into the room where Miss -- sat reading at midnight by a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 40]: The girl at the head of the file wore a shroud and a doughface , she crept behind the victim , touched her on the shoulder , and she looked up and screamed , and then fell into convulsions .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 12]: She did not recover from the fright , but went mad .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 17]: In these days it seems incredible that people believed in ghosts so short a time ago .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 4]: But they did .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 33]: After asking after such other folk as I could call to mind , I finally inquired about MYSELF : ` Oh , he succeeded well enough -- another case of damned fool .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 16]: If they 'd sent him to St. Louis , he 'd have succeeded sooner . '
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 27]: It was with much satisfaction that I recognized the wisdom of having told this candid gentleman , in the beginning , that my name was Smith .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 37]: Chapter 54 Past and Present Being left to myself , up there , I went on picking out old houses in the distant town , and calling back their former inmates out of the moldy past .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 18]: Among them I presently recognized the house of the father of Lem Hackett -LRB- fictitious name -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 67]: It carried me back more than a generation in a moment , and landed me in the midst of a time when the happenings of life were not the natural and logical results of great general laws , but of special orders , and were freighted with very precise and distinct purposes -- partly punitive in intent , partly admonitory ; and usually local in application .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 16]: When I was a small boy , Lem Hackett was drowned -- on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 13]: He fell out of an empty flat-boat , where he was playing .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 14]: Being loaded with sin , he went to the bottom like an anvil .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 13]: He was the only boy in the village who slept that night .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 8]: We others all lay awake , repenting .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 30]: We had not needed the information , delivered from the pulpit that evening , that Lem 's was a case of special judgment -- we knew that , already .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 17]: There was a ferocious thunder-storm , that night , and it raged continuously until near dawn .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 75]: The winds blew , the windows rattled , the rain swept along the roof in pelting sheets , and at the briefest of intervals the inky blackness of the night vanished , the houses over the way glared out white and blinding for a quivering instant , then the solid darkness shut down again and a splitting peal of thunder followed , which seemed to rend everything in the neighborhood to shreds and splinters .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 21]: I sat up in bed quaking and shuddering , waiting for the destruction of the world , and expecting it .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 19]: To me there was nothing strange or incongruous in heaven 's making such an uproar about Lem Hackett .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 11]: Apparently it was the right and proper thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 34]: Not a doubt entered my mind that all the angels were grouped together , discussing this boy 's case and observing the awful bombardment of our beggarly little village with satisfaction and approval .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 50]: There was one thing which disturbed me in the most serious way ; that was the thought that this centering of the celestial interest on our village could not fail to attract the attention of the observers to people among us who might otherwise have escaped notice for years .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 22]: I felt that I was not only one of those people , but the very one most likely to be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 30]: That discovery could have but one result : I should be in the fire with Lem before the chill of the river had been fairly warmed out of him .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 11]: I knew that this would be only just and fair .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 47]: I was increasing the chances against myself all the time , by feeling a secret bitterness against Lem for having attracted this fatal attention to me , but I could not help it -- this sinful thought persisted in infesting my breast in spite of me .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 16]: Every time the lightning glared I caught my breath , and judged I was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 68]: In my terror and misery , I meanly began to suggest other boys , and mention acts of theirs which were wickeder than mine , and peculiarly needed punishment -- and I tried to pretend to myself that I was simply doing this in a casual way , and without intent to divert the heavenly attention to them for the purpose of getting rid of it myself .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 36]: With deep sagacity I put these mentions into the form of sorrowing recollections and left-handed sham-supplications that the sins of those boys might be allowed to pass unnoticed -- ` Possibly they may repent . '
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 24]: ` It is true that Jim Smith broke a window and lied about it -- but maybe he did not mean any harm .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 30]: And although Tom Holmes says more bad words than any other boy in the village , he probably intends to repent -- though he has never said he would .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 59]: And whilst it is a fact that John Jones did fish a little on Sunday , once , he did n't really catch anything but only just one small useless mud-cat ; and maybe that would n't have been so awful if he had thrown it back -- as he says he did , but he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 17]: Pity but they would repent of these dreadful things -- and maybe they will yet . '
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 43]: But while I was shamefully trying to draw attention to these poor chaps -- who were doubtless directing the celestial attention to me at the same moment , though I never once suspected that -- I had heedlessly left my candle burning .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 11]: It was not a time to neglect even trifling precautions .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 23]: There was no occasion to add anything to the facilities for attracting notice to me -- so I put the light out .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 18]: It was a long night to me , and perhaps the most distressful one I ever spent .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 56]: I endured agonies of remorse for sins which I knew I had committed , and for others which I was not certain about , yet was sure that they had been set down against me in a book by an angel who was wiser than I and did not trust such important matters to memory .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 48]: It struck me , by and by , that I had been making a most foolish and calamitous mistake , in one respect : doubtless I had not only made my own destruction sure by directing attention to those other boys , but had already accomplished theirs !
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 16]: -- Doubtless the lightning had stretched them all dead in their beds by this time !
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 19]: The anguish and the fright which this thought gave me made my previous sufferings seem trifling by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 6]: Things had become truly serious .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 32]: I resolved to turn over a new leaf instantly ; I also resolved to connect myself with the church the next day , if I survived to see its sun appear .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 23]: I resolved to cease from sin in all its forms , and to lead a high and blameless life for ever after .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 111]: I would be punctual at church and Sunday-school ; visit the sick ; carry baskets of victuals to the poor -LRB- simply to fulfil the regulation conditions , although I knew we had none among us so poor but they would smash the basket over my head for my pains -RRB- ; I would instruct other boys in right ways , and take the resulting trouncings meekly ; I would subsist entirely on tracts ; I would invade the rum shop and warn the drunkard -- and finally , if I escaped the fate of those who early become too good to live , I would go for a missionary .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 43]: The storm subsided toward daybreak , and I dozed gradually to sleep with a sense of obligation to Lem Hackett for going to eternal suffering in that abrupt way , and thus preventing a far more dreadful disaster -- my own loss .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 50]: But when I rose refreshed , by and by , and found that those other boys were still alive , I had a dim sense that perhaps the whole thing was a false alarm ; that the entire turmoil had been on Lem 's account and nobody 's else .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 24]: The world looked so bright and safe that there did not seem to be any real occasion to turn over a new leaf .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 44]: I was a little subdued , during that day , and perhaps the next ; after that , my purpose of reforming slowly dropped out of my mind , and I had a peaceful , comfortable time again , until the next storm .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 39]: That storm came about three weeks later ; and it was the most unaccountable one , to me , that I had ever experienced ; for on the afternoon of that day , ` Dutchy ' was drowned .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 6]: Dutchy belonged to our Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 30]: He was a German lad who did not know enough to come in out of the rain ; but he was exasperatingly good , and had a prodigious memory .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 44]: One Sunday he made himself the envy of all the youth and the talk of all the admiring village , by reciting three thousand verses of Scripture without missing a word ; then he went off the very next day and got drowned .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 9]: Circumstances gave to his death a peculiar impressiveness .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 40]: We were all bathing in a muddy creek which had a deep hole in it , and in this hole the coopers had sunk a pile of green hickory hoop poles to soak , some twelve feet under water .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 13]: We were diving and ` seeing who could stay under longest . '
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 13]: We managed to remain down by holding on to the hoop poles .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 24]: Dutchy made such a poor success of it that he was hailed with laughter and derision every time his head appeared above water .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 55]: At last he seemed hurt with the taunts , and begged us to stand still on the bank and be fair with him and give him an honest count -- ` be friendly and kind just this once , and not miscount for the sake of having the fun of laughing at him . '
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 23]: Treacherous winks were exchanged , and all said ` All right , Dutchy -- go ahead , we 'll play fair . '
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 37]: Dutchy plunged in , but the boys , instead of beginning to count , followed the lead of one of their number and scampered to a range of blackberry bushes close by and hid behind it .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 27]: They imagined Dutchy 's humiliation , when he should rise after a superhuman effort and find the place silent and vacant , nobody there to applaud .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 21]: They were ` so full of laugh ' with the idea , that they were continually exploding into muffled cackles .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 31]: Time swept on , and presently one who was peeping through the briers , said , with surprise -- ` Why , he has n't come up , yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 4]: The laughing stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 13]: ` Boys , it 's a splendid dive , ' said one .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 22]: ` Never mind that , ' said another , ` the joke on him is all the better for it . '
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 13]: There was a remark or two more , and then a pause .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 12]: Talking ceased , and all began to peer through the vines .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 18]: Before long , the boys ' faces began to look uneasy , then anxious , then terrified .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 10]: Still there was no movement of the placid water .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: Hearts began to beat fast , and faces to turn pale .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 29]: We all glided out , silently , and stood on the bank , our horrified eyes wandering back and forth from each other 's countenances to the water .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 9]: ` Somebody must go down and see ! '
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 13]: Yes , that was plain ; but nobody wanted that grisly task .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 5]: ` Draw straws ! '
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 19]: So we did -- with hands which shook so , that we hardly knew what we were about .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 11]: The lot fell to me , and I went down .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 53]: The water was so muddy I could not see anything , but I felt around among the hoop poles , and presently grasped a limp wrist which gave me no response -- and if it had I should not have known it , I let it go with such a frightened suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 15]: The boy had been caught among the hoop poles and entangled there , helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 11]: I fled to the surface and told the awful news .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 26]: Some of us knew that if the boy were dragged out at once he might possibly be resuscitated , but we never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 57]: We did not think of anything ; we did not know what to do , so we did nothing -- except that the smaller lads cried , piteously , and we all struggled frantically into our clothes , putting on anybody 's that came handy , and getting them wrong-side-out and upside-down , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 23]: Then we scurried away and gave the alarm , but none of us went back to see the end of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 29]: We had a more important thing to attend to : we all flew home , and lost not a moment in getting ready to lead a better life .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 6]: The night presently closed down .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 10]: Then came on that tremendous and utterly unaccountable storm .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 11]: I was perfectly dazed ; I could not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 11]: It seemed to me that there must be some mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 22]: The elements were turned loose , and they rattled and banged and blazed away in the most blind and frantic manner .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 43]: All heart and hope went out of me , and the dismal thought kept floating through my brain , ` If a boy who knows three thousand verses by heart is not satisfactory , what chance is there for anybody else ? '
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 98]: Of course I never questioned for a moment that the storm was on Dutchy 's account , or that he or any other inconsequential animal was worthy of such a majestic demonstration from on high ; the lesson of it was the only thing that troubled me ; for it convinced me that if Dutchy , with all his perfections , was not a delight , it would be vain for me to turn over a new leaf , for I must infallibly fall hopelessly short of that boy , no matter how hard I might try .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 48]: Nevertheless I did turn it over -- a highly educated fear compelled me to do that -- but succeeding days of cheerfulness and sunshine came bothering around , and within a month I had so drifted backward that again I was as lost and comfortable as ever .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 31]: Breakfast time approached while I mused these musings and called these ancient happenings back to mind ; so I got me back into the present and went down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 23]: On my way through town to the hotel , I saw the house which was my home when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 36]: At present rates , the people who now occupy it are of no more value than I am ; but in my time they would have been worth not less than five hundred dollars apiece .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 5]: They are colored folk .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 56]: After breakfast , I went out alone again , intending to hunt up some of the Sunday-schools and see how this generation of pupils might compare with their progenitors who had sat with me in those places and had probably taken me as a model -- though I do not remember as to that now .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 64]: By the public square there had been in my day a shabby little brick church called the ` Old Ship of Zion , ' which I had attended as a Sunday-school scholar ; and I found the locality easily enough , but not the old church ; it was gone , and a trig and rather hilarious new edifice was in its place .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 35]: The pupils were better dressed and better looking than were those of my time ; consequently they did not resemble their ancestors ; and consequently there was nothing familiar to me in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 94]: Still , I contemplated them with a deep interest and a yearning wistfulness , and if I had been a girl I would have cried ; for they were the offspring , and represented , and occupied the places , of boys and girls some of whom I had loved to love , and some of whom I had loved to hate , but all of whom were dear to me for the one reason or the other , so many years gone by -- and , Lord , where be they now !
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 89]: I was mightily stirred , and would have been grateful to be allowed to remain unmolested and look my fill ; but a bald-summited superintendent who had been a tow-headed Sunday-school mate of mine on that spot in the early ages , recognized me , and I talked a flutter of wild nonsense to those children to hide the thoughts which were in me , and which could not have been spoken without a betrayal of feeling that would have been recognized as out of character with me .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 61]: Making speeches without preparation is no gift of mine ; and I was resolved to shirk any new opportunity , but in the next and larger Sunday-school I found myself in the rear of the assemblage ; so I was very willing to go on the platform a moment for the sake of getting a good look at the scholars .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 81]: On the spur of the moment I could not recall any of the old idiotic talks which visitors used to insult me with when I was a pupil there ; and I was sorry for this , since it would have given me time and excuse to dawdle there and take a long and satisfying look at what I feel at liberty to say was an array of fresh young comeliness not matchable in another Sunday-school of the same size .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 41]: As I talked merely to get a chance to inspect ; and as I strung out the random rubbish solely to prolong the inspection , I judged it but decent to confess these low motives , and I did so .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 17]: If the Model Boy was in either of these Sunday-schools , I did not see him .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 81]: The Model Boy of my time -- we never had but the one -- was perfect : perfect in manners , perfect in dress , perfect in conduct , perfect in filial piety , perfect in exterior godliness ; but at bottom he was a prig ; and as for the contents of his skull , they could have changed place with the contents of a pie and nobody would have been the worse off for it but the pie .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 15]: This fellow 's reproachlessness was a standing reproach to every lad in the village .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 17]: He was the admiration of all the mothers , and the detestation of all their sons .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 24]: I was told what became of him , but as it was a disappointment to me , I will not enter into details .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 5]: He succeeded in life .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 79]: Chapter 55 A Vendetta and Other Things DURING my three days ' stay in the town , I woke up every morning with the impression that I was a boy -- for in my dreams the faces were all young again , and looked as they had looked in the old times -- but I went to bed a hundred years old , every night -- for meantime I had been seeing those faces as they are now .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 23]: Of course I suffered some surprises , along at first , before I had become adjusted to the changed state of things .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 35]: I met young ladies who did not seem to have changed at all ; but they turned out to be the daughters of the young ladies I had in mind -- sometimes their grand-daughters .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 43]: When you are told that a stranger of fifty is a grandmother , there is nothing surprising about it ; but if , on the contrary , she is a person whom you knew as a little girl , it seems impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 16]: You say to yourself , ` How can a little girl be a grandmother . '
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 31]: It takes some little time to accept and realize the fact that while you have been growing old , your friends have not been standing still , in that matter .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 16]: I noticed that the greatest changes observable were with the women , not the men .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 18]: I saw men whom thirty years had changed but slightly ; but their wives had grown old .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 13]: These were good women ; it is very wearing to be good .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 15]: There was a saddler whom I wished to see ; but he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 9]: Dead , these many years , they said .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 33]: Once or twice a day , the saddler used to go tearing down the street , putting on his coat as he went ; and then everybody knew a steamboat was coming .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 90]: Everybody knew , also , that John Stavely was not expecting anybody by the boat -- or any freight , either ; and Stavely must have known that everybody knew this , still it made no difference to him ; he liked to seem to himself to be expecting a hundred thousand tons of saddles by this boat , and so he went on all his life , enjoying being faithfully on hand to receive and receipt for those saddles , in case by any miracle they should come .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 21]: A malicious Quincy paper used always to refer to this town , in derision as ` Stavely 's Landing . '
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 44]: Stavely was one of my earliest admirations ; I envied him his rush of imaginary business , and the display he was able to make of it , before strangers , as he went flying down the street struggling with his fluttering coat .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 11]: But there was a carpenter who was my chiefest hero .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 19]: He was a mighty liar , but I did not know that ; I believed everything he said .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 18]: He was a romantic , sentimental , melodramatic fraud , and his bearing impressed me with awe .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 13]: I vividly remember the first time he took me into his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 62]: He was planing a board , and every now and then he would pause and heave a deep sigh ; and occasionally mutter broken sentences -- confused and not intelligible -- but out of their midst an ejaculation sometimes escaped which made me shiver and did me good : one was , ' O God , it is his blood ! '
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 21]: I sat on the tool-chest and humbly and shudderingly admired him ; for I judged he was full of crime .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 21]: At last he said in a low voice -- ` My little friend , can you keep a secret ? '
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 7]: I eagerly said I could . '
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 7]: A dark and dreadful one ? '
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 7]: I satisfied him on that point .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 28]: ` Then I will tell you some passages in my history ; for oh , I MUST relieve my burdened soul , or I shall die ! '
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 27]: He cautioned me once more to be ` as silent as the grave ; ' then he told me he was a ` red-handed murderer . '
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 37]: He put down his plane , held his hands out before him , contemplated them sadly , and said -- ` Look -- with these hands I have taken the lives of thirty human beings ! '
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 26]: The effect which this had upon me was an inspiration to him , and he turned himself loose upon his subject with interest and energy .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 46]: He left generalizing , and went into details , -- began with his first murder ; described it , told what measures he had taken to avert suspicion ; then passed to his second homicide , his third , his fourth , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 28]: He had always done his murders with a bowie-knife , and he made all my hairs rise by suddenly snatching it out and showing it to me .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 39]: At the end of this first seance I went home with six of his fearful secrets among my freightage , and found them a great help to my dreams , which had been sluggish for a while back .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 30]: I sought him again and again , on my Saturday holidays ; in fact I spent the summer with him -- all of it which was valuable to me .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 24]: His fascinations never diminished , for he threw something fresh and stirring , in the way of horror , into each successive murder .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 11]: He always gave names , dates , places -- everything .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 33]: This by and by enabled me to note two things : that he had killed his victims in every quarter of the globe , and that these victims were always named Lynch .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 57]: The destruction of the Lynches went serenely on , Saturday after Saturday , until the original thirty had multiplied to sixty -- and more to be heard from yet ; then my curiosity got the better of my timidity , and I asked how it happened that these justly punished persons all bore the same name .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 40]: My hero said he had never divulged that dark secret to any living being ; but felt that he could trust me , and therefore he would lay bare before me the story of his sad and blighted life .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 29]: He had loved one ` too fair for earth , ' and she had reciprocated ` with all the sweet affection of her pure and noble nature . '
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 38]: But he had a rival , a ` base hireling ' named Archibald Lynch , who said the girl should be his , or he would ` dye his hands in her heart 's best blood . '
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 80]: The carpenter , ` innocent and happy in love 's young dream , ' gave no weight to the threat , but led his ` golden-haired darling to the altar , ' and there , the two were made one ; there also , just as the minister 's hands were stretched in blessing over their heads , the fell deed was done -- with a knife -- and the bride fell a corpse at her husband 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 7]: And what did the husband do ?
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 39]: He plucked forth that knife , and kneeling by the body of his lost one , swore to ` consecrate his life to the extermination of all the human scum that bear the hated name of Lynch . '
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 4]: That was it .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 20]: He had been hunting down the Lynches and slaughtering them , from that day to this -- twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 42]: He had always used that same consecrated knife ; with it he had murdered his long array of Lynches , and with it he had left upon the forehead of each victim a peculiar mark -- a cross , deeply incised .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 44]: Said he -- ` The cross of the Mysterious Avenger is known in Europe , in America , in China , in Siam , in the Tropics , in the Polar Seas , in the deserts of Asia , in all the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 45]: Wherever in the uttermost parts of the globe , a Lynch has penetrated , there has the Mysterious Cross been seen , and those who have seen it have shuddered and said , `` It is his mark , he has been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 21]: You have heard of the Mysterious Avenger -- look upon him , for before you stands no less a person !
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 11]: But beware -- breathe not a word to any soul .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 6]: Be silent , and wait .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 45]: Some morning this town will flock aghast to view a gory corpse ; on its brow will be seen the awful sign , and men will tremble and whisper , `` He has been here -- it is the Mysterious Avenger 's mark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 19]: You will come here , but I shall have vanished ; you will see me no more . '
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 52]: This ass had been reading the ` Jibbenainosay , ' no doubt , and had had his poor romantic head turned by it ; but as I had not yet seen the book then , I took his inventions for truth , and did not suspect that he was a plagiarist .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 28]: However , we had a Lynch living in the town ; and the more I reflected upon his impending doom , the more I could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 49]: It seemed my plain duty to save him , and a still plainer and more important duty to get some sleep for myself , so at last I ventured to go to Mr. Lynch and tell him what was about to happen to him -- under strict secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 16]: I advised him to ` fly , ' and certainly expected him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 80]: But he laughed at me ; and he did not stop there ; he led me down to the carpenter 's shop , gave the carpenter a jeering and scornful lecture upon his silly pretensions , slapped his face , made him get down on his knees and beg -- then went off and left me to contemplate the cheap and pitiful ruin of what , in my eyes , had so lately been a majestic and incomparable hero .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 53]: The carpenter blustered , flourished his knife , and doomed this Lynch in his usual volcanic style , the size of his fateful words undiminished ; but it was all wasted upon me ; he was a hero to me no longer , but only a poor , foolish , exposed humbug .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 28]: I was ashamed of him , and ashamed of myself ; I took no further interest in him , and never went to his shop any more .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 19]: He was a heavy loss to me , for he was the greatest hero I had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 28]: The fellow must have had some talent ; for some of his imaginary murders were so vividly and dramatically described that I remember all their details yet .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 13]: The people of Hannibal are not more changed than is the town .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 28]: It is no longer a village ; it is a city , with a mayor , and a council , and water-works , and probably a debt .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 49]: It has fifteen thousand people , is a thriving and energetic place , and is paved like the rest of the west and south -- where a well-paved street and a good sidewalk are things so seldom seen , that one doubts them when he does see them .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 22]: The customary half-dozen railways center in Hannibal now , and there is a new depot which cost a hundred thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 58]: In my time the town had no specialty , and no commercial grandeur ; the daily packet usually landed a passenger and bought a catfish , and took away another passenger and a hatful of freight ; but now a huge commerce in lumber has grown up and a large miscellaneous commerce is one of the results .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 9]: A deal of money changes hands there now .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 42]: Bear Creek -- so called , perhaps , because it was always so particularly bare of bears -- is hidden out of sight now , under islands and continents of piled lumber , and nobody but an expert can find it .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 41]: I used to get drowned in it every summer regularly , and be drained out , and inflated and set going again by some chance enemy ; but not enough of it is unoccupied now to drown a person in .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 13]: It was a famous breeder of chills and fever in its day .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 14]: I remember one summer when everybody in town had this disease at once .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 21]: Many chimneys were shaken down , and all the houses were so racked that the town had to be rebuilt .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 26]: The chasm or gorge between Lover 's Leap and the hill west of it is supposed by scientists to have been caused by glacial action .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 5]: This is a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 16]: There is an interesting cave a mile or two below Hannibal , among the bluffs .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 13]: I would have liked to revisit it , but had not time .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 21]: In my time the person who then owned it turned it into a mausoleum for his daughter , aged fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 30]: The body of this poor child was put into a copper cylinder filled with alcohol , and this was suspended in one of the dismal avenues of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 38]: The top of the cylinder was removable ; and it was said to be a common thing for the baser order of tourists to drag the dead face into view and examine it and comment upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 35]: Chapter 56 A Question of Law THE slaughter-house is gone from the mouth of Bear Creek and so is the small jail -LRB- or ` calaboose ' -RRB- which once stood in its neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 25]: A citizen asked , ` Do you remember when Jimmy Finn , the town drunkard , was burned to death in the calaboose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 23]: Observe , now , how history becomes defiled , through lapse of time and the help of the bad memories of men .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 29]: Jimmy Finn was not burned in the calaboose , but died a natural death in a tan vat , of a combination of delirium tremens and spontaneous combustion .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 19]: When I say natural death , I mean it was a natural death for Jimmy Finn to die .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 19]: The calaboose victim was not a citizen ; he was a poor stranger , a harmless whiskey-sodden tramp .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 28]: I know more about his case than anybody else ; I knew too much of it , in that bygone day , to relish speaking of it .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 53]: That tramp was wandering about the streets one chilly evening , with a pipe in his mouth , and begging for a match ; he got neither matches nor courtesy ; on the contrary , a troop of bad little boys followed him around and amused themselves with nagging and annoying him .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 75]: I assisted ; but at last , some appeal which the wayfarer made for forbearance , accompanying it with a pathetic reference to his forlorn and friendless condition , touched such sense of shame and remnant of right feeling as were left in me , and I went away and got him some matches , and then hied me home and to bed , heavily weighted as to conscience , and unbuoyant in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 32]: An hour or two afterward , the man was arrested and locked up in the calaboose by the marshal -- large name for a constable , but that was his title .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 26]: At two in the morning , the church bells rang for fire , and everybody turned out , of course -- I with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 27]: The tramp had used his matches disastrously : he had set his straw bed on fire , and the oaken sheathing of the room had caught .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 32]: When I reached the ground , two hundred men , women , and children stood massed together , transfixed with horror , and staring at the grated windows of the jail .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 42]: Behind the iron bars , and tugging frantically at them , and screaming for help , stood the tramp ; he seemed like a black object set against a sun , so white and intense was the light at his back .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 14]: That marshal could not be found , and he had the only key .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 35]: A battering-ram was quickly improvised , and the thunder of its blows upon the door had so encouraging a sound that the spectators broke into wild cheering , and believed the merciful battle won .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 6]: But it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 11]: The timbers were too strong ; they did not yield .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 33]: It was said that the man 's death-grip still held fast to the bars after he was dead ; and that in this position the fires wrapped him about and consumed him .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 9]: As to this , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 23]: What was seen after I recognized the face that was pleading through the bars was seen by others , not by me .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 45]: I saw that face , so situated , every night for a long time afterward ; and I believed myself as guilty of the man 's death as if I had given him the matches purposely that he might burn himself up with them .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 20]: I had not a doubt that I should be hanged if my connection with this tragedy were found out .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 31]: The happenings and the impressions of that time are burnt into my memory , and the study of them entertains me as much now as they themselves distressed me then .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 96]: If anybody spoke of that grisly matter , I was all ears in a moment , and alert to hear what might be said , for I was always dreading and expecting to find out that I was suspected ; and so fine and so delicate was the perception of my guilty conscience , that it often detected suspicion in the most purposeless remarks , and in looks , gestures , glances of the eye which had no significance , but which sent me shivering away in a panic of fright , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 26]: And how sick it made me when somebody dropped , howsoever carelessly and barren of intent , the remark that ` murder will out ! '
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 15]: For a boy of ten years , I was carrying a pretty weighty cargo .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 22]: All this time I was blessedly forgetting one thing -- the fact that I was an inveterate talker in my sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 28]: But one night I awoke and found my bed-mate -- my younger brother -- sitting up in bed and contemplating me by the light of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 10]: I said -- ` What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 11]: ` You talk so much I ca n't sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 22]: I came to a sitting posture in an instant , with my kidneys in my throat and my hair on end .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 6]: ` What did I say .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 12]: Quick -- out with it -- what did I say ? '
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 5]: ` Nothing much . '
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 11]: ` It 's a lie -- you know everything . '
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 6]: ` Everything about what ? '
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 6]: ` You know well enough .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 4]: About THAT . '
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 4]: ` About WHAT ?
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 11]: -- I do n't know what you are talking about .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 10]: I think you are sick or crazy or something .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 21]: But anyway , you 're awake , and I 'll get to sleep while I 've got a chance . '
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 28]: He fell asleep and I lay there in a cold sweat , turning this new terror over in the whirling chaos which did duty as my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 13]: The burden of my thought was , How much did I divulge ?
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 6]: How much does he know ?
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 8]: -- what a distress is this uncertainty !
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 22]: But by and by I evolved an idea -- I would wake my brother and probe him with a supposititious case .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 31]: I shook him up , and said -- ` Suppose a man should come to you drunk -- ' ` This is foolish -- I never get drunk . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 13]: I do n't mean you , idiot -- I mean the man .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 45]: Suppose a MAN should come to you drunk , and borrow a knife , or a tomahawk , or a pistol , and you forgot to tell him it was loaded , and -- ' ` How could you load a tomahawk ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 20]: I do n't mean the tomahawk , and I did n't say the tomahawk ; I said the pistol .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 15]: Now do n't you keep breaking in that way , because this is serious .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 8]: There 's been a man killed . '
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 5]: in this town ? '
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 8]: ` Yes , in this town . '
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 15]: ` Well , go on -- I wo n't say a single word . '
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 50]: ` Well , then , suppose you forgot to tell him to be careful with it , because it was loaded , and he went off and shot himself with that pistol -- fooling with it , you know , and probably doing it by accident , being drunk .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 8]: Well , would it be murder ? '
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 6]: ` No -- suicide . '
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 24]: I do n't mean HIS act , I mean yours : would you be a murderer for letting him have that pistol ? '
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 35]: After deep thought came this answer -- ` Well , I should think I was guilty of something -- maybe murder -- yes , probably murder , but I do n't quite know . '
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 6]: This made me very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 9]: However , it was not a decisive verdict .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 18]: I should have to set out the real case -- there seemed to be no other way .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 16]: But I would do it cautiously , and keep a watch out for suspicious effects .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 20]: I said -- ' I was supposing a case , but I am coming to the real one now .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 16]: Do you know how the man came to be burned up in the calaboose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 9]: ` Have n't you the least idea ? '
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 6]: ` Not the least . '
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 13]: ` Wish you may die in your tracks if you have ? '
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 12]: ` Yes , wish I may die in my tracks . '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 10]: ` Well , the way of it was this .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 10]: The man wanted some matches to light his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 6]: A boy got him some .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 18]: The man set fire to the calaboose with those very matches , and burnt himself up . '
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 6]: ` Is that so ? '
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 6]: ` Yes , it is .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 13]: Now , is that boy a murderer , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 5]: ` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 6]: The man was drunk ? '
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 8]: ` Yes , he was drunk . '
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 5]: ` Very drunk ? '
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 8]: ` And the boy knew it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 8]: ` Yes , he knew it . '
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 6]: There was a long pause .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 25]: Then came this heavy verdict -- ` If the man was drunk , and the boy knew it , the boy murdered that man .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 5]: This is certain . '
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 32]: Faint , sickening sensations crept along all the fibers of my body , and I seemed to know how a person feels who hears his death sentence pronounced from the bench .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 11]: I waited to hear what my brother would say next .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 14]: I believed I knew what it would be , and I was right .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 10]: He said -- ' I know the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 11]: I had nothing to say ; so I said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 4]: I simply shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 32]: Then he added -- ` Yes , before you got half through telling about the thing , I knew perfectly well who the boy was ; it was Ben Coontz ! '
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 14]: I came out of my collapse as one who rises from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 20]: I said , with admiration -- ` Why , how in the world did you ever guess it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 9]: ` You told it in your sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 11]: I said to myself , ` How splendid that is !
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 10]: This is a habit which must be cultivated . '
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 94]: My brother rattled innocently on -- ` When you were talking in your sleep , you kept mumbling something about `` matches , '' which I could n't make anything out of ; but just now , when you began to tell me about the man and the calaboose and the matches , I remembered that in your sleep you mentioned Ben Coontz two or three times ; so I put this and that together , you see , and right away I knew it was Ben that burnt that man up . '
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 6]: I praised his sagacity effusively .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 17]: Presently he asked -- ` Are you going to give him up to the law ? '
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 19]: ` No , ' I said ; ' I believe that this will be a lesson to him .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 38]: I shall keep an eye on him , of course , for that is but right ; but if he stops where he is and reforms , it shall never be said that I betrayed him . '
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 7]: ` How good you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 8]: ` Well , I try to be .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 14]: It is all a person can do in a world like this . '
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 17]: And now , my burden being shifted to other shoulders , my terrors soon faded away .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 24]: The day before we left Hannibal , a curious thing fell under my notice -- the surprising spread which longitudinal time undergoes there .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 28]: I learned it from one of the most unostentatious of men -- the colored coachman of a friend of mine , who lives three miles from town .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 19]: He was to call for me at the Park Hotel at 7.30 P.M. , and drive me out .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 12]: But he missed it considerably -- did not arrive till ten .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 38]: He excused himself by saying -- ` De time is mos ' an hour en a half slower in de country en what it is in de town ; you 'll be in plenty time , boss .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 23]: Sometimes we shoves out early for church , Sunday , en fetches up dah right plum in de middle er de sermon .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 5]: Diffunce in de time .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 12]: A body ca n't make no calculations ` bout it . '
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 18]: I had lost two hours and a half ; but I had learned a fact worth four .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 30]: Chapter 57 An Archangel FROM St. Louis northward there are all the enlivening signs of the presence of active , energetic , intelligent , prosperous , practical nineteenth-century populations .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 9]: The people do n't dream , they work .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 27]: The happy result is manifest all around in the substantial outside aspect of things , and the suggestions of wholesome life and comfort that everywhere appear .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 31]: Quincy is a notable example -- a brisk , handsome , well-ordered city ; and now , as formerly , interested in art , letters , and other high things .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 7]: But Marion City is an exception .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 11]: Marion City has gone backwards in a most unaccountable way .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 30]: This metropolis promised so well that the projectors tacked ` city ' to its name in the very beginning , with full confidence ; but it was bad prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 23]: When I first saw Marion City , thirty-five years ago , it contained one street , and nearly or quite six houses .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 29]: It contains but one house now , and this one , in a state of ruin , is getting ready to follow the former five into the river .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 9]: Doubtless Marion City was too near to Quincy .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 30]: It had another disadvantage : it was situated in a flat mud bottom , below high-water mark , whereas Quincy stands high up on the slope of a hill .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 43]: In the beginning Quincy had the aspect and ways of a model New England town : and these she has yet : broad , clean streets , trim , neat dwellings and lawns , fine mansions , stately blocks of commercial buildings .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 43]: And there are ample fair-grounds , a well kept park , and many attractive drives ; library , reading-rooms , a couple of colleges , some handsome and costly churches , and a grand court-house , with grounds which occupy a square .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 9]: The population of the city is thirty thousand .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 21]: There are some large factories here , and manufacturing , of many sorts , is done on a great scale .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 30]: La Grange and Canton are growing towns , but I missed Alexandria ; was told it was under water , but would come up to blow in the summer .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 5]: Keokuk was easily recognizable .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 14]: I lived there in 1857 -- an extraordinary year there in real-estate matters .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 8]: The ` boom ' was something wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 26]: Everybody bought , everybody sold -- except widows and preachers ; they always hold on ; and when the tide ebbs , they get left .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 36]: Anything in the semblance of a town lot , no matter how situated , was salable , and at a figure which would still have been high if the ground had been sodded with greenbacks .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 18]: The town has a population of fifteen thousand now , and is progressing with a healthy growth .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 28]: It was night , and we could not see details , for which we were sorry , for Keokuk has the reputation of being a beautiful city .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 23]: It was a pleasant one to live in long ago , and doubtless has advanced , not retrograded , in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 15]: A mighty work which was in progress there in my day is finished now .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 8]: This is the canal over the Rapids .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 22]: It is eight miles long , three hundred feet wide , and is in no place less than six feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 23]: Its masonry is of the majestic kind which the War Department usually deals in , and will endure like a Roman aqueduct .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 8]: The work cost four or five millions .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 17]: After an hour or two spent with former friends , we started up the river again .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 20]: Keokuk , a long time ago , was an occasional loafing-place of that erratic genius , Henry Clay Dean .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 20]: I believe I never saw him but once ; but he was much talked of when I lived there .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 16]: This is what was said of him -- He began life poor and without education .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 11]: But he educated himself -- on the curbstones of Keokuk .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 83]: He would sit down on a curbstone with his book , careless or unconscious of the clatter of commerce and the tramp of the passing crowds , and bury himself in his studies by the hour , never changing his position except to draw in his knees now and then to let a dray pass unobstructed ; and when his book was finished , its contents , however abstruse , had been burnt into his memory , and were his permanent possession .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 35]: In this way he acquired a vast hoard of all sorts of learning , and had it pigeon-holed in his head where he could put his intellectual hand on it whenever it was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 36]: His clothes differed in no respect from a ` wharf-rat 's , ' except that they were raggeder , more ill-assorted and inharmonious -LRB- and therefore more extravagantly picturesque -RRB- , and several layers dirtier .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 16]: Nobody could infer the master-mind in the top of that edifice from the edifice itself .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 22]: He was an orator -- by nature in the first place , and later by the training of experience and practice .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 25]: When he was out on a canvass , his name was a lodestone which drew the farmers to his stump from fifty miles around .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 6]: His theme was always politics .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 13]: He used no notes , for a volcano does not need notes .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 54]: In 1862 , a son of Keokuk 's late distinguished citizen , Mr. Claggett , gave me this incident concerning Dean -- The war feeling was running high in Keokuk -LRB- in ' 61 -RRB- , and a great mass meeting was to be held on a certain day in the new Athenaeum .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 9]: A distinguished stranger was to address the house .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 31]: After the building had been packed to its utmost capacity with sweltering folk of both sexes , the stage still remained vacant -- the distinguished stranger had failed to connect .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 13]: The crowd grew impatient , and by and by indignant and rebellious .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 47]: About this time a distressed manager discovered Dean on a curb-stone , explained the dilemma to him , took his book away from him , rushed him into the building the back way , and told him to make for the stage and save his country .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 27]: Presently a sudden silence fell upon the grumbling audience , and everybody 's eyes sought a single point -- the wide , empty , carpetless stage .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 15]: A figure appeared there whose aspect was familiar to hardly a dozen persons present .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 127]: It was the scarecrow Dean -- in foxy shoes , down at the heels ; socks of odd colors , also ` down ; ' damaged trousers , relics of antiquity , and a world too short , exposing some inches of naked ankle ; an unbuttoned vest , also too short , and exposing a zone of soiled and wrinkled linen between it and the waistband ; shirt bosom open ; long black handkerchief , wound round and round the neck like a bandage ; bob-tailed blue coat , reaching down to the small of the back , with sleeves which left four inches of forearm unprotected ; small , stiff-brimmed soldier-cap hung on a corner of the bump of -- whichever bump it was .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 35]: This figure moved gravely out upon the stage and , with sedate and measured step , down to the front , where it paused , and dreamily inspected the house , saying no word .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 34]: The silence of surprise held its own for a moment , then was broken by a just audible ripple of merriment which swept the sea of faces like the wash of a wave .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 9]: The figure remained as before , thoughtfully inspecting .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 9]: Another wave started -- laughter , this time .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 15]: It was followed by another , then a third -- this last one boisterous .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 36]: And now the stranger stepped back one pace , took off his soldier-cap , tossed it into the wing , and began to speak , with deliberation , nobody listening , everybody laughing and whispering .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 21]: The speaker talked on unembarrassed , and presently delivered a shot which went home , and silence and attention resulted .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 177]: He followed it quick and fast , with other telling things ; warmed to his work and began to pour his words out , instead of dripping them ; grew hotter and hotter , and fell to discharging lightnings and thunder -- and now the house began to break into applause , to which the speaker gave no heed , but went hammering straight on ; unwound his black bandage and cast it away , still thundering ; presently discarded the bob tailed coat and flung it aside , firing up higher and higher all the time ; finally flung the vest after the coat ; and then for an untimed period stood there , like another Vesuvius , spouting smoke and flame , lava and ashes , raining pumice-stone and cinders , shaking the moral earth with intellectual crash upon crash , explosion upon explosion , while the mad multitude stood upon their feet in a solid body , answering back with a ceaseless hurricane of cheers , through a thrashing snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 33]: ` When Dean came , ' said Claggett , ` the people thought he was an escaped lunatic ; but when he went , they thought he was an escaped archangel . '
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 46]: Burlington , home of the sparkling Burdette , is another hill city ; and also a beautiful one ; unquestionably so ; a fine and flourishing city , with a population of twenty-five thousand , and belted with busy factories of nearly every imaginable description .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 82]: It was a very sober city , too -- for the moment -- for a most sobering bill was pending ; a bill to forbid the manufacture , exportation , importation , purchase , sale , borrowing , lending , stealing , drinking , smelling , or possession , by conquest , inheritance , intent , accident , or otherwise , in the State of Iowa , of each and every deleterious beverage known to the human race , except water .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 21]: This measure was approved by all the rational people in the State ; but not by the bench of Judges .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 47]: Burlington has the progressive modern city 's full equipment of devices for right and intelligent government ; including a paid fire department , a thing which the great city of New Orleans is without , but still employs that relic of antiquity , the independent system .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 22]: In Burlington , as in all these Upper-River towns , one breathes a go-ahead atmosphere which tastes good in the nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 29]: An opera-house has lately been built there which is in strong contrast with the shabby dens which usually do duty as theaters in cities of Burlington 's size .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 21]: We had not time to go ashore in Muscatine , but had a daylight view of it from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 36]: I lived there awhile , many years ago , but the place , now , had a rather unfamiliar look ; so I suppose it has clear outgrown the town which I used to know .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 23]: In fact , I know it has ; for I remember it as a small place -- which it is n't now .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 48]: But I remember it best for a lunatic who caught me out in the fields , one Sunday , and extracted a butcher-knife from his boot and proposed to carve me up with it , unless I acknowledged him to be the only son of the Devil .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 56]: I tried to compromise on an acknowledgment that he was the only member of the family I had met ; but that did not satisfy him ; he would n't have any half-measures ; I must say he was the sole and only son of the Devil -- he whetted his knife on his boot .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 32]: It did not seem worth while to make trouble about a little thing like that ; so I swung round to his view of the matter and saved my skin whole .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 26]: Shortly afterward , he went to visit his father ; and as he has not turned up since , I trust he is there yet .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 14]: And I remember Muscatine -- still more pleasantly -- for its summer sunsets .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 17]: I have never seen any , on either side of the ocean , that equaled them .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 61]: They used the broad smooth river as a canvas , and painted on it every imaginable dream of color , from the mottled daintinesses and delicacies of the opal , all the way up , through cumulative intensities , to blinding purple and crimson conflagrations which were enchanting to the eye , but sharply tried it at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 14]: All the Upper Mississippi region has these extraordinary sunsets as a familiar spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 23]: It is the true Sunset Land : I am sure no other country can show so good a right to the name .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 10]: The sunrises are also said to be exceedingly fine .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 5]: I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 30]: Chapter 58 On the Upper River THE big towns drop in , thick and fast , now : and between stretch processions of thrifty farms , not desolate solitude .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 38]: Hour by hour , the boat plows deeper and deeper into the great and populous North-west ; and with each successive section of it which is revealed , one 's surprise and respect gather emphasis and increase .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 13]: Such a people , and such achievements as theirs , compel homage .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 66]: This is an independent race who think for themselves , and who are competent to do it , because they are educated and enlightened ; they read , they keep abreast of the best and newest thought , they fortify every weak place in their land with a school , a college , a library , and a newspaper ; and they live under law .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 14]: Solicitude for the future of a race like this is not in order .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 19]: This region is new ; so new that it may be said to be still in its babyhood .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 24]: By what it has accomplished while still teething , one may forecast what marvels it will do in the strength of its maturity .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 21]: It is so new that the foreign tourist has not heard of it yet ; and has not visited it .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 49]: For sixty years , the foreign tourist has steamed up and down the river between St. Louis and New Orleans , and then gone home and written his book , believing he had seen all of the river that was worth seeing or that had anything to see .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 37]: In not six of all these books is there mention of these Upper River towns -- for the reason that the five or six tourists who penetrated this region did it before these towns were projected .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 29]: The latest tourist of them all -LRB- 1878 -RRB- made the same old regulation trip -- he had not heard that there was anything north of St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 4]: Yet there was .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 25]: There was this amazing region , bristling with great towns , projected day before yesterday , so to speak , and built next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 13]: A score of them number from fifteen hundred to five thousand people .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 58]: Then we have Muscatine , ten thousand ; Winona , ten thousand ; Moline , ten thousand ; Rock Island , twelve thousand ; La Crosse , twelve thousand ; Burlington , twenty-five thousand ; Dubuque , twenty-five thousand ; Davenport , thirty thousand ; St. Paul , fifty-eight thousand , Minneapolis , sixty thousand and upward .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 19]: The foreign tourist has never heard of these ; there is no note of them in his books .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 12]: They have sprung up in the night , while he slept .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 21]: So new is this region , that I , who am comparatively young , am yet older than it is .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 22]: When I was born , St. Paul had a population of three persons , Minneapolis had just a third as many .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 35]: The then population of Minneapolis died two years ago ; and when he died he had seen himself undergo an increase , in forty years , of fifty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine persons .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 7]: He had a frog 's fertility .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 24]: I must explain that the figures set down above , as the population of St. Paul and Minneapolis , are several months old .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 7]: These towns are far larger now .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 23]: In fact , I have just seen a newspaper estimate which gives the former seventy-one thousand , and the latter seventy-eight thousand .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 24]: This book will not reach the public for six or seven months yet ; none of the figures will be worth much then .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 59]: We had a glimpse of Davenport , which is another beautiful city , crowning a hill -- a phrase which applies to all these towns ; for they are all comely , all well built , clean , orderly , pleasant to the eye , and cheering to the spirit ; and they are all situated upon hills .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 9]: Therefore we will give that phrase a rest .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 18]: The Indians have a tradition that Marquette and Joliet camped where Davenport now stands , in 1673 .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 21]: The next white man who camped there , did it about a hundred and seventy years later -- in 1834 .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 13]: Davenport has gathered its thirty thousand people within the past thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 18]: She sends more children to her schools now , than her whole population numbered twenty-three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 52]: She has the usual Upper River quota of factories , newspapers , and institutions of learning ; she has telephones , local telegraphs , an electric alarm , and an admirable paid fire department , consisting of six hook and ladder companies , four steam fire engines , and thirty churches .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 13]: Davenport is the official residence of two bishops -- Episcopal and Catholic .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 20]: Opposite Davenport is the flourishing town of Rock Island , which lies at the foot of the Upper Rapids .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 28]: A great railroad bridge connects the two towns -- one of the thirteen which fret the Mississippi and the pilots , between St. Louis and St. Paul .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 51]: The charming island of Rock Island , three miles long and half a mile wide , belongs to the United States , and the Government has turned it into a wonderful park , enhancing its natural attractions by art , and threading its fine forests with many miles of drives .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 30]: Near the center of the island one catches glimpses , through the trees , of ten vast stone four-story buildings , each of which covers an acre of ground .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 18]: These are the Government workshops ; for the Rock Island establishment is a national armory and arsenal .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 55]: We move up the river -- always through enchanting scenery , there being no other kind on the Upper Mississippi -- and pass Moline , a center of vast manufacturing industries ; and Clinton and Lyons , great lumber centers ; and presently reach Dubuque , which is situated in a rich mineral region .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 12]: The lead mines are very productive , and of wide extent .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 23]: Dubuque has a great number of manufacturing establishments ; among them a plow factory which has for customers all Christendom in general .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 18]: At least so I was told by an agent of the concern who was on the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 59]: He said -- ` You show me any country under the sun where they really know how to plow , and if I do n't show you our mark on the plow they use , I 'll eat that plow ; and I wo n't ask for any Woostershyre sauce to flavor it up with , either . '
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 14]: All this part of the river is rich in Indian history and traditions .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 18]: Black Hawk 's was once a puissant name hereabouts ; as was Keokuk 's , further down .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 69]: A few miles below Dubuque is the Tete de Mort -- Death 's - head rock , or bluff -- to the top of which the French drove a band of Indians , in early times , and cooped them up there , with death for a certainty , and only the manner of it matter of choice -- to starve , or jump off and kill themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 69]: Black Hawk adopted the ways of the white people , toward the end of his life ; and when he died he was buried , near Des Moines , in Christian fashion , modified by Indian custom ; that is to say , clothed in a Christian military uniform , and with a Christian cane in his hand , but deposited in the grave in a sitting posture .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 12]: Formerly , a horse had always been buried with a chief .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 26]: The substitution of the cane shows that Black Hawk 's haughty nature was really humbled , and he expected to walk when he got over .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 25]: We noticed that above Dubuque the water of the Mississippi was olive-green -- rich and beautiful and semi-transparent , with the sun on it .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 46]: Of course the water was nowhere as clear or of as fine a complexion as it is in some other seasons of the year ; for now it was at flood stage , and therefore dimmed and blurred by the mud manufactured from caving banks .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 32]: The majestic bluffs that overlook the river , along through this region , charm one with the grace and variety of their forms , and the soft beauty of their adornment .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 47]: The steep verdant slope , whose base is at the water 's edge is topped by a lofty rampart of broken , turreted rocks , which are exquisitely rich and mellow in color -- mainly dark browns and dull greens , but splashed with other tints .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 65]: And then you have the shining river , winding here and there and yonder , its sweep interrupted at intervals by clusters of wooded islands threaded by silver channels ; and you have glimpses of distant villages , asleep upon capes ; and of stealthy rafts slipping along in the shade of the forest walls ; and of white steamers vanishing around remote points .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 28]: And it is all as tranquil and reposeful as dreamland , and has nothing this-worldly about it -- nothing to hang a fret or a worry upon .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 89]: Until the unholy train comes tearing along -- which it presently does , ripping the sacred solitude to rags and tatters with its devil 's warwhoop and the roar and thunder of its rushing wheels -- and straightway you are back in this world , and with one of its frets ready to hand for your entertainment : for you remember that this is the very road whose stock always goes down after you buy it , and always goes up again as soon as you sell it .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 24]: It makes me shudder to this day , to remember that I once came near not getting rid of my stock at all .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 15]: It must be an awful thing to have a railroad left on your hands .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 26]: The locomotive is in sight from the deck of the steamboat almost the whole way from St. Louis to St. Paul -- eight hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 10]: These railroads have made havoc with the steamboat commerce .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 15]: The clerk of our boat was a steamboat clerk before these roads were built .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 56]: In that day the influx of population was so great , and the freight business so heavy , that the boats were not able to keep up with the demands made upon their carrying capacity ; consequently the captains were very independent and airy -- pretty ` biggity , ' as Uncle Remus would say .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 76]: The clerk nut-shelled the contrast between the former time and the present , thus -- ` Boat used to land -- captain on hurricane roof -- mighty stiff and straight -- iron ramrod for a spine -- kid gloves , plug tile , hair parted behind -- man on shore takes off hat and says -- ' `` Got twenty-eight tons of wheat , cap'n -- be great favor if you can take them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 23]: ` Captain says -- ' '' 'll take two of them '' -- and do n't even condescend to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 80]: ` But nowadays the captain takes off his old slouch , and smiles all the way around to the back of his ears , and gets off a bow which he has n't got any ramrod to interfere with , and says -- ' `` Glad to see you , Smith , glad to see you -- you 're looking well -- have n't seen you looking so well for years -- what you got for us ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 28]: `` Nuth ` n '' , says Smith ; and keeps his hat on , and just turns his back and goes to talking with somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 23]: ` Oh , yes , eight years ago , the captain was on top ; but it 's Smith 's turn now .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 43]: Eight years ago a boat used to go up the river with every stateroom full , and people piled five and six deep on the cabin floor ; and a solid deck-load of immigrants and harvesters down below , into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 36]: To get a first-class stateroom , you 'd got to prove sixteen quarterings of nobility and four hundred years of descent , or be personally acquainted with the nigger that blacked the captain 's boots .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 55]: But it 's all changed now ; plenty staterooms above , no harvesters below -- there 's a patent self-binder now , and they do n't have harvesters any more ; they 've gone where the woodbine twineth -- and they did n't go by steamboat , either ; went by the train . '
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 84]: Up in this region we met massed acres of lumber rafts coming down -- but not floating leisurely along , in the old-fashioned way , manned with joyous and reckless crews of fiddling , song-singing , whiskey-drinking , breakdown-dancing rapscallions ; no , the whole thing was shoved swiftly along by a powerful stern-wheeler , modern fashion , and the small crews were quiet , orderly men , of a sedate business aspect , with not a suggestion of romance about them anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 25]: Along here , somewhere , on a black night , we ran some exceedingly narrow and intricate island-chutes by aid of the electric light .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 61]: Behind was solid blackness -- a crackless bank of it ; ahead , a narrow elbow of water , curving between dense walls of foliage that almost touched our bows on both sides ; and here every individual leaf , and every individual ripple stood out in its natural color , and flooded with a glare as of noonday intensified .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 12]: The effect was strange , and fine , and very striking .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 29]: We passed Prairie du Chien , another of Father Marquette 's camping-places ; and after some hours of progress through varied and beautiful scenery , reached La Crosse .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 39]: Here is a town of twelve or thirteen thousand population , with electric lighted streets , and with blocks of buildings which are stately enough , and also architecturally fine enough , to command respect in any city .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 30]: It is a choice town , and we made satisfactory use of the hour allowed us , in roaming it over , though the weather was rainier than necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 43]: Chapter 59 Legends and Scenery WE added several passengers to our list , at La Crosse ; among others an old gentleman who had come to this north-western region with the early settlers , and was familiar with every part of it .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 7]: Pardonably proud of it , too .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 20]: He said -- ` You 'll find scenery between here and St. Paul that can give the Hudson points .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 88]: You 'll have the Queen 's Bluff -- seven hundred feet high , and just as imposing a spectacle as you can find anywheres ; and Trempeleau Island , which is n't like any other island in America , I believe , for it is a gigantic mountain , with precipitous sides , and is full of Indian traditions , and used to be full of rattlesnakes ; if you catch the sun just right there , you will have a picture that will stay with you .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 23]: And above Winona you 'll have lovely prairies ; and then come the Thousand Islands , too beautiful for anything ; green ?
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 83]: why you never saw foliage so green , nor packed so thick ; it 's like a thousand plush cushions afloat on a looking-glass -- when the water 's still ; and then the monstrous bluffs on both sides of the river -- ragged , rugged , dark-complected -- just the frame that 's wanted ; you always want a strong frame , you know , to throw up the nice points of a delicate picture and make them stand out . '
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 19]: The old gentleman also told us a touching Indian legend or two -- but not very powerful ones .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 99]: After this excursion into history , he came back to the scenery , and described it , detail by detail , from the Thousand Islands to St. Paul ; naming its names with such facility , tripping along his theme with such nimble and confident ease , slamming in a three-ton word , here and there , with such a complacent air of ' t is n't - anything,-I-can-do-it-any-time-I-want-to , and letting off fine surprises of lurid eloquence at such judicious intervals , that I presently began to suspect -- But no matter what I began to suspect .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 54]: Hear him -- ` Ten miles above Winona we come to Fountain City , nestling sweetly at the feet of cliffs that lift their awful fronts , Jovelike , toward the blue depths of heaven , bathing them in virgin atmospheres that have known no other contact save that of angels ' wings .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 76]: ` And next we glide through silver waters , amid lovely and stupendous aspects of nature that attune our hearts to adoring admiration , about twelve miles , and strike Mount Vernon , six hundred feet high , with romantic ruins of a once first-class hotel perched far among the cloud shadows that mottle its dizzy heights -- sole remnant of once-flourishing Mount Vernon , town of early days , now desolate and utterly deserted .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 7]: ` And so we move on .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 39]: Past Chimney Rock we fly -- noble shaft of six hundred feet ; then just before landing at Minnieska our attention is attracted by a most striking promontory rising over five hundred feet -- the ideal mountain pyramid .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 29]: Its conic shape -- thickly-wooded surface girding its sides , and its apex like that of a cone , cause the spectator to wonder at nature 's workings .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 28]: From its dizzy heights superb views of the forests , streams , bluffs , hills and dales below and beyond for miles are brought within its focus .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 28]: What grander river scenery can be conceived , as we gaze upon this enchanting landscape , from the uppermost point of these bluffs upon the valleys below ?
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 44]: The primeval wildness and awful loneliness of these sublime creations of nature and nature 's God , excite feelings of unbounded admiration , and the recollection of which can never be effaced from the memory , as we view them in any direction .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 123]: ` Next we have the Lion 's Head and the Lioness 's Head , carved by nature 's hand , to adorn and dominate the beauteous stream ; and then anon the river widens , and a most charming and magnificent view of the valley before us suddenly bursts upon our vision ; rugged hills , clad with verdant forests from summit to base , level prairie lands , holding in their lap the beautiful Wabasha , City of the Healing Waters , puissant foe of Bright 's disease , and that grandest conception of nature 's works , incomparable Lake Pepin -- these constitute a picture whereon the tourist 's eye may gaze uncounted hours , with rapture unappeased and unappeasable .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 72]: ` And so we glide along ; in due time encountering those majestic domes , the mighty Sugar Loaf , and the sublime Maiden 's Rock -- which latter , romantic superstition has invested with a voice ; and oft-times as the birch canoe glides near , at twilight , the dusky paddler fancies he hears the soft sweet music of the long-departed Winona , darling of Indian song and story .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 159]: ` Then Frontenac looms upon our vision , delightful resort of jaded summer tourists ; then progressive Red Wing ; and Diamond Bluff , impressive and preponderous in its lone sublimity ; then Prescott and the St. Croix ; and anon we see bursting upon us the domes and steeples of St. Paul , giant young chief of the North , marching with seven-league stride in the van of progress , banner-bearer of the highest and newest civilization , carving his beneficent way with the tomahawk of commercial enterprise , sounding the warwhoop of Christian culture , tearing off the reeking scalp of sloth and superstition to plant there the steam-plow and the school-house -- ever in his front stretch arid lawlessness , ignorance , crime , despair ; ever in his wake bloom the jail , the gallows , and the pulpit ; and ever -- ' ` Have you ever traveled with a panorama ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 9]: I have formerly served in that capacity . '
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 5]: My suspicion was confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 9]: ` Do you still travel with it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 13]: ` No , she is laid up till the fall season opens .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 41]: I am helping now to work up the materials for a Tourist 's Guide which the St. Louis and St. Paul Packet Company are going to issue this summer for the benefit of travelers who go by that line . '
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 24]: ` When you were talking of Maiden 's Rock , you spoke of the long-departed Winona , darling of Indian song and story .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 8]: Is she the maiden of the rock ?
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 10]: -- and are the two connected by legend ? '
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 11]: ` Yes , and a very tragic and painful one .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 21]: Perhaps the most celebrated , as well as the most pathetic , of all the legends of the Mississippi . '
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 7]: We asked him to tell it .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 103]: He dropped out of his conversational vein and back into his lecture-gait without an effort , and rolled on as follows -- ' A little distance above Lake City is a famous point known as Maiden 's Rock , which is not only a picturesque spot , but is full of romantic interest from the event which gave it its name , Not many years ago this locality was a favorite resort for the Sioux Indians on account of the fine fishing and hunting to be had there , and large numbers of them were always to be found in this locality .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 18]: Among the families which used to resort here , was one belonging to the tribe of Wabasha .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 24]: We-no-na -LRB- first-born -RRB- was the name of a maiden who had plighted her troth to a lover belonging to the same band .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 22]: But her stern parents had promised her hand to another , a famous warrior , and insisted on her wedding him .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 13]: The day was fixed by her parents , to her great grief .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 24]: She appeared to accede to the proposal and accompany them to the rock , for the purpose of gathering flowers for the feast .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 48]: On reaching the rock , We-no-na ran to its summit and standing on its edge upbraided her parents who were below , for their cruelty , and then singing a death-dirge , threw herself from the precipice and dashed them in pieces on the rock below . '
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 10]: ` Dashed who in pieces -- her parents ? '
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 14]: ` Well , it certainly was a tragic business , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 20]: And moreover , there is a startling kind of dramatic surprise about it which I was not looking for .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 13]: It is a distinct improvement upon the threadbare form of Indian legend .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 37]: There are fifty Lover 's Leaps along the Mississippi from whose summit disappointed Indian girls have jumped , but this is the only jump in the lot hat turned out in the right and satisfactory way .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 6]: What became of Winona ? '
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 103]: ` She was a good deal jarred up and jolted : but she got herself together and disappeared before the coroner reached the fatal spot ; and 't is said she sought and married her true love , and wandered with him to some distant clime , where she lived happy ever after , her gentle spirit mellowed and chastened by the romantic incident which had so early deprived her of the sweet guidance of a mother 's love and a father 's protecting arm , and thrown her , all unfriended , upon the cold charity of a censorious world . '
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 42]: I was glad to hear the lecturer 's description of the scenery , for it assisted my appreciation of what I saw of it , and enabled me to imagine such of it as we lost by the intrusion of night .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 16]: As the lecturer remarked , this whole region is blanketed with Indian tales and traditions .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 30]: But I reminded him that people usually merely mention this fact -- doing it in a way to make a body 's mouth water -- and judiciously stopped there .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 30]: Because the impression left , was that these tales were full of incident and imagination -- a pleasant impression which would be promptly dissipated if the tales were told .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 59]: I showed him a lot of this sort of literature which I had been collecting , and he confessed that it was poor stuff , exceedingly sorry rubbish ; and I ventured to add that the legends which he had himself told us were of this character , with the single exception of the admirable story of Winona .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 90]: He granted these facts , but said that if I would hunt up Mr. Schoolcraft 's book , published near fifty years ago , and now doubtless out of print , I would find some Indian inventions in it that were very far from being barren of incident and imagination ; that the tales in Hiawatha were of this sort , and they came from Schoolcraft 's book ; and that there were others in the same book which Mr. Longfellow could have turned into verse with good effect .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 14]: For instance , there was the legend of ` The Undying Head . '
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 35]: He could not tell it , for many of the details had grown dim in his memory ; but he would recommend me to find it and enlarge my respect for the Indian imagination .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 64]: He said that this tale , and most of the others in the book , were current among the Indians along this part of the Mississippi when he first came here ; and that the contributors to Schoolcraft 's book had got them directly from Indian lips , and had written them down with strict exactness , and without embellishments of their own .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 6]: I have found the book .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 5]: The lecturer was right .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 12]: There are several legends in it which confirm what he said .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 26]: I will offer two of them -- ` The Undying Head , ' and ` Peboan and Seegwun , an Allegory of the Seasons . '
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 45]: The latter is used in Hiawatha ; but it is worth reading in the original form , if only that one may see how effective a genuine poem can be without the helps and graces of poetic measure and rhythm -- PEBOAN AND SEEGWUN .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 18]: An old man was sitting alone in his lodge , by the side of a frozen stream .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 22]: It was the close of winter , and his fire was almost out , He appeared very old and very desolate .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 14]: His locks were white with age , and he trembled in every joint .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 25]: Day after day passed in solitude , and he heard nothing but the sound of the tempest , sweeping before it the new-fallen snow .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 20]: One day , as his fire was just dying , a handsome young man approached and entered his dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 24]: His cheeks were red with the blood of youth , his eyes sparkled with animation , and a smile played upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 9]: He walked with a light and quick step .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 30]: His forehead was bound with a wreath of sweet grass , in place of a warrior 's frontlet , and he carried a bunch of flowers in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 20]: ` Ah , my son , ' said the old man , ' I am happy to see you .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 3]: Come in .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 18]: Come and tell me of your adventures , and what strange lands you have been to see .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 7]: Let us pass the night together .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 16]: I will tell you of my prowess and exploits , and what I can perform .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 13]: You shall do the same , and we will amuse ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 34]: He then drew from his sack a curiously wrought antique pipe , and having filled it with tobacco , rendered mild by a mixture of certain leaves , handed it to his guest .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 11]: When this ceremony was concluded they began to speak . '
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 18]: I blow my breath , ' said the old man , ` and the stream stands still .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 12]: The water becomes stiff and hard as clear stone . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 20]: I breathe , ' said the young man , ` and flowers spring up over the plain . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 18]: I shake my locks , ' retorted the old man , ` and snow covers the land .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 17]: The leaves fall from the trees at my command , and my breath blows them away .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 15]: The birds get up from the water , and fly to a distant land .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 20]: The animals hide themselves from my breath , and the very ground becomes as hard as flint . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 23]: I shake my ringlets , ' rejoined the young man , ` and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 20]: The plants lift up their heads out of the earth , like the eyes of children glistening with delight .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 6]: My voice recalls the birds .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 9]: The warmth of my breath unlocks the streams .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 14]: Music fills the groves wherever I walk , and all nature rejoices . '
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 8]: At length the sun began to rise .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 8]: A gentle warmth came over the place .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 9]: The tongue of the old man became silent .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 14]: The robin and bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 24]: The stream began to murmur by the door , and the fragrance of growing herbs and flowers came softly on the vernal breeze .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 13]: Daylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his entertainer .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 14]: When he looked upon him , he had the icy visage of Peboan .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 7]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- Winter . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 8]: Streams began to flow from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 20]: As the sun increased , he grew less and less in stature , and anon had melted completely away .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 21]: Nothing remained on the place of his lodge-fire but the miskodeed , -LCB- footnote -LSB- The trailing arbutus . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 21]: a small white flower , with a pink border , which is one of the earliest species of northern plants .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 38]: ` The Undying Head ' is a rather long tale , but it makes up in weird conceits , fairy-tale prodigies , variety of incident , and energy of movement , for what it lacks in brevity .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 40]: -LCB- footnote -LSB- See appendix D. -RSB- -RCB- Chapter 60 Speculations and Conclusions WE reached St. Paul , at the head of navigation of the Mississippi , and there our voyage of two thousand miles from New Orleans ended .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 9]: It is about a ten-day trip by steamer .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 9]: It can probably be done quicker by rail .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 33]: I judge so because I know that one may go by rail from St. Louis to Hannibal -- a distance of at least a hundred and twenty miles -- in seven hours .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 13]: This is better than walking ; unless one is in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 64]: The season being far advanced when we were in New Orleans , the roses and magnolia blossoms were falling ; but here in St. Paul it was the snow , In New Orleans we had caught an occasional withering breath from over a crater , apparently ; here in St. Paul we caught a frequent benumbing one from over a glacier , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 7]: But I wander from my theme .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 7]: St. Paul is a wonderful town .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 22]: It is put together in solid blocks of honest brick and stone , and has the air of intending to stay .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 38]: Its post-office was established thirty-six years ago ; and by and by , when the postmaster received a letter , he carried it to Washington , horseback , to inquire what was to be done with it .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 5]: Such is the legend .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 17]: Two frame houses were built that year , and several persons were added to the population .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 78]: A recent number of the leading St. Paul paper , the ` Pioneer Press , ' gives some statistics which furnish a vivid contrast to that old state of things , to wit : Population , autumn of the present year -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , 71,000 ; number of letters handled , first half of the year , 1,209,387 ; number of houses built during three-quarters of the year , 989 ; their cost , $ 3,186,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 17]: The increase of letters over the corresponding six months of last year was fifty per cent .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 14]: Last year the new buildings added to the city cost above $ 4,500,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 14]: St. Paul 's strength lies in her commerce -- I mean his commerce .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 28]: He is a manufacturing city , of course -- all the cities of that region are -- but he is peculiarly strong in the matter of commerce .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 12]: Last year his jobbing trade amounted to upwards of $ 52,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 27]: He has a custom-house , and is building a costly capitol to replace the one recently burned -- for he is the capital of the State .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 36]: He has churches without end ; and not the cheap poor kind , but the kind that the rich Protestant puts up , the kind that the poor Irish ` hired-girl ' delights to erect .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 12]: What a passion for building majestic churches the Irish hired-girl has .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 23]: It is a fine thing for our architecture but too often we enjoy her stately fanes without giving her a grateful thought .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 85]: In fact , instead of reflecting that ` every brick and every stone in this beautiful edifice represents an ache or a pain , and a handful of sweat , and hours of heavy fatigue , contributed by the back and forehead and bones of poverty , ' it is our habit to forget these things entirely , and merely glorify the mighty temple itself , without vouchsafing one praiseful thought to its humble builder , whose rich heart and withered purse it symbolizes .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 9]: This is a land of libraries and schools .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 20]: St. Paul has three public libraries , and they contain , in the aggregate , some forty thousand books .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 23]: He has one hundred and sixteen school-houses , and pays out more than seventy thousand dollars a year in teachers ' salaries .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 51]: There is an unusually fine railway station ; so large is it , in fact , that it seemed somewhat overdone , in the matter of size , at first ; but at the end of a few months it was perceived that the mistake was distinctly the other way .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 7]: The error is to be corrected .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 18]: The town stands on high ground ; it is about seven hundred feet above the sea level .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 18]: It is so high that a wide view of river and lowland is offered from its streets .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 14]: It is a very wonderful town indeed , and is not finished yet .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 55]: All the streets are obstructed with building material , and this is being compacted into houses as fast as possible , to make room for more -- for other people are anxious to build , as soon as they can get the use of the streets to pile up their bricks and stuff in .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 45]: How solemn and beautiful is the thought , that the earliest pioneer of civilization , the van-leader of civilization , is never the steamboat , never the railroad , never the newspaper , never the Sabbath-school , never the missionary -- but always whiskey !
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 5]: Such is the case .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 8]: Look history over ; you will see .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 94]: The missionary comes after the whiskey -- I mean he arrives after the whiskey has arrived ; next comes the poor immigrant , with ax and hoe and rifle ; next , the trader ; next , the miscellaneous rush ; next , the gambler , the desperado , the highwayman , and all their kindred in sin of both sexes ; and next , the smart chap who has bought up an old grant that covers all the land ; this brings the lawyer tribe ; the vigilance committee brings the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 40]: All these interests bring the newspaper ; the newspaper starts up politics and a railroad ; all hands turn to and build a church and a jail -- and behold , civilization is established for ever in the land .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 14]: But whiskey , you see , was the van-leader in this beneficent work .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 4]: It always is .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 30]: It was like a foreigner -- and excusable in a foreigner -- to be ignorant of this great truth , and wander off into astronomy to borrow a symbol .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 24]: But if he had been conversant with the facts , he would have said -- Westward the Jug of Empire takes its way .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 17]: This great van-leader arrived upon the ground which St. Paul now occupies , in June 1837 .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 30]: Yes , at that date , Pierre Parrant , a Canadian , built the first cabin , uncorked his jug , and began to sell whiskey to the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 6]: The result is before us .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 58]: All that I have said of the newness , briskness , swift progress , wealth , intelligence , fine and substantial architecture , and general slash and go , and energy of St. Paul , will apply to his near neighbor , Minneapolis -- with the addition that the latter is the bigger of the two cities .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 34]: These extraordinary towns were ten miles apart , a few months ago , but were growing so fast that they may possibly be joined now , and getting along under a single mayor .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 47]: At any rate , within five years from now there will be at least such a substantial ligament of buildings stretching between them and uniting them that a stranger will not be able to tell where the one Siamese twin leaves off and the other begins .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 26]: Combined , they will then number a population of two hundred and fifty thousand , if they continue to grow as they are now growing .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 36]: Thus , this center of population at the head of Mississippi navigation , will then begin a rivalry as to numbers , with that center of population at the foot of it -- New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 68]: Minneapolis is situated at the falls of St. Anthony , which stretch across the river , fifteen hundred feet , and have a fall of eighty-two feet -- a waterpower which , by art , has been made of inestimable value , business-wise , though somewhat to the damage of the Falls as a spectacle , or as a background against which to get your photograph taken .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 61]: Thirty flouring-mills turn out two million barrels of the very choicest of flour every year ; twenty sawmills produce two hundred million feet of lumber annually ; then there are woolen mills , cotton mills , paper and oil mills ; and sash , nail , furniture , barrel , and other factories , without number , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 26]: The great flouring-mills here and at St. Paul use the ` new process ' and mash the wheat by rolling , instead of grinding it .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 15]: Sixteen railroads meet in Minneapolis , and sixty-five passenger trains arrive and depart daily .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 12]: In this place , as in St. Paul , journalism thrives .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 14]: Here there are three great dailies , ten weeklies , and three monthlies .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 27]: There is a university , with four hundred students -- and , better still , its good efforts are not confined to enlightening the one sex .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 25]: There are sixteen public schools , with buildings which cost $ 500,000 ; there are six thousand pupils and one hundred and twenty-eight teachers .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 13]: There are also seventy churches existing , and a lot more projected .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 24]: The banks aggregate a capital of $ 3,000,000 , and the wholesale jobbing trade of the town amounts to $ 50,000,000 a year .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 36]: Near St. Paul and Minneapolis are several points of interest -- Fort Snelling , a fortress occupying a river-bluff a hundred feet high ; the falls of Minnehaha , White-bear Lake , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 22]: The beautiful falls of Minnehaha are sufficiently celebrated -- they do not need a lift from me , in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 7]: The White-bear Lake is less known .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 25]: It is a lovely sheet of water , and is being utilized as a summer resort by the wealth and fashion of the State .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 32]: It has its club-house , and its hotel , with the modern improvements and conveniences ; its fine summer residences ; and plenty of fishing , hunting , and pleasant drives .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 22]: There are a dozen minor summer resorts around about St. Paul and Minneapolis , but the White-bear Lake is the resort .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 11]: Connected with White-bear Lake is a most idiotic Indian legend .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 22]: I would resist the temptation to print it here , if I could , but the task is beyond my strength .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 17]: The guide-book names the preserver of the legend , and compliments his ` facile pen . '
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 25]: Without further comment or delay then , let us turn the said facile pen loose upon the reader -- A LEGEND OF WHITE-BEAR LAKE .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 45]: Every spring , for perhaps a century , or as long as there has been a nation of red men , an island in the middle of White-bear Lake has been visited by a band of Indians for the purpose of making maple sugar .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 37]: Tradition says that many springs ago , while upon this island , a young warrior loved and wooed the daughter of his chief , and it is said , also , the maiden loved the warrior .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 32]: He had again and again been refused her hand by her parents , the old chief alleging that he was no brave , and his old consort called him a woman !
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 80]: The sun had again set upon the ` sugar-bush , ' and the bright moon rose high in the bright blue heavens , when the young warrior took down his flute and went out alone , once more to sing the story of his love , the mild breeze gently moved the two gay feathers in his head-dress , and as he mounted on the trunk of a leaning tree , the damp snow fell from his feet heavily .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 25]: As he raised his flute to his lips , his blanket slipped from his well-formed shoulders , and lay partly on the snow beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 47]: He began his weird , wild love-song , but soon felt that he was cold , and as he reached back for his blanket , some unseen hand laid it gently on his shoulders ; it was the hand of his love , his guardian angel .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 47]: She took her place beside him , and for the present they were happy ; for the Indian has a heart to love , and in this pride he is as noble as in his own freedom , which makes him the child of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 29]: As the legend runs , a large white-bear , thinking , perhaps , that polar snows and dismal winter weather extended everywhere , took up his journey southward .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 34]: He at length approached the northern shore of the lake which now bears his name , walked down the bank and made his way noiselessly through the deep heavy snow toward the island .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 11]: It was the same spring ensuing that the lovers met .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 25]: They had left their first retreat , and were now seated among the branches of a large elm which hung far over the lake .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 16]: -LRB- The same tree is still standing , and excites universal curiosity and interest . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 87]: For fear of being detected , they talked almost in a whisper , and now , that they might get back to camp in good time and thereby avoid suspicion , they were just rising to return , when the maiden uttered a shriek which was heard at the camp , and bounding toward the young brave , she caught his blanket , but missed the direction of her foot and fell , bearing the blanket with her into the great arms of the ferocious monster .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 20]: Instantly every man , woman , and child of the band were upon the bank , but all unarmed .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 9]: Cries and wailings went up from every mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 7]: What was to be done ' ?
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 33]: In the meantime this white and savage beast held the breathless maiden in his huge grasp , and fondled with his precious prey as if he were used to scenes like this .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 73]: One deafening yell from the lover warrior is heard above the cries of hundreds of his tribe , and dashing away to his wigwam he grasps his faithful knife , returns almost at a single bound to the scene of fear and fright , rushes out along the leaning tree to the spot where his treasure fell , and springing with the fury of a mad panther , pounced upon his prey .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 51]: The animal turned , and with one stroke of his huge paw brought the lovers heart to heart , but the next moment the warrior , with one plunge of the blade of his knife , opened the crimson sluices of death , and the dying bear relaxed his hold .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 55]: That night there was no more sleep for the band or the lovers , and as the young and the old danced about the carcass of the dead monster , the gallant warrior was presented with another plume , and ere another moon had set he had a living treasure added to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 64]: Their children for many years played upon the skin of the white-bear -- from which the lake derives its name -- and the maiden and the brave remembered long the fearful scene and rescue that made them one , for Kis-se-me-pa and Ka-go-ka could never forget their fearful encounter with the huge monster that came so near sending them to the happy hunting-ground .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 6]: It is a perplexing business .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 111]: First , she fell down out of the tree -- she and the blanket ; and the bear caught her and fondled her -- her and the blanket ; then she fell up into the tree again -- leaving the blanket ; meantime the lover goes war-whooping home and comes back ` heeled , ' climbs the tree , jumps down on the bear , the girl jumps down after him -- apparently , for she was up the tree -- resumes her place in the bear 's arms along with the blanket , the lover rams his knife into the bear , and saves -- whom , the blanket ?
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 7]: No -- nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 38]: You get yourself all worked up and excited about that blanket , and then all of a sudden , just when a happy climax seems imminent you are let down flat -- nothing saved but the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 20]: Whereas , one is not interested in the girl ; she is not the prominent feature of the legend .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 29]: Nevertheless , there you are left , and there you must remain ; for if you live a thousand years you will never know who got the blanket .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 13]: A dead man could get up a better legend than this one .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 22]: I do n't mean a fresh dead man either ; I mean a man that 's been dead weeks and weeks .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 40]: We struck the home-trail now , and in a few hours were in that astonishing Chicago -- a city where they are always rubbing the lamp , and fetching up the genii , and contriving and achieving new impossibilities .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 26]: It is hopeless for the occasional visitor to try to keep up with Chicago -- she outgrows his prophecies faster than he can make them .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 22]: She is always a novelty ; for she is never the Chicago you saw when you passed through the last time .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 39]: The Pennsylvania road rushed us to New York without missing schedule time ten minutes anywhere on the route ; and there ended one of the most enjoyable five-thousand-mile journeys I have ever had the good fortune to make .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 16]: APPENDIX A -LRB- FROM THE NEW ORLEANS TIMES DEMOCRAT OF MARCH 29 , 1882 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 41]: VOYAGE OF THE TIMES-DEMOCRAT 'S RELIEF BOAT THROUGH THE INUNDATED REGIONS IT was nine o'clock Thursday morning when the ` Susie ' left the Mississippi and entered Old River , or what is now called the mouth of the Red .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 29]: Ascending on the left , a flood was pouring in through and over the levees on the Chandler plantation , the most northern point in Pointe Coupee parish .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 19]: The water completely covered the place , although the levees had given way but a short time before .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 34]: The stock had been gathered in a large flat-boat , where , without food , as we passed , the animals were huddled together , waiting for a boat to tow them off .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 32]: On the right-hand side of the river is Turnbull 's Island , and on it is a large plantation which formerly was pronounced one of the most fertile in the State .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 25]: The water has hitherto allowed it to go scot-free in usual floods , but now broad sheets of water told only where fields were .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 21]: The top of the protecting levee could be seen here and there , but nearly all of it was submerged .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 39]: The trees have put on a greener foliage since the water has poured in , and the woods look bright and fresh , but this pleasant aspect to the eye is neutralized by the interminable waste of water .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 20]: We pass mile after mile , and it is nothing but trees standing up to their branches in water .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 16]: A water-turkey now and again rises and flies ahead into the long avenue of silence .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 34]: A pirogue sometimes flits from the bushes and crosses the Red River on its way out to the Mississippi , but the sad-faced paddlers never turn their heads to look at our boat .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 17]: The puffing of the boat is music in this gloom , which affects one most curiously .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 30]: It is not the gloom of deep forests or dark caverns , but a peculiar kind of solemn silence and impressive awe that holds one perforce to its recognition .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 16]: We passed two negro families on a raft tied up in the willows this morning .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 23]: They were evidently of the well-to-do class , as they had a supply of meal and three or four hogs with them .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 27]: Their rafts were about twenty feet square , and in front of an improvised shelter earth had been placed , on which they built their fire .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 44]: The current running down the Atchafalaya was very swift , the Mississippi showing a predilection in that direction , which needs only to be seen to enforce the opinion of that river 's desperate endeavors to find a short way to the Gulf .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 34]: Small boats , skiffs , pirogues , etc. , are in great demand , and many have been stolen by piratical negroes , who take them where they will bring the greatest price .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 36]: From what was told me by Mr. C. P. Ferguson , a planter near Red River Landing , whose place has just gone under , there is much suffering in the rear of that place .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 32]: The negroes had given up all thoughts of a crevasse there , as the upper levee had stood so long , and when it did come they were at its mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 22]: On Thursday a number were taken out of trees and off of cabin roofs and brought in , many yet remaining .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 16]: One does not appreciate the sight of earth until he has traveled through a flood .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 30]: At sea one does not expect or look for it , but here , with fluttering leaves , shadowy forest aisles , house-tops barely visible , it is expected .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 16]: In fact a grave-yard , if the mounds were above water , would be appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 20]: The river here is known only because there is an opening in the trees , and that is all .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 29]: It is in width , from Fort Adams on the left bank of the Mississippi to the bank of Rapides Parish , a distance of about sixty miles .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 19]: A large portion of this was under cultivation , particularly along the Mississippi and back of the Red .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 26]: When Red River proper was entered , a strong current was running directly across it , pursuing the same direction as that of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 12]: After a run of some hours , Black River was reached .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 11]: Hardly was it entered before signs of suffering became visible .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 12]: All the willows along the banks were stripped of their leaves .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 28]: One man , whom your correspondent spoke to , said that he had had one hundred and fifty head of cattle and one hundred head of hogs .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 36]: At the first appearance of water he had started to drive them to the high lands of Avoyelles , thirty-five miles off , but he lost fifty head of the beef cattle and sixty hogs .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 14]: Black River is quite picturesque , even if its shores are under water .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 47]: A dense growth of ash , oak , gum , and hickory make the shores almost impenetrable , and where one can get a view down some avenue in the trees , only the dim outlines of distant trunks can be barely distinguished in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 39]: A few miles up this river , the depth of water on the banks was fully eight feet , and on all sides could be seen , still holding against the strong current , the tops of cabins .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 19]: Here and there one overturned was surrounded by drift-wood , forming the nucleus of possibly some future island .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 32]: In order to save coal , as it was impossible to get that fuel at any point to be touched during the expedition , a look-out was kept for a wood-pile .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 38]: On rounding a point a pirogue , skilfully paddled by a youth , shot out , and in its bow was a girl of fifteen , of fair face , beautiful black eyes , and demure manners .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 28]: The boy asked for a paper , which was thrown to him , and the couple pushed their tiny craft out into the swell of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 30]: Presently a little girl , not certainly over twelve years , paddled out in the smallest little canoe and handled it with all the deftness of an old voyageur .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 22]: The little one looked more like an Indian than a white child , and laughed when asked if she were afraid .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 12]: She had been raised in a pirogue and could go anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 29]: She was bound out to pick willow leaves for the stock , and she pointed to a house near by with water three inches deep on the floors .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 35]: At its back door was moored a raft about thirty feet square , with a sort of fence built upon it , and inside of this some sixteen cows and twenty hogs were standing .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 25]: The family did not complain , except on account of losing their stock , and promptly brought a supply of wood in a flat .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 37]: From this point to the Mississippi River , fifteen miles , there is not a spot of earth above water , and to the westward for thirty-five miles there is nothing but the river 's flood .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 24]: Black River had risen during Thursday , the 23rd , 1 -LCB- three-quarters -RCB- inches , and was going up at night still .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 18]: As we progress up the river habitations become more frequent , but are yet still miles apart .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 13]: Nearly all of them are deserted , and the out-houses floated off .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 35]: To add to the gloom , almost every living thing seems to have departed , and not a whistle of a bird nor the bark of the squirrel can be heard in this solitude .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 27]: Sometimes a morose gar will throw his tail aloft and disappear in the river , but beyond this everything is quiet -- the quiet of dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 52]: Down the river floats now a neatly whitewashed hen-house , then a cluster of neatly split fence-rails , or a door and a bloated carcass , solemnly guarded by a pair of buzzards , the only bird to be seen , which feast on the carcass as it bears them along .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 33]: A picture-frame in which there was a cheap lithograph of a soldier on horseback , as it floated on told of some hearth invaded by the water and despoiled of this ornament .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 32]: At dark , as it was not prudent to run , a place alongside the woods was hunted and to a tall gum-tree the boat was made fast for the night .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 39]: A pretty quarter of the moon threw a pleasant light over forest and river , making a picture that would be a delightful piece of landscape study , could an artist only hold it down to his canvas .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 31]: The motion of the engines had ceased , the puffing of the escaping steam was stilled , and the enveloping silence closed upon us , and such silence it was !
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 31]: Usually in a forest at night one can hear the piping of frogs , the hum of insects , or the dropping of limbs ; but here nature was dumb .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 25]: The dark recesses , those aisles into this cathedral , gave forth no sound , and even the ripplings of the current die away .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 16]: At daylight Friday morning all hands were up , and up the Black we started .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 22]: The morning was a beautiful one , and the river , which is remarkably straight , put on its loveliest garb .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 20]: The blossoms of the haw perfumed the air deliciously , and a few birds whistled blithely along the banks .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 15]: The trees were larger , and the forest seemed of older growth than below .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 43]: More fields were passed than nearer the mouth , but the same scene presented itself -- smoke-houses drifting out in the pastures , negro quarters anchored in confusion against some oak , and the modest residence just showing its eaves above water .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 22]: The sun came up in a glory of carmine , and the trees were brilliant in their varied shades of green .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 33]: Not a foot of soil is to be seen anywhere , and the water is apparently growing deeper and deeper , for it reaches up to the branches of the largest trees .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 28]: All along , the bordering willows have been denuded of leaves , showing how long the people have been at work gathering this fodder for their animals .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 17]: An old man in a pirogue was asked how the willow leaves agreed with his cattle .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 50]: He stopped in his work , and with an ominous shake of his head replied : ` Well , sir , it 's enough to keep warmth in their bodies and that 's all we expect , but it 's hard on the hogs , particularly the small ones .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 7]: They is dropping off powerful fast .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 6]: But what can you do ?
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 8]: It 's all we 've got . '
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 45]: At thirty miles above the mouth of Black River the water extends from Natchez on the Mississippi across to the pine hills of Louisiana , a distance of seventy-three miles , and there is hardly a spot that is not ten feet under it .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 13]: The tendency of the current up the Black is toward the west .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 55]: In fact , so much is this the case , the waters of Red River have been driven down from toward the Calcasieu country , and the waters of the Black enter the Red some fifteen miles above the mouth of the former , a thing never before seen by even the oldest steamboatmen .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 13]: The water now in sight of us is entirely from the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 34]: Up to Trinity , or rather Troy , which is but a short distance below , the people have nearly all moved out , those remaining having enough for their present personal needs .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 26]: Their cattle , though , are suffering and dying off quite fast , as the confinement on rafts and the food they get breeds disease .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 25]: After a short stop we started , and soon came to a section where there were many open fields and cabins thickly scattered about .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 8]: Here were seen more pictures of distress .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 21]: On the inside of the houses the inmates had built on boxes a scaffold on which they placed the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 22]: The bed-posts were sawed off on top , as the ceiling was not more than four feet from the improvised floor .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 14]: The buildings looked very insecure , and threatened every moment to float off .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 15]: Near the houses were cattle standing breast high in the water , perfectly impassive .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 17]: They did not move in their places , but stood patiently waiting for help to come .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 20]: The sight was a distressing one , and the poor creatures will be sure to die unless speedily rescued .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 9]: Cattle differ from horses in this peculiar quality .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 36]: A horse , after finding no relief comes , will swim off in search of food , whereas a beef will stand in its tracks until with exhaustion it drops in the water and drowns .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 18]: At half-past twelve o'clock a hail was given from a flat-boat inside the line of the bank .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 12]: Rounding to we ran alongside , and General York stepped aboard .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 29]: He was just then engaged in getting off stock , and welcomed the ` Times-Democrat ' boat heartily , as he said there was much need for her .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 12]: He said that the distress was not exaggerated in the least .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 14]: People were in a condition it was difficult even for one to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 16]: The water was so high there was great danger of their houses being swept away .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 30]: It had already risen so high that it was approaching the eaves , and when it reaches this point there is always imminent risk of their being swept away .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 12]: If this occurs , there will be great loss of life .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 28]: The General spoke of the gallant work of many of the people in their attempts to save their stock , but thought that fully twenty-five per cent .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 3]: had perished .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 36]: Already twenty-five hundred people had received rations from Troy , on Black River , and he had towed out a great many cattle , but a very great quantity remained and were in dire need .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 24]: The water was now eighteen inches higher than in 1874 , and there was no land between Vidalia and the hills of Catahoula .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 19]: At two o'clock the ` Susie ' reached Troy , sixty-five miles above the mouth of Black River .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 22]: Here on the left comes in Little River ; just beyond that the Ouachita , and on the right the Tensas .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 8]: These three rivers form the Black River .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 32]: Troy , or a portion of it , is situated on and around three large Indian mounds , circular in shape , which rise above the present water about twelve feet .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 19]: They are about one hundred and fifty feet in diameter , and are about two hundred yards apart .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 24]: The houses are all built between these mounds , and hence are all flooded to a depth of eighteen inches on their floors .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 22]: These elevations , built by the aborigines , hundreds of years ago , are the only points of refuge for miles .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 22]: When we arrived we found them crowded with stock , all of which was thin and hardly able to stand up .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 16]: They were mixed together , sheep , hogs , horses , mules , and cattle .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 42]: One of these mounds has been used for many years as the grave-yard , and to-day we saw attenuated cows lying against the marble tomb-stones , chewing their cud in contentment , after a meal of corn furnished by General York .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 23]: Here , as below , the remarkable skill of the women and girls in the management of the smaller pirogues was noticed .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 16]: Children were paddling about in these most ticklish crafts with all the nonchalance of adepts .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 15]: General York has put into operation a perfect system in regard to furnishing relief .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 55]: He makes a personal inspection of the place where it is asked , sees what is necessary to be done , and then , having two boats chartered , with flats , sends them promptly to the place , when the cattle are loaded and towed to the pine hills and uplands of Catahoula .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 21]: He has made Troy his headquarters , and to this point boats come for their supply of feed for cattle .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 38]: On the opposite side of Little River , which branches to the left out of Black , and between it and the Ouachita , is situated the town of Trinity , which is hourly threatened with destruction .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 20]: It is much lower than Troy , and the water is eight and nine feet deep in the houses .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 21]: A strong current sweeps through it , and it is remarkable that all of its houses have not gone before .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 24]: The residents of both Troy and Trinity have been cared for , yet some of their stock have to be furnished with food .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 33]: As soon as the ` Susie ' reached Troy , she was turned over to General York , and placed at his disposition to carry out the work of relief more rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 26]: Nearly all her supplies were landed on one of the mounds to lighten her , and she was headed down stream to relieve those below .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 30]: At Tom Hooper 's place , a few miles from Troy , a large flat , with about fifty head of stock on board , was taken in tow .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 11]: The animals were fed , and soon regained some strength .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 13]: To-day we go on Little River , where the suffering is greatest .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 9]: DOWN BLACK RIVER Saturday Evening , March 25 .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 24]: We started down Black River quite early , under the direction of General York , to bring out what stock could be reached .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 34]: Going down river a flat in tow was left in a central locality , and from there men poled her back in the rear of plantations , picking up the animals wherever found .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 28]: In the loft of a gin-house there were seventeen head found , and after a gangway was built they were led down into the flat without difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 32]: Taking a skiff with the General , your reporter was pulled up to a little house of two rooms , in which the water was standing two feet on the floors .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 36]: In one of the large rooms were huddled the horses and cows of the place , while in the other the Widow Taylor and her son were seated on a scaffold raised on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 20]: One or two dug-outs were drifting about in the roam ready to be put in service at any time .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 35]: When the flat was brought up , the side of the house was cut away as the only means of getting the animals out , and the cattle were driven on board the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 41]: General York , in this as in every case , inquired if the family desired to leave , informing them that Major Burke , of ` The Times-Democrat , ' has sent the ` Susie ' up for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 16]: Mrs. Taylor said she thanked Major Burke , but she would try and hold out .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 15]: The remarkable tenacity of the people here to their homes is beyond all comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 33]: Just below , at a point sixteen miles from Troy , information was received that the house of Mr. Tom Ellis was in danger , and his family were all in it .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 12]: We steamed there immediately , and a sad picture was presented .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 37]: Looking out of the half of the window left above water , was Mrs. Ellis , who is in feeble health , whilst at the door were her seven children , the oldest not fourteen years .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 20]: One side of the house was given up to the work animals , some twelve head , besides hogs .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 18]: In the next room the family lived , the water coming within two inches of the bed-rail .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 19]: The stove was below water , and the cooking was done on a fire on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 29]: The house threatened to give way at any moment : one end of it was sinking , and , in fact , the building looked a mere shell .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 71]: As the boat rounded to , Mr. Ellis came out in a dug-out , and General York told him that he had come to his relief ; that ` The Times-Democrat ' boat was at his service , and would remove his family at once to the hills , and on Monday a flat would take out his stock , as , until that time , they would be busy .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 18]: Notwithstanding the deplorable situation himself and family were in , Mr. Ellis did not want to leave .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 19]: He said he thought he would wait until Monday , and take the risk of his house falling .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 20]: The children around the door looked perfectly contented , seeming to care little for the danger they were in .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 9]: These are but two instances of the many .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 36]: After weeks of privation and suffering , people still cling to their houses and leave only when there is not room between the water and the ceiling to build a scaffold on which to stand .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 20]: It seemed to be incomprehensible , yet the love for the old place was stronger than that for safety .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 16]: After leaving the Ellis place , the next spot touched at was the Oswald place .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 36]: Here the flat was towed alongside the gin-house where there were fifteen head standing in water ; and yet , as they stood on scaffolds , their heads were above the top of the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 29]: It was found impossible to get them out without cutting away a portion of the front ; and so axes were brought into requisition and a gap made .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 14]: After much labor the horses and mules were securely placed on the flat .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 27]: At each place we stop there are always three , four , or more dug-outs arriving , bringing information of stock in other places in need .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 49]: Notwithstanding the fact that a great many had driven a part of their stock to the hills some time ago , there yet remains a large quantity , which General York , who is working with indomitable energy , will get landed in the pine hills by Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 30]: All along Black River the ` Susie ' has been visited by scores of planters , whose tales are the repetition of those already heard of suffering and loss .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 36]: An old planter , who has lived on the river since 1844 , said there never was such a rise , and he was satisfied more than one quarter of the stock has been lost .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 27]: Luckily the people cared first for their work stock , and when they could find it horses and mules were housed in a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 39]: The rise which still continues , and was two inches last night , compels them to get them out to the hills ; hence it is that the work of General York is of such a great value .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 30]: From daylight to late at night he is going this way and that , cheering by his kindly words and directing with calm judgment what is to be done .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 19]: One unpleasant story , of a certain merchant in New Orleans , is told all along the river .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 25]: It appears for some years past the planters have been dealing with this individual , and many of them had balances in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 25]: When the overflow came they wrote for coffee , for meal , and , in fact , for such little necessities as were required .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 33]: No response to these letters came , and others were written , and yet these old customers , with plantations under water , were refused even what was necessary to sustain life .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 14]: It is needless to say he is not popular now on Back River .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 28]: The hills spoken of as the place of refuge for the people and stock on Black River are in Catahoula parish , twenty-four miles from Black River .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 43]: After filling the flat with cattle we took on board the family of T. S. Hooper , seven in number , who could not longer remain in their dwelling , and we are now taking them up Little River to the hills .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 13]: THE FLOOD STILL RISING Troy : March 27 , 1882 , noon .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 25]: The flood here is rising about three and a half inches every twenty-four hours , and rains have set in which will increase this .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 26]: General York feels now that our efforts ought to be directed towards saving life , as the increase of the water has jeopardized many houses .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 27]: We intend to go up the Tensas in a few minutes , and then we will return and go down Black River to take off families .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 13]: There is a lack of steam transportation here to meet the emergency .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 30]: The General has three boats chartered , with flats in tow , but the demand for these to tow out stock is greater than they can meet with promptness .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 21]: All are working night and day , and the ` Susie ' hardly stops for more than an hour anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 24]: The rise has placed Trinity in a dangerous plight , and momentarily it is expected that some of the houses will float off .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 13]: Troy is a little higher , yet all are in the water .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 22]: Reports have come in that a woman and child have been washed away below here , and two cabins floated off .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 14]: Their occupants are the same who refused to come off day before yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 11]: One would not believe the utter passiveness of the people .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 30]: As yet no news has been received of the steamer ` Delia , ' which is supposed to be the one sunk in yesterday 's storm on Lake Catahoula .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 11]: She is due here now , but has not arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 22]: Even the mail here is most uncertain , and this I send by skiff to Natchez to get it to you .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 40]: It is impossible to get accurate data as to past crops , etc. , as those who know much about the matter have gone , and those who remain are not well versed in the production of this section .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 21]: General York desires me to say that the amount of rations formerly sent should be duplicated and sent at once .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 23]: It is impossible to make any estimate , for the people are fleeing to the hills , so rapid is the rise .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 24]: The residents here are in a state of commotion that can only be appreciated when seen , and complete demoralization has set in .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 40]: If rations are drawn for any particular section hereabouts , they would not be certain to be distributed , so everything should be sent to Troy as a center , and the General will have it properly disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 28]: He has sent for one hundred tents , and , if all go to the hills who are in motion now , two hundred will be required .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 37]: APPENDIX B THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION THE condition of this rich valley of the Lower Mississippi , immediately after and since the war , constituted one of the disastrous effects of war most to be deplored .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 35]: Fictitious property in slaves was not only righteously destroyed , but very much of the work which had depended upon the slave labor was also destroyed or greatly impaired , especially the levee system .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 37]: It might have been expected by those who have not investigated the subject , that such important improvements as the construction and maintenance of the levees would have been assumed at once by the several States .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 58]: But what can the State do where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent. , and are also under the necessity of pledging their crops in advance even of planting , at these rates , for the privilege of purchasing all of their supplies at 100 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 2]: profit ?
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 40]: It has needed but little attention to make it perfectly obvious that the control of the Mississippi River , if undertaken at all , must be undertaken by the national government , and can not be compassed by States .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 24]: The river must be treated as a unit ; its control can not be compassed under a divided or separate system of administration .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 16]: Neither are the States especially interested competent to combine among themselves for the necessary operations .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 36]: The work must begin far up the river ; at least as far as Cairo , if not beyond ; and must be conducted upon a consistent general plan throughout the course of the river .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 87]: It does not need technical or scientific knowledge to comprehend the elements of the case if one will give a little time and attention to the subject , and when a Mississippi River commission has been constituted , as the existing commission is , of thoroughly able men of different walks in life , may it not be suggested that their verdict in the case should be accepted as conclusive , so far as any a priori theory of construction or control can be considered conclusive ?
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 59]: It should be remembered that upon this board are General Gilmore , General Comstock , and General Suter , of the United States Engineers ; Professor Henry Mitchell -LRB- the most competent authority on the question of hydrography -RRB- , of the United States Coast Survey ; B. B. Harrod , the State Engineer of Louisiana ; Jas .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 25]: B. Eads , whose success with the jetties at New Orleans is a warrant of his competency , and Judge Taylor , of Indiana .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 26]: It would be presumption on the part of any single man , however skilled , to contest the judgment of such a board as this .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 29]: The method of improvement proposed by the commission is at once in accord with the results of engineering experience and with observations of nature where meeting our wants .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 60]: As in nature the growth of trees and their proneness where undermined to fall across the slope and support the bank secures at some points a fair depth of channel and some degree of permanence , so in the project of the engineer the use of timber and brush and the encouragement of forest growth are the main features .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 48]: It is proposed to reduce the width where excessive by brushwood dykes , at first low , but raised higher and higher as the mud of the river settles under their shelter , and finally slope them back at the angle upon which willows will grow freely .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 40]: In this work there are many details connected with the forms of these shelter dykes , their arrangements so as to present a series of settling basins , etc. , a description of which would only complicate the conception .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 48]: Through the larger part of the river works of contraction will not be required , but nearly all the banks on the concave side of the beds must be held against the wear of the stream , and much of the opposite banks defended at critical points .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 35]: The works having in view this conservative object may be generally designated works of revetment ; and these also will be largely of brushwood , woven in continuous carpets , or twined into wire-netting .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 40]: This veneering process has been successfully employed on the Missouri River ; and in some cases they have so covered themselves with sediments , and have become so overgrown with willows , that they may be regarded as permanent .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 36]: In securing these mats rubble-stone is to be used in small quantities , and in some instances the dressed slope between high and low river will have to be more or less paved with stone .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 49]: Any one who has been on the Rhine will have observed operations not unlike those to which we have just referred ; and , indeed , most of the rivers of Europe flowing among their own alluvia have required similar treatment in the interest of navigation and agriculture .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 17]: The levee is the crowning work of bank revetment , although not necessarily in immediate connection .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 24]: It may be set back a short distance from the revetted bank ; but it is , in effect , the requisite parapet .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 68]: The flood river and the low river can not be brought into register , and compelled to unite in the excavation of a single permanent channel , without a complete control of all the stages ; and even the abnormal rise must be provided against , because this would endanger the levee , and once in force behind the works of revetment would tear them also away .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 60]: Under the general principle that the local slope of a river is the result and measure of the resistance of its bed , it is evident that a narrow and deep stream should have less slope , because it has less frictional surface in proportion to capacity ; i.e. , less perimeter in proportion to area of cross section .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 31]: The ultimate effect of levees and revetments confining the floods and bringing all the stages of the river into register is to deepen the channel and let down the slope .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 68]: The first effect of the levees is to raise the surface ; but this , by inducing greater velocity of flow , inevitably causes an enlargement of section , and if this enlargement is prevented from being made at the expense of the banks , the bottom must give way and the form of the waterway be so improved as to admit this flow with less rise .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 75]: The actual experience with levees upon the Mississippi River , with no attempt to hold the banks , has been favorable , and no one can doubt , upon the evidence furnished in the reports of the commission , that if the earliest levees had been accompanied by revetment of banks , and made complete , we should have to-day a river navigable at low water , and an adjacent country safe from inundation .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 71]: Of course it would be illogical to conclude that the constrained river can ever lower its flood slope so as to make levees unnecessary , but it is believed that , by this lateral constraint , the river as a conduit may be so improved in form that even those rare floods which result from the coincident rising of many tributaries will find vent without destroying levees of ordinary height .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 33]: That the actual capacity of a channel through alluvium depends upon its service during floods has been often shown , but this capacity does not include anomalous , but recurrent , floods .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 39]: It is hardly worth while to consider the projects for relieving the Mississippi River floods by creating new outlets , since these sensational propositions have commended themselves only to unthinking minds , and have no support among engineers .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 69]: Were the river bed cast-iron , a resort to openings for surplus waters might be a necessity ; but as the bottom is yielding , and the best form of outlet is a single deep channel , as realizing the least ratio of perimeter to area of cross section , there could not well be a more unphilosophical method of treatment than the multiplication of avenues of escape .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 52]: In the foregoing statement the attempt has been made to condense in as limited a space as the importance of the subject would permit , the general elements of the problem , and the general features of the proposed method of improvement which has been adopted by the Mississippi River Commission .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 60]: The writer can not help feeling that it is somewhat presumptuous on his part to attempt to present the facts relating to an enterprise which calls for the highest scientific skill ; but it is a matter which interests every citizen of the United States , and is one of the methods of reconstruction which ought to be approved .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 39]: It is a war claim which implies no private gain , and no compensation except for one of the cases of destruction incident to war , which may well be repaired by the people of the whole country .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 3]: EDWARD ATKINSON .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 7]: Boston : April 14 , 1882 .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 68]: APPENDIX C RECEPTION OF CAPTAIN BASIL HALL 'S BOOK IN THE UNITED STATES HAVING now arrived nearly at the end of our travels , I am induced , ere I conclude , again to mention what I consider as one of the most remarkable traits in the national character of the Americans ; namely , their exquisite sensitiveness and soreness respecting everything said or written concerning them .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 37]: Of this , perhaps , the most remarkable example I can give is the effect produced on nearly every class of readers by the appearance of Captain Basil Hall 's ` Travels in North America . '
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 55]: In fact , it was a sort of moral earthquake , and the vibration it occasioned through the nerves of the republic , from one corner of the Union to the other , was by no means over when I left the country in July 1831 , a couple of years after the shock .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 26]: I was in Cincinnati when these volumes came out , but it was not till July 1830 , that I procured a copy of them .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 41]: One bookseller to whom I applied told me that he had had a few copies before he understood the nature of the work , but that , after becoming acquainted with it , nothing should induce him to sell another .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 52]: Other persons of his profession must , however , have been less scrupulous ; for the book was read in city , town , village , and hamlet , steamboat , and stage-coach , and a sort of war-whoop was sent forth perfectly unprecedented in my recollection upon any occasion whatever .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 61]: An ardent desire for approbation , and a delicate sensitiveness under censure , have always , I believe , been considered as amiable traits of character ; but the condition into which the appearance of Captain Hall 's work threw the republic shows plainly that these feelings , if carried to excess , produce a weakness which amounts to imbecility .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 24]: It was perfectly astonishing to hear men who , on other subjects , were of some judgment , utter their opinions upon this .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 21]: I never heard of any instance in which the commonsense generally found in national criticism was so overthrown by passion .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 27]: I do not speak of the want of justice , and of fair and liberal interpretation : these , perhaps , were hardly to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 38]: Other nations have been called thin-skinned , but the citizens of the Union have , apparently , no skins at all ; they wince if a breeze blows over them , unless it be tempered with adulation .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 28]: It was not , therefore , very surprising that the acute and forcible observations of a traveler they knew would be listened to should be received testily .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 48]: The extraordinary features of the business were , first , the excess of the rage into which they lashed themselves ; and , secondly , the puerility of the inventions by which they attempted to account for the severity with which they fancied they had been treated .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 62]: Not content with declaring that the volumes contained no word of truth , from beginning to end -LRB- which is an assertion I heard made very nearly as often as they were mentioned -RRB- , the whole country set to work to discover the causes why Captain Hall had visited the United States , and why he had published his book .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 85]: I have heard it said with as much precision and gravity as if the statement had been conveyed by an official report , that Captain Hall had been sent out by the British Government expressly for the purpose of checking the growing admiration of England for the Government of the United States , -- that it was by a commission from the treasury he had come , and that it was only in obedience to orders that he had found anything to object to .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 29]: I do not give this as the gossip of a coterie ; I am persuaded that it is the belief of a very considerable portion of the country .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 43]: So deep is the conviction of this singular people that they can not be seen without being admired , that they will not admit the possibility that any one should honestly and sincerely find aught to disapprove in them or their country .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 83]: The American Reviews are , many of them , I believe , well known in England ; I need not , therefore , quote them here , but I sometimes wondered that they , none of them , ever thought of translating Obadiah 's curse into classic American ; if they had done so , on placing -LRB- he , Basil Hall -RRB- between brackets , instead of -LRB- he , Obadiah -RRB- it would have saved them a world of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 32]: I can hardly describe the curiosity with which I sat down at length to peruse these tremendous volumes ; still less can I do justice to my surprise at their contents .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 19]: To say that I found not one exaggerated statement throughout the work is by no means saying enough .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 25]: It is impossible for any one who knows the country not to see that Captain Hall earnestly sought out things to admire and commend .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 47]: When he praises , it is with evident pleasure ; and when he finds fault , it is with evident reluctance and restraint , excepting where motives purely patriotic urge him to state roundly what it is for the benefit of his country should be known .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 14]: In fact , Captain Hall saw the country to the greatest possible advantage .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 46]: Furnished , of course , with letters of introduction to the most distinguished individuals , and with the still more influential recommendation of his own reputation , he was received in full drawing-room style and state from one end of the Union to the other .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 41]: He saw the country in full dress , and had little or no opportunity of judging of it unhouselled , unanointed , unannealed , with all its imperfections on its head , as I and my family too often had .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 41]: Captain Hall had certainly excellent opportunities of making himself acquainted with the form of the government and the laws ; and of receiving , moreover , the best oral commentary upon them , in conversation with the most distinguished citizens .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 32]: Of these opportunities he made excellent use ; nothing important met his eye which did not receive that sort of analytical attention which an experienced and philosophical traveler alone can give .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 127]: This has made his volumes highly interesting and valuable ; but I am deeply persuaded , that were a man of equal penetration to visit the United States with no other means of becoming acquainted with the national character than the ordinary working-day intercourse of life , he would conceive an infinitely lower idea of the moral atmosphere of the country than Captain Hall appears to have done ; and the internal conviction on my mind is strong , that if Captain Hall had not placed a firm restraint on himself , he must have given expression to far deeper indignation than any he has uttered against many points in the American character , with which he shows from other circumstances that he was well acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 42]: His rule appears to have been to state just so much of the truth as would leave on the mind of his readers a correct impression , at the least cost of pain to the sensitive folks he was writing about .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 40]: He states his own opinions and feelings , and leaves it to be inferred that he has good grounds for adopting them ; but he spares the Americans the bitterness which a detail of the circumstances would have produced .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 51]: If any one chooses to say that some wicked antipathy to twelve millions of strangers is the origin of my opinion , I must bear it ; and were the question one of mere idle speculation , I certainly would not court the abuse I must meet for stating it .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 6]: But it is not so .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 3]: ... . .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 142]: The candor which he expresses , and evidently feels , they mistake for irony , or totally distrust ; his unwillingness to give pain to persons from whom he has received kindness , they scornfully reject as affectation , and although they must know right well , in their own secret hearts , how infinitely more they lay at his mercy than he has chosen to betray ; they pretend , even to themselves , that he has exaggerated the bad points of their character and institutions ; whereas , the truth is , that he has let them off with a degree of tenderness which may be quite suitable for him to exercise , however little merited ; while , at the same time , he has most industriously magnified their merits , whenever he could possibly find anything favorable .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 27]: APPENDIX D THE UNDYING HEAD IN a remote part of the North lived a man and his sister , who had never seen a human being .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 54]: Seldom , if ever , had the man any cause to go from home ; for , as his wants demanded food , he had only to go a little distance from the lodge , and there , in some particular spot , place his arrows , with their barbs in the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 31]: Telling his sister where they had been placed , every morning she would go in search , and never fail of finding each stuck through the heart of a deer .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 15]: She had then only to drag them into the lodge and prepare their food .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 37]: Thus she lived till she attained womanhood , when one day her brother , whose name was Iamo , said to her : ` Sister , the time is at hand when you will be ill .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 5]: Listen to my advice .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 15]: If you do not , it will probably be the cause of my death .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 10]: Take the implements with which we kindle our fires .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 12]: Go some distance from our lodge and build a separate fire .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 17]: When you are in want of food , I will tell you where to find it .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 12]: You must cook for yourself , and I will for myself .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 23]: When you are ill , do not attempt to come near the lodge , or bring any of the utensils you use .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 24]: Be sure always to fasten to your belt the implements you need , for you do not know when the time will come .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 13]: As for myself , I must do the best I can . '
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 12]: His sister promised to obey him in all he had said .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 12]: Shortly after , her brother had cause to go from home .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 11]: She was alone in her lodge , combing her hair .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 27]: She had just untied the belt to which the implements were fastened , when suddenly the event , to which her brother had alluded , occurred .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 15]: She ran out of the lodge , but in her haste forgot the belt .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 11]: Afraid to return , she stood for some time thinking .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 12]: Finally , she decided to enter the lodge and get it .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 25]: For , thought she , my brother is not at home , and I will stay but a moment to catch hold of it .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 4]: She went back .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 21]: Running in suddenly , she caught hold of it , and was coming out when her brother came in sight .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 7]: He knew what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 17]: ` Oh , ' he said , ` did I not tell you to take care .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 8]: But now you have killed me . '
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 22]: She was going on her way , but her brother said to her , ` What can you do there now .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 5]: The accident has happened .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 11]: Go in , and stay where you have always stayed .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 7]: And what will become of you ?
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 6]: You have killed me . '
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 27]: He then laid aside his hunting-dress and accoutrements , and soon after both his feet began to turn black , so that he could not move .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 18]: Still he directed his sister where to place the arrows , that she might always have food .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 26]: The inflammation continued to increase , and had now reached his first rib ; and he said : ` Sister , my end is near .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 8]: You must do as I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 12]: You see my medicine-sack , and my war-club tied to it .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 17]: It contains all my medicines , and my war-plumes , and my paints of all colors .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 15]: As soon as the inflammation reaches my breast , you will take my war-club .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 14]: It has a sharp point , and you will cut off my head .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 26]: When it is free from my body , take it , place its neck in the sack , which you must open at one end .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 9]: Then hang it up in its former place .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 8]: Do not forget my bow and arrows .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 11]: One of the last you will take to procure food .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 23]: The remainder , tie in my sack , and then hang it up , so that I can look towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 14]: Now and then I will speak to you , but not often . '
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 7]: His sister again promised to obey .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 9]: In a little time his breast was affected .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 18]: ` Now , ' said he , ` take the club and strike off my head . '
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 12]: She was afraid , but he told her to muster courage .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 15]: ` Strike , ' said he , and a smile was on his face .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 15]: Mustering all her courage , she gave the blow and cut off the head .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 17]: ` Now , ' said the head , ` place me where I told you . '
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 10]: And fearfully she obeyed it in all its commands .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 38]: Retaining its animation , it looked around the lodge as usual , and it would command its sister to go in such places as it thought would procure for her the flesh of different animals she needed .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 31]: One day the head said : ` The time is not distant when I shall be freed from this situation , and I shall have to undergo many sore evils .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 14]: So the superior manito decrees , and I must bear all patiently . '
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 9]: In this situation we must leave the head .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 20]: In a certain part of the country was a village inhabited by a numerous and warlike band of Indians .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 13]: In this village was a family of ten young men -- brothers .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 19]: It was in the spring of the year that the youngest of these blackened his face and fasted .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 5]: His dreams were propitious .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 32]: Having ended his fast , he went secretly for his brothers at night , so that none in the village could overhear or find out the direction they intended to go .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 13]: Though their drum was heard , yet that was a common occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 33]: Having ended the usual formalities , he told how favorable his dreams were , and that he had called them together to know if they would accompany him in a war excursion .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 6]: They all answered they would .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 27]: The third brother from the eldest , noted for his oddities , coming up with his war-club when his brother had ceased speaking , jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 46]: ` Yes , ' said he , ' I will go , and this will be the way I will treat those I am going to fight ; ' and he struck the post in the center of the lodge , and gave a yell .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 25]: The others spoke to him , saying : ` Slow , slow , Mudjikewis , when you are in other people 's lodges . '
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 5]: So he sat down .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 21]: Then , in turn , they took the drum , and sang their songs , and closed with a feast .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 21]: The youngest told them not to whisper their intention to their wives , but secretly to prepare for their journey .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 14]: They all promised obedience , and Mudjikewis was the first to say so .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 8]: The time for their departure drew near .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 16]: Word was given to assemble on a certain night , when they would depart immediately .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 10]: Mudjikewis was loud in his demands for his moccasins .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 9]: Several times his wife asked him the reason .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 16]: ` Besides , ' said she , ` you have a good pair on . '
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 28]: ` Quick , quick , ' said he , ` since you must know , we are going on a war excursion ; so be quick . '
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 6]: He thus revealed the secret .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 7]: That night they met and started .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 19]: The snow was on the ground , and they traveled all night , lest others should follow them .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 49]: When it was daylight , the leader took snow and made a ball of it , then tossing it into the air , he said : ` It was in this way I saw snow fall in a dream , so that I could not be tracked . '
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 27]: And he told them to keep close to each other for fear of losing themselves , as the snow began to fall in very large flakes .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 15]: Near as they walked , it was with difficulty they could see each other .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 20]: The snow continued falling all that day and the following night , so it was impossible to track them .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 16]: They had now walked for several days , and Mudjikewis was always in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 19]: One day , running suddenly forward , he gave the SAW-SAW-QUAN , -LCB- footnote -LSB- War-whoop . -RSB- -RCB-
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 19]: and struck a tree with his war-club , and it broke into pieces as if struck with lightning .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 24]: ` Brothers , ' said he , ` this will be the way I will serve those we are going to fight . '
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 27]: The leader answered , ` Slow , slow , Mudjikewis , the one I lead you to is not to be thought of so lightly . '
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 12]: Again he fell back and thought to himself : ` What !
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 2]: what !
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 11]: who can this be he is leading us to ? '
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 7]: He felt fearful and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 28]: Day after day they traveled on , till they came to an extensive plain , on the borders of which human bones were bleaching in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 17]: The leader spoke : ` They are the bones of those who have gone before us .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 15]: None has ever yet returned to tell the sad tale of their fate . '
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 15]: Again Mudjikewis became restless , and , running forward , gave the accustomed yell .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 21]: Advancing to a large rock which stood above the ground , he struck it , and it fell to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 23]: ` See , brothers , ' said he , ` thus will I treat those whom we are going to fight . '
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 30]: ` Still , still , ' once more said the leader ; ` he to whom I am leading you is not to be compared to the rock . '
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 29]: Mudjikewis fell back thoughtful , saying to himself : ' I wonder who this can be that he is going to attack ; ' and he was afraid .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 49]: Still they continued to see the remains of former warriors , who had been to the place where they were now going , some of whom had retreated as far back as the place where they first saw the bones , beyond which no one had ever escaped .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 27]: At last they came to a piece of rising ground , from which they plainly distinguished , sleeping on a distant mountain , a mammoth bear .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 21]: The distance between them was very great , but the size of the animal caused him to be plainly seen .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 34]: ` There , ' said the leader , ` it is he to whom I am leading you ; here our troubles will commence , for he is a mishemokwa and a manito .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 30]: It is he who has that we prize so dearly -LRB- i.e. wampum -RRB- , to obtain which , the warriors whose bones we saw , sacrificed their lives .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 9]: You must not be fearful : be manly .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 7]: We shall find him asleep . '
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 15]: Then the leader went forward and touched the belt around the animal 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 14]: ` This , ' said he , ` is what we must get .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 6]: It contains the wampum . '
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 40]: Then they requested the eldest to try and slip the belt over the bear 's head , who appeared to be fast asleep , as he was not in the least disturbed by the attempt to obtain the belt .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 17]: All their efforts were in vain , till it came to the one next the youngest .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 22]: He tried , and the belt moved nearly over the monster 's head , but he could get it no farther .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 16]: Then the youngest one , and the leader , made his attempt , and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 24]: Placing it on the back of the oldest , he said , ` Now we must run , ' and off they started .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 13]: When one became fatigued with its weight , another would relieve him .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 31]: Thus they ran till they had passed the bones of all former warriors , and were some distance beyond , when looking back , they saw the monster slowly rising .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 10]: He stood some time before he missed his wampum .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 39]: Soon they heard his tremendous howl , like distant thunder , slowly filling all the sky ; and then they heard him speak and say , ` Who can it be that has dared to steal my wampum ?
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 22]: earth is not so large but that I can find them ; ' and he descended from the hill in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 13]: As if convulsed , the earth shook with every jump he made .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 7]: Very soon he approached the party .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 27]: They , however , kept the belt , exchanging it from one to another , and encouraging each other ; but he gained on them fast .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 33]: ` Brothers , ' said the leader , ` has never any one of you , when fasting , dreamed of some friendly spirit who would aid you as a guardian ? '
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 5]: A dead silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 34]: ` Well , ' said he , ` fasting , I dreamed of being in danger of instant death , when I saw a small lodge , with smoke curling from its top .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 54]: An old man lived in it , and I dreamed he helped me ; and may it be verified soon , ' he said , running forward and giving the peculiar yell , and a howl as if the sounds came from the depths of his stomach , and what is called CHECAUDUM .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 10]: Getting upon a piece of rising ground , behold !
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 12]: a lodge , with smoke curling from its top , appeared .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 15]: This gave them all new strength , and they ran forward and entered it .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 35]: The leader spoke to the old man who sat in the lodge , saying , ` Nemesho , help us ; we claim your protection , for the great bear will kill us . '
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 15]: ` Sit down and eat , my grandchildren , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 8]: ` Who is a great manito ? '
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 26]: ` There is none but me ; but let me look , ' and he opened the door of the lodge , when , lo !
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 18]: at a little distance he saw the enraged animal coming on , with slow but powerful leaps .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 5]: He closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 51]: ` Yes , ' said he , ` he is indeed a great manito : my grandchildren , you will be the cause of my losing my life ; you asked my protection , and I granted it ; so now , come what may , I will protect you .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 21]: When the bear arrives at the door , you must run out of the other door of the lodge . '
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 23]: Then putting his hand to the side of the lodge where he sat , he brought out a bag which he opened .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 13]: Taking out two small black dogs , he placed them before him .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 54]: ` These are the ones I use when I fight , ' said he ; and he commenced patting with both hands the sides of one of them , and he began to swell out , so that he soon filled the lodge by his bulk ; and he had great strong teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 39]: When he attained his full size he growled , and from that moment , as from instinct , he jumped out at the door and met the bear , who in another leap would have reached the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 5]: A terrible combat ensued .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 11]: The skies rang with the howls of the fierce monsters .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 8]: The remaining dog soon took the field .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 25]: The brothers , at the onset , took the advice of the old man , and escaped through the opposite side of the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 24]: They had not proceeded far before they heard the dying cry of one of the dogs , and soon after of the other .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 28]: ` Well , ' said the leader , ` the old man will share their fate : so run ; he will soon be after us . '
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 33]: They started with fresh vigor , for they had received food from the old man : but very soon the bear came in sight , and again was fast gaining upon them .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 15]: Again the leader asked the brothers if they could do nothing for their safety .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 4]: All were silent .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 11]: The leader , running forward , did as before . '
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 33]: I dreamed , ' he cried , ` that , being in great trouble , an old man helped me who was a manito ; we shall soon see his lodge . '
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 8]: Taking courage , they still went on .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 14]: After going a short distance they saw the lodge of the old manito .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 16]: They entered immediately and claimed his protection , telling him a manito was after them .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 14]: The old man , setting meat before them , said : ` Eat !
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 5]: who is a manito ?
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 24]: there is no manito but me ; there is none whom I fear ; ' and the earth trembled as the monster advanced .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 11]: The old man opened the door and saw him coming .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 22]: He shut it slowly , and said : ` Yes , my grandchildren , you have brought trouble upon me . '
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 29]: Procuring his medicine-sack , he took out his small war-clubs of black stone , and told the young men to run through the other side of the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 25]: As he handled the clubs , they became very large , and the old man stepped out just as the bear reached the door .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 18]: Then striking him with one of the clubs , it broke in pieces ; the bear stumbled .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 19]: Renewing the attempt with the other war-club , that also was broken , but the bear fell senseless .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 28]: Each blow the old man gave him sounded like a clap of thunder , and the howls of the bear ran along till they filled the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 14]: The young men had now run some distance , when they looked back .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 12]: They could see that the bear was recovering from the blows .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 16]: First he moved his paws , and soon they saw him rise on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 23]: The old man shared the fate of the first , for they now heard his cries as he was torn in pieces .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 12]: Again the monster was in pursuit , and fast overtaking them .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 36]: Not yet discouraged , the young men kept on their way ; but the bear was now so close , that the leader once more applied to his brothers , but they could do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 24]: ` Well , ' said he , ` my dreams will soon be exhausted ; after this I have but one more . '
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 11]: He advanced , invoking his guardian spirit to aid him .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 44]: ` Once , ' said he , ' I dreamed that , being sorely pressed , I came to a large lake , on the shore of which was a canoe , partly out of water , having ten paddles all in readiness .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 16]: Do not fear , ' he cried , ` we shall soon get it . '
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 11]: And so it was , even as he had said .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 18]: Coming to the lake , they saw the canoe with ten paddles , and immediately they embarked .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 20]: Scarcely had they reached the center of the lake , when they saw the bear arrive at its borders .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 12]: Lifting himself on his hind legs , he looked all around .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 24]: Then he waded into the water ; then losing his footing he turned back , and commenced making the circuit of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 13]: Meantime the party remained stationary in the center to watch his movements .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 18]: He traveled all around , till at last he came to the place from whence he started .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 21]: Then he commenced drinking up the water , and they saw the current fast setting in towards his open mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 12]: The leader encouraged them to paddle hard for the opposite shore .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 34]: When only a short distance from land , the current had increased so much , that they were drawn back by it , and all their efforts to reach it were in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 14]: Then the leader again spoke , telling them to meet their fates manfully .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 18]: ` Now is the time , Mudjikewis , ' said he , ` to show your prowess .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 30]: Take courage and sit at the bow of the canoe ; and when it approaches his mouth , try what effect your club will have on his head . '
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 29]: He obeyed , and stood ready to give the blow ; while the leader , who steered , directed the canoe for the open mouth of the monster .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 28]: Rapidly advancing , they were just about to enter his mouth , when Mudjikewis struck him a tremendous blow on the head , and gave the SAW-SAW-QUAN .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 17]: The bear 's limbs doubled under him , and he fell , stunned by the blow .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 32]: But before Mudjikewis could renew it , the monster disgorged all the water he had drank , with a force which sent the canoe with great velocity to the opposite shore .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 19]: Instantly leaving the canoe , again they fled , and on they went till they were completely exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 15]: The earth again shook , and soon they saw the monster hard after them .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 9]: Their spirits drooped , and they felt discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 44]: The leader exerted himself , by actions and words , to cheer them up ; and once more he asked them if they thought of nothing , or could do nothing for their rescue ; and , as before , all were silent .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 21]: ` Then , ' he said , ` this is the last time I can apply to my guardian spirit .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 14]: Now , if we do not succeed , our fates are decided . '
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 16]: He ran forward , invoking his spirit with great earnestness , and gave the yell .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 24]: ` We shall soon arrive , ' said he to his brothers , ` at the place where my last guardian spirit dwells .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 7]: In him I place great confidence .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 15]: Do not , do not be afraid , or your limbs will be fear-bound .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 7]: We shall soon reach his lodge .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 8]: Run , run , ' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 45]: Returning now to Iamo , he had passed all the time in the same condition we had left him , the head directing his sister , in order to procure food , where to place the magic arrows , and speaking at long intervals .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 17]: One day the sister saw the eyes of the head brighten , as if with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 5]: At last it spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 24]: ` Oh , sister , ' it said , ` in what a pitiful situation you have been the cause of placing me !
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 22]: Soon , very soon , a party of young men will arrive and apply to me for aid ; but alas !
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 14]: How can I give what I would have done with so much pleasure ?
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 31]: Nevertheless , take two arrows , and place them where you have been in the habit of placing the others , and have meat prepared and cooked before they arrive .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 19]: When you hear them coming and calling on my name , go out and say , `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 10]: it is long ago that an accident befell him .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 8]: I was the cause of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 16]: If they still come near , ask them in , and set meat before them .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 9]: And now you must follow my directions strictly .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 12]: When the bear is near , go out and meet him .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 14]: You will take my medicine-sack , bows and arrows , and my head .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 34]: You must then untie the sack , and spread out before you my paints of all colors , my war-eagle feathers , my tufts of dried hair , and whatever else it contains .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 50]: As the bear approaches , you will take all these articles , one by one , and say to him , `` This is my deceased brother 's paint , '' and so on with all the other articles , throwing each of them as far as you can .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 52]: The virtues contained in them will cause him to totter ; and , to complete his destruction , you will take my head , and that too you will cast as far off as you can , crying aloud , `` See , this is my deceased brother 's head . ''
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 6]: He will then fall senseless .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 19]: By this time the young men will have eaten , and you will call them to your assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 36]: You must then cut the carcass into pieces , yes , into small pieces , and scatter them to the four winds ; for , unless you do this , he will again revive . '
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 11]: She promised that all should be done as he said .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 23]: She had only time to prepare the meat , when the voice of the leader was heard calling upon Iamo for aid .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 12]: The woman went out and said as her brother had directed .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 14]: But the war party being closely pursued , came up to the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 12]: She invited them in , and placed the meat before them .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 11]: While they were eating , they heard the bear approaching .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 17]: Untying the medicine-sack and taking the head , she had all in readiness for his approach .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 40]: When he came up she did as she had been told ; and , before she had expended the paints and feathers , the bear began to totter , but , still advancing , came close to the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 23]: Saying as she was commanded , she then took the head , and cast it as far from her as she could .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 29]: As it rolled along the ground , the blood , excited by the feelings of the head in this terrible scene , gushed from the nose and mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 12]: The bear , tottering , soon fell with a tremendous noise .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 22]: Then she cried for help , and the young men came rushing out , having partially regained their strength and spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 17]: Mudjikewis , stepping up , gave a yell and struck him a blow upon the head .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 37]: This he repeated , till it seemed like a mass of brains , while the others , as quick as possible , cut him into very small pieces , which they then scattered in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 42]: While thus employed , happening to look around where they had thrown the meat , wonderful to behold , they saw starting up and turning off in every direction small black bears , such as are seen at the present day .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 10]: The country was soon overspread with these black animals .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 16]: And it was from this monster that the present race of bears derived their origin .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 12]: Having thus overcome their pursuer , they returned to the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 25]: In the meantime , the woman , gathering the implements she had used , and the head , placed them again in the sack .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 18]: But the head did not speak again , probably from its great exertion to overcome the monster .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 44]: Having spent so much time and traversed so vast a country in their flight , the young men gave up the idea of ever returning to their own country , and game being plenty , they determined to remain where they now were .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 24]: One day they moved off some distance from the lodge for the purpose of hunting , having left the wampum with the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 25]: They were very successful , and amused themselves , as all young men do when alone , by talking and jesting with each other .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 42]: One of them spoke and said , ` We have all this sport to ourselves ; let us go and ask our sister if she will not let us bring the head to this place , as it is still alive .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 15]: It may be pleased to hear us talk , and be in our company .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 10]: In the meantime take food to our sister . '
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 7]: They went and requested the head .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 34]: She told them to take it , and they took it to their hunting-grounds , and tried to amuse it , but only at times did they see its eyes beam with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 17]: One day , while busy in their encampment , they were unexpectedly attacked by unknown Indians .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 23]: The skirmish was long contested and bloody ; many of their foes were slain , but still they were thirty to one .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 11]: The young men fought desperately till they were all killed .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 26]: The attacking party then retreated to a height of ground , to muster their men , and to count the number of missing and slain .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 28]: One of their young men had stayed away , and , in endeavoring to overtake them , came to the place where the head was hung up .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 17]: Seeing that alone retain animation , he eyed it for some time with fear and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 30]: However , he took it down and opened the sack , and was much pleased to see the beautiful feathers , one of which he placed on his head .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 43]: Starting off , it waved gracefully over him till he reached his party , when he threw down the head and sack , and told them how he had found it , and that the sack was full of paints and feathers .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 12]: They all looked at the head and made sport of it .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 44]: Numbers of the young men took the paint and painted themselves , and one of the party took the head by the hair and said -- ` Look , you ugly thing , and see your paints on the faces of warriors . '
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 18]: But the feathers were so beautiful , that numbers of them also placed them on their heads .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 30]: Then again they used all kinds of indignity to the head , for which they were in turn repaid by the death of those who had used the feathers .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 13]: Then the chief commanded them to throw away all except the head .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 22]: ` We will see , ' said he , ` when we get home , what we can do with it .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 11]: We will try to make it shut its eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 40]: When they reached their homes they took it to the council-lodge , and hung it up before the fire , fastening it with raw hide soaked , which would shrink and become tightened by the action of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 22]: ` We will then see , ' they said , ` if we can not make it shut its eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 36]: Meantime , for several days , the sister had been waiting for the young men to bring back the head ; till , at last , getting impatient , she went in search of it .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 20]: The young men she found lying within short distances of each other , dead , and covered with wounds .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 11]: Various other bodies lay scattered in different directions around them .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 16]: She searched for the head and sack , but they were nowhere to be found .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 12]: She raised her voice and wept , and blackened her face .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 21]: Then she walked in different directions , till she came to the place from whence the head had been taken .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 23]: Then she found the magic bow and arrows , where the young men , ignorant of their qualities , had left them .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 32]: She thought to herself that she would find her brother 's head , and came to a piece of rising ground , and there saw some of his paints and feathers .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 18]: These she carefully put up , and hung upon the branch of a tree till her return .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 14]: At dusk she arrived at the first lodge of a very extensive village .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 19]: Here she used a charm , common among Indians when they wish to meet with a kind reception .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 17]: On applying to the old man and woman of the lodge , she was kindly received .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 6]: She made known her errand .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 39]: The old man promised to aid her , and told her the head was hung up before the council-fire , and that the chiefs of the village , with their young men , kept watch over it continually .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 7]: The former are considered as manitoes .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 25]: She said she only wished to see it , and would be satisfied if she could only get to the door of the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 13]: She knew she had not sufficient power to take it by force .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 18]: ` Come with me , ' said the Indian , ' I will take you there . '
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 12]: They went , and they took their seats near the door .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 32]: The council-lodge was filled with warriors , amusing themselves with games , and constantly keeping up a fire to smoke the head , as they said , to make dry meat .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 23]: They saw the head move , and not knowing what to make of it , one spoke and said : ` Ha !

Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 12]: It is beginning to feel the effects of the smoke . '
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 27]: The sister looked up from the door , and her eyes met those of her brother , and tears rolled down the cheeks of the head .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 20]: ` Well , ' said the chief , ' I thought we would make you do something at last .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 26]: look at it -- shedding tears , ' said he to those around him ; and they all laughed and passed their jokes upon it .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 30]: The chief , looking around , and observing the woman , after some time said to the man who came with her : ` Who have you got there ?
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 12]: I have never seen that woman before in our village . '
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 26]: ` Yes , ' replied the man , ` you have seen her ; she is a relation of mine , and seldom goes out .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 21]: She stays at my lodge , and asked me to allow her to come with me to this place . '
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 27]: In the center of the lodge sat one of those young men who are always forward , and fond of boasting and displaying themselves before others .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 30]: ` Why , ' said he , ' I have seen her often , and it is to this lodge I go almost every night to court her . '
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 9]: All the others laughed and continued their games .
