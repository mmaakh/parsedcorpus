Parsing [sent. 1 len. 53]: THE FLIRT BY BOOTH TARKINGTON To SUSANAH THE FLIRT CHAPTER ONE Valentine Corliss walked up Corliss Street the hottest afternoon of that hot August , a year ago , wearing a suit of white serge which attracted a little attention from those observers who were able to observe anything except the heat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 33]: The coat was shaped delicately ; it outlined the wearer , and , fitting him as women 's clothes fit women , suggested an effeminacy not an attribute of the tall Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 35]: The effeminacy belonged all to the tailor , an artist plying far from Corliss Street , for the coat would have encountered a hundred of its fellows at Trouville or Ostende this very day .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 64]: Corliss Street is the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne , the Park Lane , the Fifth Avenue , of Capitol City , that smoky illuminant of our great central levels , but although it esteems itself an established cosmopolitan thoroughfare , it is still provincial enough to be watchful ; and even in its torrid languor took some note of the alien garment .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 27]: Mr. Corliss , treading for the first time in seventeen years the pavements of this namesake of his grandfather , mildly repaid its interest in himself .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 17]: The street , once the most peaceful in the world , he thought , had changed .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 70]: It was still long and straight , still shaded by trees so noble that they were betrothed , here and there , high over the wide white roadway , the shimmering tunnels thus contrived shot with gold and blue ; but its pristine complete restfulness was departed : gasoline had arrived , and a pedestrian , even this August day of heat , must glance two ways before crossing .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 11]: Architectural transformations , as vital , staggered the returned native .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 50]: In his boyhood that posthumously libelled sovereign lady , Anne , had terribly prevailed among the dwellings on this highway ; now , however , there was little left of the jig-saw 's hare-brained ministrations ; but the growing pains of the adolescent city had wrought some madness here .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 52]: There had been a revolution which was a riot ; and , plainly incited by a new outbreak of the colonies , the Goth , the Tudor , and the Tuscan had harried the upper reaches to a turmoil attaining its climax in a howl or two from the Spanish Moor .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 41]: Yet it was a pleasant street in spite of its improvements ; in spite , too , of a long , gray smoke-plume crossing the summer sky and dropping an occasional atomy of coal upon Mr. Corliss 's white coat .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 45]: The green continuous masses of tree-foliage , lawn , and shrubbery were splendidly asserted ; there was a faint wholesome odour from the fine block pavement of the roadway , white , save where the snailish water-wagon laid its long strips of steaming brown .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 36]: Locusts , serenaders of the heat , invisible among the branches , rasped their interminable cadences , competing bitterly with the monotonous chattering of lawn-mowers propelled by glistening black men over the level swards beneath .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 101]: And though porch and terrace were left to vacant wicker chairs and swinging-seats , and to flowers and plants in jars and green boxes , and the people sat unseen -- and , it might be guessed , unclad for exhibition , in the dimmer recesses of their houses -- nevertheless , a summery girl under an alluring parasol now and then prettily trod the sidewalks , and did not altogether suppress an ample consciousness of the white pedestrian 's stalwart grace ; nor was his quick glance too distressingly modest to be aware of these faint but attractive perturbations .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 49]: A few of the oldest houses remained as he remembered them , and there were two or three relics of mansard and cupola days ; but the herd of cast-iron deer that once guarded these lawns , standing sentinel to all true gentry : Whither were they fled ?
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 38]: In his boyhood , one specimen betokened a family of position and affluence ; two , one on each side of the front walk , spoke of a noble opulence ; two and a fountain were overwhelming .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 66]: He wondered in what obscure thickets that once proud herd now grazed ; and then he smiled , as through a leafy opening of shrubbery he caught a glimpse of a last survivor , still loyally alert , the haughty head thrown back in everlasting challenge and one foreleg lifted , standing in a vast and shadowy backyard with a clothesline fastened to its antlers .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 44]: Mr. Corliss remembered that backyard very well : it was an old battlefield whereon he had conquered ; and he wondered if `` the Lindley boys '' still lived there , and if Richard Lindley would hate him now as implacably as then .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 31]: A hundred yards farther on , he paused before a house more familiar to him than any other , and gave it a moment 's whimsical attention , without emotion .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 32]: It was a shabby old brick structure , and it stood among the gayest , the most flamboyant dwellings of all Corliss Street like a bewildered tramp surrounded by carnival maskers .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 37]: It held place full in the course of the fury for demolition and rebuilding , but remained unaltered -- even unrepaired , one might have thought -- since the early seventies , when it was built .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 47]: There was a sagging cornice , and the nauseous brown which the walls had years ago been painted was sooted to a repellent dinge , so cracked and peeled that the haggard red bricks were exposed , like a beggar through the holes in his coat .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 43]: It was one of those houses which are large without being commodious ; its very tall , very narrow windows , with their attenuated , rusty inside shutters , boasting to the passerby of high ceilings but betraying the miserly floor spaces .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 57]: At each side of the front door was a high and cramped bay-window , one of them insanely culminating in a little six-sided tower of slate , and both of them girdled above the basement windows by a narrow porch , which ran across the front of the house and gave access to the shallow vestibule .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 72]: However , a pleasant circumstance modified the gloom of this edifice and assured it a remnant of reserve and dignity in its ill-considered old age : it stood back a fine hundred feet from the highway , and was shielded in part by a friendly group of maple trees and one glorious elm , hoary , robust , and majestic , a veteran of the days when this was forest ground .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 29]: Mr. Corliss concluded his momentary pause by walking up the broken cement path , which was hard beset by plantain-weed and the long grass of the ill-kept lawn .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 41]: Ascending the steps , he was assailed by an odour as of vehement bananas , a diffusion from some painful little chairs standing in the long , high , dim , rather sorrowful hall disclosed beyond the open double doors .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 54]: They were stiff little chairs of an inconsequent , mongrel pattern ; armless , with perforated wooden seats ; legs tortured by the lathe to a semblance of buttons strung on a rod ; and they had that day received a streaky coat of a gilding preparation which exhaled the olfactory vehemence mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 41]: Their present station was temporary , their purpose , as obviously , to dry ; and they were doing some incidental gilding on their own account , leaving blots and splashes and sporadic little round footprints on the hardwood floor .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 47]: The old-fashioned brass bell-handle upon the caller 's right drooped from its socket in a dead fag , but after comprehensive manipulation on the part of the young man , and equal complaint on its own , it was constrained to permit a dim tinkle remotely .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 44]: Somewhere in the interior a woman 's voice , not young , sang a repeated fragment of `` Lead , Kindly Light , '' to the accompaniment of a flapping dust-cloth , sounds which ceased upon a second successful encounter with the bell .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 30]: Ensued a silence , probably to be interpreted as a period of whispered consultation out of range ; a younger voice called softly and urgently , `` Laura ! ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 17]: and a dark-eyed , dark-haired girl of something over twenty made her appearance to Mr. Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 24]: At sight of her he instantly restored a thin gold card-case to the pocket whence he was in the act of removing it .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 49]: She looked at him with only grave , impersonal inquiry ; no appreciative invoice of him was to be detected in her quiet eyes , which may have surprised him , possibly the more because he was aware there was plenty of appreciation in his own kindling glance .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 10]: She was very white and black , this lady .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 91]: Tall , trim , clear , she looked cool in spite of the black winter skirt she wore , an effect helped somewhat , perhaps , by the crisp freshness of her white waist , with its masculine collar and slim black tie , and undoubtedly by the even and lustreless light ivory of her skin , against which the strong black eyebrows and undulated black hair were lined with attractive precision ; but , most of all , that coolness was the emanation of her undisturbed and tranquil eyes .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 28]: They were not phlegmatic : a continuing spark glowed far within them , not ardently , but steadily and inscrutably , like the fixed stars in winter .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 26]: Mr. Valentine Corliss , of Paris and Naples , removed his white-ribboned straw hat and bowed as no one had ever bowed in that doorway .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 36]: This most vivid salutation -- accomplished by adding something to a rather quick inclination of the body from the hips , with the back and neck held straight expressed deference without affecting or inviting cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 22]: It was an elaborate little formality of a kind fancifully called `` foreign , '' and evidently habitual to the performer .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 9]: It produced no outward effect upon the recipient .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 5]: Such self-control is unusual .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 7]: `` Is Mr. Madison at home ?
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: My name is Valentine Corliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 7]: `` He is at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 9]: She indicated an open doorway upon her right .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 8]: `` Will you wait in there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 12]: `` Thank you , '' said Mr. Corliss , passing within .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 33]: `` I shall be -- '' He left the sentence unfinished , for he was already alone , and at liberty to reflect upon the extraordinary coolness of this cool young woman .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 36]: The room , with its closed blinds , was soothingly dark after the riotous sun without , a grateful obscurity which was one of two attractions discovered in it by Mr. Corliss while he waited .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 78]: It was a depressing little chamber , disproportionately high , uncheered by seven chairs -LRB- each of a different family , but all belonging to the same knobby species , and all upholstered a repellent blue -RRB- , a scratched `` inlaid table , '' likewise knobby , and a dangerous looking small sofa -- turbulent furniture , warmly harmonious , however , in a common challenge to the visitor to take comfort in any of it .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 35]: A once-gilt gas chandelier hung from the distant ceiling , with three globes of frosted glass , but undeniable evidence that five were intended ; and two of the three had been severely bitten .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 68]: There was a hostile little coal-grate , making a mouth under a mantel of imitation black marble , behind an old blue-satin fire-screen upon which red cat-tails and an owl over a pond had been roughly embroidered in high relief , this owl motive being the inspiration of innumerable other owls reflected in innumerable other ponds in the formerly silver moonlight with which the walls were papered .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 55]: Corliss thought he remembered that in his boyhood , when it was known as `` the parlour '' -LRB- though he guessed that the Madison family called it `` the reception room , '' now -RRB- this was the place where his aunt received callers who , she justifiably hoped , would not linger .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 24]: Altogether , it struck him that it might be a good test-room for an alienist : no incipient lunacy would remain incipient here .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 60]: There was one incongruity which surprised him -- a wicker waste-paper basket , so nonsensically out of place in this arid cell , where not the wildest hare-brain could picture any one coming to read or write , that he bestowed upon it a particular , frowning attention , and so discovered the second attractive possession of the room .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 22]: A fresh and lovely pink rose , just opening full from the bud , lay in the bottom of the basket .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 26]: There was a rustling somewhere in the house and a murmur , above which a boy 's voice became audible in emphatic but undistinguishable complaint .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: A whispering followed , and a woman exclaimed protestingly , `` Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 16]: And then a startlingly pretty girl came carelessly into the room through the open door .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 46]: She was humming `` Quand I ' Amour Meurt '' in a gay preoccupation , and evidently sought something upon the table in the centre of the room , for she continued her progress toward it several steps before realizing the presence of a visitor .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 45]: She was a year or so younger than the girl who had admitted him , fairer and obviously more plastic , more expressive , more perishable , a great deal more insistently feminine ; though it was to be seen that they were sisters .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 44]: This one had eyes almost as dark as the other 's , but these were not cool ; they were sweet , unrestful , and seeking ; brilliant with a vivacious hunger : and not Diana but huntresses more ardent have such eyes .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 46]: Her hair was much lighter than her sister 's ; it was the colour of dry corn-silk in the sun ; and she was the shorter by a head , rounder everywhere and not so slender ; but no dumpling : she was exquisitely made .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 15]: There was a softness about her : something of velvet , nothing of mush .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 18]: She diffused with her entrance a radiance of gayety and of gentleness ; sunlight ran with her .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 9]: She seemed the incarnation of a caressing smile .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 4]: She was point-device .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 64]: Her close , white skirt hung from a plainly embroidered white waist to a silken instep ; and from the crown of her charming head to the tall heels of her graceful white suede slippers , heels of a sweeter curve than the waist of a violin , she was as modern and lovely as this dingy old house was belated and hideous .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 19]: Mr. Valentine Corliss spared the fraction of a second for another glance at the rose in the waste-basket .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 28]: The girl saw him before she reached the table , gave a little gasp of surprise , and halted with one hand carried prettily to her breast .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 12]: she said impulsively ; `` I _ beg _ your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 47]: I did n't know there was -- I was looking for a book I thought I -- '' She stopped , whelmed with a breath-taking shyness , her eyes , after one quick but condensed encounter with those of Mr. Corliss , falling beneath exquisite lashes .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 40]: Her voice was one to stir all men : it needs not many words for a supremely beautiful `` speaking-voice '' to be recognized for what it is ; and this girl 's was like herself , hauntingly lovely .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 17]: The intelligent young man immediately realized that no one who heard it could ever forget it .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 24]: `` I see , '' she faltered , turning to leave the room ; `` it is n't here -- the book . ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 13]: `` There 's something else of yours here , '' said Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 5]: `` Is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 16]: She paused , hesitating at the door , looking at him over her shoulder uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 7]: `` You dropped this rose . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 19]: He lifted the rose from the waste-basket and repeated the bow he had made at the front door .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 8]: This time it was not altogether wasted .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 4]: `` I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 4]: You lost it .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 6]: It belongs to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 6]: `` Yes -- it does .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 4]: How curious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 4]: she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 12]: `` How curious it happened to be _ there _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 16]: She stepped to take it from him , her eyes upon his in charming astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 27]: `` And how odd that -- '' She stopped ; then said quickly : `` How did you know it was _ my _ rose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 7]: `` Any one would know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 34]: Her expression of surprise was instantaneously merged in a flash of honest pleasure and admiration , such as only an artist may feel in the presence of a little masterpiece by a fellow-craftsman .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 33]: Happily , anticlimax was spared them by the arrival of the person for whom the visitor had asked at the door , and the young man retained the rose in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 83]: Mr. Madison , a shapeless hillock with a large , harassed , red face , evidently suffered from the heat : his gray hair was rumpled back from a damp forehead ; the sleeves of his black alpaca coat were pulled up to the elbow above his uncuffed white shirtsleeves ; and he carried in one mottled hand the ruins of a palm-leaf fan , in the other a balled wet handkerchief which released an aroma of camphor upon the banana-burdened air .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 50]: He bore evidences of inadequate adjustment after a disturbed siesta , but , exercising a mechanical cordiality , preceded himself into the room by a genial half-cough and a hearty , `` Well-well-well , '' as if wishing to indicate a spirit of polite , even excited , hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 20]: `` I expected you might be turning up , after your letter , '' he said , shaking hands .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 7]: `` Well , well , well !
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 7]: I remember you as a boy .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 26]: Would n't have known you , of course ; but I expect you 'll find the town about as much changed as you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 29]: With a father 's blindness to all that is really vital , he concluded his greeting inconsequently : `` Oh , this is my little girl Cora . ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 13]: `` Run along , little girl , '' said the fat father .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 31]: His little girl 's radiant glance at the alert visitor imparted her thorough comprehension of all the old man 's absurdities , which had reached their climax in her dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 30]: Her parting look , falling from Corliss 's face to the waste-basket at his feet , just touched the rose in his hand as she passed through the door .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 40]: CHAPTER TWO Cora paused in the hall at a point about twenty feet from the door , a girlish stratagem frequently of surprising advantage to the practitioner ; but the two men had begun to speak of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 77]: Suffering a momentary disappointment , she went on , stepping silently , and passed through a door at the end of the hall into a large and barren looking dining-room , stiffly and skimpily furnished , but well-lighted , owing to the fact that one end of it had been transformed into a narrow `` conservatory , '' a glass alcove now tenanted by two dried palms and a number of vacant jars and earthen crocks .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 68]: Here her sister sat by an open window , repairing masculine underwear ; and a handsome , shabby , dirty boy of about thirteen sprawled on the floor of the `` conservatory '' unloosing upon its innocent , cracked , old black and white tiles a ghastly family of snakes , owls , and visaged crescent moons , in orange , green , and other loathsome chalks .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 53]: As Cora entered from the hall , a woman of fifty came in at a door opposite , and , a dust-cloth retained under her left arm , an unsheathed weapon ready for emergency , leaned sociably against the door-casing and continued to polish a tablespoon with a bit of powdered chamois-skin .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 50]: She was tall and slightly bent ; and , like the flat , old , silver spoon in her hand , seemed to have been worn thin by use ; yet it was plain that the three young people in the room `` got their looks '' from her .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 26]: Her eyes , if tired , were tolerant and fond ; and her voice held its youth and something of the music of Cora 's .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 7]: `` What is he like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 8]: She addressed the daughter by the window .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 9]: `` Why do n't you ask Coralie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 10]: suggested the sprawling artist , relaxing his hideous labour .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 10]: He pronounced his sister 's name with intense bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 53]: He called it `` Cora - _ lee _ , '' with an implication far from subtle that his sister had at some time thus Gallicized herself , presumably for masculine favour ; and he was pleased to receive tribute to his satire in a flash of dislike from her lovely eyes .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 19]: `` I ask Laura because it was Laura who went to the door , '' Mrs. Madison answered .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 13]: `` I do not ask Cora because Cora has n't seen him .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 9]: Do I satisfy you , Hedrick ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 9]: ` Cora has n't seen him ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 5]: the boy hooted mockingly .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 5]: `` She has n't ?
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 60]: She was peeking out of the library shutters when he came up the front walk , and she would n't let me go to the door ; she told Laura to go , but first she took the library waste-basket and laid one o ' them roses -- '' '' _ Those _ roses , '' said Cora sharply .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 12]: `` He _ will _ hang around the neighbours ' stables .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 14]: I think you ought to do something about it , mother . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 6]: _ Them _ roses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 4]: repeated Hedrick fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 13]: `` One o ' them roses Dick Lindley sent her this morning .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 28]: Laid it in the waste-basket and sneaked it into the reception room for an excuse to go galloping in and -- '' '' ` Galloping ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 5]: said Mrs. Madison gravely .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 41]: `` It was a pretty bum excuse , '' continued the unaffected youth , `` but you bet your life you 'll never beat our Cora - _ lee _ when there 's a person in pants on the premises !
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 5]: It 's sickening . ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 23]: He rose , and performed something like a toe-dance , a supposed imitation of his sister 's mincing approach to the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 12]: `` Oh , dear , I am such a little sweety !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 29]: Here I am all alone just reeking with Browning-and-Tennyson and thinking to myself about such lovely things , and walking around looking for my nice , pretty rose .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 5]: Where can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 11]: Oh heavens , Mister , are _ you _ here ?
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 17]: Oh my , I never , never thought that there was a _ man _ here !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 5]: How you frighten me !
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 9]: See what a shy little thing I am ?
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 13]: You _ do see , do n't _ you , old sweeticums ?
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 8]: Ta , ta , here 's papa .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 13]: Remember me by that rose , 'cause it 's just like me .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 12]: Me and it 's twins , you see , cutie-sugar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 30]: The diabolical boy then concluded with a reversion to the severity of his own manner : `` If she was _ my _ daughter I 'd whip her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 89]: His indignation was left in the air , for the three ladies had instinctively united against him , treacherously including his private feud in the sex-war of the ages : Cora jumped lightly upon the table and sat whistling and polishing the nails of one hand upon the palm of another ; Laura continued to sew without looking up , and Mrs. Madison , conquering a tendency to laugh , preserved a serene countenance and said ruminatively : `` They were all rather queer , the Corlisses . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 25]: Hedrick stared incredulously , baffled ; but men must expect these things , and this was no doubt a helpful item in his education .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 16]: `` I wonder if he wants to sell the house , '' said Mrs. Madison .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 6]: `` I wish he would .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 11]: Anything that would make father get out of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 3]: Cora exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 16]: `` I hope Mr. Corliss will burn it if he does n't sell it . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 10]: `` He might want to live here himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 4]: `` He ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 6]: Cora emitted a derisive outcry .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 18]: Her mother gave her a quick , odd look , in which there was a real alarm .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 9]: `` What is he like , Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 7]: `` Awfully foreign and distinguished ! ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 18]: This brought Hedrick to confront her with a leap as of some wild animal under a lash .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 10]: He landed close to her ; his face awful .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 16]: `` Princely , I should call him , '' said Cora , her enthusiasm undaunted .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 5]: `` Distinctly princely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 7]: `` Princely , '' moaned Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 4]: `` Pe-rin-sley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 4]: `` Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 6]: Mrs. Madison reproved him automatically .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 13]: `` In what way is he ` foreign , ' Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 7]: `` Oh , every way . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 11]: Cora let her glance rest dreamily upon the goaded boy .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 19]: `` He has a splendid head set upon a magnificent torso -- '' '' _ Torso _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 4]: Hedrick whispered hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 14]: `` Tall , a glorious figure -- like a young guardsman 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 34]: Madness was gathering in her brother 's eyes ; and observing it with quiet pleasure , she added : `` One sees immediately he has the grand manner , the bel air . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 4]: Hedrick exploded . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 8]: ` _ Bel air _ ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 21]: he screamed , and began to jump up and down , tossing his arms frantically , and gasping with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 6]: `` Oh , bel air !
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 4]: Oh , blah !
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 5]: ` Henry Esmond ! '
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 8]: Been readin ' ` Henry Esmond ! '
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 10]: Oh , you be-yoo-tiful Cora-Beatrix-a - _ lee _ !
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 3]: Magganifisent torso !
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 6]: Gull_o _ - rious figgi-your !
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 3]: Bel air !
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 4]: Oh , slush !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 6]: Oh , luv-a-ly slush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 11]: He cast himself convulsively upon the floor , full length .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 11]: `` Luv-a-ly , _ luv _ - a-ly slush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 15]: `` He is thirty , I should say , '' continued Cora , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 6]: `` Yes -- about thirty .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 9]: A strong , keen face , rather tanned .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 21]: He 's between fair and dark -- '' Hedrick raised himself to the attitude of the `` Dying Gaul . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 12]: `` And with ` hair slightly silvered at the temples ! '
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 14]: _ Ain _ ' t his hair slightly silvered at the temples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 4]: he cried imploringly .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 19]: `` Oh , sister , in pity 's name let his hair be slightly silvered at the temples ?
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 15]: Only three grains of corn , your Grace ; my children are starving ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 15]: He collapsed again , laid his face upon his extended arms , and writhed .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 11]: `` He has rather wonderful eyes , '' said Cora .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 10]: `` They seem to look right through you . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 17]: `` Slush , slush , luv-a-ly slush , '' came in muffled tones from the floor .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 12]: `` And he wears his clothes so well -- so differently !
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 16]: You feel at once that he 's not a person , but a personage . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 29]: Hedrick sat up , his eyes closed , his features contorted as with agony , and chanted , impromptu : `` Slush , slush , luv-a-ly , slush !
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 16]: Le ` ss all go a-swimmin ' in a dollar 's worth o ' mush .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 24]: Slush in the morning , slush at night , If I do n't get my slush I 'm bound to get tight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 4]: `` Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 25]: `` Altogether I should say that Mr. Valentine Corliss looks as if he lived up to his name , '' Cora went on tranquilly .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 19]: `` Valentine Corliss of Corliss Street -- I think I rather like the sound of that name . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 11]: She let her beautiful voice linger upon it , caressingly .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 5]: `` Valentine Corliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 29]: Hedrick opened his eyes , allowed his countenance to resume its ordinary proportions , and spoke another name slowly and with honeyed thoughtfulness : `` Ray Vilas . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 7]: This was the shot that told .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 10]: Cora sprang down from the table with an exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 22]: Hedrick , subduing elation , added gently , in a mournful whisper : '' _ Poor _ old Dick Lindley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 24]: His efforts to sting his sister were completely successful at last : Cora was visibly agitated , and appealed hotly to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 13]: `` Am I to bear this kind of thing all my life ?
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 13]: Are n't you _ ever _ going to punish his insolence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 6]: `` Hedrick , Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 5]: said Mrs. Madison sadly .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 13]: Cora turned to the girl by the window with a pathetic gesture .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 10]: `` Laura -- '' she said , and hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 11]: Laura Madison looked up into her sister 's troubled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 17]: `` I feel so morbid , '' said Cora , flushing a little and glancing away .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: `` I wish -- '' She stopped .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 16]: The silent Laura set aside her work , rose and went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 18]: Her cheeks , too , had reddened faintly , a circumstance sharply noted by the terrible boy .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 29]: He sat where he was , asprawl , propped by his arms behind him , watching with acute concentration the injured departure of Cora , following her sister .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 24]: At the door , Cora , without pausing , threw him a look over her shoulder : a full-eyed shot of frankest hatred .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 12]: A few moments later , magnificent chords sounded through the house .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 24]: The piano was old , but tuned to the middle of the note , and the keys were swept by a master hand .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 35]: The wires were not hammered ; they were touched knowingly as by the player 's own fingers , and so they sang -- and from out among the chords there stole an errant melody .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 18]: This was not `` piano-playing '' and not a pianist 's triumphant nimbleness -- it was music .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 23]: Art is the language of a heart that knows how to speak , and a heart that knew how was speaking here .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 29]: What it told was something immeasurably wistful , something that might have welled up in the breast of a young girl standing at twilight in an April orchard .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 15]: It was the inexpressible made into sound , an improvisation by a master player .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 10]: `` You hear what she 's up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 9]: said Hedrick , turning his head at last .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 6]: But his mother had departed .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 28]: He again extended himself flat upon the floor , face downward , this time as a necessary preliminary to rising after a manner of his own invention .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 32]: Mysteriously he became higher in the middle , his body slowly forming first a round and then a pointed arch , with forehead , knees , and elbows touching the floor .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 37]: A brilliantly executed manoeuvre closed his Gothic period , set him upright and upon his feet ; then , without ostentation , he proceeded to the kitchen , where he found his mother polishing a sugar-bowl .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 14]: He challenged her with a damnatory gesture in the direction of the music .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 10]: `` You hear what Cora 's up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 39]: Mrs. Madison 's expression was disturbed ; she gave her son a look almost of appeal , and said , gently : `` I believe there 's nothing precisely criminal in her getting Laura to play for her .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 25]: Laura 's playing always soothes her when she feels out of sorts -- and -- you were n't very considerate of her , Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 5]: You upset her . ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 9]: `` Mentioning Ray Vilas , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 7]: `` You were n't kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 5]: `` She deserves it .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 4]: Look at her !
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 15]: _ You _ know why she 's got Laura at the piano now . ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 17]: `` It 's -- it 's because you worried her , '' his mother faltered evasively .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 18]: `` Besides , it is very hot , and Cora is n't as strong as she looks .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 11]: She said she felt morbid and -- '' `` Morbid ?
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 3]: Blah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 5]: interrupted the direct boy .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 15]: `` She 's started after this Corliss man just like she did for Vilas .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 18]: If I was Dick Lindley I would n't stand for Cora 's -- '' `` Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: His mother checked his outburst pleadingly .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 20]: `` Cora has so much harder time than the other girls ; they 're all so much better off .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 20]: They seem to get everything they want , just by asking : nice clothes and jewellery -- and automobiles .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 16]: That seems to make a great difference nowadays ; they all seem to have automobiles .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 23]: We 're so dreadfully poor , and Cora has to struggle so for what good times she -- '' `` Her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 5]: the boy jibed bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 12]: `` I do n't see her doing any particular struggling . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 9]: He waved his hand in a wide gesture .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 9]: `` She takes it _ all _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 6]: `` There , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 36]: the mother said , and , as if feeling the need of placating this harsh judge , continued gently : `` Cora is n't strong , Hedrick , and she does have a hard time .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 21]: Almost every one of the other girls in her set is at the seashore or somewhere having a gay summer .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 36]: You do n't realize , but it 's mortifying to have to be the only one to stay at home , with everybody knowing it 's because your father ca n't afford to send her .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 60]: And this house is so hopeless , '' Mrs. Madison went on , extending her plea hopefully ; `` it 's impossible to make it attractive , but Cora keeps trying and trying : she was all morning on her knees gilding those chairs for the music-room , poor child , and -- '' '' ` Music-room ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 4]: sneered the boy .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 4]: `` Gilt chairs !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 3]: All show-off !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 8]: That 's all she ever thinks about .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 25]: It 's all there is to Cora , just show-off , so she 'll get a string o ' fellows chasin ' after her .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 17]: She 's started for this Corliss just exactly the way she did for Ray Vilas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 4]: `` Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 7]: `` Just look at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 4]: he cried vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 27]: `` Do n't you know she 's tryin ' to make this Corliss think it 's _ her _ playin ' the piano right now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 17]: `` Oh , no -- '' `` Did n't she do that with Ray Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 4]: he demanded quickly .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 30]: `` Was n't that exactly what she did the first time he ever came here -- got Laura to play and made him think it was _ her _ ?
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 5]: Did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 8]: `` Oh -- just in fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 28]: Mrs. Madison 's tone lacked conviction ; she turned , a little confusedly , from the glaring boy and fumbled among the silver on the kitchen table .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 13]: `` Besides -- she told him afterward that it was Laura . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 25]: `` He walked in on her one day when she was battin ' away at the piano herself with her back to the door .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 23]: Then she pretended it had been a joke , and he was so far gone by that time he did n't care .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 13]: He 's crazy , anyway , '' added the youth , casually .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 7]: `` Who is this Corliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 6]: `` He owns this house .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 21]: His family were early settlers and used to be very prominent , but they 're all dead except this one .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 36]: His mother was a widow ; she went abroad to live and took him with her when he was about your age , and I do n't think he 's ever been back since . ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 11]: `` Did he use to live in this house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: `` No ; an aunt of his did .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 13]: She left it to him when she died , two years ago .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 8]: Your father was agent for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 11]: `` You think this Corliss wants to sell it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 14]: `` It 's been for sale all the time he 's owned it .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 14]: That 's why we moved here ; it made the rent low . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 6]: `` Is he rich ? ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 14]: `` They used to have money , but maybe it 's all spent .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 29]: It seemed to me he might want to raise money on the house , because I do n't see any other reason that could bring him back here .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 13]: He 's already mortgaged it pretty heavily , your father told me .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 18]: I do n't -- '' Mrs. Madison paused abruptly , her eyes widening at a dismaying thought .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 21]: `` Oh , I do hope your father will know better than to ask him to stay to dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: Hedrick 's expression became cryptic .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 11]: `` Father wo n't ask him , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 13]: `` But I 'll bet you a thousand dollars he stays ! ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 25]: The mother followed her son 's thought and did not seek to elicit verbal explanation of the certainty which justified so large a venture .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 11]: `` Oh , I hope not , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 23]: `` Sarah 's threatening to leave , anyway ; and she gets so cross if there 's extra cooking on wash-days . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 95]: `` Well , Sarah 'll have to get cross , '' said the boy grimly ; `` and _ I _ 'll have to plug out and go for a quart of brick ice-cream and carry it home in all this heat ; and Laura and you 'll have to stand over the stove with Sarah ; and father 'll have to change his shirt ; and we 'll all have to toil and moil and sweat and suffer while Cora-lee sits out on the front porch and talks toodle-do-dums to her new duke .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 23]: And then she 'll have _ you _ go out and kid him along while -- '' '' _ Hedrick _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 6]: `` Yes , you will !
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 12]: -- while she gets herself all dressed and powdered up again .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 51]: After that , she 'll do her share of the work : she 'll strain her poor back carryin ' Dick Lindley 's flowers down the back stairs and stickin ' 'em in a vase over a hole in the tablecloth that Laura has n't had time to sew up .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 6]: You wait and see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 16]: The gloomy realism of this prophecy was not without effect upon the seer 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 5]: she exclaimed , protestingly .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 8]: `` We really ca n't manage it .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 18]: I 'm sure Cora wo n't want to ask him -- '' `` You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 25]: `` No ; I 'm sure she would n't think of it , but if she does I 'll tell her we ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 8]: We really ca n't , to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 7]: Her son looked pityingly upon her .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 29]: `` She ought to be _ my _ daughter , '' he said , the sinister implication all too plain ; -- `` just about five minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 12]: With that , he effectively closed the interview and left her .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 73]: He returned to his abandoned art labours in the `` conservatory , '' and meditatively perpetrated monstrosities upon the tiles for the next half-hour , at the end of which he concealed his box of chalks , with an anxiety possibly not unwarranted , beneath the sideboard ; and made his way toward the front door , first glancing , unseen , into the kitchen where his mother still pursued the silver .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 34]: He walked through the hall on tiptoe , taking care to step upon the much stained and worn strip of `` Turkish '' carpet , and not upon the more resonant wooden floor .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 7]: The music had ceased long since .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 65]: The open doorway was like a brilliantly painted picture hung upon the darkness of the hall , though its human centre of interest was no startling bit of work , consisting of Mr. Madison pottering aimlessly about the sun-flooded , unkempt lawn , fanning himself , and now and then stooping to pull up one of the thousands of plantain-weeds that beset the grass .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 37]: With him the little spy had no concern ; but from a part of the porch out of sight from the hall came Cora 's exquisite voice and the light and pleasant baritone of the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 11]: Hedrick flattened himself in a corner just inside the door .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 50]: `` I should break any engagement whatsoever if I had one , '' Mr. Corliss was saying with what the eavesdropper considered an offensively `` foreign '' accent and an equally unjustifiable gallantry ; `` but of course I have n't : I am so utterly a stranger here .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 22]: Your mother is immensely hospitable to wish you to ask me , and I 'll be only too glad to stay .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 14]: Perhaps after dinner you 'll be very , very kind and play again ?
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 29]: Of course you know how remarkable such -- '' `` Oh , just improvising , '' Cora tossed off , carelessly , with a deprecatory ripple of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 11]: `` It 's purely with the mood , you see .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 8]: I ca n't make myself do things .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 12]: No ; I fancy I shall not play again today . ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 7]: There was a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 16]: `` Sha n't I fasten that in your buttonhole for you , '' said Cora .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 13]: `` You see how patiently I 've been awaiting the offer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 45]: There was another little silence ; and the listener was able to construct a picture -LRB- possibly in part from an active memory -RRB- of Cora 's delicate hands uplifted to the gentleman 's lapel and Cora 's eyes for a moment likewise uplifted .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 13]: `` Yes , one has moods , '' she said , dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 8]: `` I am _ all _ moods .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 9]: I think you are too , Mr. Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 6]: You _ look _ moody .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 5]: Are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 19]: A horrible grin might have been seen to disfigure the shadow in the corner just within the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 66]: CHAPTER THREE It was cooler outdoors , after dinner , in the dusk of that evening ; nevertheless three members of the Madison family denied themselves the breeze , and , as by a tacitly recognized and habitual house-rule , so disposed themselves as to afford the most agreeable isolation for the younger daughter and the guest , who occupied wicker chairs upon the porch .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 53]: The mother and father sat beneath a hot , gas droplight in the small `` library '' ; Mrs. Madison with an evening newspaper , her husband with `` King Solomon 's Mines '' ; and Laura , after crisply declining an urgent request from Hedrick to play , had disappeared upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 13]: The inimical lad alone was inspired for the ungrateful role of duenna .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 64]: He sat upon the topmost of the porch steps with the air of being permanently implanted ; leaning forward , elbows on knees , cheeks on palms , in a treacherous affectation of profound reverie ; and his back -LRB- all of him that was plainly visible in the hall light -RRB- tauntingly close to a delicate foot which would , God wot !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: willingly have launched him into the darkness beyond .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 18]: It was his dreadful pleasure to understand wholly the itching of that shapely silk and satin foot .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 36]: The gas-light from the hall laid a broad orange path to the steps -- Cora and her companion sat just beyond it , his whiteness gray , and she a pale ethereality in the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 21]: She wore an evening gown that revealed a vague lilac through white , and shimmered upon her like a vapour .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 19]: She was very quiet ; and there was a wan sweetness about her , an exhalation of wistfulness .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 14]: Cora , in the evening , was more like a rose than ever .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 7]: She was fragrant in the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 24]: The spell she cast was an Undine 's : it was not to be thought so exquisite a thing as she could last .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 18]: And who may know how she managed to say what she did in the silence and darkness ?
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 45]: For it was said -- without words , without touch , even without a look -- as plainly as if she had spoken or written the message : `` If I am a rose , I am one to be worn and borne away .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 6]: Are you the man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 41]: With the fall of night , the street they faced had become still , save for an infrequent squawk of irritation on the part of one of the passing automobiles , gadding for the most part silently , like fireflies .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: But after a time a strolling trio of negroes came singing along the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 31]: `` In the evening , by the moonlight , you could hear those banjos ringing ; In the evening , by the moonlight , you could hear those darkies singing .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 28]: How the ole folks would injoy it ; they would sit all night an ' lis-sun , As we sang I-I-N the evening BY-Y-Y the moonlight . '
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 11]: `` Ah , _ that _ takes me back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 3]: exclaimed Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 9]: `` That 's as it used to be .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 8]: I might be a boy again . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 14]: `` And I suppose this old house has many memories for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 5]: said Cora , softly .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: `` Not very many .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 20]: My , old-maid aunt did n't like me overmuch , I believe ; and I was n't here often .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 10]: My mother and I lived far down the street .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 31]: A big apartment-house stands there now , I noticed as I was walking out here this afternoon -- the ` Verema , ' it is called , absurdly enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 15]: `` Ray Vilas lives there , '' volunteered Hedrick , not altering his position .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 4]: `` Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 24]: said the visitor politely , with a casual recollection that the name had been once or twice emphasized by the youth at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: `` I do n't remember Vilas among the old names here . ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 12]: `` It was n't , I guess , '' said Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 11]: `` Ray Vilas has only been here about two years .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 6]: He came from Kentucky . ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 11]: `` A great friend of yours , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 19]: `` He ai n't a boy , '' said Hedrick , and returned to silence without further explanation .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 17]: `` How cool and kind the stars are to-night , '' said Cora , very gently .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 49]: She leaned forward from her chair , extending a white arm along the iron railing of the porch ; bending toward Corliss , and speaking toward him and away from Hedrick in as low a voice as possible , probably entertaining a reasonable hope of not being overheard .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 14]: `` I love things that are cool and kind , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 10]: `` I love things that are cool and strong .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 5]: I love iron . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 9]: She moved her arm caressingly upon the railing .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 9]: `` I love its cool , smooth touch .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 9]: Any strong life must have iron in it .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 7]: I like iron in men . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 9]: She leaned a very little closer to him .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 11]: `` Have you iron in you , Mr. Corliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 32]: At these words the frayed edge of Hedrick 's broad white collar was lifted perceptibly from his coat , as if by a shudder passing over the back and shoulders beneath .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 22]: `` If I have not , '' answered Corliss in a low voice , `` I will have -- now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 10]: `` Tell me about yourself , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 35]: `` Dear lady , '' he began -- and it was an effective beginning , for a sigh of pleasure parted her lips as he spoke -- `` there is nothing interesting to tell .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 9]: I have spent a very commonplace life . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 15]: You should n't call any life commonplace that has escaped _ this _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 15]: The lovely voice was all the richer for the pain that shook it now .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 16]: `` This monotony , this unending desert of ashes , this death in life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 8]: `` This town , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 7]: `` This prison , I mean !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 2]: Everything .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 8]: Tell me what lies outside of it .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 4]: You can . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 9]: `` What makes you think I can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 9]: `` I do n't need to answer that .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 5]: You understand perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 22]: Valentine Corliss drew in his breath with a sound murmurous of delight , and for a time they did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' he said , finally , `` I think I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: `` There are meetings in the desert , '' he went on , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 13]: `` A lonely traveller finds another at a spring , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 13]: `` And sometimes they find that they speak the same language ? ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 35]: His answer came , almost in a whisper : '' ` Even as you and I. ' '' '' ` Even as you and I , ' '' she echoed , even more faintly .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 21]: Cora breathed rapidly in the silence that followed ; she had every appearance of a woman deeply and mysteriously stirred .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 48]: Her companion watched her keenly in the dusk , and whatever the reciprocal symptoms of emotion he may have exhibited , they were far from tumultuous , bearing more likeness to the quiet satisfaction of a good card-player taking what may prove to be a decisive trick .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 18]: After a time she leaned back in her chair again , and began to fan herself slowly .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 16]: `` You have lived in the Orient , have n't you , Mr. Corliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 7]: she said in an ordinary tone .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 4]: `` Not lived .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 8]: I 've been East once or twice .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 12]: I spend a greater part of the year at Posilipo . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 6]: `` Where is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 8]: `` On the fringe of Naples . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: `` Do you live in a hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 8]: A slight surprise sounded in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 8]: `` I have a villa there . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 11]: `` Do you know what that seems to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 19]: Cora asked gravely , after a pause ; then answered herself , after another : `` Like magic .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 8]: Like a strange , beautiful dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 11]: `` Yes , it is beautiful , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 12]: `` Then tell me : What do you do there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 15]: `` I spend a lot of time on the water in a boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 4]: `` Sailing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 17]: `` On sapphires and emeralds and turquoises and rubies , melted and blown into waves . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 10]: `` And you go yachting over that glory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 10]: `` Fishing with my crew -- and loafing . ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 14]: `` But your boat is really a yacht , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 13]: `` Oh , it might be called anything , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 9]: `` And your sailors are Italian fishermen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 12]: Hedrick slew a mosquito upon his temple , smiting himself hard .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 8]: `` No , they 're Chinese ! ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 4]: he muttered hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 9]: `` They 're Neapolitans , '' said Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 10]: `` Do they wear red sashes and earrings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 3]: asked Cora .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 12]: `` One of them wears earrings and a derby hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 8]: she protested , turning to him again .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 7]: `` You do n't tell me .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 14]: You let me cross-question you , but you do n't tell me things !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 5]: Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 10]: I want to know what _ life _ is !
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 26]: I want to know of strange seas , of strange people , of pain and of danger , of great music , of curious thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 8]: What are the Neapolitan women like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 6]: `` They fade early . ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 6]: She leaned closer to him .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 14]: `` Before the fading have you -- have you loved -- many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 44]: `` All the pretty ones I ever saw , '' he answered gayly , but with something in his tone -LRB- as there was in hers -RRB- which implied that all the time they were really talking of things other than those spoken .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 12]: Yet here this secret subject seemed to come near the surface .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 12]: She let him hear a genuine little snap of her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: `` I _ thought _ you were like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 12]: `` Ah , but you were sure to see it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 30]: `` You could ` a ' seen a Neapolitan woman yesterday , Cora , '' said Hedrick , obligingly , `` if you 'd looked out the front window .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 14]: She was working a hurdy-gurdy up and down this neighbourhood all afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 27]: He turned genially to face his sister , and added : `` Ray Vilas used to say there were lots of pretty girls in Lexington . ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: Cora sprang to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 19]: `` You 're not smoking , '' she said to Corliss hurriedly , as upon a sudden discovery .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 9]: `` Let me get you some matches . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 29]: She had entered the house before he could protest , and Hedrick , looking down the hall , was acutely aware that she dived desperately into the library .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 58]: But , however tragic the cry for justice she uttered there , it certainly was not prolonged ; and the almost instantaneous quickness of her reappearance upon the porch , with matches in her hand , made this one of the occasions when her brother had to admit that in her own line Cora was a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 15]: `` So thoughtless of me , '' she said cheerfully , resuming her seat .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 20]: She dropped the matches into Mr. Corliss 's hand with a fleeting touch of her finger-tips upon his palm .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 8]: `` Of course you wanted to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 12]: I ca n't think why I did n't realize it before .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 18]: I must have -- '' A voice called from within , commanding in no , uncertain tones .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 3]: `` Hedrick !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 8]: I should like to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 28]: Hedrick rose , and , looking neither to the right nor , to the left , went stonily into the house , and appeared before the powers .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 5]: `` Call me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 19]: he inquired with the air of cheerful readiness to proceed upon any errand , no matter how difficult .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 7]: Mr. Madison countered diplomacy with gloom .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 11]: `` I do n't know what to do with you .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 10]: Why ca n't you let your sister alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 9]: `` Has Laura been complaining of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 6]: `` Oh , Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 4]: said Mrs. Madison .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 20]: Hedrick himself felt the justice of her reproof : his reference to Laura was poor work , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 17]: He hung his head and began to scrape the carpet with the side of his shoe .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 14]: `` Well , what 'd Cora say I been doing to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 17]: `` You know perfectly well what you 've been doing , '' said Mr. Madison sharply .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 11]: `` Nothing at all ; just sitting on the steps .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 8]: What 'd she _ say _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 14]: His father evidently considered it wiser not to repeat the text of accusation .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 12]: `` You know what you did , '' he said heavily .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 4]: `` Oho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 15]: Hedrick 's eyes became severe , and his sire 's evasively shifted from them .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 15]: `` You keep away from the porch , '' said the father , uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 11]: `` You mean what I said about Ray Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 4]: asked the boy .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 32]: Both parents looked uncomfortable , and Mr. Madison , turning a leaf in his book , gave a mediocre imitation of an austere person resuming his reading after an impertinent interruption .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 13]: `` That 's what you mean , '' said the boy accusingly .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 5]: `` Ray Vilas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 10]: `` Just you keep away from that porch . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 10]: `` Because I happened to mention Ray Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 3]: demanded Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 8]: `` You let your sister alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 16]: `` I got a right to know what she said , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 12]: There was no response , which appeared to satisfy Hedrick perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 24]: Neither parent met his glance ; the mother troubled and the father dogged , while the boy rejoiced sternly in some occult triumph .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 32]: He inflated his scant chest in pomp and hurled at the defeated pair the well-known words : `` I wish she was _ my _ daughter -- about five minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 40]: New sounds from without -- men 's voices in greeting , and a ripple of response from Cora somewhat lacking in enthusiasm -- afforded Mr. Madison unmistakable relief , and an errand upon which to send his deadly offspring .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 13]: Hedrick , after a reconnaissance in the hall , obeyed at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 42]: Closing the library door nonchalantly behind him , he found himself at the foot of a flight of unillumined back stairs , where his manner underwent a swift alteration , for here was an adventure to be gone about with ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 6]: `` Ventre St. Gris ! ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 17]: he muttered hoarsely , and loosened the long rapier in the shabby sheath at his side .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 64]: For , with the closing of the door , he had become a Huguenot gentleman , over forty and a little grizzled perhaps , but modest and unassuming ; wiry , alert , lightning-quick , with a wrist of steel and a heart of gold ; and he was about to ascend the stairs of an unknown house at Blois in total darkness .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 28]: He went up , crouching , ready for anything , without a footfall , not even causing a hideous creak ; and gained the top in safety .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 42]: Here he turned into an obscure passage , and at the end of it beheld , through an open door , a little room in which a dark-eyed lady sat writing in a book by the light of an oil lamp .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 11]: The wary Huguenot remained in the shadow and observed her .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: Laura was writing in an old ledger she had found in the attic , blank and unused .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 20]: She had rebound it herself in heavy gray leather ; and fitted it with a tiny padlock and key .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 17]: She wore the key under her dress upon a very thin silver chain round her neck .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 36]: Upon the first page of the book was written a date , now more than a year past , the month was June -- and beneath it : `` Love came to me to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 8]: Nothing more was written upon that page .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 51]: CHAPTER FOUR Laura , at this writing , looked piquantly unfamiliar to her brother : her eyes were moist and bright ; her cheeks were flushed and as she bent low , intently close to the book , a loosened wavy strand of her dark hair almost touched the page .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 53]: Hedrick had never before seen her wearing an expression so `` becoming '' as the eager and tremulous warmth of this ; though sometimes , at the piano , she would play in a reverie which wrought such glamour about her that even a brother was obliged to consider her rather handsome .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 38]: She looked more than handsome now , so strangely lovely , in fact , that his eyes watered painfully with the protracted struggle to read a little of the writing in her book before she discovered him .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 23]: He gave it up at last , and lounged forward blinking , with the air of finding it sweet to do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 7]: `` Whatch ' writin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: he asked in simple carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 33]: At the first sound of his movement she closed the book in a flash ; then , with a startled , protective gesture , extended her arms over it , covering it .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 8]: `` What is it , Hedrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 5]: she asked , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 8]: `` What 's the padlock for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 7]: `` Nothing , '' she panted .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 8]: `` What is it you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 7]: `` You writin ' poetry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 9]: Laura 's eyes dilated ; she looked dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 25]: `` Oh , I do n't care about your old book , '' said Hedrick , with an amused nonchalance Talleyrand might have admired .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 13]: `` There 's callers , and you have to come down . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 6]: `` Who sent you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 16]: `` A man I 've often noticed around the house , '' he replied blightingly .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 14]: `` You may have seen him -- I think his name 's Madison .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 10]: His wife and he both sent for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 20]: One of Laura 's hands instinctively began to arrange her hair , but the other remained upon the book .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 7]: `` Who is it calling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 9]: `` Richard Lindley and that Wade Trumble . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 11]: Laura rose , standing between her brother and the table .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 9]: `` Tell mother I will come down . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 23]: Hedrick moved a little nearer , whereupon , observing his eye , she put her right hand behind her upon the book .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 19]: She was not deceived , and boys are not only superb strategic actors sometimes , but calamitously quick .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 25]: Appearing to be unaware of her careful defence , he leaned against the wall and crossed his feet in an original and interesting manner .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 13]: `` Of course _ you _ understand , '' he said cosily .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 38]: `` Cora wants to keep this Corliss in a corner of the porch where she can coo at him ; so you and mother 'll have to raise a ballyhoo for Dick Lindley and that Wade Trumble .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 16]: It 'd been funny if Dick had n't noticed anybody was there and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 16]: What on earth does he want to stay engaged to her for , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 16]: `` You do n't know that she is engaged to Mr. Lindley , Hedrick . ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 5]: `` Get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 3]: he hooted .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 11]: `` What 's the use talking like that to me ?
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 48]: A blind mackerel could see she 's let poor old Lindley think he 's High Man with her these last few months ; but he 'll have to hit the pike now , I reckon , 'cause this Corliss is altogether too pe-rin-sley for Dick 's class .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 5]: Lee roy est mort .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 5]: Vive lee roy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 10]: `` Hedrick , wo n't you please run along ?
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 8]: I want to change my dress . ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 4]: `` What for ?
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 13]: There was company for dinner and you did n't change then . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: Laura 's flushed cheeks flushed deeper , and in her confusion she answered too quickly .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 8]: `` I only have one evening gown .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 13]: I -- of course I ca n't wear it every night . ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 24]: `` Well , then , '' he returned triumphantly , `` what do you want to put it on now for ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 12]: _ Please _ run along , Hedrick , '' she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 13]: `` You did n't for this Corliss , '' he persisted sharply .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 42]: `` You know Dick Lindley could n't see anybody but Cora to save his life , and I do n't suppose there 's a girl on earth fool enough to dress up for that Wade Trum -- '' `` Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 29]: Laura 's voice rang with a warning which he remembered to have heard upon a few previous occasions when she had easily proved herself physically stronger than he .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 13]: `` Go and tell mother I 'm coming , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 36]: He began to whistle `` Beulah Land '' as he went , but , with the swift closing of the door behind him , abandoned that pathetically optimistic hymn prematurely , after the third bar .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 70]: Twenty minutes later , when Laura came out and went downstairs , a fine straight figure in her black evening gown , the Sieur de Marsac -- that hard-bitten Huguenot , whose middle-aged shabbiness was but the outward and deceptive seeming of the longest head and the best sword in France -- emerged cautiously from the passageway and stood listening until her footsteps were heard descending the front stairs .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 29]: Nevertheless , the most painstaking search of her room , a search as systematic as it was feverish , failed to reveal where she had hidden the book .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 7]: He returned wearily to the porch .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 84]: A prophet has always been supposed to take some pleasure , perhaps morbid , in seeing his predictions fulfilled ; and it may have been a consolation to the gloomy heart of Hedrick , sorely injured by Laura 's offensive care of her treasure , to find the grouping upon the porch as he had foretold : Cora and Mr. Corliss sitting a little aloof from the others , far enough to permit their holding an indistinct and murmurous conversation of their own .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 42]: Their sequestration , even by so short a distance , gave them an appearance of intimacy which probably accounted for the rather absent greeting bestowed by Mr. Lindley upon the son of the house , who met him with some favour .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 55]: This Richard Lindley was a thin , friendly looking young man with a pleasing , old-fashioned face which suggested that if he were minded to be portrayed it should be by the daguerreotype , and that a high , black stock would have been more suitable to him than his businesslike , modern neck-gear .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 63]: He had fine eyes , which seemed habitually concerned with faraway things , though when he looked at Cora they sparkled ; however , it can not be said that the sparkling continued at its brightest when his glance wandered -LRB- as it not infrequently did this evening -RRB- from her lovely head to the rose in Mr. Corliss 's white coat .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 32]: Hedrick , resuming a position upon the top step between the two groups , found the conversation of the larger annoying because it prevented him from hearing that of the smaller .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 30]: It was carried on for the greater part by his mother and Mr. Trumble ; Laura sat silent between these two ; and Lindley 's mood was obviously contemplative .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 22]: Mr. Wade Trumble , twenty-six , small , earnest , and already beginning to lose his hair , was talkative enough .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 16]: He was one of those people who are so continuously aggressive that they are negligible .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter here ?
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 7]: Nobody pays any attention to me .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 5]: I 'M important ! ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 41]: He might have had that legend engraved on his card , it spoke from everything else that was his : face , voice , gesture -- even from his clothes , for they also clamoured for attention without receiving it .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 38]: Worn by another man , their extravagance of shape and shade might have advertised a self-sacrificing effort for the picturesque ; but upon Mr. Trumble they paradoxically confirmed an impression that he was well off and close .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 20]: Certainly this was the impression confirmed in the mind of the shrewdest and most experienced observer on that veranda .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 27]: The accomplished Valentine Corliss was quite able to share Cora 's detachment satisfactorily , and be very actively aware of other things at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 33]: For instance : Richard Lindley 's preoccupation had neither escaped him nor remained unconnected in his mind with that gentleman 's somewhat attentive notice of the present position of a certain rose .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 74]: Mr. Trumble took up Mrs. Madison 's placid weather talk as if it had been a flaunting challenge ; he made it a matter of conscience and for argument ; for he was a doughty champion , it appeared , when nothings were in question , one of those stern men who will have accuracy in the banal , insisting upon portent in talk meant to be slid over as mere courteous sound .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 17]: `` I do n't know about that , now , '' he said with severe emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 10]: `` I do n't know about that at all .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 9]: I ca n't say I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 34]: In fact , I do not agree with you : it was hotter in the early part of July , year before last , than it has been at any time this summer .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 8]: Several degrees hotter -- several degrees . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 25]: `` I fear I must beg to differ with you , '' he said , catching the poor lady again , a moment later .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 7]: `` I beg to differ decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 9]: Other places get a great deal more heat .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 5]: Look at Egypt . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 21]: `` Permit me to disagree , '' he interrupted her at once , when she pathetically squirmed to another subject .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 11]: `` There 's more than one side to this matter .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 50]: You are looking at this matter from a totally wrong angle ... Let me inform you that statistics ... '' Mrs. Madison 's gentle voice was no more than just audible in the short intervals he permitted ; a blind listener would have thought Mr. Trumble at the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 27]: Hedrick was thankful when his mother finally gave up altogether the display of her ignorance , inaccuracy , and general misinformation , and Trumble talked alone .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 25]: That must have been the young man 's object ; certainly he had struggled for it ; and so it must have pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 63]: He talked on and on and on ; he passed from one topic to another with no pause ; swinging over the gaps with a `` Now you take , '' or , `` And that reminds me , '' filling many a vacancy with `` So-and-so and so-and-so , '' and other stencils , while casting about for material to continue .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 17]: Everything was italicized , the significant and the trivial , to the same monotone of emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 10]: Death and shoe-laces were all the same to him .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: Anything was all the same to him so long as he talked .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 89]: Hedrick 's irritation was gradually dispelled ; and , becoming used to the sound , he found it lulling ; relaxed his attitude and drowsed ; Mr. Lindley was obviously lost in a reverie ; Mrs. Madison , her hand shading her eyes , went over her market-list for the morrow and otherwise set her house in order ; Laura alone sat straight in her chair ; and her face was toward the vocalist , but as she was in deep shadow her expression could not be guessed .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 20]: However , one person in that group must have listened with genuine pleasure -- else why did he talk ?
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 16]: It was the returned native whose departure at last rang the curtain on the monologue .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 17]: The end of the long sheltered seclusion of Cora and her companion was a whispered word .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 9]: He spoke it first : `` To-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 4]: `` To-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 33]: Cora gave a keen , quick , indrawn sigh -- not of sorrow -- and sank back in her chair , as he touched her hand in farewell and rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 34]: She remained where she was , motionless and silent in the dark , while he crossed to Mrs. Madison , and prefaced a leave-taking unusually formal for these precincts with his mannered bow .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 24]: He shook hands with Richard Lindley , asking genially : `` Do you still live where you did -- just below here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 36]: `` When I passed by there this afternoon , '' said Corliss , `` it recalled a stupendous conflict we had , once upon a time ; but I could n't remember the cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 22]: `` I remember the cause , '' said Mr. Lindley , but , stopping rather short , omitted to state it .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 10]: `` At all events , it was settled . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' said the other quietly .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 6]: `` You whipped me . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 6]: `` Did I so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 4]: Corliss laughed gayly .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 10]: `` We must n't let it happen again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 14]: Mr. Trumble joined the parting guest , making simultaneous adieus with unmistakable elation .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 14]: Mr. Trumble 's dreadful entertainment had made it a happy evening for him .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 81]: As they went down the steps together , the top of his head just above the level of his companion 's shoulder , he lifted to Corliss a searching gaze like an actor 's hopeful scrutiny of a new acquaintance ; and before they reached the street his bark rang eagerly on the stilly night : `` Now _ there _ is a point on which I beg to differ with you ... '' Mrs. Madison gave Lindley her hand .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 8]: `` I think I 'll go in .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 4]: Good-night , Richard .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 5]: Come , Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 17]: Hedrick rose , groaning , and batted his eyes painfully as he faced the hall light .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 11]: `` What 'd you and this Corliss fight about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 5]: he asked , sleepily .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 7]: `` Nothing , '' said Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 7]: `` You said you remembered . ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 12]: `` Oh , I remember a lot of useless things . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: `` Well , what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 10]: I want to know what you fought about . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 19]: `` Come , Hedrick , '' repeated his mother , setting a gently urgent hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 22]: `` I wo n't , '' said the boy impatiently , shaking her off and growing suddenly very wideawake and determined .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 16]: `` I wo n't move a step till he tells me what they fought about .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 5]: Not a step ! ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 11]: `` Well -- it was about a ` show . '
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 15]: We were only boys , you know -- younger than you , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 5]: `` A circus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 13]: `` A boy-circus he and my brother got up in our yard .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 7]: I was n't in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 10]: `` Well , what did you fight about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 13]: `` I thought Val Corliss was n't quite fair to my brother .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 5]: That 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 7]: `` No , it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 7]: How was n't he fair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 21]: `` They sold tickets to the other boys ; and I thought my brother did n't get his share . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 8]: `` This Corliss kept it all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 13]: `` Oh , something like that , '' said Lindley , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 9]: `` Probably I was in the wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 7]: `` And he licked you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 7]: `` All over the place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 20]: `` I wish I 'd seen it , '' said Hedrick , not unsympathetically , but as a sportsman .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 8]: And he consented to be led away .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 41]: Laura had been standing at the top of the steps looking down the street , where Corliss and his brisk companion had emerged momentarily from deep shadows under the trees into the illumination of a swinging arc-lamp at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 20]: They disappeared ; and she turned , and , smiling , gave the delaying guest her hand in good-night .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 26]: His expression , which was somewhat troubled , changed to one of surprise as her face came into the light , for it was transfigured .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 23]: Deeply flushed , her eyes luminous , she wore that shining look Hedrick had seen as she wrote in her secret book .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 6]: `` Why , Laura ! ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 5]: said Lindley , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 10]: She said good-night again , and went in slowly .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 34]: As she reached the foot of the stairs , she heard him moving a chair upon the porch , and Cora speaking sharply : `` Please do n't sit close to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 27]: There was a sudden shrillness in the voice of honey , and the six words were run so rapidly together they seemed to form but one .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 38]: After a moment Cora added , with a deprecatory ripple of laughter not quite free from the same shrillness : `` You see , Richard , it 's so -- it 's so hot , to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 38]: CHAPTER FIVE Half an hour later , when Lindley had gone , Cora closed the front doors in a manner which drew an immediate cry of agony from the room where her father was trying to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 74]: She stood on tiptoe to turn out the gas-light in the hall ; but for a time the key resisted the insufficient pressure of her finger-tips : the little orange flame , with its black-green crescent over the armature , so maliciously like the `` eye '' of a peacock feather , limned the exquisite planes of the upturned face ; modelled them with soft and regular shadows ; painted a sullen loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 29]: The key turned a little , but not enough ; and she whispered to herself a monosyllable not usually attributed to the vocabulary of a damsel of rank .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 24]: Next moment , her expression flashed in a brilliant change , like that of a pouting child suddenly remembering that tomorrow is Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 17]: The key surrendered instantly , and she ran gayly up the familiar stairs in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 28]: The transom of Laura 's door shone brightly ; but the knob , turning uselessly in Cora 's hand , proved the door itself not so hospitable .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 19]: There was a brief rustling within the room ; the bolt snapped , and Laura opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 22]: `` Why , Laura , '' said Cora , observing her sister with transient curiosity , `` you have n't undressed .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 6]: What have you been doing ?
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 7]: Something 's the matter with you .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 25]: I know what it is , '' she added , laughing , as she seated herself on the edge of the old black-walnut bed .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 10]: `` You 're in love with Wade Trumble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 11]: `` He 's a strong man , '' observed Laura .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 6]: `` A remarkable throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 6]: `` Horrible little person ! ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 26]: said Cora , forgetting what she owed the unfortunate Mr. Trumble for the vocal wall which had so effectively sheltered her earlier in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 36]: `` He 's like one of those booming June-bugs , batting against the walls , falling into lamp-chimneys ----- '' `` He does n't get very near the light he wants , '' said Laura .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 3]: `` Me ?
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 10]: Yes , he would like to , the rat !
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 17]: But he 's consoled when he can get any one to listen to his awful chatter .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 18]: He makes up to himself among women for the way he gets sat on at the club .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 17]: But he has his use : he shows off the other men so , by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 5]: Oh , Laura ! ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 19]: She lifted both hands to her cheeks , which were beautiful with a quick suffusion of high colour .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 7]: `` Is n't he gorgeous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' said Laura gently , `` I 've always thought so . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 10]: `` Now what 's the use of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 10]: asked Cora peevishly , `` with _ me _ ?
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 7]: I did n't mean Richard Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 9]: You _ know _ what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 13]: `` Yes -- of course -- I do , '' Laura said .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 46]: Cora gave her a long look in which a childlike pleading mingled with a faint , strange trouble ; then this glance wandered moodily from the face of her sister to her own slippers , which she elevated to meet her descending line of vision .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 22]: `` And you know I ca n't help it , '' she said , shifting quickly to the role of accuser .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 13]: `` So what 's the use of behaving like the Pest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 37]: She let her feet drop to the floor again , and her voice trembled a little as she went on : `` Laura , you do n't know what I had to endure from him to-night .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 23]: I really do n't think I can stand it to live in the same house any longer with that frightful little devil .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 19]: He 's been throwing Ray Vilas 's name at me until -- oh , it was ghastly to-night !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 10]: And then -- then -- '' Her tremulousness increased .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 32]: `` I have n't said anything about it all day , but I _ met _ him on the street downtown , this morning -- '' `` You met Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 4]: Laura looked startled .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 9]: `` Did he speak to you ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 7]: ` Speak to me ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 10]: Cora 's exclamation shook with a half-laugh of hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 9]: `` He made an awful _ scene _ !
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 65]: He came out of the Richfield Hotel barroom on Main Street just as I was going into the jeweller 's next door , and he stopped and bowed like a monkey , square in front of me , and -- and he took off his hat and set it on the pavement at my feet and told me to kick it into the gutter !
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 13]: Everybody stopped and stared ; and I could n't get by him .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 27]: And he said -- he said I 'd kicked his heart into the gutter and he did n't want it to catch cold without a hat !
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 19]: And would n't I please be so kind as to kick -- '' She choked with angry mortification .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 5]: `` It was horrible !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 39]: People were stopping and laughing , and a rowdy began to make fun of Ray , and pushed him , and they got into a scuffle , and I ran into the jeweller 's and almost fainted . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 6]: `` He is insane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 5]: said Laura , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 14]: `` He 's nothing of the kind ; he 's just a brute .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 51]: He does it to make people say I 'm the cause of his drinking ; and everybody in this gossipy old town _ does _ say it -- just because I got bored to death with his everlasting do-you-love-me-to-day-as-well-as-yesterday style of torment , and could n't help liking Richard better .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 22]: Yes , every old cat in town says I ruined him , and that 's what he wants them to say .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 5]: It 's so unmanly !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 6]: I wish he 'd die !
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: Yes , I _ do _ wish he would !
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 8]: Why does n't he kill himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 12]: `` Ah , do n't say that , '' protested Laura .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 6]: He 's threatened to enough .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 26]: And I 'm afraid to go out of the house because I ca n't tell when I 'll meet him or what he 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 24]: I was almost sick in that jeweller 's shop , this morning , and so upset I came away without getting my pendant .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 17]: There 's _ another _ thing I 've got to go through , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 7]: She pounded the yielding pillow desperately .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 7]: `` Oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 32]: Life is n't worth living -- it seems to me sometimes as if everybody in the world spent his time trying to think up ways to make it harder for me !
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 25]: I could n't have worn the pendant , though , even if I 'd got it , '' she went on , becoming thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 19]: `` It 's Richard 's silly old engagement ring , you know , '' she explained , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 27]: `` I had it made up into a pendant , and heaven knows how I 'm going to get Richard to see it the right way .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 7]: He was so unreasonable tonight . ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 11]: `` Was he cross about Mr. Corliss monopolizing you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 13]: `` Oh , you know how he is , '' said Cora .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 9]: `` He did n't speak of it exactly .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 27]: But after you 'd gone , he asked me -- '' She stopped with a little gulp , an expression of keen distaste about her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 43]: `` Oh , he wants me to wear my ring , '' she continued , with sudden rapidity : `` and how the dickens _ can _ I when I ca n't even tell him it 's been made into a pendant !
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 15]: He wants to speak to father ; he wants to _ announce _ it .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 55]: He 's sold out his business for what he thinks is a good deal of money , and he wants me to marry him next month and take some miserable little trip , I do n't know where , for a few weeks , before he invests what he 's made in another business .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 33]: `` It 's a _ horrible _ thing to ask a girl to do : to settle down -- just housekeeping , housekeeping , housekeeping forever in this stupid , stupid town !
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 5]: It 's so unfair !
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 18]: Men are just possessive ; they think it 's loving you to want to possess you themselves .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 6]: A beautiful ` love ' !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 5]: It 's so mean !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 3]: Men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 15]: She sprang up and threw out both arms in a vehement gesture of revolt .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 15]: `` Damn 'em , I wish they 'd let me _ alone _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 21]: Laura 's eyes had lost their quiet ; they showed a glint of tears , and she was breathing quickly .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 29]: In this crisis of emotion the two girls went to each other silently ; Cora turned , and Laura began to unfasten Cora 's dress in the back .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 5]: `` Poor Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 20]: said Laura presently , putting into her mouth a tiny pearl button which had detached itself at her touch .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 10]: `` This was his first evening in the overflow .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 7]: No wonder he was troubled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 3]: said Cora .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 16]: `` As if you and mamma were n't good enough for him to talk to !
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 4]: He 's spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 44]: He 's so used to being called ` the most popular man in town ' and knowing that every girl on Corliss Street wanted to marry him -- '' She broke off , and exclaimed sharply : `` I wish they would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 4]: `` Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 20]: `` Oh , I suppose you mean that 's the reason _ I _ went in for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' explained Laura hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 9]: `` I only meant , stand still . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 7]: `` Well , it was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 24]: And Cora 's abrupt laugh had the glad , free ring fancy attaches to the merry confidences of a buccaneer in trusted company .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 24]: Laura knelt to continue unfastening the dress ; and when it was finished she extended three of the tiny buttons in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 14]: `` They 're always loose on a new dress , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 12]: `` I 'll sew them all on tight , to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 4]: Cora smiled lovingly .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 10]: `` You good old thing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 7]: `` You looked pretty to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 6]: `` That 's nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 16]: Laura laughed , as she dropped the buttons into a little drawer of her bureau .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 67]: It was an ugly , cheap , old bureau , its veneer loosened and peeling , the mirror small and flawed -- a piece of furniture in keeping with the room , which was small , plain and hot , its only ornamental adjunct being a silver-framed photograph of Mrs. Madison , with Cora , as a child of seven or eight , upon her lap .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 13]: `` You really do look ever so pretty , '' asserted Cora .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 25]: `` I wonder if I look as well as I did the last time I heard I was pretty , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 9]: `` That was at the Assembly in March .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 26]: Coming down the stairs , I heard a man from out of town say , ` That black-haired Miss Madison is a pretty girl . '
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 22]: And some one with him said , ` Yes ; you 'll think so until you meet her sister ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 8]: `` You are an old dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 22]: Cora enfolded her delightedly ; then , drawing back , exclaimed : `` You _ know _ he 's gorgeous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 26]: And with a feverish little ripple of laughter , caught her dress together in the back and sped through the hall to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 36]: This was a very different affair from Laura 's , much cooler and larger ; occupying half the width of the house ; and a rather expensive struggle had made it pretty and even luxurious .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 59]: The window curtains and the wall-paper were fresh , and of a quiet blue ; there was a large divan of the same colour ; a light desk , prettily equipped , occupied a corner ; and between two gilt gas-brackets , whose patent burners were shielded by fringed silk shades , stood a cheval-glass six feet high .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 44]: The door of a very large clothes-pantry stood open , showing a fine company of dresses , suspended from forms in an orderly manner ; near by , a rosewood cabinet exhibited a delicate collection of shoes and slippers upon its four shelves .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 34]: A dressing-table , charmingly littered with everything , took the place of a bureau ; and upon it , in a massive silver frame , was a large photograph of Mr. Richard Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 14]: The frame was handsome , but somewhat battered : it had seen service .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 8]: However , the photograph was quite new .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 66]: There were photographs everywhere -- photographs framed and unframed ; photographs large and photographs small , the fresh and the faded ; tintypes , kodaks , `` full lengths , '' `` cabinets , '' groups -- every kind of photograph ; and among them were several of Cora herself , one of her mother , one of Laura , and two others of girls .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 6]: All the rest were sterner .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 91]: Two or three were seamed across with cracks , hastily recalled sentences to destruction ; and here and there remained tokens of a draughtsman 's over-generous struggle to confer upon some of the smooth-shaven faces additional manliness in the shape of sweeping moustaches , long beards , goatees , mutton-chops , and , in the case of one gentleman of a blond , delicate and tenor-like beauty , neck-whiskers ; -- decorations in many instances so deeply and damply pencilled that subsequent attempts at erasure had failed of great success .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 12]: Certainly , Hedrick had his own way of relieving dull times .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 27]: Cora turned up the lights at the sides of the cheval-glass , looked at herself earnestly , then absently , and began to loosen her hair .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 93]: Her lifted hands hesitated ; she re-arranged the slight displacement of her hair already effected ; set two chairs before the mirror , seated herself in one ; pulled up her dress , where it was slipping from her shoulder , rested an arm upon the back of the other chair as , earlier in the evening , she had rested it upon the iron railing of the porch , and , leaning forward , assumed as exactly as possible the attitude in which she had sat so long beside Valentine Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 41]: She leaned very slowly closer and yet closer to the mirror ; a rich colour spread over her ; her eyes , gazing into themselves , became dreamy , inexpressibly wistful , cloudily sweet ; her breath was tumultuous . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 9]: ` Even as you and I ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 55]: Then , in the final moment of this after-the-fact rehearsal , as her face almost touched the glass , she forgot how and what she had looked to Corliss ; she forgot him ; she forgot him utterly : she leaped to her feet and kissed the mirrored lips with a sort of passion .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 7]: `` You _ darling _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 17]: Cora 's christening had been unimaginative , for the name means only , `` maiden . ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 7]: She should have been called Narcissa .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 18]: The rhapsody was over instantly , leaving an emotional vacuum like a silence at the dentist 's .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 11]: Cora yawned , and resumed the loosening of her hair .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 30]: When she had put on her nightgown , she went from one window to another , closing the shutters against the coming of the morning light to wake her .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 57]: As she reached the last window , a sudden high wind rushed among the trees outside ; a white flare leaped at her face , startling her ; there was a boom and rattle as of the brasses , cymbals , and kettle-drums of some fatal orchestra ; and almost at once it began to rain .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 63]: And with that , from the distance came a voice , singing ; and at the first sound of it , though it was far away and almost indistinguishable , Cora started more violently than at the lightning ; she sprang to the mirror lights , put them out ; threw herself upon the bed , and huddled there in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 42]: The wind passed ; the heart of the storm was miles away ; this was only its fringe ; but the rain pattered sharply upon the thick foliage outside her windows ; and the singing voice came slowly up the street .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 24]: It was a strange voice : high-pitched and hoarse -- and not quite human , so utter was the animal abandon of it .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 51]: `` I love a lassie , a bonnie , bonnie lassie , '' it wailed and piped , coming nearer ; and the gay little air -- wrought to a grotesque of itself by this wild , high voice in the rain -- might have been a banshee 's love-song .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 12]: `` I love a lassie , a bonnie , bonnie lassie .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 38]: She 's as pure as the lily in the dell -- '' The voice grew louder ; came in front of the house ; came into the yard ; came and sang just under Cora 's window .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 57]: There it fell silent a moment ; then was lifted in a long peal of imbecile laughter , and sang again : `` Then slowly , slowly rase she up And slowly she came nigh him , And when she drew the curtain by -- ` Young man I think you 're dyin ' . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 29]: Cora 's door opened and closed softly , and Laura , barefooted , stole to the bed and put an arm about the shaking form of her sister .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 6]: `` The drunken beast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 3]: sobbed Cora .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 7]: `` It 's to disgrace me !
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 6]: That 's what he wants .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 22]: He 'd like nothing better than headlines in the papers : ` Ray Vilas arrested at the Madison residence ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 7]: She choked with anger and mortification .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 16]: `` The neighbours -- '' `` They 're nearly all away , '' whispered Laura .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 11]: `` You need n't fear -- '' `` Hark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 34]: The voice stopped singing , and began to mumble incoherently ; then it rose again in a lamentable outcry : `` Oh , God of the fallen , be Thou merciful to me !
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 19]: Be Thou merciful -- merciful -- _ merciful _ '' ... `` MERCIFUL , MERCIFUL , MERCIFUL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 32]: it shrieked , over and over , with increasing loudness , and to such nerve-racking effect that Cora , gasping , beat the bedclothes frantically with her hands at each iteration .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 19]: The transom over the door became luminous ; some one had lighted the gas in the upper hall .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 16]: Both girls jumped from the bed , ran to the door , and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 33]: Their mother , wearing a red wrapper , was standing at the head of the stairs , which Mr. Madison , in his night-shirt and slippers , was slowly and heavily descending .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 29]: Before he reached the front door , the voice outside ceased its dreadful plaint with the abrupt anti-climax of a phonograph stopped in the middle of a record .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 20]: There was the sound of a struggle and wrestling , a turmoil in the wet shrubberies , branches cracking .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 29]: `` Let me go , da -- '' cried the voice , drowned again at half a word , as by a powerful hand upon a screaming mouth .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 41]: The old man opened the front door , stepped out , closing it behind him ; and the three women looked at each other wanly during a hushed interval like that in a sleeping-car at night when the train stops .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 22]: Presently he came in again , and started up the stairs , heavily and slowly , as he had gone down .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 20]: `` Richard Lindley stopped him , '' he said , sighing with the ascent , and not looking up .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 26]: `` He heard him as he came along the street , and dressed as quick as he could , and ran up and got him .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 7]: Richard 's taken him away . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 25]: He went to his own room , panting , mopping his damp gray hair with his fat wrist , and looking at no one .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 6]: Cora began to cry again .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 37]: It was an hour before any of this family had recovered sufficient poise to realize , with the shuddering gratitude of adventurers spared from the abyss , that , under Providence , Hedrick had not wakened !
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 28]: CHAPTER SIX Much light shatters much loveliness ; but a pretty girl who looks pretty outdoors on a dazzling hot summer morning is prettier then than ever .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 43]: Cora knew it ; of course she knew it ; she knew exactly how she looked , as she left the concrete bridge behind her at the upper end of Corliss Street and turned into a shrub-bordered bypath of the river park .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 52]: In imagination she stood at the turn of the path just ahead , watching her own approach : she saw herself as a picture -- the white-domed parasol , with its cheerful pale-green lining , a background for her white hat , her corn-silk hair , and her delicately flushed face .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 75]: She saw her pale , live arms through their thin sleeves , and the light grasp of her gloved fingers upon the glistening stick of the parasol ; she saw the long , simple lines of her close white dress and their graceful interchanging movements with the alternate advance of her white shoes over the fine gravel path ; she saw the dazzling splashes of sunshine playing upon her through the changeful branches overhead .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 11]: Cora never lacked a gallery : she sat there herself .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 79]: She refreshed the eyes of a respectable burgess of sixty , a person so colourless that no one , after passing him , could have remembered anything about him except that he wore glasses and some sort of moustache ; and to Cora 's vision he was as near transparent as any man could be , yet she did not miss the almost imperceptible signs of his approval , as they met and continued on their opposite ways .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 37]: She did not glance round , nor did he pause in his slow walk ; neither was she clairvoyant ; none the less , she knew that he turned his head and looked back at her .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 40]: The path led away from the drives and more public walks of the park , to a low hill , thoughtfully untouched by the gardener and left to the shadowy thickets and good-smelling underbrush of its rich native woodland .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 15]: And here , by a brown bench , waited a tall gentleman in white .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 8]: They touched hands and sat without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 34]: For several moments they continued the silence , then turned slowly and looked at each other ; then looked slowly and gravely away , as if to an audience in front of them .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 30]: They knew how to do it ; but probably a critic in the first row would have concluded that Cora felt it even more than Valentine Corliss enjoyed it .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 17]: `` I suppose this is very clandestine , '' she said , after a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 11]: `` I do n't think I care , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 22]: `` I hope you do , '' he smiled , `` so that I could think your coming means more . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 16]: `` Then I 'll care , '' she said , and looked at him again .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: `` You dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 4]: he exclaimed deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 22]: She bit her lip and looked down , but not before he had seen the quick dilation of her ardent eyes .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 13]: `` I wanted to be out of doors , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 19]: `` I 'm afraid there 's one thing of yours I do n't like , Mr. Corliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 9]: `` I 'll throw it away , then .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 4]: Tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 4]: `` Your house .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 11]: I do n't like living in it , very much .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 13]: I 'm sorry you _ ca n't _ throw it away . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 14]: `` I 'm thinking of doing that very thing , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 17]: `` But I 'm glad I found the rose in that queer old waste-basket first . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 14]: `` Not too much like a rose , sometimes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 30]: `` I think this morning I 'm a little like some of the old doors up on the third floor : I feel rather unhinged , Mr. Corliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 11]: `` You do n't look it , Miss Madison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 9]: `` I did n't sleep very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 24]: She bestowed upon him a glance which transmuted her actual explanation into , `` I could n't sleep for thinking of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 12]: It was perfectly definite ; but the acute gentleman laughed genially .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 7]: `` Go on with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 11]: Her eyes sparkled , and she joined laughter with him .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: `` But it 's true : you did keep me awake .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 8]: Besides , I had a serenade . ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 3]: `` Serenade ?
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 14]: I had an idea they did n't do that any more over here .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 40]: I remember the young men going about at night with an orchestra sometimes when I was a boy , but I supposed -- '' `` Oh , it was n't much like that , '' she interrupted , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 17]: `` I do n't think that sort of thing has been done for years and years .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 15]: It was n't an orchestra -- just a man singing under my window . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 6]: `` With a guitar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 5]: She laughed a little .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 5]: `` Just singing . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 13]: `` But it rained last night , '' said Corliss , puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 12]: `` Oh , _ he _ would n't mind that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 6]: `` How stupid of me !
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 7]: Of course , he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 6]: Was it Richard Lindley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 29]: Yes , that was a bad guess : I 'm sure Lindley 's just the same steady-going , sober , plodding old horse he was as a boy .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 19]: His picture does n't fit a romantic frame -- singing under a lady 's window in a thunderstorm !
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 9]: Your serenader must have been very young . ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 8]: `` He is , '' said Cora .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 21]: `` I suppose he 's about twenty-three ; just a boy -- and a very annoying one , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 7]: Her companion looked at her narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 22]: `` By any chance , is he the person your little brother seemed so fond of mentioning -- Mr. Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 6]: Cora gave a genuine start .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 7]: What makes you think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 14]: she cried , but she was sufficiently disconcerted to confirm his amused suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 11]: `` So it was Mr. Vilas , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 12]: `` He 's one of the jilted , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 8]: `` Oh , ` jilted ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 23]: `` All the wild boys that a girl ca n't make herself like are n't ` jilted , ' are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 13]: `` I believe I should say -- yes , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 14]: `` Yes , in this instance , just about all of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 12]: `` Is every woman a target for you , Mr. Corliss ?
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 18]: I suppose you know that you have a most uncomfortable way of shooting up the landscape . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 17]: She stirred uneasily , and moved away from him to the other end of the bench .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 12]: `` I did n't miss that time , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: `` Do n't you ever miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 30]: He leaned quickly toward her and answered in a low voice : `` You can be sure I 'm not going to miss anything about _ you _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 14]: It was as if his bending near her had been to rouge her .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 49]: But it can not be said that she disliked his effect upon her ; for the deep breath she drew in audibly , through her shut teeth , was a signal of delight ; and then followed one of those fraught silences not uncharacteristic of dialogues with Cora .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 39]: Presently , she gracefully and uselessly smoothed her hair from the left temple with the backs of her fingers , of course finishing the gesture prettily by tucking in a hairpin tighter above the nape of her neck .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 29]: Then , with recovered coolness , she asked : `` Did you come all the way from Italy just to sell our old house , Mr. Corliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 16]: `` Perhaps that was part of why I came , '' he said , gayly .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 14]: `` I need a great deal of money , Miss Cora Madison . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: `` For your villa and your yacht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 22]: `` No ; I 'm a magician , dear lady -- '' `` Yes , '' she said , almost angrily .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 8]: `` Of course you know it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 5]: `` You mock me !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 14]: No ; I 'm going to make everybody rich who will trust me .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 14]: I have a secret , and it 's worth a mountain of gold .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 34]: I 've put all I have into it , and will put in everything else I can get for myself , but it 's going to take a great deal more than that .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 16]: And everybody who goes into it will come out on Monte Cristo 's island . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 17]: `` Then I 'm sorry papa has n't anything to put in , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 13]: `` But he has : his experience in business and his integrity .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: I want him to be secretary of my company .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 9]: Will you help me to get him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 8]: `` Do you want me to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 19]: she asked with a quick , serious glance straight in his eyes , one which he met admirably .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 30]: `` I have an extremely definite impression , '' he said lightly , `` that you can make anybody you know do just what you want him to . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 38]: `` And I have another that you have still another ` extremely definite impression ' that takes rank over that , '' she said , but not with his lightness , for her tone was faintly rueful .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 19]: `` It is that you can make _ me _ do just what you want me to . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 13]: Mr. Valentine Corliss threw himself back on the bench and laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: `` What a girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 27]: Then for a fraction of a second he set his hand over hers , an evanescent touch at which her whole body started and visibly thrilled .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 30]: She lifted her gloved hand and looked at it with an odd wonder ; her alert emotions , always too ready , flinging their banners to her cheeks again .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 27]: `` Oh , I do n't think it 's soiled , '' he said , a speech which she punished with a look of starry contempt .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 54]: For an instant she made him afraid that something had gone wrong with his measuring tape ; but with a slow movement she set her hand softly against her hot cheek ; and he was reassured : it was not his touching her that had offended her , but the allusion to it .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 10]: `` Thanks , '' he said , very softly .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 24]: She dropped her hand to her parasol , and began , musingly , to dig little holes in the gravel of the path .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 12]: `` Richard Lindley is looking for investments , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: `` I 'm glad to hear he 's been so successful , '' returned Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 11]: `` He might like a share in your gold-mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 14]: `` Thank heaven it is n't literally a gold-mine , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 26]: `` There have been so many crooked ones exploited I do n't believe you could get anybody nowadays to come in on a real one .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 27]: But I think you 'd make an excellent partner for an adventurer who had discovered hidden treasure ; and I 'm that particular kind of adventurer .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 9]: I think I 'll take you in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 14]: `` How would you like to save a man from being ruined ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 3]: `` Ruined ?
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 8]: You do n't mean it literally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 4]: `` Literally ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 4]: He laughed gayly .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 20]: `` If I do n't ` land ' this I 'm gone , smashed , finished -- quite ended !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 13]: Do n't bother , I 'm going to ` land ' it .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 18]: And it 's rather a serious compliment I 'm paying you , thinking you can help me .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 23]: I 'd like to see a woman -- just once in the world -- who could manage a thing like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 6]: He became suddenly very grave .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 4]: `` Good God !
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 9]: would n't I be at her feet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 7]: Her eyes became even more eager .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 16]: `` You think I -- I _ might _ be a woman who could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 7]: `` Who knows , Miss Madison ?
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 45]: I believe -- '' He stopped abruptly , then in a lowered , graver voice asked : `` Does n't it somehow seem a little queer to you when we call each other , ` Miss Madison ' and ` Mr. Corliss ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' she answered slowly ; `` it does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 34]: `` Does n't it seem to you , '' he went on , in the same tone , `` that we only ` Miss ' and ` Mister ' each other in fun ?
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 18]: That though you never saw me until yesterday , we 've gone pretty far beyond mere surfaces ?
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 11]: That we did in our talk , last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' she repeated ; `` it does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 19]: He let a pause follow , and then said huskily : `` How far are we going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 25]: She was barely audible ; but she turned deliberately , and there took place an eager exchange of looks which continued a long while .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 23]: At last , and without ending this serious encounter , she whispered : `` How far do _ you _ think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 53]: Mr. Corliss did not answer , and a peculiar phenomenon became vaguely evident to the girl facing him : his eyes were still fixed full upon hers , but he was not actually looking at her ; nevertheless , and with an extraordinarily acute attention , he was unquestionably looking at something .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 31]: The direct front of pupil and iris did not waver from her ; but for the time he was not aware of her ; had not even heard her question .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 37]: Something in the outer field of his vision had suddenly and completely engrossed him ; something in that nebulous and hazy background which we see , as we say , with the white of the eye .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 12]: Cora instinctively turned and looked behind her , down the path .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 63]: There was no one in sight except a little girl and the elderly burgess who had glanced over his shoulder at Cora as she entered the park ; and he was , in face , mien , and attire , so thoroughly the unnoticeable , average man-on-the-street that she did not even recall him as the looker-round of a little while ago .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 38]: He was strolling benevolently , the little girl clinging to one of his hands , the other holding an apple ; and a composite photograph of a thousand grandfathers might have resulted in this man 's picture .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 39]: As the man and little girl came slowly up the walk toward the couple on the bench there was a faint tinkle at Cora 's feet : her companion 's scarfpin , which had fallen from his tie .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 81]: He was maladroit about picking it up , trying with thumb and forefinger to seize the pin itself , instead of the more readily grasped design of small pearls at the top , so that he pushed it a little deeper into the gravel ; and then occurred a tiny coincidence : the elderly man , passing , let fall the apple from his hand , and it rolled toward the pin just as Corliss managed to secure the latter .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 38]: For an instant , though the situation was so absolutely commonplace , so casual , Cora had a wandering consciousness of some mysterious tensity ; a feeling like the premonition of a crisis very near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 11]: This sensation was the more curious because nothing whatever happened .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 17]: The man got his apple , joined in the child 's laughter , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 9]: `` What was it you asked me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 15]: said Corliss , lifting his head again and restoring the pin to his tie .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 21]: He gazed carelessly at the back of the grandsire , disappearing beyond a bush at a bend in the path .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 7]: `` Who was that man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 6]: said Cora with some curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 5]: `` That old fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 6]: I have n't an idea .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 17]: You see I 've been away from here so many years I remember almost no one .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 23]: `` I do n't know , unless it was because I had an idea you were thinking of him instead of me .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 10]: You did n't listen to what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 17]: `` That was because I was thinking so intensely of you , '' he began instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 13]: `` A startlingly vivid thought of you came to me just then .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 12]: Did n't I look like a man in a trance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 7]: `` What was the thought ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 38]: `` It was a picture : I saw you standing under a great bulging sail , and the water flying by in moonlight ; oh , a moon and a night such as you have never seen !
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 50]: and a big blue headland looming up against the moon , and crowned with lemon groves and vineyards , all sparkling with fireflies -- old watch-towers and the roofs of white villas gleaming among olive orchards on the slopes -- the sound of mandolins -- '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 15]: she sighed , the elderly man , his grandchild , and his apple well-forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 10]: `` Do you think it was a prophecy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 9]: `` What do _ you _ think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 3]: she breathed .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 11]: `` That was really what I asked you before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 33]: `` I think , '' he said slowly , `` that I 'm in danger of forgetting that my ` hidden treasure ' is the most important thing in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 6]: `` In great danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 6]: The words were not vocal .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 41]: He moved close to her ; their eyes met again , with increased eagerness , and held fast ; she was trembling , visibly ; and her lips -- parted with her tumultuous breathing -- were not far from his .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 23]: `` Is n't any man in great danger , '' he said , `` if he falls in love with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 57]: CHAPTER SEVEN Toward four o'clock that afternoon , a very thin , fair young man shakily heaved himself into a hammock under the trees in that broad backyard wherein , as Valentine Corliss had yesterday noticed , the last iron monarch of the herd , with unabated arrogance , had entered domestic service as a clothes-prop .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 37]: The young man , who was of delicate appearance and unhumanly pale , stretched himself at full length on his back , closed his eyes , moaned feebly , cursed the heat in a stricken whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 38]: Then , as a locust directly overhead violently shattered the silence , and seemed like to continue the outrage forever , the shaken lounger stopped his ears with his fingers and addressed the insect in old Saxon .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 15]: A white jacketed mulatto came from the house bearing something on a silver tray .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 8]: `` Julip , Mist ' Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 4]: he said sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 52]: Ray Vilas rustily manoeuvred into a sitting position ; and , with eyes still closed , made shift to accept the julep in both hands , drained half of it , opened his eyes , and thanked the cup-bearer feebly , in a voice and accent reminiscent of the melodious South .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 42]: `` And I wonder , '' he added , `` if you can tell me -- '' `` I 'm Miz William Lindley 's house-man , Joe Vaxdens , '' said the mulatto , in the tone of an indulgent nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 17]: `` You in Miz Lindley 's backyard right now , sittin ' in a hammick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 16]: `` I seem to gather almost that much for myself , '' returned the patient .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 13]: `` But I should like to know how I got here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 21]: `` Jes ' come out the front door an ' walk ' aroun ' the house an ' set down .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 71]: Mist ' Richard had to go downtown ; tole me not to wake you ; but I heerd you splashin ' in the bath an ' you tole me you din ' want no breakfuss -- '' `` Yes , Joe , I 'm aware of what 's occurred since I woke , '' said Vilas , and , throwing away the straws , finished the julep at one draught .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 19]: `` What I want to know is how I happened to be here at Mr. Lindley 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 12]: `` Mist ' Richard brought you las ' night , suh .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 42]: I don ' know where he got you , but I heered a considerable thrashum aroun ' , up an ' down the house , an ' so I come help him git you to bed in one vem spare-rooms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 4]: Joe chuckled ingratiatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 4]: `` Lord name !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 15]: You cert 'n' y was n't askin ' fer no _ bed _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 22]: He took the glass , and the young man reclined again in the hammock , a hot blush vanquishing his pallor .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 12]: `` Was I -- was I very bad , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 17]: `` Oh , you was all _ right _ , '' Joe hastened to reassure him .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 14]: `` You was jes ' on ' y a little bit tight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 10]: `` Did it really seem only a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: the other asked hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 8]: `` Yessuh , '' said Joe promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 6]: `` Nothin ' at all .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 11]: You jes ' wanted to rare roun ' little bit .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: Mist ' Richard took gun away from you -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 15]: `` Oh , I tole him you wasn ' goin ' use it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 3]: Joe laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 13]: `` But you so wile be din ' know what you do .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 23]: You cert 'n' y was drunkes ' man _ I _ see in _ long _ while , '' he said admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 74]: `` You pert near had us bofe wore out ` fore you give up , an ' Mist ' Richard an ' me , we _ use ' _ to han ` lin ' drunkum man , too -- use ' to have big times week-in , week-out ` ith Mist ' Will -- at 's Mist ' Richard 's brother , you know , suh , what died o ' whiskey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 7]: He laughed again in high good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 22]: `` You cert 'n' y laid it all over any vem ole times we had ` ith Mist ' Will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 26]: Mr. Vilas shifted his position in the hammock uneasily ; Joe 's honest intentions to be of cheer to the sufferer were not wholly successful .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 31]: `` I tole Mist ' Richard , '' the kindly servitor continued , `` it was a mighty good thing his ma gone up Norf endurin ' the hot spell .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 19]: Sence Mist ' Will die she ca n't hardly bear to see drunkum man aroun ' the house .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 12]: Mist ' Richard hardly ever tech nothin ' himself no more .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 26]: You goin ' feel better , suh , out in the f ` esh air , '' he concluded , comfortingly as he moved away .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 4]: `` Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 9]: Mr. Vilas pulled himself upright for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 16]: `` What use in the world do you reckon one julep is to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 26]: `` Mist ' Richard say to give you one drink ef you ask ' for it , suh , '' answered Joe , looking troubled .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 52]: `` Well , you 've told me enough now about last night to make any man hang himself , and I 'm beginning to remember enough more -- '' `` Pshaw , Mist ' Vilas , '' the coloured man interrupted , deprecatingly , `` you din ' broke nothin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 12]: You on ' y had couple glass ' wine too much .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 17]: You din ' make no trouble at all ; jes ' went right off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 26]: You ought seen some vem ole times me an Mist ' Richard use to have ` ith Mist ' Will -- '' `` Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 14]: `` I want three more juleps and I want them right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 11]: The troubled expression upon the coloured man 's face deepened .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 16]: `` Mist ' Richard say jes ' one , suh , '' he said reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 10]: `` I 'm afraid -- '' `` Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 29]: `` I do n't know , '' said Ray Vilas slowly , `` whether or not you ever heard that I was born and raised in Kentucky . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 8]: `` Yessuh , '' returned Joe humbly .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 6]: `` I heerd so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 24]: `` Well , then , '' said the young man in a quiet voice , `` you go and get me three juleps .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 9]: I 'll settle it with Mr. Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 38]: But it was with a fifth of these renovators that Lindley found his guest occupied , an hour later , while upon a small table nearby a sixth , untouched , awaited disposal beside an emptied coffee-cup .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 40]: Also , Mr. Vilas was smoking a cigarette with unshadowed pleasure ; his eye was bright , his expression care-free ; and he was sitting up in the hammock , swinging cheerfully , and singing the `` Marseillaise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 37]: Richard approached through the yard , coming from the street without entering the house ; and anxiety was manifest in the glance he threw at the green-topped glass upon the table , and in his greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 6]: `` Hail , gloom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 28]: returned Mr. Vilas , cordially , and , observing the anxious glance , he swiftly removed the untouched goblet from the table to his own immediate possession .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 15]: `` Two simultaneous juleps will enhance the higher welfare , '' he explained airily .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 24]: `` Sir , your Mr. Varden was induced to place a somewhat larger order with us than he protested to be your intention .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 17]: Trusting you to exonerate him from all so-and-so and that these few words , etcetera ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 23]: He depleted the elder glass of its liquor , waved it in the air , cried , `` Health , host ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 7]: and set it upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 32]: `` I believe I do not err in assuming my cup-bearer 's name to be Varden , although he himself , in his simple Americo-Africanism , is pleased to pluralize it .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 8]: Do I fret you , host ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 26]: `` Not in the least , '' said Richard , dropping upon a rustic bench , and beginning to fan himself with his straw hat .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 22]: `` What 's the use of fretting about a boy who has n't sense enough to fret about himself ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 5]: ` Boy ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 5]: Mr. Vilas affected puzzlement .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 6]: `` Do I hear aright ?
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 7]: Sir , do you boy me ?
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 17]: Bethink you , I am now the shell of five mint-juleps plus , and am pot-valiant .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 13]: And is this mere capacity itself to be lightly _ boyed _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 16]: Again , do I not wear a man 's garment , a man 's garnitures ?
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 36]: Heed your answer ; for this serge , these flannels , and these silks are yours , and though I may not fill them to the utmost , I do to the longmost , precisely .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 31]: I am the stature of a man ; had it not been for your razor I should wear the beard of a man ; therefore I 'll not be boyed .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 9]: What have you to say in defence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 17]: `` Had n't you better let me get Joe to bring you something to eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 3]: asked Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: `` Eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 10]: Mr. Vilas disposed of the suggestion with mournful hauteur .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 7]: For the once I forgive you .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 10]: Let the subject never be mentioned between us again .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: We will tactfully turn to a topic of interest .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 18]: My memories of last evening , at first hazy and somewhat disconcerting , now merely amuse me .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 25]: Following the pleasant Spanish custom , I went a-serenading , but was kidnapped from beneath the precious casement by -- by a zealous arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 21]: Host , ` zealous arrival ' is not the julep in action : it is a triumph of paraphrase . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 17]: `` I wish you 'd let Joe take you back to bed , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 15]: `` Always bent on thoughts of the flesh , '' observed the other sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 15]: `` Beds are for bodies , and I am become a thing of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 13]: My soul is grateful a little for your care of its casing .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 18]: You behold , I am generous : I am able to thank my successor to Carmen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 5]: Lindley 's back stiffened .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 4]: `` Vilas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 7]: `` Spare me your protests . ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 8]: The younger man waved his hand languidly .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 24]: `` You wish not to confer upon this subject -- '' `` It 's a subject we 'll omit , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 35]: His companion stopped swinging , allowed the hammock to come to rest ; his air of badinage fell from him ; for the moment he seemed entirely sober ; and he spoke with gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 18]: `` Mr. Lindley , if you please , I am still a gentleman -- at times . ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 11]: `` I beg your pardon , '' said Richard quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 7]: `` No need of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 12]: The speaker 's former careless and boisterous manner instantly resumed possession .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 27]: `` You must permit me to speak of a wholly fictitious lady , a creature of my wanton fancy , sir , whom I call Carmen .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 24]: It will enable me to relieve my burdened soul of some remarks I have long wished to address to your excellent self . ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 13]: `` Oh , all right , '' muttered Richard , much annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 65]: `` Let us imagine , '' continued Mr. Vilas , beginning to swing again , `` that I thought I had won this Carmen -- '' Lindley uttered an exclamation , shifted his position in his chair , and fixed a bored attention upon the passing vehicles in the glimpse of the street afforded between the house and the shrubberies along the side fence .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 54]: The other , without appearing to note his annoyance , went on , cheerfully : `` She was a precocious huntress : early in youth she passed through the accumulator stage , leaving it to the crude or village belle to rejoice in numbers and the excitement of teasing cubs in the bear-pit .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 40]: It is the nature of this imagined Carmen to play fiercely with one imitation of love after another : a man thinks he wins her , but it is merely that she has chosen him -- for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 45]: And Carmen can have what she chooses ; if the man exists who could show her that she can not , she would follow him through the devil 's dance ; but neither you nor I would be that man , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 67]: We assume that Carmen 's eyes have been mine -- her heart is another matter -- and that she has grown weary of my somewhat Sicilian manner of looking into them , and , following her nature and the law of periodicity which Carmens must bow to , she seeks a cooler gaze and calls Mr. Richard Lindley to come and take a turn at looking .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 40]: Now , Mr. Richard Lindley is straight as a die : he will not even show that he hears the call until he is sure that I have been dismissed : therefore , I have no quarrel with him .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 24]: Also , I can not even hate him , for in my clearer julep vision I see that he is but an interregnum .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 17]: Let me not offend my friend : chagrin is to be his as it is mine .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 18]: I was a strong draught , he but the quieting potion our Carmen took to settle it .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 9]: We shall be brothers in woe some day .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 24]: Nothing in the universe lasts except Hell : Life is running water ; Love , a looking-glass ; Death , an empty theatre !
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 14]: That reminds me : as you are not listening I will sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 42]: He finished his drink and lifted his voice hilariously : `` The heavenly stars far above her , The wind of the infinite sea , Who know all her perfidy , love her , So why call it madness in me ?
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 27]: Ah , why call it madness -- '' He set his glass with a crash upon the table , staring over his companion 's shoulder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 21]: _ What _ , if you please , is the royal exile who thus seeks refuge in our hermitage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 17]: His host had already observed the approaching visitor with some surprise , and none too graciously .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 24]: It was Valentine Corliss : he had turned in from the street and was crossing the lawn to join the two young men .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 25]: Lindley rose , and , greeting him with sufficient cordiality , introduced Mr. Vilas , who bestowed upon the newcomer a very lively interest .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 26]: `` You are as welcome , Mr. Corliss , '' said this previous guest , earnestly , `` as if these sylvan shades were mine .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 30]: I hail you , not only for your own sake , but because your presence encourages a hope that our host may offer refreshment to the entire company . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 21]: Corliss smilingly declined to be a party to this diplomacy , and seated himself beside Richard Lindley on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 6]: `` Then I relapse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 12]: exclaimed Mr. Vilas , throwing himself back full-length in the hammock .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 9]: `` I am not replete , but content .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 4]: I shall meditate .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 6]: Gentlemen , speak on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 27]: He waved his hand in a gracious gesture , indicating his intention to remain silent , and lay quiet , his eyes fixed steadfastly upon Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 46]: `` I was coming to call on you , '' said the latter to Lindley , `` but I saw you from the street and thought you might n't mind my being as informal as I used to be , so many years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 8]: `` Of course , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 16]: `` I have a sinister purpose in coming , '' Mr. Corliss laughingly went on .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 16]: `` I want to bore you a little first , and then make your fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 27]: No doubt that 's an old story to you , but I happen to be one of the adventurers whose argosies are laden with real cargoes .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 66]: Nobody knows who has or has n't money to invest nowadays , and of course I 've no means of knowing whether _ you _ have or not -- you see what a direct chap I am -- but if you have , or can lay hold of some , I can show you how to make it bring you an immense deal more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 20]: `` Naturally , '' said Richard pleasantly , `` I shall be glad if you can do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 9]: `` Then I 'll come to the point .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 15]: It is exceedingly simple ; that 's certainly one attractive thing about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 25]: Corliss took some papers and unmounted photographs from his pocket , and began to spread them open on the bench between himself and Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 14]: `` No doubt you know Southern Italy as well as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 11]: `` Oh , I do n't ` know ' it .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 24]: I 've been to Naples ; down to Paestum ; drove from Salerno to Sorrentoby Amalfi ; but that was years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 14]: `` Here 's a large scale map that will refresh your memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 32]: He unfolded it and laid it across their knees ; it was frayed with wear along the folds , and had been heavily marked and dotted with red and blue pencillings .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 14]: `` My millions are in this large irregular section , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 26]: `` It 's the anklebone and instep of Italy 's boot ; this sizable province called Basilicata , east of Salerno , north of Calabria .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 12]: And I 'll not hang fire on the point , Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 9]: What I 've got there is oil . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 4]: `` Olives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 5]: asked Richard , puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 4]: `` Hardly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 3]: Corliss laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 23]: `` Though of course one does n't connect petroleum with the thought of Italy , and of all Italy , Southern Italy .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 47]: But in spite of the years I 've lived there , I 've discovered myself to be so essentially American and commercial that I want to drench the surface of that antique soil with the brown , bad-smelling crude oil that lies so deep beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 16]: Basilicata is the coming great oil-field of the world -- and that 's my secret .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 16]: I dare to tell it here , as I should n't dare in Naples . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 8]: `` Should n't ` dare ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 21]: Richard repeated , with growing interest , and no doubt having some vague expectation of a tale of the Camorra .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 62]: To him Naples had always seemed of all cities the most elusive and incomprehensible , a laughing , thieving , begging , mandolin-playing , music-and-murder haunted metropolis , about which anything was plausible ; and this impression was not unique , as no inconsiderable proportion of Mr. Lindley 's fellow-countrymen share it , a fact thoroughly comprehended by the returned native .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 20]: `` It is n't a case of not daring on account of any bodily danger , '' explained Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 8]: `` No , '' Richard smiled reminiscently .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 16]: `` I do n't believe that would have much weight with you if it were .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 13]: You certainly showed no symptoms of that sort in your extreme youth .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 19]: I remember you had the name of being about the most daring and foolhardy boy in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 23]: `` I grew up to be cautious enough in business , though , '' said the other , shaking his head gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 13]: `` I have n't been able to afford not being careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 9]: He adjusted the map -- a prefatory gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 14]: `` Now , I 'll make this whole affair perfectly clear to you .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 12]: It 's a simple matter , as are most big things .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 40]: I 'll begin by telling you of Moliterno -- he 's been my most intimate friend in that part of the continent for a great many years ; since I went there as a boy , in fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 65]: He sketched a portrait of his friend , Prince Moliterno , bachelor chief of a historic house , the soul of honour , `` land-poor '' ; owning leagues and leagues of land , hills and mountains , broken towers and ruins , in central Basilicata , a province described as wild country and rough , off the rails and not easy to reach .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 57]: Moliterno and the narrator had gone there to shoot ; Corliss had seen `` surface oil '' upon the streams and pools ; he recalled the discovery of oil near his own boyhood home in America ; had talked of it to Moliterno , and both men had become more and more interested , then excited .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 7]: They decided to sink a well .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 64]: Corliss described picturesquely the difficulties of this enterprise , the hardships and disappointments ; how they dragged the big tools over the mountains by mule power ; how they had kept it all secret ; how he and Moliterno had done everything with the help of peasant labourers and one experienced man , who had `` seen service in the Persian oil-fields . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 28]: He gave the business reality , colouring it with details relevant and irrelevant , anecdotes and wayside incidents : he was fluent , elaborate , explicit throughout .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 27]: They sank five wells , he said , `` at the angles of this irregular pentagon you see here on the map , outlined in blue .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 8]: These red circles are the wells . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 35]: Four of the wells `` came in tremendous , '' but they had managed to get them sealed after wasting -- he was `` sorry to think how many thousand barrels of oil . ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 26]: The fifth well was so enormous that they had not been able to seal it at the time of the speaker 's departure for America .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 26]: `` But I had a cablegram this morning , '' he added , `` letting me know they 've managed to do it at last .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 7]: Here is , the cablegram . ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 11]: He handed Richard a form signed `` Antonio Moliterno . ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 28]: `` Now , to go back to what I said about not ` daring ' to speak of this in Naples , '' he continued , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 10]: `` The fear is financial , not physical . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 20]: The knowledge of the lucky strike , he explained , must be kept from the `` Neapolitan money-sharks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 37]: A third of the land so rich in oil already belonged to the Moliterno estates , but it was necessary to obtain possession of the other two thirds `` before the secret leaks into Naples . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 23]: So far , it was safe , the peasants of Basilicata being `` as medieval a lot as one could wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 29]: He related that these peasants thought that the devils hiding inside the mountains had been stabbed by the drills , and that the oil was devils ' blood .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 31]: `` You can see some of the country people hanging about , staring at a well , in this kodak , though it 's not a very good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 27]: He put into Richard 's hand a small , blurred photograph showing a spouting well with an indistinct crowd standing in an irregular semicircle before it .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 9]: `` Is this the Basilicatan peasant costume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 18]: asked Richard , indicating a figure in the foreground , the only one revealed at all definitely .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 6]: `` It looks more oriental .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 9]: Is n't the man wearing a fez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 12]: `` Let me see , '' responded Mr. Corliss very quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 9]: `` Perhaps I gave you the wrong picture .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 28]: Oh , no , '' he laughed easily , holding the kodak closer to his eyes ; `` that 's all right : it is a fez .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 31]: That 's old Salviati , our engineer , the man I spoke of who 'd worked in Persia , you know ; he 's always worn a fez since then .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 17]: Got in the habit of it out there and says he 'll never give it up .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 8]: Moliterno 's always chaffing him about it .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 10]: He 's a faithful old chap , Salviati . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 5]: `` I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 16]: Lindley looked thoughtfully at the picture , which the other carelessly returned to his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 12]: `` There seems to be a lot of oil there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 11]: `` It 's one of the smaller wells at that .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 33]: And you can see from the kodak that it 's just ` blowing ' -- not an eruption from being ` shot , ' or the people would n't stand so near .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 25]: Yes ; there 's an ocean of oil under that whole province ; but we want a lot of money to get at it .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 21]: It 's mountain country ; our wells will all have to go over fifteen-hundred feet , and that 's expensive .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 30]: We want to pipe the oil to Salerno , where the Standard 's ships will take it from us , and it will need a great deal for that .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 27]: But most of all we want money to get hold of the land ; we must control the whole field , and it 's big ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 13]: `` How did you happen to come here to finance it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 7]: `` I was getting to that .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 13]: Moliterno himself is as honourable a man as breathes God 's air .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 19]: But my experience has been that Neapolitan capitalists are about the cleverest and slipperiest financiers in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 25]: We could have financed it twenty times over in Naples in a day , but neither Moliterno nor I was willing to trust them .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 71]: The thing is enormous , you see -- a really colossal fortune -- and Italian law is full of ins and outs , and the first man we talked to confidentially would have given us his word to play straight , and , the instant we left him , would have flown post-haste for Basilicata and grabbed for himself the two thirds of the field not yet in our hands .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 85]: Moliterno and I talked it over many , many times ; we thought of going to Rome for the money , to Paris , to London , to New York ; but I happened to remember the old house here that my aunt had left me -- I wanted to sell it , to add whatever it brought to the money I 've already put in -- and then it struck me I might raise the rest here as well as anywhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 4]: The other nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 5]: `` I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 25]: `` I suppose you 'll think me rather sentimental , '' Corliss went on , with a laugh which unexpectedly betrayed a little shyness .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 16]: `` I 've never forgotten that I was born here -- was a boy here .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 15]: In all my wanderings I 've always really thought of this as home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 39]: His voice trembled slightly and his face flushed ; he smiled deprecatingly as though in apology for these symptoms of emotion ; and at that both listeners felt -LRB- perhaps with surprise -RRB- the man 's strong attraction .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 47]: There was something very engaging about him : in the frankness of his look and in the slight tremor in his voice ; there was something appealing and yet manly in the confession , by this thoroughgoing cosmopolite , of his real feeling for the home-town .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 49]: `` Of course I know how very few people , even among the ` old citizens , ' would have any recollection whatever of me , '' he went on ; `` but that does n't make any difference in my sentiment for the place and its people .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 120]: That street out yonder was named for my grandfather : there 's a statue of my great uncle in the State House yard ; all my own blood : belonged here , and though I have been a wanderer and may not be remembered -- naturally am _ not _ remembered -- yet the name is honoured here , and I -- I -- '' He faltered again , then concluded with quiet earnestness : `` I thought that if my good luck was destined to bring fortunes to others , it might as well be to my own kind -- that at least I 'd offer them the chance before I offered it to any one else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: He turned and looked Richard in the face .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 12]: `` That 's why I 'm here , Mr. Lindley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 8]: The other impulsively put out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 9]: `` I understand , '' he said heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 5]: `` Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: Corliss changed his tone for one less serious .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 16]: `` You 've listened very patiently and I hope you 'll be rewarded for it .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 12]: Certainly you will if you decide to come in with us .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 11]: May I leave the maps and descriptions with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 16]: I 'll look them over carefully and have another talk with you about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 11]: `` Thank heaven , _ that 's _ over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 23]: exclaimed the lounger in the hammock , who had not once removed his fascinated stare from the expressive face of Valentine Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 26]: `` If you have now concluded with dull care , allow me to put a vital question : Mr. Corliss , do you sing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 39]: The gentleman addressed favoured him with a quizzical glance from between half-closed lids , and probably checking an impulse to remark that he happened to know that his questioner sometimes sang , replied merely , `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 7]: `` It is a pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 10]: `` Nothing , '' returned the other , inconsequently .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 15]: `` It just struck me that you ought to sing the Toreador song . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 31]: Richard Lindley , placing the notes and maps in his pocket , dropped them , and , stooping , began to gather the scattered papers with a very red face .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 7]: Corliss , however , laughed good-naturedly .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 34]: `` That 's most flattering , '' he said ; `` though there are other things in ` Carmen ' I prefer -- probably because one does n't hear them so eternally . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 14]: Vilas pulled himself up to a sitting position and began to swing again .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 13]: `` Observe our host , Mr. Corliss , '' he commanded gayly .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 24]: `` He is a kind old Dobbin , much beloved , but cares damn little to hear you or me speak of music .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 31]: He 'd even rather discuss your oil business than listen to us talk of women , whereas nothing except women ever really interests _ you _ , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 24]: He 's not our kind of man , '' he concluded , mournfully ; `` not at all our kind of man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 26]: `` I hope , '' Corliss suggested , `` he 's going to be my kind of man in the development of these oil-fields . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 19]: `` How ridic '' -- Mr. Vilas triumphed over the word after a slight struggle -- `` ulous !
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 16]: I shall review that : ridiculous of you to pretend to be interested in oil-fields .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 9]: You are not that sort of person whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 18]: Nothing could be clearer than that you would never waste the time demanded by fields of oil .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 13]: Groundlings call this ` the mechanical age ' -- a vulgar error .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 16]: My dear sir , you and I know that it is the age of Woman !
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 11]: Even poets have begun to see that she is alive .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 27]: Formerly we did not speak of her at all , but of late years she has become such a scandal that she is getting talked about .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 16]: Even our dramas , which used to be all blood , have become all flesh .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 17]: I wish I were dead -- but will continue my harangue because the thought is pellucid .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 25]: Women selecting men to mate with are of only two kinds , just as there are but two kinds of children in a toy-shop .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 61]: One child sets its fancy on one partic '' -- the orator paused , then continued -- `` on one certain toy and will make a distressing scene if she does n't get it : she will have that one ; she will go straight to it , clasp it and keep it ; she wo n't have any other .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 47]: The other kind of woman is to be understood if you will make the experiment of taking the other kind of child to a toy-shop and telling her you will buy her any toy in the place , but that you will buy her only one .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 63]: If you do this in the morning , she will still be in the shop when it is closing for the night , because , though she runs to each toy in turn with excitement and delight , she sees another over her shoulder , and the one she has not touched is always her choice -- until she has touched it !
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 7]: Some get broken in the handling .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 18]: For my part , my wires are working rather rustily , but I must obey the Stage-Manager .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 16]: For my requiem I wish somebody would ask them to play Gounod 's masterpiece . ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 6]: asked Corliss , amused . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 10]: ` The Funeral March of a Marionette ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 19]: `` I suppose you mean that for a cheerful way of announcing that you are a fatalist . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 3]: `` Fatalism ?
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 12]: That is only a word , '' declared Mr. Vilas gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 13]: `` If I am not a puppet then I am a god .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 11]: Somehow , I do not seem to be a god .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 15]: If a god is a god , one thinks he would know it himself .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 6]: I now yield the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 17]: Thanking you cordially , I believe there is a lady walking yonder who commands salutation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 9]: He rose to his feet , bowing profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 20]: Cora Madison was passing , strolling rather briskly down the street , not in the direction of her home .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 25]: She waved her parasol with careless gayety to the trio under the trees , and , going on , was lost to their sight .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 13]: exclaimed Corliss , looking at his watch with a start of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 12]: `` I have two letters to write for the evening mail .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 6]: I must be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 36]: At this , Ray Vilas 's eyes -- still fixed upon him , as they had been throughout the visit -- opened to their fullest capacity , in a gaze of only partially alcoholic wildness .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 23]: Entirely aware of this singular glare , but not in the least disconcerted by it , the recipient proffered his easy farewells .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 10]: `` I had no idea it was so late .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 3]: Good afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 11]: Mr. Vilas , I have been delighted with your diagnosis .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 15]: Lindley , I 'm at your disposal when you 've looked over my data .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 13]: My very warm thanks for your patience , and -- addio ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 41]: Lindley looked after him as he strode quickly away across the green lawn , turning , at the street , in the direction Cora had taken ; and the troubled Richard felt his heart sink with vague but miserable apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 26]: There was a gasp of desperation beside him , and the sound of Ray Vilas 's lips parting and closing with little noises of pain .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 16]: `` So he knows her , '' said the boy , his thin body shaking .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 8]: `` Look at him , damn him !
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 32]: See his deep chest , that conqueror 's walk , the easy , confident , male pride of him : a true-born , natural rake -- the Toreador all over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 23]: His agitation passed suddenly ; he broke into a loud laugh , and flung a reckless hand to his companion 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 11]: `` You good old fool , '' he cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 10]: _ You 'll _ never play Don Jose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 52]: CHAPTER EIGHT Hedrick Madison , like too many other people , had never thought seriously about the moon ; nor ever had he encouraged it to become his familiar ; and he underwent his first experience of its incomparable betrayals one brilliant night during the last week of that hot month .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 61]: The preface to this romantic evening was substantial and prosaic : four times during dinner was he copiously replenished with hash , which occasioned so rich a surfeit within him that , upon the conclusion of the meal , he found himself in no condition to retort appropriately to a solicitous warning from Cora to keep away from the cat .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 31]: Indeed , it was half an hour later , and he was sitting -- to his own consciousness too heavily -- upon the back fence , when belated inspiration arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 19]: But there is no sound where there is no ear to hear , and no repartee , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 51]: when the wretch who said the first part has gone , so that Cora remained unscathed as from his alley solitude Hedrick hurled in the teeth of the rising moon these bitter words : `` Oh , no ; _ our _ cat only eats _ soft _ meat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 35]: He renewed a morbid silence , and the moon , with its customary deliberation , swung clear of a sweeping branch of the big elm in the front yard and shone full upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 42]: Nothing warned the fated youth not to sit there ; no shadow of imminent catastrophe tinted that brightness : no angel whisper came to him , bidding him begone -- and to go in a hurry and as far as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 33]: No ; he sat upon the fence an inoffensive lad , and -- except for still feeling his hash somewhat , and a gradually dispersing rancour concerning the cat -- at peace .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 16]: It is for such lulled mortals that the ever-lurking Furies save their most hideous surprises .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 19]: Chin on palms , he looked idly at the moon , and the moon inscrutably returned his stare .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 18]: Plausible , bright , bland , it gave no sign that it was at its awful work .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 22]: For the bride of night is like a card-dealer whose fingers move so swiftly through the pack the trickery goes unseen .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 44]: This moon upon which he was placidly gazing , because he had nothing else to do , betokened nought to Hedrick : to him it was the moon of any other night , the old moon ; certainly no moon of his delight .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 23]: Withal , it may never be gazed upon so fixedly and so protractedly -- no matter how languidly -- with entire impunity .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 9]: That light breeds a bug in the brain .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 27]: Who can deny how the moon wrought this thing under the hair of unconscious Hedrick , or doubt its responsibility for the thing that happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 6]: _ Little boy _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 46]: It was a very soft , small voice , silky and queer ; and at first Hedrick had little suspicion that it could be addressing him : the most rigid self-analysis could have revealed to him no possibility of his fitting so ignominious a description .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 7]: `` Oh , little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 23]: He looked over his shoulder and saw , standing in the alley behind him , a girl of about his own age .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 16]: She was daintily dressed and had beautiful hair which was all shining in pale gold .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 5]: `` Little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 22]: She was smiling up at him , and once more she used that wantonly inaccurate vocative : `` Little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 4]: Hedrick grunted unencouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 11]: `` Who you callin ' ` little boy ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 9]: For reply she began to climb the fence .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 38]: It was high , but the young lady was astonishingly agile , and not even to be deterred by several faint wails from tearing and ripping fabrics -- casualties which appeared to be entirely beneath her notice .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 31]: Arriving at the top rather dishevelled , and with irregular pennons here and there flung to the breeze from her attire , she seated herself cosily beside the dumbfounded Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 22]: She turned her face to him and smiled -- and there was something about her smile which Hedrick did not like .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 7]: It discomforted him ; nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 20]: In sunlight he would have had the better chance to comprehend ; but , unhappily , this was moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 8]: `` Kiss me , little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 6]: `` I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 13]: exclaimed the shocked and indignant Hedrick , edging uneasily away from her .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 10]: `` Let 's play , '' she said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 5]: `` Play what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 5]: `` I like chickens .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 8]: Did you know I like chickens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 18]: The rather singular lack of connection in her remarks struck him as a misplaced effort at humour .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 15]: `` You 're having lots of fun with me , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 13]: She instantly moved close to him and lifted her face to his .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 9]: `` Kiss me , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 39]: There was something more than uncommonly queer about this stranger , an unearthliness of which he was confusedly perceptive , but she was not without a curious kind of prettiness , and her pale gold hair was beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 10]: The doomed lad saw the moon shining through it .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 9]: `` Kiss me , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 11]: His head whirled ; for the moment she seemed divine .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 10]: George Washington used profanity at the Battle of Monmouth .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 4]: Hedrick kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 9]: He instantly pushed her away with strong distaste .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 4]: he said angrily .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 9]: `` I hope that 'll satisfy you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 6]: He belonged to his sex .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 11]: `` Kiss me some more , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 10]: she cried , and flung her arms about him .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 40]: With a smothered shout of dismay he tried to push her off , and they fell from the fence together , into the yard , at the cost of further and almost fatal injuries to the lady 's apparel .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 7]: Hedrick was first upon his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 11]: `` Have n't you got _ any _ sense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 23]: She smiled unwaveringly , rose -LRB- without assistance -RRB- and repeated : `` Kiss me some more , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 7]: `` No , I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 9]: I would n't for a thousand dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 9]: Apparently , she did not consider this discouraging .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 11]: She began to advance endearingly , while he retreated backward .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 16]: `` Kiss me some -- '' `` I wo n't , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 11]: Hedrick kept stepping away , moving in a desperate circle .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 14]: He resorted to a brutal formula : `` You make me sick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 16]: `` Kiss me some more , darling lit -- '' `` I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 3]: he bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 22]: `` And if you say that again I 'll -- '' `` Kiss me some more , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 19]: She flung herself at him , and with a yell of terror he turned and ran at top-speed .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 23]: She pursued , laughing sweetly , and calling loudly as she ran , `` Kiss me some more , darling little boy !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 10]: Kiss me some more , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 83]: The stricken Hedrick knew not whither to direct his flight : he dared not dash for the street with this imminent tattered incubus -- she was almost upon him -- and he frantically made for the kitchen door , only to swerve with a gasp of despair as his foot touched the step , for she was at his heels , and he was sickeningly assured she would cheerfully follow him through the house , shouting that damning refrain for all ears .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 32]: A strangling fear took him by the throat -- if Cora should come to be a spectator of this unspeakable flight , if Cora should hear that horrid plea for love !
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 13]: Then farewell peace ; indeed , farewell all joy in life forever !
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 15]: Panting sobbingly , he ducked under the amorous vampire 's arm and fled on .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 44]: He zigzagged desperately to and fro across the broad , empty backyard , a small hand ever and anon managing to clutch his shoulder , the awful petition in his ears : `` Kiss me some more , darling little boy ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 5]: _ Hedrick _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 31]: Emerging from the kitchen door , Laura stood and gazed in wonder as the two eerie figures sped by her , circled , ducked , dodged , flew madly on .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 50]: This commonplace purlieu was become the scene of a witch-chase ; the moonlight fell upon the ghastly flitting face of the pursued , uplifted in agony , white , wet , with fay eyes ; also it illumined the unreal elf following close , a breeze-blown fantasy in rags .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 11]: `` Kiss me some more , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 6]: Laura uttered a sharp exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 7]: `` Stand still , Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 3]: she called .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 5]: `` You must ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 10]: Hedrick made a piteous effort to increase his speed .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 10]: `` It 's Lolita Martin , '' called Laura .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 14]: `` She must have her way or nothing can be done with her .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 6]: Stand _ still _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 30]: Hedrick had never heard of Lolita Martin , but the added information concerning her was not ineffective : it operated as a spur ; and Laura joined the hunt .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 5]: `` Stand still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 7]: she cried to the wretched quarry .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 6]: `` She 's run away .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 6]: She must be taken home .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 4]: Stop , Hedrick !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: You _ must _ stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 27]: Hedrick had no intention of stopping , but Laura was a runner , and , as he dodged the other , caught and held him fast .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 18]: The next instant , Lolita , laughing happily , flung her arms round his neck from behind .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 6]: `` Lem me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: shuddered Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 6]: `` Lem me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 14]: `` Kiss me again , darl -- '' `` I -- woof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 4]: He became inarticulate .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 16]: `` She is n't quite right , '' his sister whispered hurriedly in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 10]: `` She has spells when she 's weak mentally .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 7]: You must be kind to her .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 15]: She only wants you to -- '' '' ` _ Only _ ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 4]: he echoed hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 15]: `` I wo n't ki -- '' He was unable to finish the word .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 12]: `` We must get her home , '' said Laura anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 12]: `` Will you come with me , Lolita , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 11]: Apparently Lolita had no consciousness whatever of Laura 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 16]: Instead of replying , she tightened her grasp upon Hedrick and warmly reiterated her request .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 8]: `` Shut up , you parrot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 5]: hissed the goaded boy .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 21]: `` Perhaps she 'll go if you let her walk with her arms round your neck , '' suggested Laura .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 8]: `` If I _ what _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 6]: `` Let 's try it .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 16]: We 've got to get her home ; her mother must be frantic about her .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 15]: Come , let 's see if she 'll go with us that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 62]: With convincing earnestness , Hedrick refused to make the experiment until Laura suggested that he remain with Lolita while she summoned assistance ; then , as no alternative appeared , his spirit broke utterly , and he consented to the trial , stipulating with a last burst of vehemence that the progress of the unthinkable pageant should be through the alley .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: `` Come , Lolita , '' said Laura coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 10]: `` We 're going for a nice walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 36]: At the adjective , Hedrick 's burdened shoulders were racked with a brief spasm , which recurred as his sister added : `` Your darling little boy will let you keep hold of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 4]: Lolita seemed content .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 44]: Laughing gayly , she offered no opposition , but , maintaining her embrace with both arms and walking somewhat sidewise , went willingly enough ; and the three slowly crossed the yard , passed through the empty stable and out into the alley .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 16]: When they reached the cross-street at the alley 's upper end , Hedrick balked flatly .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 6]: Laura expostulated , then entreated .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 19]: Hedrick refused with sincere loathing to be seen upon the street occupying his present position in the group .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 40]: Laura assured him that there was no one to see ; he replied that the moon was bright and the evening early ; he would die , and readily , but he would not set foot in the street .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 38]: Unfortunately , he had selected an unfavourable spot for argument : they were already within a yard or two of the street ; and a strange boy , passing , stopped and observed , and whistled discourteously .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 8]: `` Ai n't he the spooner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 7]: remarked this unknown with hideous admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 21]: `` I 'll thank you , '' returned Hedrick haughtily , `` to go on about your own business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 11]: `` Kiss me some more , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 3]: said Lolita .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 29]: The strange boy squawked , wailed , screamed with laughter , howled the loving petition in a dozen keys of mockery , while Hedrick writhed and Lolita clung .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 20]: Enriched by a new and great experience , the torturer trotted on , leaving viperish cachinnations in his wake .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 8]: But the martyrdom was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 29]: A woman , hurrying past , bareheaded , was greeted by a cry of delight from Lolita , who released Hedrick and ran to her with outstretched arms .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 16]: `` We were bringing her home , Mrs. Martin , '' said Laura , reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 17]: `` She 's all right ; nothing 's the matter except that her dress got torn .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 9]: We found her playing in our yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 57]: `` I thank you a thousand times , Miss Madison , '' cried Lolita 's mother , and flutteringly plunged into a description of her anxiety , her search for Lolita , and concluded with renewed expressions of gratitude for the child 's safe return , an outpouring of thankfulness and joy wholly incomprehensible to Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 10]: `` Not at all , '' said Laura cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 5]: `` Come , Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 12]: We 'll go home by the street , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 14]: She touched his shoulder , and he went with her in stunned obedience .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 23]: He was not able to face the incredible thing that had happened to him : he walked in a trance of horror .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 6]: `` Poor little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 15]: said Laura gently , with what seemed to her brother an indefensibly misplaced compassion .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 30]: `` Usually they have her live in an institution for people afflicted as she is , but they brought her home for a visit last week , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 17]: Of course you did n't understand , but I think you should have been more thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 11]: Really , you should n't have flirted with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 5]: Hedrick stopped short . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 7]: ` _ Flirted _ ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 25]: His voice was beginning to show symptoms of changing , this year ; it rose to a falsetto wail , flickered and went out .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 28]: With the departure of Lolita in safety , what had seemed bizarre and piteous became obscured , and another aspect of the adventure was presented to Laura .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 23]: The sufferings of the arrogant are not wholly depressing to the spectator ; and of arrogance Hedrick had ever been a master .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 29]: She began to shake ; a convulsion took her , and suddenly she sat upon the curbstone without dignity , and laughed as he had never seen her .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 23]: A horrid distrust of her rose within him : he began to realize in what plight he stood , what terrors o'erhung .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 36]: `` Look here , '' he said miserably , `` are you -- you are n't -- you do n't have to go and -- and _ talk _ about this , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 15]: `` No , Hedrick , '' she responded , rising and controlling herself somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 10]: `` Not so long as you 're good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 6]: This was no reassuring answer .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 10]: `` And politer to Cora , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 13]: Seemingly he heard the lash of a slave-whip crack in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 5]: The future grew dark .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 43]: `` I know you 'll try '' -- she said ; and the unhappy lad felt that her assurance was justified ; but she had not concluded the sentence -- `` darling little boy , '' she capped it , choking slightly .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 18]: `` No other little girl ever fell in love with you , did there , Hedrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 28]: she asked , and , receiving an incoherent but furious reply , she was again overcome , so that she must lean against the fence to recover .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 44]: `` It seems -- so -- so _ curious _ , '' she explained , gasping , `` that the first one -- the -- the only one -- should be an -- a -- an -- '' She was unable to continue .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 16]: Hedrick 's distrust became painfully increased : he began to feel that he disliked Laura .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 49]: She was still wiping her eyes and subject to recurrent outbursts when they reached their own abode ; and as he bitterly flung himself into a chair upon the vacant front porch , he heard her stifling an attack as she mounted the stairs to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 19]: He swung the chair about , with its back to the street , and sat facing the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 4]: He saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 14]: There are profundities in the abyss which reveal no glimpse of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 22]: Presently he heard his father coughing near by ; and the sound was hateful , because it seemed secure and unshamed .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 66]: It was a cough of moral superiority ; and just then the son would have liked to believe that his parent 's boyhood had been one of degradation as complete as his own ; but no one with this comfortable cough could ever have plumbed such depths : his imagination refused the picture he was bitterly certain that Mr. Madison had never kissed an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 21]: Hedrick had a dread that his father might speak to him ; he was in no condition for light conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 19]: But Mr. Madison was unaware of his son 's near presence , and continued upon his purposeless way .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 12]: He was smoking his one nightly cigar and enjoying the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 32]: He drifted out toward the sidewalk and was accosted by a passing acquaintance , a comfortable burgess of sixty , leading a child of six or seven , by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 13]: `` Out taking the air , are you , Mr. Madison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 6]: said the pedestrian , pausing .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 14]: `` Yes ; just trying to cool off , '' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 9]: `` How are you , Pryor , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 11]: I have n't seen you for a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 10]: `` Not since last summer , '' said Pryor .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 17]: `` I only get here once or twice a year , to see my married daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 12]: I always try to spend August with her if I can .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 24]: She 's still living in that little house , over on the next street , I bought for her through your real-estate company .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 11]: I suppose you 're still in the same business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 7]: Pretty slack , these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 16]: `` I suppose so , I suppose so , '' responded Mr. Pryor , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: `` Summer , I suppose it usually is .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 18]: Well , I do n't know when I 'll be going out on the road again myself .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 12]: Business is pretty slack all over the country this year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 14]: `` Let 's see -- I 've forgotten , '' said Madison ruminatively .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 9]: `` You travel , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 12]: `` For a New York house , '' affirmed Mr. Pryor .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 12]: He did not , however , mention his `` line . ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 51]: `` Yes-sir , '' he added , merely as a decoration , and then said briskly : `` I see you have a fine family , Mr. Madison ; yes-sir , a fine family ; I 've passed here several times lately and I 've noticed 'em : fine family .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 14]: Let 's see , you 've got four , have n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 7]: `` Three , '' said Madison .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 8]: `` Two girls and a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 21]: `` Well , sir , that 's mighty nice , '' observed Mr. Pryor ; '' _ mighty _ nice !
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 37]: I only have my one daughter , and of course me living in New York when I 'm at home , and her here , why , I do n't get to see much of her .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 14]: You got both your daughters living with you , have n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 9]: `` Yes , right here at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 15]: `` Let 's see : neither of 'em 's married , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 7]: `` No ; not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 40]: `` Seems to me now , '' said Pryor , taking off his glasses and wiping them , `` seems to me I did hear somebody say one of 'em was going to be married engaged , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Madison .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 8]: `` Not that I know of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 13]: `` Well , I suppose you 'd be the first to know !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 3]: Yes-sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 10]: And both men laughed their appreciation of this folly .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 18]: `` They 're mighty good-looking girls , _ that 's _ certain , '' continued Mr. Pryor .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 23]: `` And one of 'em 's as fine a dresser as you 'll meet this side the Rue de la Paix . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 7]: `` You mean in Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 9]: asked Madison , slightly surprised at this allusion .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 10]: `` You 've been over there , Pryor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 10]: `` Oh , sometimes , '' was the response .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 11]: `` My business takes me over , now and then .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 17]: I _ think _ it 's one of your daughters I 've noticed dresses so well .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 40]: Is n't one of 'em a mighty pretty girl about twenty-one or two , with a fine head of hair sort of lightish brown , beautiful figure , and carries a white parasol with a green lining sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 11]: `` Yes , that 's Cora , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: `` Pretty name , too , '' said Pryor approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 3]: `` Yes-sir .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 29]: I saw her going into a florist 's , downtown , the other day , with a fine-looking young fellow -- I ca n't think of his name .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 43]: Let 's see : my daughter was with me , and she 'd heard his name -- said his family used to be big people in this town and -- '' `` Oh , '' said Madison , `` young Corliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 4]: `` Corliss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 7]: exclaimed Mr. Pryor , with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: `` That 's it , Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 37]: Well , sir , '' he chuckled , `` from the way he was looking at your Miss Cora it struck me he seemed kind of anxious for her name to be Corliss , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 12]: `` Well , hardly I expect , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 31]: `` They just barely know each other : he 's only been here a few weeks ; they have n't had time to get much acquainted , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 14]: `` I suppose not , '' agreed Mr. Pryor , with perfect readiness .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 5]: `` I suppose not .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 22]: I 'll bet _ he _ tries all he can to get acquainted though ; he looked pretty smart to me .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 13]: Does n't he come about as often as the law allows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 12]: `` I should n't be surprised , '' said Madison indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 22]: `` He does n't know many people about here any more , and it 's lonesome for him at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 28]: But I guess he comes to see the whole family ; I left him in the library a little while ago , talking to my wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 6]: `` That 's the way !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 8]: Get around the old folks first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 29]: Mr. Pryor chuckled cordially ; then in a mildly inquisitive tone he said : `` Seems to be a fine , square young fellow , I expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 8]: `` Yes , I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 12]: `` Pretty name , ` Cora ' , '' said Pryor .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 10]: `` What 's this little girl 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 17]: Mr. Madison indicated the child , who had stood with heroic patience throughout the incomprehensible dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 7]: `` Lottie , for her mother .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 8]: She 's a good little girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 7]: `` She is _ so _ !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 33]: I 've got a young son she ought to know , '' remarked Mr. Madison serenely , with an elderly father 's total unconsciousness of the bridgeless gap between seven and thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 9]: `` He 'd like to play with her .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 6]: I 'll call him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 13]: `` I expect we better be getting on , '' said Pryor .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 18]: `` It 's near Lottie 's bedtime ; we just came out for our evening walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 19]: `` Well , he can come and shake hands with her anyway , '' urged Hedrick 's father .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 17]: `` Then they 'll know each other , and they can play some other time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 13]: He turned toward the house and called loudly : `` Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 5]: There was no response .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 12]: Behind the back of his chair Hedrick could not be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 14]: He was still sitting immovable , his eyes torpidly fixed upon the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 8]: `` Hed - _ rick _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 2]: Silence .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 10]: `` Oh , _ Hed _ - rick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 4]: shouted his father .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 5]: `` Come out here !
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 9]: I want you to meet a little girl !
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 9]: Come and see a nice little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 9]: Mr. Pryor 's grandchild was denied the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 47]: At the ghastly words '' _ little girl _ , '' Hedrick dropped from his chair flat upon the floor , crawled to the end of the porch , wriggled through the railing , and immersed himself in deep shadow against the side of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 29]: Here he removed his shoes , noiselessly mounted to the sill of one of the library windows , then reconnoitred through a slit in the blinds before entering .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 25]: The gas burned low in the `` drop-light '' -- almost too dimly to reveal the two people upon a sofa across the room .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 19]: It was a faint murmur from one of them that caused Hedrick to pause and peer more sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 20]: They were Cora and Corliss ; he was bending close to her ; her face was lifting to his .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 6]: `` Ah , kiss me !
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 4]: Kiss me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 33]: Hedrick dropped from the sill , climbed through a window of the kitchen , hurried up the back-stairs , and reached his own apartment in time to be violently ill in seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 24]: CHAPTER NINE Villages are scattered plentifully over the unstable buttresses of Vesuvius , and the inhabitants sleep o ' nights : Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 28]: Quite unaware that he was much of their condition , Mr. Madison bade his incidental gossip and the tiny Lottie good-night , and sought his early bed .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 41]: He maintained in good faith that Saturday night was `` a great night to sleep , '' because of the later hour for rising ; probably having also some factitious conviction that there prevailed a hush preparative of the Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 24]: As a matter of fact , in summer , the other members of his family always looked uncommonly haggard at the Sunday breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 42]: Accepting without question his preposterous legend of additional matutinal slumber , they postponed retiring to a late hour , and were awakened -- simultaneously with thousands of fellow-sufferers -- at about half-after five on Sunday morning , by a journalistic uprising .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 40]: Over the town , in these early hours , rampaged the small vendors of the manifold sheets : local papers and papers from greater cities , hawker succeeding hawker with yell upon yell and brain-piercing shrillings in unbearable cadences .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 54]: No good burgher ever complained : the people bore it , as in winter they bore the smoke that injured their health , ruined their linen , spoiled their complexions , forbade all hope of beauty and comfort in their city , and destroyed the sweetness of their homes and of their wives .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 11]: It is an incredibly patient citizenry and exalts its persecutors .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 26]: Of the Madison family , Cora probably suffered most ; and this was the time when it was no advantage to have the front bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 25]: She had not slept until close upon dawn , and the hawkers woke her irreparably ; she could but rage upon her hot pillow .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 16]: By and by , there came a token that another anguish kept company with hers .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 30]: She had left her door open for a better circulation of the warm and languid air , and from Hedrick 's room issued an '' _ oof _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 4]: of agonized disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 17]: Cora little suspected that the youth reeked not of newsboys : Hedrick 's miseries were introspective .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 43]: The cries from the street were interminable ; each howler in turn heard faintly in the distance , then in crescendo until he had passed and another succeeded him , and all the while Cora lay tossing and whispering between clenched teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 17]: Having ample reason , that morning , to prefer sleep to thinking , sleep was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 36]: But she fought for it : she did not easily surrender what she wanted ; and she struggled on , with closed eyes , long after she had heard the others go down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 35]: About a hundred yards from her windows , to the rear , were the open windows of a church which fronted the next street , and stood dos-a-dos to the dwelling of the Madisons .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 34]: The Sunday-school hour had been advanced for the hot weather , and , partly on this account , and partly because of the summer absence of many families , the attendants were few .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 36]: But the young voices were conducted , rather than accompanied , in pious melody by a cornetist who worthily thought to amend , in his single person , what lack of volume this paucity occasioned .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 60]: He was a slender young man in hot black clothes ; he wore the unfacaded collar fatally and unanimously adopted by all adam 's - apple men of morals ; he was washed , fair , flat-skulled , clean-minded , and industrious ; and the only noise of any kind he ever made in the world was on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 22]: `` Prashus joowuls , sweet joowuls , _ thee _ jams off iz crowowun , '' sang the little voices feebly .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 20]: They were almost unheard ; but the young man helped them out : figuratively , he put them out .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 41]: And the cornet was heard : it was heard for blocks and blocks ; it was heard over all that part of the town -- in the vicinity of the church it was the only thing that could be heard .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 29]: In his daily walk this cornetist had no enemies : he was kind-hearted ; he would not have shot a mad dog ; he gladly nursed the sick .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 25]: He sat upon the platform before the children ; he swelled , perspired and blew , and felt that it was a good blowing .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 36]: If other thoughts vapoured upon the borders of his mind , they were of the dinner he would eat , soon after noon , at the house of one of the frilled , white-muslin teachers .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 4]: He was serene .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 58]: His eyes were not blasted ; his heart was not instantly withered ; his thin , bluish hair did not fall from his head ; his limbs were not detached from his torso -- yet these misfortunes had been desired for him , with comprehension and sincerity , at the first flat blat of his brassy horn .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 47]: It is impossible to imagine the state of mind of this young cornetist , could he have known that he had caused the prettiest girl in town to jump violently out of bed with what petitions upon her lips regarding his present whereabouts and future detention !
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 41]: It happened that during the course of his Sunday walk on Corliss Street , that very afternoon , he saw her -- was hard-smitten by her beauty , and for weeks thereafter laid unsuccessful plans to `` meet '' her .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 33]: Her image was imprinted : he talked about her to his boarding-house friends and office acquaintances , his favourite description being , `` the sweetest-looking lady I ever laid eyes on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 32]: Cora , descending to the breakfast-table rather white herself , was not unpleasantly shocked by the haggard aspect of Hedrick , who , with Laura and Mrs. Madison , still lingered .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 63]: `` Good-morning , Cora , '' he said politely , and while she stared , in suspicious surprise , he passed her a plate of toast with ostentatious courtesy ; but before she could take one of the slices , `` Wait , '' he said ; `` it 's very nice toast , but I 'm afraid it is n't hot .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 15]: I 'll take it to the kitchen and have it warmed for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 12]: And he took the plate and went out , walking softly .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 8]: Cora turned to her mother , appalled .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 7]: `` He 'll be sick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 9]: Mrs. Madison shook her head and smiled sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 19]: `` He helped to wait on all of us : he must have been doing something awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 12]: `` More likely he wants permission to do something awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 7]: Laura looked out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 26]: `` There , Cora , '' said Hedrick kindly , when he brought the toast ; `` you 'll find that nice and hot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 13]: She regarded him steadfastly , but with modesty he avoided her eye .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 38]: `` You would n't make such a radical change in your nature , Hedrick , '' she said , with a puzzled frown , `` just to get out of going to church , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 17]: `` I do n't want to get out of going to church , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 4]: He gulped slightly .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 6]: `` I like church . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 46]: And church-time found him marching decorously beside his father , the three ladies forming a rear rank ; a small company in the very thin procession of fanning women and mopping men whose destination was the gray stone church at the foot of Corliss Street .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 16]: The locusts railed overhead : Hedrick looked neither to the right nor to the left .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 43]: They passed a club , of which a lower window was vacated simultaneously with their coming into view ; and a small but ornate figure in pale gray crash hurried down the steps and attached itself to the second row of Madisons .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 9]: `` Good-morning , '' said Mr. Wade Trumble .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 14]: `` Thought I 'd take a look-in at church this morning myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 31]: Care of this encumbrance was usually expected of Laura and Mrs. Madison , but to their surprise Cora offered a sprightly rejoinder and presently dropped behind them with Mr. Trumble .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 12]: Mr. Trumble was also surprised and , as naively , pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 6]: `` What 's happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 6]: he asked with cheerful frankness .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 18]: `` You have n't given me a chance to talk to you for a long while . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 6]: `` Have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 4]: she smiled enigmatically .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 12]: `` I do n't think you 've tried very hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 15]: This was too careless ; it did not quite serve , even for Trumble .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 6]: `` What 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 7]: he asked , not without shrewdness .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 9]: `` Is Richard Lindley out of town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 9]: Perhaps it 's this new chap , Corliss ?
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 5]: Has he left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 4]: `` What nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 14]: What have they got to do with my being nice to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 14]: She gave him a dangerous smile , and it wrought upon him visibly .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 19]: `` Do n't you ever be nice to me unless you mean it , '' he said feebly .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 11]: Cora looked grave and sweet ; she seemed mysteriously moved .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 23]: `` I never do anything I do n't mean , '' she said in a low voice which thrilled the little man .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 8]: This was machine-work , easy and accurate .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 9]: `` Cora -- '' he began , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 12]: she exclaimed , shifting on the instant to a lively brusqueness .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 11]: `` That 's enough for you just _ now _ .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 9]: We 're on our way to church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 9]: Trumble felt almost that she had accepted him .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 12]: `` Have you got your penny for the contribution box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 3]: she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 13]: `` I suppose you really give a great deal to the church .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 9]: I hear you 're richer and richer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 12]: `` I do pretty well , '' he returned , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 13]: `` You can know just how well , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 27]: `` Not on Sunday , '' she laughed ; then went on , admiringly , `` I hear you 're very dashing in your speculations . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 17]: `` Then you 've heard wrong , because I do n't speculate , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 11]: `` I 'm not a gambler -- except on certainties .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 23]: I guess I disappointed a friend of yours the other day because I would n't back him on a thousand-to-one shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 6]: `` Who was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 9]: she asked , with an expression entirely veiled .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 3]: `` Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 17]: He came to see me ; wanted me to put real money into an oil scheme .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: Too thin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 10]: `` Why is it ` too thin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 4]: she asked carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 13]: `` Too far away , for one thing -- somewhere in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 23]: Anybody who put up his cash would have to do it on Corliss 's bare word that he 's struck oil . ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 17]: She turned her face to him , and a faint perturbation was manifest in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 17]: `` Is n't Mr. Corliss 's ` bare word ' supposed to be perfectly good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 13]: `` Oh , I suppose so , but I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 19]: He is n't known here : nobody really knows anything about him except that he was born here .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 24]: Besides , I would n't make an investment on my own father 's bare word , if he happened to be alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 5]: `` Perhaps not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 19]: Cora spoke impulsively , a sudden anger getting the better of her , but she controlled it immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 15]: `` Of course I do n't mean that , '' she laughed , sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 30]: `` But _ I _ happen to think Mr. Corliss 's scheme a very handsome one , and I want my friends to make their fortunes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 10]: Richard Lindley and papa are going into it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 13]: `` I 'll bet they do n't , '' said Trumble promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 18]: `` Lindley told me he 'd looked it over and could n't see his way to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 5]: `` He did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 8]: Cora stiffened perceptibly and bit her lip .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 5]: Trumble began to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 11]: `` This is funny : you trying to talk business !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 10]: So Corliss has been telling you about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 12]: `` Yes , he has ; and I understand it perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 36]: I think there 's an enormous fortune in it , and you 'd better not laugh at me : a woman 's instinct about such things is better than a man 's experience sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 20]: `` You 'll find neither Lindley nor your father are going to think so , '' he returned skeptically .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: She gave him a deep , sweet look .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 31]: `` But I must n't be disappointed in you , '' she said , with the suggestion of a tremor in her voice , `` whatever _ they _ do !
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 13]: You 'll take my advice , wo n't you -- Wade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 12]: `` I 'll take your advice in anything but business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 6]: He shook his head ominously .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 28]: `` And would n't you take my advice in business , '' -- she asked very slowly and significantly -- `` under _ any _ circumstances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 17]: `` You mean , '' he said huskily , `` if you were my wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 10]: She looked away , and slightly inclined her head .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 13]: `` No , '' he answered doggedly , `` I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 44]: You know mighty well that 's what I want you to be , and I 'd give my soul for the tip of your shoe , but business is an entirely different matter , and I -- '' '' _ Wade _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 9]: she said , with wonderful and thrilling sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 23]: They had reached the church ; Hedrick and his father had entered ; Mrs. Madison and Laura were waiting on the steps .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 11]: Cora and Trumble came to a stop some yards away .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 16]: `` Wade , I -- I _ want _ you to go into this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 11]: `` Ca n't do it , '' he said stubbornly .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 41]: `` If you ever make up your mind to marry me , I 'll spend all the money you like on _ you _ , but you 'll have to keep to the woman 's side of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 31]: `` You make it pretty hard for me to be nice to you , '' she returned , and the tremor now more evident in her voice was perfectly genuine .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 12]: `` You positively refuse to do this -- for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: `` Yes I do .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 15]: I would n't buy sight-unseen to please God ` lmighty , Cora Madison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: He looked at her shrewdly , struck by a sudden thought .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 13]: `` Did Corliss ask you to try and get me in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 11]: `` He did not , '' she responded , icily .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 7]: `` Your refusal is final ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 4]: `` Certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 11]: He struck the pavement a smart rap with his walking-stick .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 13]: `` By George , I believe he _ did _ ask you !
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 14]: That spoils church for me this morning ; I 'll not go in .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: When you quit playing games , let me know .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 34]: You need n't try to work me any more , because I wo n't stand for it , but if you ever get tired of playing , come and tell me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: He uttered a bark of rueful laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 16]: I must say that gentleman has an interesting way of combining business with pleasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 15]: Under favourable circumstances the blow Cora dealt him might have been physically more violent .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: `` Good-morning , '' she laughed , gayly .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 14]: `` I 'm not bothering much about Mr. Corliss 's oil in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 28]: I had a bet with Laura I could keep you from saying ` I beg to differ , ' or talking about the weather for five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 8]: She 'll have to pay me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 45]: Then , still laughing , she lowered her parasol , and with superb impudence , brushed it smartly across his face ; turned on her heel , and , red with fury , joined her mother and sister , and went into the church .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 18]: The service failed to occupy her attention : she had much in her thoughts to distract her .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 18]: Nevertheless , she bestowed some wonderment upon the devotion with which her brother observed each ceremonial rite .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 40]: He joined in prayer with real fervour ; he sang earnestly and loudly ; a great appeal sounded in his changing voice ; and during the sermon he sat with his eyes upon the minister in a stricken fixity .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 37]: All this was so remarkable that Cora could not choose but ponder upon it , and , observing Hedrick furtively , she caught , if not a clue itself , at least a glimpse of one .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 36]: She saw Laura 's clear profile becoming subtly agitated ; then noticed a shimmer of Laura 's dark eye as it wandered to Hedrick and so swiftly away it seemed not to dare to remain .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 28]: Cora was quick : she perceived that Laura was repressing a constant desire to laugh and that she feared to look at Hedrick lest it overwhelm her .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 9]: So Laura knew what had wrought the miracle .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 11]: Cora made up her mind to explore this secret passage .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 44]: When the service was over and the people were placidly buzzing their way up the aisles , Cora felt herself drawn to look across the church , and following the telepathic impulse , turned her head to encounter the gaze of Ray Vilas .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 12]: He was ascending the opposite aisle , walking beside Richard Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 36]: He looked less pale than usual , though his thinness was so extreme it was like emaciation ; but his eyes were clear and quiet , and the look he gave her was strangely gentle .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 13]: Cora frowned and turned away her head with an air of annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 35]: They came near each other in the convergence at the doors ; but he made no effort to address her , and , moving away through the crowd as quickly as possible , disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 8]: Valentine Corliss was disclosed in the vestibule .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 33]: He reached her an instant in advance of Mr. Lindley , who had suffered himself to be impeded ; and Cora quickly handed the former her parasol , lightly taking his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 61]: Thus the slow Richard found himself walking beside Laura in a scattered group , its detached portion consisting of his near-betrothed and Corliss ; for although the dexterous pair were first to leave the church , they contrived to be passed almost at once , and , assuming the position of trailers , lagged far behind on the homeward way .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 28]: Laura and Richard walked in the unmitigated glare of the sun ; he had taken her black umbrella and conscientiously held it aloft , but over nobody .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 35]: They walked in silence : they were quiet people , both of them ; and Richard , not `` talkative '' under any circumstances , never had anything whatever to say to Laura Madison .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 57]: He had known her for many years , ever since her childhood ; seldom indeed formulating or expressing a definite thought about her , though sometimes it was vaguely of his consciousness that she played the piano nicely , and even then her music had taken its place as but a colour of Cora 's background .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 23]: For to him , as to every one else -LRB- including Laura -RRB- , Laura was in nothing her sister 's competitor .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 73]: She was a neutral-tinted figure , taken-for-granted , obscured , and so near being nobody at all , that , as Richard Lindley walked beside her this morning , he glanced back at the lagging couple and uttered a long and almost sonorous sigh , which he would have been ashamed for anybody to hear ; and then actually proceeded on his way without the slightest realization that anybody had heard it .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 3]: She understood .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 20]: And she did not disturb the trance ; she did nothing to make him observe that she was there .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 30]: She walked on with head , shoulders , and back scorching in the fierce sun , and allowed him to continue shading the pavement before them with her umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 23]: When they reached the house she gently took the umbrella from him and thanked him ; and he mechanically raised his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 24]: They had walked more than a mile together ; he had not spoken a word , and he did not even know it .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 56]: CHAPTER TEN Dinner on Sunday , the most elaborate feast of the week for the Madisons , was always set for one o'clock in the afternoon , and sometimes began before two , but not to-day : the escorts of both daughters remained , and a change of costume by Cora occasioned a long postponement .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 50]: Justice demands the admission that her reappearance in a glamour of lilac was reward for the delay ; nothing more ravishing was ever seen , she was warrantably informed by the quicker of the two guests , in a moment 's whispered tete-a-tete across the banisters as she descended .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 28]: Another wait followed while she prettily arranged upon the table some dozens of asters from a small garden-bed , tilled , planted , and tended by Laura .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 13]: Meanwhile , Mrs. Madison constantly turned the other cheek to the cook .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 48]: Laura assisted in the pacification ; Hedrick froze the ice-cream to an impenetrable solidity ; and the nominal head of the family sat upon the front porch with the two young men , and wiped his wrists and rambled politically till they were summoned to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 8]: Cora did the talking for the table .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 25]: She was in high spirits ; no trace remained of a haggard night : there was a bloom upon her -- she was radiant .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 43]: Her gayety may have had some inspiration in her daring , for round her throat she wore a miraculously slender chain of gold and enamel , with a pendant of minute pale sapphires scrolled about a rather large and very white diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 19]: Laura started when she saw it , and involuntarily threw a glance almost of terror at Richard Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 14]: But that melancholy and absent-minded gentleman observed neither the glance nor the jewel .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 26]: He saw Cora 's eyes , when they were vouchsafed to his vision , and when they were not he apparently saw nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 35]: With the general exodus from the table , Cora asked Laura to come to the piano and play , a request which brought a snort from Hedrick , who was taken off his guard .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 28]: Catching Laura 's eye , he applied a handkerchief with renewed presence of mind , affecting to have sneezed , and stared searchingly over it at Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 20]: He perceived that the man remained unmoved , evidently already informed that it was Laura who was the musician .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 20]: Cora must be going it pretty fast this time : such was the form of her brother 's deduction .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 22]: When Laura opened the piano , Richard had taken a seat beside Cora , and Corliss stood leaning in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 37]: The player lost herself in a wandering medley , echoes from `` Boheme '' and `` Pagliacci '' ; then drifted into improvisation and played her heart into it magnificently -- a heart released to happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 41]: The still air of the room filled with wonderful , golden sound : a song like the song of a mother flying from earth to a child in the stars , a torrential tenderness , unpent and glorying in freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 15]: The flooding , triumphant chords rose , crashed -- stopped with a shattering abruptness .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 22]: Laura 's hands fell to her sides , then were raised to her glowing face and concealed it for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 30]: She shivered ; a quick , deep sigh heaved her breast ; and she came back to herself like a prisoner leaving a window at the warden 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 3]: She turned .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 8]: Cora and Corliss had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 15]: Richard was sitting beside a vacant chair , staring helplessly at the open door .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 24]: If he had been vaguely conscious of Laura 's playing , which is possible , certainly he was unaware that it had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 18]: `` The others have gone out to the porch , '' she said composedly , and rose .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 8]: `` Sha n't we join them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 5]: he returned , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 20]: `` I beg your pardon -- '' `` Let 's go out on the porch with the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 13]: `` No , I -- '' He got to his feet confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 15]: `` I was thinking -- I believe I 'd best be going home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 13]: `` Not ` best , ' I think , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 6]: `` Not even better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 15]: `` I do n't see , '' he said , his perplexity only increased .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 10]: `` Mr. Corliss would , '' she retorted quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 13]: `` Come on : we 'll go and sit with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 21]: And she compelled his obedience by preceding him with such a confident assumption that he would follow that he did .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 42]: The fugitive pair were not upon the porch , however ; they were discovered in the shade of a tree behind the house , seated upon a rug , and occupied in a conversation which would not have disturbed a sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 36]: The pursuers came upon them , boldly sat beside them ; and Laura began to talk with unwonted fluency to Corliss , but within five minutes found herself alone with Richard Lindley upon the rug .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 20]: Cora had promised to show Mr. Corliss an `` old print '' in the library -- so Cora said .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: Lindley gave the remaining lady a desolate and faintly reproachful look .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 25]: He was kind , but he was a man ; and Laura saw that this last abandonment was being attributed in part to her .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 17]: She reddened , and , being not an angel , observed with crispness : `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 11]: You 're quite right : it 's my fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 4]: he asked vacantly .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 27]: She looked at him rather fixedly ; his own gaze had returned to the angle of the house beyond which the other couple had just disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 22]: `` I said , '' she answered , slowly , `` I thought it would n't rain this , afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 16]: His wistful eyes absently swept the serene sky which had been cloudless for several days .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 11]: `` No , I suppose not , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 23]: `` Richard , '' she said with a little sharpness , `` will you please listen to me for a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 6]: `` Oh -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 12]: He was like a diver coming up out of deep water .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 4]: He laughed apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 6]: `` Was n't I listening ?
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 7]: What is it , Laura ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 16]: `` Why do you let Mr. Corliss take Cora away from you like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 4]: she asked gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 18]: `` He does n't , '' the young man returned with a rueful shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 6]: `` Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 7]: It 's Cora that goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 10]: `` Why do you let her , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 3]: He sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 21]: `` I do n't seem to be able to keep up with Cora , especially when she 's punishing me .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 21]: I could n't do something she asked me to , last night -- '' `` Invest with Mr. Corliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 4]: asked Laura quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 10]: It seemed to trouble her that I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 27]: She 's convinced it 's a good thing : she thinks it would make a great fortune for us -- '' '' ` Us ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 4]: repeated Laura gently .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 8]: `` You mean for you and her ?
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 11]: When you 're -- '' `` When we 're married .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 16]: Yes , '' he said thoughtfully , `` that 's the way she stated it .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 18]: She wanted me to put in all I have -- '' `` Do n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 4]: said Laura decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 8]: He glanced at her with sharp inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 11]: `` Do you mean you would distrust Mr. Corliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 46]: `` I was n't thinking of that : I do n't know whether I 'd trust him or not -- I think I would n't ; there 's something veiled about him , and I do n't believe he is an easy man to know .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 22]: What I meant was that I do n't believe it would really be a good thing for you with Cora . ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 19]: `` It would please her , of course -- thinking I deferred so much to her judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 7]: `` Do n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 6]: she said again , impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 14]: `` I do n't see how I can , '' he returned sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 30]: `` It 's my work for all the years since I got out of college , and if I lost it I 'd have to begin all over again .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: It would mean postponing everything .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 40]: Cora is n't a girl you can ask to share a little salary , and if it were a question of years , perhaps -- perhaps Cora might not feel she could wait for me , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 19]: He made this explanation with plaintive and boyish sincerity , hesitatingly , and as if pleading a cause .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 27]: And Laura , after a long look at him , turned away , and in her eyes were actual tears of compassion for the incredible simpleton .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: `` I see , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 7]: `` Perhaps she might not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 56]: `` Of course , '' he went on , `` she 's fond of having nice things , and she thinks this is a great chance for us to be millionaires ; and then , too , I think she may feel that it would please Mr. Corliss and help to save him from disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 12]: She seems to have taken a great fancy to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 10]: Laura glanced at him , but did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 12]: `` He _ is _ attractive , '' continued Richard feebly .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 35]: `` I think he has a great deal of what people call ` magnetism ' : he 's the kind of man who somehow makes you want to do what he wants you to .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 35]: He seems a manly , straightforward sort , too -- so far as one can tell -- and when he came to me with his scheme I was strongly inclined to go into it .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 22]: But it is too big a gamble , and I ca n't , though I was sorry to disappoint him myself .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 15]: He was perfectly cheerful about it and so pleasant it made me feel small .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 13]: I do n't wonder at all that Cora likes him so much .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 9]: Besides , he seems to understand her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 5]: Laura looked very grave .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 11]: `` I think he does , '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 13]: `` And then he 's ` different , ' '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 37]: `` He 's more a ` man of the world ' than most of us here : she never saw anything just like him before , and she 's seen _ us _ all her life .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 7]: She likes change , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 9]: That 's natural , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 30]: `` Poor Vilas says she wants a man to be different every day , and if he is n't , then she wants a different man every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 16]: `` You 've rather taken Ray Vilas under your wing , have n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 3]: asked Laura .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , '' he answered deprecatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 22]: `` I only try to keep him with me so he 'll stay away from downtown as much as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 9]: `` Does he talk much of Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 5]: `` All the time .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 6]: There 's no stopping him .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 16]: I suppose he ca n't help it , because he thinks of nothing else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 13]: `` Is n't that rather -- rather queer for you ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 5]: ` Queer ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 8]: `` No , I suppose not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 4]: She laughed impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 44]: `` And probably you do n't think it 's ` queer ' of you to sit here helplessly , and let another man take your place -- '' `` But I do n't ` let ' him , Laura , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 9]: `` No , he just does it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 36]: `` Well , '' he smiled , `` you must admit my efforts to supplant him have n't -- '' `` It wo n't take any effort now , '' she said , rising quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 16]: Valentine Corliss came into their view upon the sidewalk in front , taking his departure .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 20]: Seeing that they observed him , he lifted his hat to Laura and nodded a cordial good-day to Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 5]: Then he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 28]: Just before he reached the corner of the lot , he encountered upon the pavement a citizen of elderly and plain appearance , strolling with a grandchild .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 42]: The two men met and passed , each upon his opposite way , without pausing and without salutation , and neither Richard nor Laura , whose eyes were upon the meeting , perceived that they had taken cognizance of each other .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 12]: But one had asked a question and the other had answered .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 28]: Mr. Pryor spoke in a low monotone , with a rapidity as singular as the restrained but perceptible emphasis he put upon one word of his question .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 25]: `` I got you in the park , '' he said ; and it is to be deduced that `` got '' was argot .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 14]: `` You 're not _ doing _ anything here , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 13]: answered Corliss with condensed venom , his back already to the other .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 11]: He fanned himself with his hat as he went on .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 10]: Mr. Pryor strolled up the street with imperturbable benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 20]: `` Your coast is cleared , '' said Laura , `` since you would n't clear it yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 13]: `` Wish me luck , '' said Richard as he left her .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 4]: She nodded brightly .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 34]: Before he disappeared , he looked back to her again -LRB- which profoundly surprised her -RRB- and smiled rather disconsolately , shaking his head as in prophecy of no very encouraging reception indoors .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 17]: The manner of this glance recalled to Laura what his mother had once said of him .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 18]: `` Richard is one of those sweet , helpless men that some women adore and others despise .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 12]: They fall in love with the ones that despise them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 35]: An ostentatious cough made her face about , being obviously designed to that effect ; and she beheld her brother in the act of walking slowly across the yard with his back to her .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 56]: He halted upon the border of her small garden of asters , regarded it anxiously , then spread his handkerchief upon the ground , knelt upon it , and with thoughtful care uprooted a few weeds which were beginning to sprout , and also such vagrant blades of grass as encroached upon the floral territory .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 18]: He had the air of a virtuous man performing a good action which would never become known .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 11]: Plainly , he thought himself in solitude and all unobserved .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 10]: It was a touching picture , pious and humble .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 31]: Done into coloured glass , the kneeling boy and the asters -- submerged in ardent sunshine -- would have appropriately enriched a cathedral : Boyhood of Saint Florus the Gardener .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 30]: Laura heartlessly turned her back , and , affecting an interest in her sleeve , very soon experienced the sensation of being stared at with some poignancy from behind .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 28]: Unchanged in attitude , she unravelled an imaginary thread , whereupon the cough reached her again , shrill and loud , its insistence not lacking in pathos .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 6]: She approached him , driftingly .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 28]: No sign that he was aware came from the busied boy , though he coughed again , hollowly now -- a proof that he was an artist .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 11]: `` All right , Hedrick , '' she said kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: `` I heard you the first time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 7]: He looked up with utter incomprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 15]: `` I 'm afraid I 've caught cold , '' he said , simply .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 18]: `` I got a good many weeds out before breakfast , and the ground was damp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 23]: Hedrick was of the New School : everything direct , real , no striving for effect , no pressure on the stroke .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 13]: He did his work : you could take it or leave it .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 18]: `` You must n't strain so , dear , '' returned his sister , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 9]: `` It wo n't last if you do .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 10]: You see this is only the first day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 33]: Struck to the heart by so brutal a misconception , he put all his wrongs into one look , rose in manly dignity , picked up his handkerchief , and left her .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 24]: Her eyes followed him , not without remorse : it was an exit which would have moved the bass-violist of a theatre orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 32]: Sighing , she went to her own room by way of the kitchen and the back-stairs , and , having locked her door , brought the padlocked book from its hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 20]: `` I think I should not have played as I did , an hour ago , '' she wrote .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 29]: `` It stirs me too greatly and I am afraid it makes me inclined to self-pity afterward , and I must never let myself feel _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 17]: If I once begin to feel sorry for myself ... But I _ will _ not !
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 7]: You are here in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 3]: You exist .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 5]: You _ are _ !
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 15]: That is the great thing to know and it must be enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 3]: It is .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 5]: I played to You .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 24]: I played _ just love _ to you -- all the yearning tenderness -- all the supreme kindness I want to give you .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 8]: Is n't love really just glorified kindness ?
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 7]: No , there is something more .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 15]: ... I feel it , though I do not know how to say it .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 14]: But it was in my playing -- I played it and played it .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 31]: Suddenly I felt that in my playing I had shouted it from the housetops , that I had told the secret to all the world and _ everybody _ knew .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 18]: I stopped , and for a moment it seemed to me that I was dying of shame .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 5]: But no one understood .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 28]: No one had even listened ... Sometimes it seems to me that I am like Cora , that I am very deeply her sister in some things .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 52]: My heart goes all to You -- my revelation of it , my release of it , my outlet of it is all here in these pages -LRB- except when I play as I did to-day and as I shall not play again -RRB- and perhaps the writing keeps me quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 27]: Cora scatters her own releasings : she is looking for the You she may never find ; and perhaps the penalty for scattering is never finding .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 19]: Sometimes I think the seeking has reacted and that now she seeks only what will make her feel .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 24]: I hope she has not found it : I am afraid of this new man -- not only for your sake , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: I felt repelled by his glance at me the first time I saw him .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 20]: I did not like it -- I can not say just why , unless that it seemed too intimate .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 51]: I am afraid of him for her , which is a queer sort of feeling because she has alw -- '' Laura 's writing stopped there , for that day , interrupted by a hurried rapping upon the door and her mother 's voice calling her with stress and urgency .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 28]: The opening of the door revealed Mrs. Madison in a state of anxious perturbation , and admitted the sound of loud weeping and agitated voices from below .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 10]: `` Please go down , '' implored the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 11]: `` You can do more with her than I can .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 16]: She and your father have been having a terrible scene since Richard went home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 7]: Laura hurried down to the library .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 13]: CHAPTER ELEVEN `` Oh , _ come _ in , Laura ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 11]: cried her sister , as Laura appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 8]: `` Do n't _ stand _ there !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 16]: Come in if you want to take part in a grand old family row ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 25]: With a furious and tear-stained face , she was confronting her father who stood before her in a resolute attitude and a profuse perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 6]: `` Shut the door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 20]: shouted Cora violently , adding , as Laura obeyed , `` Do you want that little Pest in here ?
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 6]: Probably he 's eavesdropping anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 7]: But what difference does it make ?
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 5]: I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 4]: Let him hear !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 7]: Let anybody hear that wants to !
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 11]: They can hear how I 'm tortured if they like .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 16]: I did n't close my eyes last night , and now I 'm being tortured .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 3]: Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 5]: She stamped her foot .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 14]: `` Are you going to take back that insult to me ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 5]: ` Insult ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 8]: repeated her father , in angry astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 14]: `` Pshaw , '' said Laura , laughing soothingly and coming to her .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 9]: `` You know that 's nonsense , Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 11]: Kind old papa could n't do that if he tried .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 19]: Dear , you know he never insulted anybody in his -- '' `` Do n't touch me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 6]: screamed Cora , repulsing her .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 14]: `` Listen , if you 've got to , but let me alone .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 4]: He did too !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 3]: He did !
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 9]: He _ knows _ what he said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 6]: `` I do not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 4]: `` He does !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 4]: He does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 3]: cried Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 19]: `` He said that I was -- I was too much ` interested ' in Mr. Corliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 9]: `` Is that an ` insult ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 5]: the father demanded sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 15]: `` It was the way he said it , '' Cora protested , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 11]: `` He meant something he did n't _ say _ .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 3]: He did !
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 3]: He did !
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 9]: He _ meant _ to insult me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 14]: `` I did nothing of the kind , '' shouted the old man .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 11]: `` I do n't know what you 're talking about .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 29]: I said I could n't understand your getting so excited about the fellow 's affairs and that you seemed to take a mighty sudden interest in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 11]: `` Well , what if I _ do _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 14]: `` Have n't I a right to be interested in what I choose ?
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 15]: I 've got to be interested in _ something _ , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 13]: _ You _ do n't make life very interesting , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 68]: Do you think it 's interesting to spend the summer in this horrible old house with the paper falling off the walls and our rotten old furniture that I work my hands off trying to make look decent and ca n't , and every other girl I know at the seashore with motor-cars and motor-boats , or getting a trip abroad and buying her clothes in Paris ?
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 11]: What do _ you _ offer to interest me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 7]: The unfortunate man hung his head .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 22]: `` I do n't see what all that has to do with it -- '' She seemed to leap at him .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 7]: `` You _ do n't _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 7]: You _ do n't _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 24]: And I do n't see why you 're so crazy to please young Corliss about this business unless you 're infatuated with him .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 38]: I had an idea -- and I was pleased with it , too , because Richard 's a steady fellow -- that you were just about engaged to Richard Lindley , and -- '' `` Engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 10]: she cried , repeating the word with bitter contempt .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 3]: `` Engaged !
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 16]: You do n't suppose I 'll marry him unless I want to , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 7]: I will if it suits me .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 13]: I wo n't if it suits me not to ; understand that !
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 15]: I do n't consider myself engaged to anybody , and you need n't either .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 23]: What on earth has that got to do with your keeping Richard Lindley from doing what Mr. Corliss wants him to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 9]: `` I 'm not keeping him from anything .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 11]: He did n't say -- '' `` He did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 3]: stormed Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 11]: `` He said he would if you went into it .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 11]: He told me this afternoon , an hour ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 8]: `` Now wait , '' said Madison .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 21]: `` I talked this over with Richard two days ago -- '' Cora stamped her foot again in frantic exasperation .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 9]: `` I 'm talking about this afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 24]: `` Two days ago , '' he repeated doggedly ; `` and we came to the same conclusion : it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 91]: He said he could n't go into it unless he went over there to Italy -- and saw for himself just what he was putting his money into , and Corliss had told him that it could n't be done ; that there was n't time , and showed him a cablegram from his Italian partner saying the secret had leaked out and that they 'd have to form the company in Naples and sell the stock over there if it could n't be done here within the next week .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 21]: Corliss said he had to ask for an immediate answer , and so Richard told him no , yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 7]: `` Oh , my God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 3]: groaned Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 15]: `` What has that got to do with _ your _ going into it ?
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 9]: You 're not going to risk any money !
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 14]: I do n't ask you to _ spend _ anything , do I ?
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 9]: You have n't got it if I did .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 8]: All Mr. Corliss wants is your name .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 9]: Ca n't you give even _ that _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 6]: What importance is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 22]: `` Well , if it is n't important , what difference does it make whether I give it or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 12]: She flung up her arms as in despairing appeal for patience .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 9]: `` It _ is _ important to him !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 17]: Richard will do it if you will be secretary of the company : he promised me .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 30]: Mr. Corliss told me your name was worth everything here : that men said downtown you could have been rich long ago if you had n't been so square .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 30]: Richard trusts you ; he says you 're the most trusted man in town -- '' `` That 's why I ca n't do it , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 8]: Her vehemence increased suddenly to its utmost .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 12]: Do n't you say that , because it 's a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 11]: That is n't the reason you wo n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 15]: You wo n't do it because you think it would please _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 11]: You 're afraid it might make me _ happy _ !
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 9]: Happy -- happy -- _ happy _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 15]: She beat her breast and cast herself headlong upon the sofa , sobbing wildly .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 8]: `` Do n't come near me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 16]: she screamed at Laura , and sprang to her feet again , dishevelled and frantic .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 7]: `` Oh , Christ in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 14]: is there such a thing as happiness in this beast of a world ?
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 6]: I want to leave it .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 19]: I want to go away : I want _ so _ to die : Why ca n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 5]: Why ca n't I !
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 5]: Why ca n't I !
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 12]: Oh , God , why _ ca n't _ I die ?
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 46]: Why ca n't -- '' Her passion culminated in a shriek : she gasped , was convulsed from head to foot for a dreadful moment , tore at the bosom of her dress with rigid bent fingers , swayed ; then collapsed all at once .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 11]: Laura caught her , and got her upon the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 20]: In the hall , Mrs. Madison could be heard running and screaming to Hedrick to go for the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 13]: Next instant , she burst into the room with brandy and camphor .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 54]: `` I could only find these ; the ammonia bottle 's empty , '' she panted ; and the miserable father started hatless , for the drug-store , a faint , choked wail from the stricken girl sounding in his ears : `` It 's -- it 's my heart , mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 48]: It was four blocks to the nearest pharmacy ; he made what haste he could in the great heat , but to himself he seemed double his usual weight ; and the more he tried to hurry , the less speed appeared obtainable from his heavy legs .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 41]: When he reached the place at last , he found it crowded with noisy customers about the `` soda-fount '' ; and the clerks were stonily slow : they seemed to know that they were `` already in eternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 34]: He got very short of breath on the way home ; he ceased to perspire and became unnaturally dry ; the air was aflame and the sun shot fire upon his bare head .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 14]: His feet inclined to strange disobediences : he walked the last block waveringly .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 9]: A solemn Hedrick met him at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 13]: `` They 've got her to bed , '' announced the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 8]: `` The doctor 's up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 29]: `` Take this ammonia up , '' said Madison huskily , and sat down upon a lower step of the stairway with a jolt , closing his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 7]: `` You sick , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 3]: asked Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 7]: Run along with that ammonia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 19]: It seemed to Madison a long time that he sat there alone , and he felt very dizzy .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 20]: Once he tried to rise , but had to give it up and remain sitting with his eyes shut .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 45]: At last he heard Cora 's door open and close ; and his wife and the doctor came slowly down the stairs , Mrs. Madison talking in the anxious yet relieved voice of one who leaves a sick-room wherein the physician pronounces progress encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 15]: `` And you 're _ sure _ her heart trouble is n't organic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 13]: `` Her heart is all right , '' her companion assured her .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 11]: `` There 's nothing serious ; the trouble is nervous .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 14]: I think you 'll find she 'll be better after a good sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 5]: Just keep her quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 12]: Had n't she been in a state of considerable excitement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 9]: `` Ye-es -- she -- '' `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 17]: A little upset on account of opposition to a plan she 'd formed , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 10]: `` Well -- partly , '' assented the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 21]: `` I see , '' he returned , adding with some dryness : `` I thought it just possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 18]: Madison got to his feet , and stepped down from the stairs for them to pass him .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 7]: He leaned heavily against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 14]: `` You think she 's going to be all right , Sloane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 6]: he asked with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 11]: `` No cause to worry , '' returned the physician .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 34]: `` You can let her stay in bed to-day if she wants to but -- '' He broke off , looking keenly at Madison 's face , which was the colour of poppies .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 3]: `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 9]: what 's up with _ you _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 8]: `` I 'm all -- right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 7]: `` Oh , you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 5]: retorted Sloane with sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 8]: `` Sit down , '' he commanded .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 28]: `` Sit right where you are -- on the stairs , here , '' and , having enforced the order , took a stethoscope from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 20]: `` Get him a glass of water , '' he said to Hedrick , who was at his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 4]: `` Doctor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 5]: exclaimed Mrs. Madison . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 13]: _ He _ is n't going to be sick , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 12]: You do n't think he 's sick _ now _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 24]: `` I should n't call him very well , '' answered the physician rather grimly , placing his stethoscope upon Madison 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 9]: `` Get his room ready for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 22]: She gave him a piteous look , struck with fear ; then obeyed a gesture and ran flutteringly up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 18]: `` I 'm all right now , '' panted Madison , drinking the water Hedrick brought him .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 20]: `` You 're not so darned all right , '' said Sloane coolly , as he pocketed his stethoscope .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 9]: `` Come , let me help you up .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 10]: We 're going to get you to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 30]: There was an effort at protest , but the physician had his way , and the two ascended the stairs slowly , Sloane 's arm round his new patient .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 9]: At Cora 's door , the latter paused .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 19]: `` I want , '' said Madison thickly -- `` I want -- to speak to Cora . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 20]: `` We 'll pass that up just now , '' returned the other brusquely , and led him on .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 23]: Madison was almost helpless : he murmured in a husky , uncertain voice , and suffered himself to be put to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 38]: There , the doctor `` worked '' with him ; cold `` applications '' were ordered ; Laura was summoned from the other sick-bed ; Hedrick sent flying with prescriptions , then to telephone for a nurse .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 19]: The two women attempted questions at intervals , but Sloane replied with orders , and kept them busy .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 17]: `` Do you -- think I 'm a -- a pretty sick man , Sloane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 11]: asked Madison after a long silence , speaking with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 15]: `` Oh , you 're sick , all right , '' the doctor conceded .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 11]: `` I -- I want to speak to Jennie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 12]: His wife rushed to the bed , and knelt beside it .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 16]: `` Do n't you go to confessing your sins , '' said Doctor Sloane crossly .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 24]: `` You 're coming out of the woods all right , and you 'll be sorry if you tell her too , much .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 17]: I 'll begin a little flirtation with you , Miss Laura , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: And he motioned to her to follow him into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 28]: `` Your father _ is _ pretty sick , '' he told her , `` and he may be sicker before we get him into shape again .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 19]: But you need n't be worried right now ; I think he 's not in immediate danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 26]: He turned at the sound of Mrs. Madison 's step , behind him , and repeated to her what he had just said to Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 28]: `` I hope your husband did n't give himself away enough to be punished when we get him on his feet again , '' he concluded cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 22]: She shook her head , tried to smile through tears , and , crossing the hall , entered Cora 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 28]: She came back after a moment , and , rejoining the other two at her husband 's bedside , found the sick man in a stertorous sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 29]: Presently the nurse arrived , and upon the physician 's pointed intimation that there were `` too many people around , '' Laura went to Cora 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 8]: She halted on the threshold in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 4]: Cora was dressing .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 37]: `` Mamma says the doctor says he 's all right , '' said Cora lightly , `` and I 'm feeling so much better myself I thought I 'd put on something loose and go downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 10]: I think there 's more air down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 33]: `` Papa is n't all right , dear , '' said Laura , staring perplexedly at Cora 's idea of `` something loose , '' an equipment inclusive of something particularly close .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 10]: `` The doctor says he is very sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 12]: `` I do n't believe it , '' returned Cora promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 8]: `` Old Sloane never did know anything .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 15]: Besides , mamma told me he said papa is n't in any danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 11]: `` No ` immediate ' danger , '' corrected Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 17]: `` And besides , Doctor Sloane said you were to stay in bed until to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 8]: `` I ca n't help that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 8]: Cora went on with her lacing impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 27]: `` I 'm not going to lie and stifle in this heat when I feel perfectly well again -- not for an old idiot like Sloane !
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 14]: He did n't even have sense enough to give me any medicine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 17]: `` Lucky thing he did n't : I 'd have thrown it out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 12]: Kick that slipper to me , will you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 12]: Laura knelt and put the slipper on her sister 's foot .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 33]: `` Cora , dear , '' she said , `` you 're just going to put on a negligee and go down and sit in the library , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 4]: `` Laura ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 7]: The tone was more than impatient .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 18]: `` I wish I could be let alone for five whole minutes some time in my life !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 12]: Do n't you think I 've stood enough for one day ?
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 12]: I ca n't bear to be questioned , questioned , questioned !
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 7]: What do you do it for ?
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 11]: Do n't you see I ca n't stand anything more ?
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 19]: If you ca n't let me alone I do wish you 'd keep out of my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 34]: Laura rose and went out ; but as she left the door , Cora called after her with a rueful laugh : `` Laura , I know I 'm a little devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 31]: Half an hour later , Laura , suffering because she had made no reply to this peace-offering , and wishing to atone , sought Cora downstairs and found no one .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 19]: She decided that Cora must still be in her own room ; she would go to her there .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 21]: But as she passed the open front door , she saw Cora upon the sidewalk in front of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 37]: She wore a new and elaborate motoring costume , charmingly becoming , and was in the act of mounting to a seat beside Valentine Corliss in a long , powerful-looking , white `` roadster '' automobile .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 46]: The engine burst into staccato thunder , sobered down ; the wheels began to move both Cora and Corliss were laughing and there was an air of triumph about them -- Cora 's veil streamed and fluttered : and in a flash they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 12]: Laura stared at the suddenly vacated space where they had been .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 6]: At a thought she started .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 20]: Then she rushed upstairs to her mother , who was sitting in the hall near her husband 's door .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 32]: `` Mamma , '' whispered Laura , flinging herself upon her knees beside her , `` when papa wanted to speak to you , was it a message to Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 5]: `` Yes , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 33]: He told me to tell her he was sorry he 'd made her sick , and that if he got well he 'd try to do what she asked him to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 4]: Laura nodded cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 20]: `` And he _ will _ get well , darling mother , '' she said , as she rose .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 14]: `` I 'll come back in a minute and sit with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 34]: Her return was not so quick as she promised , for she lay a long time weeping upon her pillow , whispering over and over : `` Oh , poor , poor papa !
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 8]: Oh , poor , poor Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 49]: CHAPTER TWELVE Within a week Mr. Madison 's illness was a settled institution in the household ; the presence of the nurse lost novelty , even to Hedrick , and became a part of life ; the day was measured by the three regular visits of the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 45]: To the younger members of the family it seemed already that their father had always been sick , and that he always would be ; indeed , to Cora and Hedrick he had become only a weak and querulous voice beyond a closed door .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 22]: Doctor Sloane was serious but reassuring , his daily announcement being that his patient was in `` no immediate danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 72]: Mrs. Madison did not share her children 's sanguine adaptability ; and , of the three , Cora was the greatest solace to the mother 's troubled heart , though Mrs. Madison never recognized this without a sense of injustice to Laura , for Laura now was housewife and housekeeper -- that is , she did all the work except the cooking , and on `` wash-day '' she did that .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 61]: But Cora 's help was to the very spirit itself , for she was sprightly in these hours of trial : with indomitable gayety she cheered her mother , inspiring in her a firmer confidence , and , most stimulating of all , Cora steadfastly refused to consider her father 's condition as serious , or its outcome as doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 37]: Old Sloane exaggerated , she said ; and she made fun of his gravity , his clothes and his walk , which she mimicked till she drew a reluctant and protesting laugh from even her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 27]: Mrs. Madison was sure she `` could n't get through '' this experience save for Cora , who was indeed the light of the threatened house .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 16]: Strange perversities of this world : Cora 's gayety was almost unbearable to her brother .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 67]: Not because he thought it either unfeeling or out of place under the circumstances -LRB- an aspect he failed to consider -RRB- , but because years of warfare had so frequently made him connect cheerfulness on her part with some unworthily won triumph over himself that habit prevailed , and he could not be a witness of her high spirits without a strong sense of injury .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 40]: Additionally , he was subject to a deeply implanted suspicion of any appearance of unusual happiness in her as having source , if not in his own defeat , then in something vaguely `` soft '' and wholly distasteful .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 15]: She grated upon him ; he chafed , and his sufferings reached the surface .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 34]: Finally , in a reckless moment , one evening at dinner , he broke out with a shout and hurled a newly devised couplet concerning luv-a-ly slush at his , sister 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 20]: The nurse was present : Cora left the table ; and Hedrick later received a serious warning from Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 15]: She suggested that it might become expedient to place him in Cora 's power .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 17]: `` Cora knows perfectly well that something peculiar happened to you , '' she advised him .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 26]: `` And she knows that I know what it was ; and she says it is n't very sisterly of me not to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 36]: Now , Hedrick , there was no secret about it ; you did n't _ confide _ your -- your trouble to me , and it would be perfectly honourable of me to tell it .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 36]: I wont -LCB- sic -RCB- unless you make me , but if you ca n't be polite and keep peace with Cora -- at least while papa is sick I think it may be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 21]: I believe , '' she finished with imperfect gravity , `` that it -- it would keep things quieter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 24]: The thoughts of a boy may be long , long thoughts , but he can not persistently remember to fear a threatened catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 8]: Youth is too quickly intimate with peril .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 30]: Hedrick had become familiar with his own , had grown so accustomed to it he was in danger of forgetting it altogether ; therefore it was out of perspective .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 25]: The episode of Lolita had begun to appear as a thing of the distant and clouded past : time is so long at thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 44]: Added to this , his late immaculate deportment had been , as Laura suggested , a severe strain ; the machinery of his nature was out of adjustment and demanded a violent reaction before it could get to running again at average speed .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 27]: Also , it is evident that his destruction had been planned on high , for he was mad enough to answer flippantly : `` Tell her !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 13]: Go on and tell her -- _ I _ give you leaf !
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 18]: _ that _ was n't anything anyway -- just helped you get a little idiot girl home .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 6]: What is there to that ?
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 26]: I never saw her before ; never saw her again ; did n't have half as much to do with her as you did yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 19]: She was a lot more _ your _ friend than mine ; I did n't even know her .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 28]: I guess you 'll have to get something better on me than that , before you try to boss _ this _ ranch , Laura Madison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 42]: That night , in bed , he wondered if he had not been perhaps a trifle rash ; but the day was bright when he awoke , and no apprehension shadowed his morning face as he appeared at the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 34]: On the contrary , a great weight had lifted from him ; clearly his defiance had been the proper thing ; he had shown Laura that her power over him was but imaginary .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 27]: Hypnotized by his own words to her , he believed them ; and his previous terrors became gossamer ; nay , they were now merely laughable .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 38]: His own remorse and shame were wholly blotted from memory , and he could not understand why in the world he had been so afraid , nor why he had felt it so necessary to placate Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 7]: She looked very meek this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 5]: _ That _ showed !
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 12]: The strong hand was the right policy in dealing with women .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 20]: He was tempted to insane daring : the rash , unfortunate child waltzed on the lip of the crater .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 6]: `` Told Cora yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 7]: he asked , with scornful laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: `` Told me what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 8]: Cora looked quickly up from her plate .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 13]: `` Oh , nothing about this Corliss , '' he returned scathingly .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 7]: `` Do n't get excited . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 4]: `` Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 8]: remonstrated his mother , out of habit .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 14]: `` She never thinks of anything else these days , '' he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 17]: `` Rides with him every evening in his pe-rin-sley hired machine , does n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 32]: `` Really , you should be more careful about the way you handle a spoon , Hedrick , '' said Cora languidly , and with at least a foundation of fact .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 12]: `` It is not the proper implement for decorating the cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 28]: We all need nourishment , but it is _ so _ difficult when one sees a deposit of breakfast-food in the ear of one 's vis-a-vis . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 26]: Hedrick too impulsively felt of his ears and was but the worse stung to find them immaculate and the latter half of the indictment unjustified .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 4]: `` Spoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 14]: `` I would n't talk about spoons if I were you , Cora-lee !
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 36]: After what I saw in the library the other night , believe _ me _ , you 're the one of this family that better be careful how you ` handle a spoon ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 7]: Cora had a moment of panic .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 25]: She let the cup she was lifting drop noisily upon its saucer , and gazed whitely at the boy , her mouth opening wide .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 9]: he went on , with a dreadful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 13]: `` I did n't hear you asking this Corliss to kiss you !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 5]: Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 23]: At this , though her mother and Laura both started , a faint , odd relief showed itself in Cora 's expression .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 4]: She recovered herself .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 6]: `` You little liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 26]: she flashed , and , with a single quick look at her mother , as of one too proud to appeal , left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 8]: `` Hedrick , Hedrick , Hedrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 4]: wailed Mrs. Madison .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 21]: `` And she told me you drove her from the table last night too , right before Miss Peirce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 14]: Miss Peirce was the nurse , fortunately at this moment in the sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 17]: `` I _ did _ hear her ask him that , '' he insisted , sullenly .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 8]: `` Do n't you believe it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 5]: `` Certainly not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 16]: Burning with outrage , he also left his meal unfinished and departed in high dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 49]: He passed through the kitchen , however , on his way out of the house ; but , finding an unusual politeness to the cook nothing except its own reward , went on his way with a bitter perception of the emptiness of the world and other places .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 18]: `` Your father managed to talk more last night , '' said Mrs. Madison pathetically to Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 32]: `` He made me understand that he was fretting about how little we 'd been able to give our children ; so few advantages ; it 's always troubled him terribly .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 20]: But sometimes I wonder if we 've done right : we 've neither of us ever exercised any discipline .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 7]: We just could n't bear to .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 44]: You see , not having any money , or the things money could buy , to give , I think we 've instinctively tried to make up for it by indulgence in other ways , and perhaps it 's been a bad thing .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 25]: Not , '' she added hastily , `` not that you are n't all three the best children any mother and father ever had !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 6]: _ He _ said so .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 16]: He said the only trouble was that our children were too good for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 47]: She shook her head remorsefully throughout Laura 's natural reply to this ; was silent a while ; then , as she rose , she said timidly , not looking at her daughter : `` Of course Hedrick did n't mean to tell an outright lie .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 23]: They were just talking , and perhaps he -- perhaps he heard something that made him think what he _ did _ .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 66]: People are so often mistaken in what they hear , even when they 're talking right to each other , and -- '' `` Is n't it more likely , '' said Laura , gravely , `` that Cora was telling some story or incident , and that Hedrick overheard that part of it , and thought she was speaking directly to Mr. Corliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 5]: `` Of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 43]: cried the mother with instant and buoyant relief ; and when the three ladies convened , a little later , Cora -LRB- unquestioned -RRB- not only confirmed this explanation , but repeated in detail the story she had related to Mr. Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 5]: Laura had been quick .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 8]: Hedrick passed a variegated morning among comrades .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 21]: He obtained prestige as having a father like-to-die , but another boy turned up who had learned to chew tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 27]: Then Hedrick was pronounced inferior to others in turning `` cartwheels , '' but succeeded in a wrestling match for an apple , which he needed .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 48]: Later , he was chased empty-handed from the rear of an ice-wagon , but greatly admired for his retorts to the vociferous chaser : the other boys rightly considered that what he said to the ice-man was much more horrible than what the ice-man said to him .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 46]: The ice-man had a fair vocabulary , but it lacked pliancy ; seemed stiff and fastidious compared with the flexible Saxon in which Hedrick sketched a family tree lacking , perhaps , some plausibility as having produced even an ice-man , but curiously interesting zoologically .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 16]: He came home at noon with the flush of this victory new upon his brow .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 36]: He felt equal to anything , and upon Cora 's appearing at lunch with a blithe , bright air and a new arrangement of her hair , he opened a fresh campaign with ill-omened bravado .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 11]: `` Ear-muffs in style for September , are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 17]: he inquired in allusion to a symmetrical and becoming undulation upon each side of her head .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 22]: `` Too bad Ray Vilas ca n't come any more ; he 'd like those , I know he would . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 15]: Cora , who was talking jauntily to her mother , went on without heeding .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 49]: She affected her enunciation at times with a slight lisp ; spoke preciously and over-exquisitely , purposely mincing the letter R , at the same time assuming a manner of artificial distinction and conscious elegance which never failed to produce in her brother the last stage of exasperation .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 5]: She did this now .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 11]: Charming woman , that dear Mrs. Villard , she prattled .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 8]: `` I met her downtown this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 17]: Dear mamma , you should but have seen her delight when she saw _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 16]: She was but just returned from Bar Harbor -- '' '' ` Baw-hawbaw ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 7]: Poor Hedrick was successfully infuriated immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 9]: `` What in thunder is ` Baw-hawbaw ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 3]: Mrs. Villawd !
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 2]: Baw-hawbaw !
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 5]: Oh , maw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 24]: `` She had no idea she should find _ me _ in town , she said , '' Cora ran on , happily .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 17]: `` She came back early on account of the children having to be sent to school .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 15]: She has such adorable children -- beautiful , dimpled babes -- '' `` SLUSH !
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 2]: SLUSH !
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 5]: LUV-A-LY SLUSH ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 56]: -- And her dear son , Egerton Villard , he 's grown to be such a comely lad , and he has the most charming courtly manners : he helped his mother out of her carriage with all the air of a man of the world , and bowed to me as to a duchess .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 27]: I think he might be a great influence for good if the dear Villards would but sometimes let him associate a little with our unfortunate Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 54]: Egerton Villard is really _ distingue _ ; he has a beautiful head ; and if he could be induced but to let Hedrick follow him about but a little -- '' `` I 'll beat his beautiful head off for him if he but butts in on me but a little ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 4]: Hedrick promised earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 4]: `` Idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 6]: Cora turned toward him innocently .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 9]: `` What did you say , Hedrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 8]: `` I said ` Idiot ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 7]: `` You mean Egerton Villard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 6]: `` Both of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 11]: `` You think I 'm an idiot , Hedrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 8]: Her tone was calm , merely inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , '' she said pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 25]: `` Do n't you think if I were _ really _ an idiot I 'd be even fonder of you than I am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 5]: It took his breath .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 52]: In a panic he sat waiting he knew not what ; but Cora blandly resumed her interrupted remarks to her mother , beginning a description of Mrs. Villard 's dress ; Laura was talking unconcernedly to Miss Peirce ; no one appeared to be aware that anything unusual had been said .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 27]: His breath came back , and , summoning his presence of mind , he found himself able to consider his position with some degree of assurance .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 14]: Perhaps , after all , Cora 's retort had been merely a coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 23]: He went over and over it in his mind , making a pretence , meanwhile , to be busy with his plate .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: `` If I were _ really _ an idiot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 13]: ... It was the '' _ really _ '' that troubled him .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 31]: But for that one word , he could have decided that her remark was a coincidence ; but '' _ really _ '' was ominous ; had a sinister ring .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 11]: `` If I were _ really _ an idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 32]: Suddenly the pleasant clouds that had obscured his memory of the fatal evening were swept away as by a monstrous Hand : it all came back to him with sickening clearness .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 15]: So is it always with the sinner with his sin and its threatened discovery .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 51]: Again , in his miserable mind , he sat beside Lolita on the fence , with the moon shining through her hair ; and he knew -- for he had often read it -- that a man could be punished his whole life through for a single moment 's weakness .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 36]: A man might become rich , great , honoured , and have a large family , but his one soft sin would follow him , hunt him out and pull him down at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 7]: _ Really _ an idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: Did that relentless Comanche , Cora , know this Thing ?
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 3]: He shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 10]: Then he fell back upon his faith in Providence .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 10]: It _ could _ not be that she knew !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 4]: Ah , no !
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 12]: Heaven would not let the world be so bad as that !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 25]: And yet it did sometimes become negligent -- he remembered the case of a baby-girl cousin who fell into the bath-tub and was drowned .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 18]: Providence had allowed that : What assurance had he that it would not go a step farther ?
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 29]: `` Why , Hedrick , '' said Cora , turning toward him cheerfully , `` you 're not really eating anything ; you 're only pretending to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 6]: His heart sank with apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 4]: Was it coming ?
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 11]: `` You really must eat , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 14]: `` School begins so soon , you must be strong , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 15]: How we shall miss you here at home during your hours of work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 16]: With that , the burden fell from his shoulders , his increasing terrors took wing .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 24]: If Laura had told his ghastly secret to Cora , the latter would not have had recourse to such weak satire as this .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 66]: Cora was not the kind of person to try a popgun on an enemy when she had a thirteen-inch gun at her disposal ; so he reasoned ; and in the gush of his relief and happiness , responded : `` You 're a little too cocky lately , Cora-lee : I wish you were _ my _ daughter -- just about five minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 6]: Cora looked upon him fondly .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 22]: `` What would you do to me , '' she inquired with a terrible sweetness -- `` darling little boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 5]: Hedrick 's head swam .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 19]: The blow was square in the face ; it jarred every bone ; the world seemed to topple .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 26]: His mother , rising from her chair , choked slightly , and hurried to join the nurse , who was already on her way upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 13]: Cora sent an affectionate laugh across the table to her stunned antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 13]: `` You would n't beat me , would you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 23]: `` I 'm almost sure you would n't ; not if I asked you to kiss me some _ more _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 10]: All doubt was gone , the last hope fled !
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 5]: The worst had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 12]: A vision of the awful future flamed across his staggered mind .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 22]: The doors to the arena were flung open : the wild beasts howled for hunger of him ; the spectators waited .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 23]: Cora began lightly to sing : ... `` Dear , Would thou wert near To hear me tell how fair thou art !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 34]: Since thou art gone I mourn all alone , Oh , my Lolita -- '' She broke off to explain : `` It 's one of those passionate little Spanish serenades , Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 17]: I 'll sing it for your boy-friends next time they come to play in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 7]: I think they 'd like it .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 16]: When they know why you like it so much , I 'm sure they will .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 15]: Of course you _ do _ like it -- you roguish little lover ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 7]: A spasm rewarded this demoniacal phrase .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 44]: `` Darling little boy , the serenade goes on like this : Oh , my Lolita , come to my heart : Oh , come beloved , love let me press thee , While I caress thee In one long kiss , Lolita !
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 3]: Lolita come !
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 15]: Let me -- '' Hedrick sprang to his feet with a yell of agony .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 23]: `` Laura Madison , you tattle-tale , '' he bellowed , `` I 'll never forgive you as long as I live !
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 14]: I 'll get even with you if it takes a thousand years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 28]: With that , and pausing merely to kick a rung out of a chair which happened to be in his way , he rushed from the room .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 17]: His sisters had risen to go , and Cora flung her arms round Laura in ecstacy .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 7]: `` You mean old viper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 9]: `` You could have told me days ago !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 30]: It 's almost too good to be true : it 's the first time in my whole life I 've felt safe from the Pest for a moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 5]: Laura shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 49]: `` My conscience troubles me ; it did seem as if I ought to tell you -- and mamma thought so , too ; and I gave him warning , but now that I have done it , it seems rather mean and -- '' `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 3]: exclaimed Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 17]: `` You just gave me a chance to protect myself for once , thank heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 15]: And she picked up her skirts and danced her way into the front hall .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 20]: `` I 'm afraid , '' said Laura , following , `` I should n't have done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 22]: `` Oh , Laura , '' cried the younger girl , `` I am having the best time , these days !
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 6]: This just caps it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 12]: She lowered her voice , but her eyes grew even brighter .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 18]: `` I think I 've shown a certain gentleman a few things he did n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 6]: `` Who , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 12]: `` Val , '' returned Cora lightly ; `` Valentine Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 19]: I think he knows a little more about women than he did when he first came here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 10]: `` You 've had a difference with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 6]: asked Laura with eager hopefulness .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 8]: `` You 've broken with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 7]: `` Oh , Lord , no !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 5]: Nothing like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: Cora leaned to her confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 41]: `` He told me , once , he 'd be at the feet of any woman that could help put through an affair like his oil scheme , and I decided I 'd just show him what I could do .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 15]: He 'd talk about it to me ; then he 'd laugh at me .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 23]: That very Sunday when I got papa to go in -- '' `` But he did n't , '' said Laura helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 15]: `` He only said he 'd try to -- when he gets well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 25]: `` It 's all the same -- and it 'll be a great thing for him , too , '' said Cora , gayly .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 19]: `` Well , that very afternoon before Val left , he practically told me I was no good .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 22]: Of course he did n't use just those words -- that is n't his way -- but he laughed at me .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 7]: And have n't I shown him !
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 51]: I sent Richard a note that very night saying papa had consented to be secretary of the company , and Richard had said he 'd go in if papa did that , and he could n't break his word -- '' `` I know , '' said Laura , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 5]: `` I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 19]: `` Laura '' -- Cora spoke with sudden gravity -- `` did you ever know anybody like me ?
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 26]: I 'm almost getting superstitious about it , because it seems to me I _ always _ get just what I set out to get .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 16]: I believe I could have anything in the world if I tried for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 19]: `` I hope so , if you tried for something good for you , '' said Laura sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 22]: `` Cora , dear , you will -- you will be a little easy on Hedrick , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 12]: Cora leaned against the newel and laughed till she was exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 81]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN Mr. Trumble 's offices were heralded by a neat blazon upon the principal door , `` Wade J. Trumble , Mortgages and Loans '' ; and the gentleman thus comfortably , proclaimed , emerging from that door upon a September noontide , burlesqued a start of surprise at sight of a figure unlocking an opposite door which exhibited the name , `` Ray Vilas , '' and below it , the cryptic phrase , `` Probate Law . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 4]: `` Water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 8]: murmured Mr. Trumble , affecting to faint .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 16]: `` You ai n't going in _ there _ , are you , Ray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 50]: He followed the other into the office , and stood leaning against a bookcase , with his hands in his pockets , while Vilas raised the two windows , which were obscured by a film of smoke-deposit : there was a thin coat of fine sifted dust over everything .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 14]: `` Better not sit down , Ray , '' continued Trumble , warningly .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 13]: `` You 'll spoil your clothes and you might get a client .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 17]: That word ` Probate ' on the door ai n't going to keep 'em out forever .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: You recognize the old place , I s ` pose ?
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 13]: You must have been here at least twice since you moved in .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 5]: What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 17]: Dick Lindley has n't missionaried you into any idea of _ working _ , has he ?
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 27]: Oh , no , _ I _ see : the Richfield Hotel bar has closed -- you 've managed to drink it all at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 12]: `` Have you heard how old man Madison is to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 10]: asked Ray , dusting his fingers with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 11]: `` Somebody told me yesterday he was about the same .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 9]: He 's not going to get well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 4]: Ray spoke quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 5]: `` Stroke too severe .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 16]: People never recover -- '' `` Oh , yes , they do , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 20]: Trumble began hotly : `` I beg to dif -- '' but checked himself , manifesting a slight confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 10]: `` That is , I know they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 25]: Old Madison may live a while , if you call that getting well ; but he 'll never be the same man he was .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 9]: Doctor Sloane says it was a bad stroke .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 12]: Says it was ` induced by heat prostration and excitement . '
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 5]: ` Excitement ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 7]: he repeated with a sour laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 27]: `` Yep , I expect a man could get all the excitement he wanted in _ that _ house , especially if he was her daddy .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 25]: Poor old man , I do n't believe he 's got five thousand dollars in the world , and look how she dresses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 18]: Ray opened a compartment beneath one of the bookcases , and found a bottle and some glasses .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 17]: `` Aha , '' he muttered , `` our janitor does n't drink , I perceive .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 4]: Join me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 30]: Mr. Trumble accepted , and Ray explained , cheerfully : `` Richard Lindley 's got me so cowed I 'm afraid to go near any of my old joints .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 55]: You see , he trails me ; the scoundrel has kept me sober for whole days at a time , and I 've been mortified , having old friends see me in that condition ; so I have to sneak up here to my own office to drink to Cora , now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 6]: You must n't tell him .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 13]: What 's she been doing to _ you _ , lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 13]: The little man addressed grew red with the sharp , resentful memory .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 5]: `` Oh , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 19]: Just struck me in the face with her parasol on the public street , that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 12]: He gave an account of his walk to church with Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 9]: `` I 'm through with that girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 7]: he exclaimed vindictively , in conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 24]: `` It was the damnedest thing you ever saw in your life : right in broad daylight , in front of the church .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 22]: And she laughed when she did it ; you 'd have thought she was knocking a puppy out of her way .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 13]: She ca n't do that to me twice , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 11]: What the devil do you see to laugh at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 27]: `` You 'll be around , '' returned his companion , refilling the glasses , `` asking for more , the first chance she gives you .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 6]: Here 's her health ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 8]: `` I do n't drink it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 5]: cried Mr. Trumble angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 14]: `` And I 'm through with her for good , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 41]: I 'm not your kind : I do n't let a girl like that upset me till I ca n't think of anything else , and go making such an ass of myself that the whole town gabbles about it .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 16]: Cora Madison 's seen the last of me , I 'll thank you to notice .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 66]: She 's never been half-decent to me ; cut dances with me all last winter ; kept me hanging round the outskirts of every crowd she was in ; stuck me with Laura and her mother every time she had a chance ; then has the nerve to try to use me , so 's she can make a bigger hit with a new man !
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 9]: You can bet your head I 'm through !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 6]: She 'll get paid though !
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 10]: Oh , she 'll get paid for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 3]: laughed Ray .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 6]: It was a difficult question .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 13]: `` You wait and see , '' responded the threatener , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 6]: `` Just wait and see .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 19]: She 's wild about this Corliss , I tell you , '' he continued , with renewed vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 27]: `` She 's crazy about him ; she 's lost her head at last -- '' `` You mean he 's going to avenge you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 19]: `` No , I do n't , though he might , if she decided to marry him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 39]: `` Do you know , '' said Ray slowly , glancing over his glass at his nervous companion , `` it does n't strike me that Mr. Valentine Corliss has much the air of a marrying man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 22]: `` He has the air to _ me _ , '' observed Mr. Trumble , `` of a darned bad lot !
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 14]: But I have to hand it to him : he 's a wizard .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 22]: He 's got something besides his good looks -- a man that could get Cora Madison interested in ` business ' !
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 5]: In _ oil _ !
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 3]: Cora Madison !
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 13]: How do you suppose -- '' His companion began to laugh again .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 20]: `` You do n't really suppose he talked his oil business to her , do you , Trumble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 5]: `` He must have .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 30]: Else how could she -- '' `` Oh , no , Cora herself never talks upon any subject but one ; she never listens to any other either . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 41]: `` Then how in thunder did he -- '' `` If Cora asks you if you think it will rain , '' interrupted Vilas , `` does n't she really seem to be asking : ` Do you love me ?
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 4]: How much ? '
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 11]: Suppose Mr. Corliss is an expert in the same line .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 9]: Of course he can talk about oil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 22]: `` He strikes me , '' said Trumble , `` as just about the slickest customer that ever hit this town .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 17]: I like Richard Lindley , and I hope he 'll see his fifty thousand dollars again .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 12]: _ I _ would n't have given Corliss thirty cents . ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 11]: `` Why do you think he 's a crook ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 11]: `` I do n't say that , '' returned Trumble .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 33]: `` All _ I _ know about him is that he 's done some of the finest work to get fifty thousand dollars put in his hands that I ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 28]: And all anybody knows about him is that he lived here seventeen years ago , and comes back claiming to know where there 's oil in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 14]: He shows some maps and papers and gets cablegrams signed ` Moliterno . '
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 58]: Then he talks about selling the old Corliss house here , where the Madisons live , and putting the money into his oil company : he does that to sound plausible , but I have good reason to know that house was mortgaged to its full value within a month after his aunt left it to him .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 11]: He 'll not get a cent if it 's sold .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 4]: That 's all .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 31]: And he 's got Cora Madison so crazy over him that she makes life a hell for poor old Lindley until he puts all he 's saved into the bubble .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 7]: The scheme may be all right .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 7]: How do _ I _ know ?
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 32]: There 's no way to tell , without going over there , and Corliss wo n't let anybody do that -- oh , he 's got a plausible excuse for it !
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 18]: But I 'm sorry for Lindley : he 's so crazy about Cora , he 's soft .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 13]: And she 's so crazy about Corliss _ she 's _ soft !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 30]: Well , I used to be crazy about her myself , but I 'm not soft -- I 'm not the Lindley kind of loon , thank heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 9]: `` What kind are you , Trumble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 5]: asked Ray , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 15]: `` Not your kind either , '' retorted the other going to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 18]: `` She cut me on the street the other day ; she 's quit speaking to me .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 23]: If you 've got any money , why do n't you take it over to the hotel and give it to Corliss ?
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 10]: She might start speaking to _ you _ again .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 7]: I 'm going to lunch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 7]: He slammed the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 32]: Ray Vilas , left alone , elevated his heels to the sill , and stared out of the window a long time at a gravelled roof which presented little of interest .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 40]: He replenished his glass and his imagination frequently , the latter being so stirred that when , about three o'clock , he noticed the inroads he had made upon the bottle , tears of self-pity came to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 6]: `` Poor little drunkard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 4]: he said aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 7]: `` Go ahead and do it .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 11]: Is n't anything _ you _ wo n't do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 41]: And , having washed his face at a basin in a corner , he set his hat slightly upon one side , picked up a walking stick and departed jauntily , and , to the outward eye , presentably sober .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 56]: Mr. Valentine Corliss would be glad to see him , the clerk at the Richfield Hotel reported , after sending up a card , and upon Ray 's following the card , Mr. Valentine Corliss in person confirmed the message with considerable amusement and a cordiality in which there was some mixture of the quizzical .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 30]: He was the taller ; and the robust manliness of his appearance , his splendid health and boxer 's figure offered a sharp contrast to the superlatively lean tippler .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 28]: Corliss was humorously aware of his advantage : his greeting seemed really to say , `` Hello , my funny bug , here you are again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 19]: though the words of his salutation were entirely courteous ; and he followed it with a hospitable offer .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 16]: `` No , '' said Vilas ; `` I wo n't drink with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 22]: He spoke so gently that the form of his refusal , usually interpreted as truculent , escaped the other 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 55]: He also declined a cigar , apologetically asking permission to light one of his own cigarettes ; then , as he sank into a velour-covered chair , apologized again for the particular attention he was bestowing upon the apartment , which he recognized as one of the suites de luxe of the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 32]: ` Parlour , bedroom , and bath , ' '' he continued , with a melancholy smile ; `` and ` Lachrymae , ' and ` A Reading from Homer . '
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 38]: Sometimes they have ` The Music Lesson , ' or ` Winter Scene ' or ` A Neapolitan Fisher Lad ' instead of ` Lachrymae , ' but they always have ` A Reading from Homer . '
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 30]: When you opened the door , a moment ago , I had a very strong impression that something extraordinary would some time happen to me in this room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 16]: `` Well , '' suggested Corliss , `` you refused a drink in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 17]: `` Even more wonderful than that , '' said Ray , glancing about the place curiously .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 23]: `` It may be a sense of something painful that already has happened here -- perhaps long ago , before your occupancy .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 6]: It has a pathos . ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 16]: `` Most hotel rooms have had something happen in them , '' said Corliss lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 17]: `` I believe the managers usually change the door numbers if what happens is especially unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 11]: Probably they change some of the rugs , also . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 10]: `` I feel -- '' Ray paused , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 13]: `` I feel as if some one had killed himself here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 15]: `` Then no doubt some of the rugs _ have _ been changed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: `` No doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 13]: The caller laughed and waved his hand in dismissal of the topic .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 28]: `` Well , Mr. Corliss , '' he went on , shifting to a brisker tone , `` I have come to make my fortune , too .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 4]: You are Midas .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 10]: Am I of sufficient importance to be touched ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 31]: Valentine Corliss gave him sidelong an almost imperceptibly brief glance of sharpest scrutiny -- it was like the wink of a camera shutter -- but laughed in the same instant .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 9]: `` Which way do you mean that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 26]: `` You have been quick , '' returned the visitor , repaying that glance with equal swiftness , `` to seize upon the American idiom .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 18]: I mean : How small a contribution would you be willing to receive toward your support ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 21]: Corliss did not glance again at Ray ; instead , he looked interested in the smoke of his cigar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 14]: ` Contribution , ' '' he repeated , with no inflection whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 7]: ` Toward my support . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 17]: `` I mean , of course , how small an investment in your oil company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 16]: `` Oh , anything , anything , '' returned the promoter , with quick amiability .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 12]: `` We need to sell all the stock we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: `` All the money you can get ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 3]: `` Precisely .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 11]: It 's really a colossal proposition , Mr. Vilas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 6]: Corliss spoke with brisk enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 14]: `` It 's a perfectly certain enormous profit upon everything that goes in .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 24]: Prince Moliterno cables me later investigations show that the oil-field is more than twice as large as we thought when I left Naples .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 16]: He 's on the ground now , buying up what he can , secretly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 16]: `` I had an impression from Richard Lindley that the secret had been discovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 27]: `` Oh , yes ; but only by a few , and those are trying to keep it quiet from the others , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 14]: Does your partner know of your success in raising a large investment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 6]: `` You mean Lindley 's ?
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 3]: Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 8]: Corliss waved his hand in light deprecation .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 21]: `` Of course that 's something , but Moliterno would hardly be apt to think of it as very large !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 27]: You see he 's putting in about five times that much , himself , and I 've already turned over to him double it for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 20]: Still , it counts -- certainly ; and of course it will be a great thing for Lindley . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 23]: `` I fear , '' Ray said hesitatingly , `` you wo n't be much interested in my drop for your bucket .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 24]: I have twelve hundred dollars in the world ; and it is in the bank -- I stopped there on my way here .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 15]: To be exact , I have twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty-one cents .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 18]: My dear sir , will you allow me to purchase one thousand dollars ' worth of stock ?
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 30]: I will keep the two hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty-one cents to live on -- I may need an egg while waiting for you to make me rich .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 9]: Will you accept so small an investment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 9]: `` Certainly , '' said Corliss , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 12]: You may as well profit by the chance as any one .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 14]: I 'll send you the stock certificates -- we put them at par .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 23]: I 'm attending to that myself , as our secretary , Mr. Madison , is unable to take up his duties . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 11]: Vilas took a cheque-book and a fountain-pen from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 21]: `` Oh , any time , any time , '' said Corliss cheerfully , observing the new investor 's movement .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 11]: `` Now , I think , '' returned Vilas quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 9]: `` How shall I make it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 14]: `` Oh , to me , I suppose , '' answered Corliss indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 26]: `` That will save a little trouble , and I can turn it over to Moliterno , by cable , as I did Lindley 's .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 19]: I 'll give you a receipt -- '' `` You need not mind that , '' said Ray .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 9]: `` Really it is of no importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 21]: `` Of course the cheque itself is a receipt , '' remarked Corliss , tossing it carelessly upon a desk .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 17]: `` You 'll have some handsome returns for that slip of paper , Mr. Vilas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 13]: `` In that blithe hope I came , '' said Ray airily .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 7]: `` I am confident of it .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 11]: I have my own ways of divination , Mr. Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 5]: I have gleams . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 16]: He rose as if to go , but stood looking thoughtfully about the apartment again .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 8]: `` Singular impression , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 34]: `` Not exactly as if I 'd seen it in a dream ; and yet -- and yet -- '' `` You have symptoms of clairvoyance at times , I take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 42]: The conscious , smooth superiority of the dexterous man playing with an inconsequent opponent resounded in this speech , clear as the humming of a struck bell ; and Vilas shot him a single open glance of fire from hectic eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 10]: For that instant , the frailer buck trumpeted challenge .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 31]: Corliss -- broad-shouldered , supple of waist , graceful and strong -- smiled down negligently ; yet the very air between the two men seemed charged with an invisible explosive .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 21]: Ray laughed quickly , as in undisturbed good nature ; then , flourishing his stick , turned toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 26]: `` Oh , no , it is n't clairvoyance -- no more than when I told you that your only real interest is women . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 9]: He paused , his hand upon the door-knob .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 18]: `` I 'm a quaint mixture , however : perhaps I should be handled with care . ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 14]: `` Very good of you , '' laughed Corliss -- `` this warning .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 23]: The afternoon I had the pleasure of meeting you I think I remember your implying that you were a mere marionette . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 6]: `` A haggard harlequin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 13]: snapped Vilas , waving his hand to a mirror across the room .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 8]: `` Do n't I look it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 9]: And the phrase fitted him with tragic accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 4]: `` You see ?
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: What a merry wedding-guest I 'll be !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 12]: I invite you to join me on the nuptial eve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 3]: `` Thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 11]: Who 's getting married : when the nuptial eve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 14]: Ray opened the door , and , turning , rolled his eyes fantastically .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 7]: `` Have n't you heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 8]: `` When Hecate marries John Barleycorn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 4]: He bowed low .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 7]: `` Mr. Midas , adieu . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 17]: Corliss stood in the doorway and watched him walk down the long hall to the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 39]: There , Ray turned and waved his hand , the other responding with gayety which was not assumed : Vilas might be insane , or drunk , or both , but the signature upon his cheque was unassailable .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 12]: Corliss closed the door and began to pace his apartment thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 7]: His expression manifested a peculiar phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 34]: In company , or upon the street , or when he talked with men , the open look and frank eyes of this stalwart young man were disarming and his most winning assets .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 90]: But now , as he paced alone in his apartment , now that he was not upon exhibition , now when there was no eye to behold him , and there was no reason to dissimulate or veil a single thought or feeling , his look was anything but open ; the last trace of frankness disappeared ; the muscles at mouth and eyes shifted ; lines and planes intermingled and altered subtly ; there was a moment of misty transformation -- and the face of another man emerged .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 30]: It was the face of a man uninstructed in mercy ; it was a shrewd and planning face : alert , resourceful , elaborately perceptive , and flawlessly hard .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 16]: But , beyond all , it was the face of a man perpetually on guard .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 24]: He had the air of debating a question , his hands in his pockets , his handsome forehead lined with a temporary indecision .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 38]: His sentry-go extended the length of his two rooms , and each time he came back into his bedroom his glance fell consideringly upon a steamer-trunk of the largest size , at the foot of his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 10]: The trunk was partially packed as if for departure .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 15]: And , indeed , it was the question of departure which he was debating .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 48]: He was a man of varied dexterities , and he had one faculty of high value , which had often saved him , had never betrayed him ; it was intuitive and equal to a sixth sense : he always knew when it was time to go .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 14]: An inner voice warned him ; he trusted to it and obeyed it .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 15]: And it had spoken now , and there was his trunk half-packed in answer .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 56]: But he had stopped midway in his packing , because he had never yet failed to make a clean sweep where there was the slightest chance for one ; he hated to leave a big job before it was completely finished -- and Mr. Wade Trumble had refused to invest in the oil-fields of Basilicata .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 39]: Corliss paused beside the trunk , stood a moment immersed in thought ; then nodded once , decisively , and , turning to a dressing-table , began to place some silver-mounted brushes and bottles in a leather travelling-case .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 9]: There was a knock at the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 31]: He frowned , set down what he had in his hands , went to the door and opened it to find Mr. Pryor , that plain citizen , awaiting entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 18]: Corliss remained motionless in an arrested attitude , his hand upon the knob of the opened door .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 19]: His position did not alter ; he became almost unnaturally still , a rigidity which seemed to increase .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 23]: Then he looked quickly behind him , over his shoulder , and back again , with a swift movement of the head .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 10]: `` No , '' said Pryor , at that .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 7]: `` I do n't want you .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 13]: I just thought I 'd have two minutes ' talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: All right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 9]: `` All right , '' said Corliss quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 5]: `` Come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 18]: He turned carelessly , and walked away from the door keeping between his guest and the desk .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 47]: When he reached the desk , he turned again and leaned against it , his back to it , but in the action of turning his hand had swept a sheet of note-paper over Ray Vilas 's cheque -- a too conspicuous oblong of pale blue .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 9]: Pryor had come in and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 35]: `` I do n't know , '' he began , regarding the other through his glasses , with steady eyes , `` that I 'm going to interfere with you at all , Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 14]: I just happened to strike you -- I was n't looking for you .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 28]: I 'm on vacation , visiting my married daughter that lives here , and I do n't want to mix in if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 5]: Corliss laughed , easily .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 10]: `` There 's nothing for you to mix in .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 9]: You could n't if you wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 32]: `` Well , I hope that 's true , '' said Pryor , with an air of indulgence , curiously like that of a teacher for a pupil who promises improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 5]: `` I do indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 15]: There is n't anybody I 'd like to see turn straight more than you .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 15]: You 're educated and cultured , and refined , and smarter than all hell .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 7]: It would be a big thing .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 15]: That 's one reason I 'm taking the trouble to talk to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 35]: `` I told you I was n't doing anything , '' said Corliss with a petulance as oddly like that of a pupil as the other 's indulgence was like that of a tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 20]: `` This is my own town ; I own property here , and I came here to sell it .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 9]: I can prove it in half-a-minute 's telephoning .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 7]: Where do you come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 11]: `` Easy , easy , '' said Pryor , soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 17]: `` I 've just told you I do n't want to come in at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 8]: `` Then what do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 22]: `` I came to tell you just one thing : to go easy up there at Mr. Madison 's house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 4]: Corliss laughed contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 8]: `` It 's _ my _ house .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 4]: I own it .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 11]: That 's the property I came here to sell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 10]: `` Oh , I know , '' responded Pryor .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 9]: `` That part of it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 21]: But I 've seen you several times with that young lady , and you looked pretty thick , to me .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 14]: You know you have n't got any business doing such things , Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 78]: I know your record from Buda Pesth to Copenhagen and -- '' `` See here , my friend , '' said the younger man , angrily , `` you may be a tiptop spotter for the government when it comes to running down some poor old lady that 's bought a string of pearls in the Rue de la Paix -- '' `` I 've been in the service twenty-eight years , '' remarked Pryor , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 24]: `` All right , '' said the other with a gesture of impatience ; `` and you got me once , all right .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 10]: Well , that 's over , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 7]: Have I tried anything since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 10]: `` Not in that line , '' said Pryor .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 13]: `` Well , what business have you with any other line ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 4]: demanded Corliss angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 10]: `` Who made you general supervisor of public morals ?
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 17]: I want to know -- '' `` Now , what 's the use your getting excited ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 18]: I 'm just here to tell you that I 'm going to keep an eye on you .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 21]: I do n't know many people here , and I have n't taken any particular pains to look you up .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 18]: For all I know , you 're only here to sell your house , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 35]: But I know old man Madison a little , and I kind of took a fancy to him ; he 's a mighty nice old man , and he 's got a nice family .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 44]: He 's sick and it wo n't do to trouble him ; but -- honest , Corliss -- if you do n't slack off in that neighbourhood a little , I 'll have to have a talk with the young lady herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 25]: A derisory light showed faintly in the younger man 's eyes as he inquired , softly : `` That all , Mr. Pryor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 8]: Do n't try anything on out here .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 10]: Not in _ any _ of your lines . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 8]: `` I do n't mean to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 5]: `` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 7]: Sell your house and clear out .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 7]: You 'll find it healthy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 6]: He went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 37]: `` So far as I can see , '' he observed , ruminatively , `` you have n't brought any of that Moliterno crowd you used to work with over to this side with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 16]: `` I have n't seen Moliterno for two years , '' said Corliss , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 10]: `` Well , I 've said my say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: Pryor gave him a last word as he went out .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 10]: `` You keep away from that little girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 4]: `` Ass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 8]: exclaimed Corliss , as the door closed .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 13]: He exhaled a deep breath sharply , and broke into a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 18]: Then he went quickly into his bedroom and began to throw the things out of his trunk .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 51]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN Hedrick Madison 's eyes were not of marble ; his heart was not flint nor his skin steel plate : he was flesh and tender ; he was a vulnerable , breathing boy , with highly developed capacities for pain which were now being taxed to their utmost .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 37]: Once he had loved to run , to leap , to disport himself in the sun , to drink deep of the free air ; he had loved life and one or two of his fellowmen .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 43]: He had borne himself buoyantly , with jaunty self-confidence , even with some intolerance toward the weaknesses of others , not infrequently displaying merriment over their mischances ; but his time had found him at last ; the evil day had come .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 21]: Indian Summer was Indian for him , indeed : sweet death were welcome ; no charity was left in him .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 14]: He leaped no more , but walked broodingly and sought the dark places .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 47]: And yet it could not be said that times were dull for him : the luckless picket who finds himself in an open eighty-acre field , under the eye of a sharpshooter up a tree , would not be apt to describe the experience as dull .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 31]: And Cora never missed a shot ; she loved the work ; her pleasure in it was almost as agonizing for the target as was the accuracy of her fire .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 24]: She was ingenious : the horrible facts at her disposal were damaging enough in all conscience : but they did not content her .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 86]: She invented a love-story , assuming that Hedrick was living it : he was supposed to be pining for Lolita , to be fading , day-by-day , because of enforced separation ; and she contrived this to such an effect of reality , and with such a diabolical affectation of delicacy in referring to it , that the mere remark , with gentle sympathy , `` I think poor Hedrick is looking a little better to-day , '' infallibly produced something closely resembling a spasm .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 34]: She formed the habit of never mentioning her brother in his presence except as `` poor Hedrick , '' a too obvious commiseration of his pretended attachment -- which met with like success .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 74]: Most dreadful of all , she invented romantic phrases and expressions assumed to have been spoken or written by Hedrick in reference to his unhappiness ; and she repeated them so persistently , yet always with such apparent sincerity of belief that they were quotations from him , and not her inventions , that the driven youth knew a fear , sometimes , that the horrid things were actually of his own perpetration .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 64]: The most withering of these was , `` Torn from her I love by the ruthless hand of a parent ... '' It was not completed ; Cora never got any further with it , nor was there need : a howl of fury invariably assured her of an effect as satisfactory as could possibly have been obtained by an effort less impressionistic .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 50]: Life became a series of easy victories for Cora , and she made them somehow the more deadly for Hedrick by not seeming to look at him in his affliction , nor even to be aiming his way : he never could tell when the next shot was coming .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 55]: At the table , the ladies of his family might be deep in dress , or discussing Mr. Madison 's slowly improving condition , when Cora , with utter irrelevance , would sigh , and , looking sadly into her coffee , murmur , `` Ah , _ fond _ mem ` ries ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 15]: or , '' _ Why _ am I haunted by the dead past ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 64]: or , the dreadful , `` Torn from her I love by the ruthless hand of a parent ... '' There was compassion in Laura 's eyes and in his mother 's , but Cora was irresistible , and they always ended by laughing in spite of themselves ; and though they pleaded for Hedrick in private , their remonstrances proved strikingly ineffective .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 21]: Hedrick was the only person who had ever used the high hand with Cora : she found repayment too congenial .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 42]: In the daytime he could not go in the front yard , but Cora 's window would open and a tenderly smiling Cora lean out to call affectionately , `` Do n't walk on the grass -- darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 43]: Or , she would nod happily to him and begin to sing : `` Oh come beloved , love let me press thee , While I caress thee In one long kiss , Lolita ... '' One terror still hung over him .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 30]: If it fell -- as it might at any fatal moment -- then the utmost were indeed done upon him ; and this apprehension bathed his soul in night .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 72]: In his own circle of congenial age and sex he was , by virtue of superior bitterness and precocity of speech , a chief -- a moral castigator , a satirist of manners , a creator of stinging nicknames ; and many nourished unhealed grievances which they had little hope of satisfying against him ; those who attempted it invariably departing with more to avenge than they had brought with them .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 13]: Let these once know what Cora knew ... The vision was unthinkable !
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 39]: It was Cora 's patent desire to release the hideous item , to spread the scandal broadcast among his fellows -- to ring it from the school-bells , to send it winging on the hot winds of Hades !
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 33]: The boys had always liked his yard and the empty stable to play in , and the devices he now employed to divert their activities elsewhere were worthy of a great strategist .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 49]: His energy and an abnormal ingenuity accomplished incredible things : school had been in session several weeks and only one boy had come within conversational distance of Cora ; -- him Hedrick bore away bodily , in simulation of resistless high spirits , a brilliant exhibition of stagecraft .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 39]: And then Cora 's friend , Mrs. Villard , removed her son Egerton from the private school he had hitherto attended , and he made his appearance in Hedrick 's class , one morning at the public school .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 26]: Hedrick 's eye lighted with a savage gleam ; timidly the first joy he had known for a thousand years crept into his grim heart .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 12]: After school , Egerton expiated a part of Cora 's cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 33]: It was a very small part , and the exploit no more than infinitesimally soothing to the conqueror , but when Egerton finally got home he was no sight for a mother .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 21]: Thus Hedrick wrought his own doom : Mrs. Villard telephoned to Cora , and Cora went immediately to see her .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 14]: It happened to Hedrick that he was late leaving home the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 24]: His entrance into his classroom was an undeniable sensation , and within ten minutes the teacher had lost all control of the school .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 9]: It became necessary to send for the principal .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 27]: Recess was a frantic nightmare for Hedrick , and his homeward progress at noon a procession of such uproarious screamers as were his equals in speed .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 47]: The nethermost depths were reached when an ignoble pigtailed person he had always trodden upon flat-footed screamed across the fence from next door , as he reached fancied sanctuary in his own backyard : `` Kiss me some _ more _ , darling little boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 35]: This worm , established upon the fence opposite the conservatory windows , and in direct view from the table in the dining-room , shrieked the accursed request at short intervals throughout the luncheon hour .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: The humour of childhood is sometimes almost intrusive .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 46]: And now began a life for Hedrick which may be rather painfully but truthfully likened to a prolongation of the experiences of a rat that finds itself in the middle of a crowded street in daylight : there is plenty of excitement but no pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 61]: He was pursued , harried , hounded from early morning till nightfall , and even in his bed would hear shrill shouts go down the sidewalk from the throats of juvenile fly-by-nights : `` Oh dar-ling lit-oh darling lit-oh _ lit _ - le boy , _ lit _ - le boy , kiss me some _ more _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 41]: And one day he overheard a remark which strengthened his growing conviction that the cataclysm had affected the whole United States : it was a teacher who spoke , explaining to another a disturbance in the hall of the school .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 16]: She said , behind her hand : '' _ He kissed an idiot _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 26]: Laura had not even remotely foreseen the consequences of her revelation , nor , indeed , did she now properly estimate their effect upon Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 32]: She and her mother were both sorry for him , and did what they could to alleviate his misfortunes , but there was an inevitable remnant of amusement in their sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 41]: Youth , at war , affects stoicism but not resignation : in truth , resignation was not much in Hedrick 's line , and it would be far from the fact to say that he was softened by his sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 10]: He brooded profoundly and his brightest thought was revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 11]: It was not upon Cora that his chief bitterness turned .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 50]: Cora had always been the constant , open enemy : warfare between them was a regular condition of life ; and unconsciously , and without `` thinking it out , '' he recognized the naturalness of her seizing upon the deadliest weapon against him that came to her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 38]: There was nothing unexpected in that : no , the treachery , to his mind , lay in the act of Laura , that non-combatant , who had furnished the natural and habitual enemy with this scourge .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 59]: At all times , and with or without cause , he ever stood ready to do anything possible for the reduction of Cora 's cockiness , but now it was for the taking-down of Laura and the repayment of her uncalled-for and overwhelming assistance to the opposite camp that he lay awake nights and kept his imagination hot .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 40]: Laura was a serene person , so neutral -- outwardly , at least -- and so little concerned for herself in any matter he could bring to mind , that for purposes of revenge she was a difficult proposition .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 13]: And then , in a desperate hour , he remembered her book .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 45]: Only once had he glimpsed it , but she had shown unmistakable agitation of a mysterious sort as she wrote in it , and , upon observing his presence , a prompt determination to prevent his reading a word of what she had written .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 10]: Therefore , it was something peculiarly sacred and intimate .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 18]: This deduction was proved by the care she exercised in keeping the book concealed from all eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 19]: A slow satisfaction began to permeate him : he made up his mind to find that padlocked ledger .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 29]: He determined with devoted ardour that when he found it he would make the worst possible use of it : the worst , that is , for Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 11]: As for consequences to himself , he was beyond them .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 36]: There is an Irish play in which an old woman finds that she no longer fears the sea when it has drowned the last of her sons ; it can do nothing more to her .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 6]: Hedrick no longer feared anything .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 72]: The book was somewhere in Laura 's room , he knew that ; and there were enough opportunities to search , though Laura had a way of coming in unexpectedly which was embarrassing ; and he suffered from a sense of inadequacy when -- on the occasion of his first new attempt -- he answered the casual inquiry as to his presence by saying that he `` had a headache . ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 22]: He felt there was something indirect in the reply ; but Laura was unsuspicious and showed no disposition to be analytical .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 53]: After this , he took the precaution to bring a school-book with him and she often found the boy seated quietly by her west window immersed in study : he said he thought his headaches came from his eyes and that the west light `` sort of eased them a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 31]: The ledger remained undiscovered , although probably there has never been a room more thoroughly and painstakingly searched , without its floor being taken up and its walls torn down .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 25]: The most mysterious , and , at the same time , the most maddening thing about it was the apparent simplicity of the task .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 27]: He was certain that the room contained the book : listening , barefooted , outside the door at night , he had heard the pen scratching .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 14]: The room was as plain as a room can be , and small .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 16]: There was a scantily filled clothes-press ; he had explored every cubic inch of it .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 21]: There was the small writing table with one drawer ; it held only some note-paper and a box of pen-points .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 15]: There was a bureau ; to his certain knowledge it contained no secret whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 23]: There were a few giltless chairs , and a white `` wash-stand , '' a mere basin and slab with exposed plumbing .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 50]: Lastly , there was the bed , a very large and ugly `` Eastlake '' contrivance ; he had acquired a close acquaintance with all of it except the interior of the huge mattress itself , and here , he finally concluded , must of necessity be the solution .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 17]: The surface of the mattress he knew to be unbroken ; nevertheless the book was there .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 25]: He had recently stimulated his deductive powers with a narrative of French journalistic sagacity in a similar case ; and he applied French reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 4]: The ledger existed .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 7]: It was somewhere in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 11]: He had searched everything except the interior of the mattress .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 7]: The ledger was in that interior .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 9]: The exploration thus become necessary presented some difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 40]: Detection in the act would involve explanations hard to invent ; it would not do to say he was looking for his knife ; and he could not think of any excuse altogether free from a flavour of insincerity .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 37]: A lameness beset them all and made them liable to suspicion ; and Laura , once suspicious , might be petty enough to destroy the book , and so put it out of his power forever .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 23]: He must await the right opportunity , and , after a racking exercise of patience , at last he saw it coming .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 17]: Doctor Sloane had permitted his patient to come down stairs for an increasing interval each day .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 19]: Mr. Madison crept , rather than walked , leaning upon his wife and closely attended by Miss Peirce .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 32]: He spoke with difficulty and not clearly ; still , there was a perceptible improvement , and his family were falling into the habit of speaking of him as almost well .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 23]: On that account , Mrs. Madison urged her daughters to accept an invitation from the mother of the once courtly Egerton Villard .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 10]: It was at breakfast that the matter was discussed .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 20]: `` Of course Cora must go , '' Laura began , `` but -- '' `` But nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 3]: interrupted Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 13]: `` How would it look if I went and you did n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 55]: Everybody knows papa 's almost well , and they 'd think it silly for us to give up the first real dance since last spring on that account ; yet they 're just spiteful enough , if I went and you stayed home , to call me a ` girl of no heart . '
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 31]: Besides , '' she added sweetly , `` we ought to go to show Mrs. Villard we are n't hurt because Egerton takes so little notice of poor Hedrick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 10]: Hedrick 's lips moved silently , as in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 10]: `` I 'd rather not , '' said Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 13]: `` I doubt if I 'd have a very good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 13]: `` You would , too , '' returned her sister , decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 32]: `` The men like to dance with you ; you dance every bit as well as I do , and that black lace is the most becoming dress you ever had .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 21]: Nobody ever remembers a black dress , anyway , unless it 's cut very conspicuously , and yours is n't .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 34]: I ca n't go without you ; they love to say nasty things about me , and you 're too good a sister to give 'em this chance , you old dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 11]: She laughed and nodded affectionately across the table at Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 8]: `` You 've got to go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 13]: `` Yes , it would be nicer , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 6]: And so it was settled .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 22]: It was simultaneously settled in Hedrick 's mind that the night of the dance should mark his discovery of the ledger .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 16]: He would have some industrious hours alone with the mysterious mattress , safe from intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 9]: Meekly he lifted his eyes from his plate .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: `` I 'm glad you 're going , sister Laura , '' he said in a gentle voice .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 11]: `` I think a change will do you good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 32]: `` Is n't it wonderful , '' exclaimed Cora , appealing to the others to observe him , `` what an improvement a disappointment in love can make in deportment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 7]: For once , Hedrick only smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 31]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN Laura had spent some thoughtful hours upon her black lace dress with results that astonished her family : it became a ball-gown -- and a splendidly effective one .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 32]: She arranged her dark hair in a more elaborate fashion than ever before , in a close coronal of faintly lustrous braids ; she had no jewellery and obviously needed none .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 54]: Her last action but one before she left her room was to dispose of the slender chain and key she always wore round her neck ; then her final glance at the mirror -- which fairly revealed a lovely woman -- ended in a deprecatory little `` face '' she made at herself .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 24]: It meant : `` Yes , old lady , you fancy yourself very passable in here all by yourself , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 14]: Just wait : you 'll be standing beside Cora in a moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 23]: And when she did stand beside Cora , in the latter 's room , a moment later , her thought seemed warranted .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 39]: Cora , radiant-eyed , in high bloom , and exquisite from head to foot in a shimmering white dancing-dress , a glittering crescent fastening the silver fillet that bound her vivid hair , was a flame of enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 27]: Mrs. Madison , almost weeping with delight , led her daughters proudly , an arm round the waist of each , into her husband 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 29]: Propped with pillows , he reclined in an armchair while Miss Peirce prepared his bed , an occupation she gave over upon this dazzling entrance , departing tactfully .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 20]: `` Look at these , '' cried the mother ; '' -- from our garden , Jim , dear !
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 11]: Do n't we feel rich , you and I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 32]: `` And -- and -- Laura , '' said the sick man , with the slow and imperfect enunication caused by his disease ; `` Laura looks pretty -- too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 7]: `` Is n't she adorable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 4]: Cora exclaimed warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 26]: `` She decided to be the portrait of a young duchess , you see , all stately splendour -- made of snow and midnight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 3]: `` Hear !
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 3]: hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 22]: laughed Laura ; but she blushed with pleasure , and taking Cora 's hand in hers lifted it to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 10]: `` And do you see Cora 's crescent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 4]: demanded Mrs. Madison .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 12]: `` What do you think of _ that _ for magnificence ?
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 25]: She went down town this morning with seven dollars , and came back with that and her party gloves and a dollar in change !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 6]: Is n't she a bargainer ?
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 13]: Even for rhinestones they are the cheapest things you ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 12]: They look precisely like stones of the very finest water . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 46]: They did -- so precisely , indeed , that if the resemblance did not amount to actual identity , then had a jeweller of the town been able to deceive the eye of Valentine Corliss , which was an eye singularly learned in such matters .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 17]: `` They 're -- both smart girls , '' said Madison , `` both of them .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 10]: And they look -- beautiful , to-night -- both .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 6]: Laura is -- amazing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 48]: When they had gone , Mrs. Madison returned from the stairway , and , kneeling beside her husband , put her arms round him gently : she had seen the tear that was marking its irregular pathway down his flaccid , gray cheek , and she understood .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 4]: `` Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 10]: Do n't worry , Jim , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 7]: `` Those bright , beautiful things !
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 7]: -- are n't they treasures ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 12]: `` It 's -- it 's Laura , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 7]: `` Cora will be all right .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 7]: She looks out for -- herself .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 10]: I 'm -- I 'm afraid for -- Laura .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 5]: Are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 11]: `` I 'm not afraid for either of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 13]: But she was : the mother had always been afraid for Cora .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 93]: ... At the dance , the two girls , attended up the stairway to the ballroom by a chattering covey of black-coats , made a sensational entrance to a gallant fanfare of music , an effect which may have been timed to the premonitory tuning of instruments heard during the ascent ; at all events , it was a great success ; and Cora , standing revealed under the wide gilt archway , might have been a lithe and shining figure from the year eighteen-hundred-and-one , about to dance at the Luxembourg .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 29]: She placed her hand upon the sleeve of Richard Lindley , and , glancing intelligently over his shoulder into the eyes of Valentine Corliss , glided rhythmically away .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 9]: People looked at her ; they always did .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 26]: Not only the non-dancers watched her ; eyes everywhere were upon her , even though the owners gyrated , glided and dipped on distant orbits .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 46]: The other girls watched her , as a rule , with a profound , an almost passionate curiosity ; and they were prompt to speak well of her to men , except in trustworthy intimacy , because they did not enjoy being wrongfully thought jealous .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 37]: Many of them kept somewhat aloof from her ; but none of them ever nowadays showed `` superiority '' in her presence , or snubbed her : that had been tried and proved disastrous in rebound .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 34]: Cora never failed to pay her score -- and with a terrifying interest added , her native tendency being to take two eyes for an eye and the whole jaw for a tooth .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 29]: They let her alone , though they asked and asked among themselves the never-monotonous question : `` Why do men fall in love with girls like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 13]: a riddle which , solved , makes wives condescending to their husbands .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 45]: Most of the people at this dance had known one another as friends , or antagonists , or indifferent acquaintances , for years , and in such an assembly there are always two worlds , that of the women and that of the men .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 58]: Each has its own vision , radically different from that of the other ; but the greatest difference is that the men are unaware of the other world , only a few of them -- usually queer ones like Ray Vilas -- vaguely perceiving that there are two visions , while all the women understand both perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 17]: The men splash about on the surface ; the women keep their eyes open under water .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 36]: Or , the life of the assembly is like a bright tapestry : the men take it as a picture and are not troubled to know how it is produced ; but women are weavers .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 51]: There was a Beauty of far-flung renown at Mrs. Villard 's to-night : Mary Kane , a creature so made and coloured that young men at sight of her became as water and older men were apt to wonder regretfully why all women could not have been made like Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 45]: She was a kindly soul , and never intentionally outshone her sisters ; but the perfect sumptuousness of her had sometimes tried the amiability of Cora Madison , to whom such success without effort and without spark seemed unfair , as well as bovine .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 48]: Miss Kane was a central figure at the dance , shining tranquilly in a new triumph : that day her engagement had been announced to Mr. George Wattling , a young man of no special attainments , but desirable in his possessions and suitable to his happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 34]: The pair radiated the pardonable , gay importance of newly engaged people , and Cora , who had never before bestowed any notice upon Mr. Wattling , now examined him with thoughtful attention .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 21]: Finding him at her elbow in a group about a punch bowl , between dances , she offered warm felicitations .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 41]: `` But I do n't suppose you care whether _ I _ care for you to be happy or not , '' she added , with a little plaintive laugh ; -- `` you 've always hated me so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 34]: Mr. Wattling was startled : never before had he imagined that Cora Madison had given him a thought ; but there was not only thought , there was feeling , in this speech .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 17]: She seemed to be concealing with bravery an even deeper feeling than the one inadvertently expressed .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 12]: `` Why , what on earth makes you think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 4]: `` Think it ?
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 7]: I _ know _ it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 27]: She gave him a strange look , luminous yet mysterious , a curtain withdrawn only to show a shining mist with something undefined but dazzling beyond .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 8]: `` I 've always known it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 8]: And she turned away from him abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 5]: He sprang after her .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: `` But you 're wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 14]: I 've never -- '' `` Oh , yes , you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 38]: They began to discuss it , and for better consideration of the theme it became necessary for Cora to `` cut '' the next dance , promised to another , and to give it to Mr. Wattling .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 14]: They danced several times together , and Mr. Wattling 's expression was serious .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 19]: The weavers of the tapestry smiled and whispered things the men would not have understood -- nor believed .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 23]: Ray Vilas , seated alone in a recessed and softly lighted gallery , did not once lose sight of the flitting sorceress .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 38]: With his elbows on the railing , he leaned out , his head swaying slowly and mechanically as she swept up and down the tumultuously moving room , his passionate eyes gaunt and brilliant with his hunger .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 27]: And something very like a general thrill passed over the assembly when , a little later , it was seen that he was dancing with her .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 15]: Laura , catching a glimpse of this couple , started and looked profoundly disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 81]: The extravagance of Vilas 's passion and the depths he sounded , in his absurd despair when discarded , had been matters of almost public gossip ; he was accounted a somewhat scandalous and unbalanced but picturesque figure ; and for the lady whose light hand had wrought such havoc upon him to be seen dancing with him was sufficiently startling to elicit the universal remark -- evidently considered superlative -- that it was `` just like Cora Madison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 52]: Cora usually perceived , with an admirably clear head , all that went on about her ; and she was conscious of increasing the sensation , when after a few turns round the room , she allowed her partner to conduct her to a secluding grove of palms in the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 28]: She sank into the chair he offered , and , fixing her eyes upon a small lamp of coloured glass which hung overhead , ostentatiously looked bored .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 22]: `` At your feet , Cora , '' he said , seating himself upon a stool , and leaning toward her .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 15]: `` Is n't it appropriate that we should talk to music -- we two ?
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 16]: It should n't be that quick step though -- not dance-music -- should it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 11]: `` Do n't know 'm sure , '' murmured Cora .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 14]: `` You were kind to dance with me , '' he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 22]: `` I dared to speak to you -- '' She did not change her attitude nor the direction of her glance .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 15]: `` I could n't cut you very well with the whole town looking on .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 8]: I 'm tired of being talked about .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 21]: Besides , I do n't care much who I dance with -- so he does n't step on me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 25]: `` Cora , '' he said , `` it is the prelude to ` L'Arlesienne ' that they should play for you and me .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 10]: Yes , I think it should be that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 7]: `` Never heard of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 34]: `` It 's just a rustic tragedy , the story of a boy in the south of France who lets love become his whole life , and then -- it kills him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 10]: `` Sounds very stupid , '' she commented languidly .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 23]: `` People do sometimes die of love , even nowadays , '' he said , tremulously -- `` in the South . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 52]: She let her eyes drift indifferently to him and perceived that he was trembling from head to foot ; that his hands and knees shook piteously ; that his lips quivered and twitched ; and , at sight of this agitation , an expression of strong distaste came to her face .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 5]: `` I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 7]: Her eyes returned to the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 18]: `` You 're from the South , and of course it 's going to kill you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 16]: `` You did n't speak the exact words you had in your mind . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 15]: `` Oh , what words did I have ` in my mind ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 4]: she asked impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 20]: `` What you really meant was : ` If it does kill you , what of it ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 9]: She laughed , and sighed as for release .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 19]: `` Cora , '' he said huskily , `` I understand you a little because you possess me .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 22]: I 've never -- literally never -- had another thought since the first time I saw you : nothing but you .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 9]: I think of you -- actually every moment .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 21]: Drunk or sober , asleep or -- awake , it 's nothing but you , you , _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 25]: It will never be different : I do n't know why I ca n't get over it -- I only know I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 14]: You own me ; you burn like a hot coal in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 9]: You 're through with me , I know .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 5]: You drained me dry .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 20]: You 're like a child who eats so heartily of what he likes that he never touches it again .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 10]: And I 'm a dish you 're sick of .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 13]: Oh , it 's all plain enough , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 15]: I 'm not exciting any more -- no , just a nauseous slave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 10]: `` Do you want people to hear you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 10]: she inquired angrily , for his voice had risen .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 5]: He tempered his tone .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 26]: `` Cora , when you liked me you went a pretty clipping gait with me , '' he said , trembling even more than before .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 36]: `` But you 're infinitely more infatuated with this Toreador of a Corliss than you were with me ; you 're lost in him ; you 're slaving for him as I would for you .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 21]: How far are you going with -- '' `` Do you want me to walk away and leave you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 15]: she asked , suddenly sitting up straight and looking at him with dilating eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 22]: `` If you want a ` scene ' -- '' `` It 's over , '' he said , more calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 10]: `` I know now how dangerous the man is .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 11]: Of course you will tell him I said that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 4]: He laughed quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 20]: `` Well -- between a dangerous chap and a desperate one , we may look for some lively times !
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 22]: Do you know , I believe I think about as continuously of him , lately , as I do of you .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 27]: That 's why I put almost my last cent into his oil company , and got what may be almost my last dance with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 16]: `` I would n't call it ` almost ' your last dance with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 4]: she returned icily .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 8]: `` Not after what you 've said .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 16]: I had a foolish idea you could behave -- well , at least decently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 17]: `` Did Corliss tell you that I insulted him in his rooms at the hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 5]: She laughed , genuinely .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: `` I see him letting you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 6]: `` He did , however .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 12]: By manner and in speech I purposely and deliberately insulted him .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 29]: You 'll tell him every word of this , of course , and he 'll laugh at it , but I give myself the pleasure of telling you .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 35]: I put the proposition of an ` investment ' to him in a way nobody not a crook would have allowed to be smoothed over -- and he allowed it to be smoothed over .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 4]: He ate it !
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 34]: I felt he was a swindler when he was showing Richard Lindley his maps and papers , and now I 've proved it to myself , and it 's worth the price . ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 50]: Often , when they had danced , and often during this interview , his eyes lifted curiously to the white flaming crescent in her hair ; now they fixed themselves upon it , and in a flash of divination he cried : `` You wear it for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 5]: She did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 5]: `` Finished raving ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 14]: `` I gave Corliss a thousand dollars , '' he said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 26]: `` Considering the fact that it was my last , I flatter myself it was not unhandsomely done -- though I may never need it .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 64]: It has struck me that the sum was about what a man who had just cleaned up fifty thousand might regard as a sort of ` extra ' -- ` for lagniappe ' -- and that he might have thought it an appropriate amount to invest in a present some jewels perhaps -- to place in the hair of a pretty friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 26]: She sprang to her feet , furious , but he stood in front of her and was able to bar the way for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 40]: `` Cora , I 'll have a last word with you if I have to hold you , '' he said with great rapidity and in a voice which shook with the intense repression he was putting upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 14]: `` We do one thing in the South , where I came from .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 12]: We protect our women -- '' `` This looks like it !
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 24]: Keeping me when -- '' `` I love you , '' he said , his face whiter than she had ever seen it .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 5]: `` I love you !
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 5]: I 'm your dog !
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 15]: You take care of yourself if you want to take care of anybody else !
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 13]: As sure as -- '' `` My dance , Miss Madison . ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 42]: A young gentleman on vacation from the navy had approached , and , with perfect unconsciousness of what he was interrupting , but with well-founded certainty that he was welcome to the lady , urged his claim in a confident voice .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 26]: `` I thought it would never come , you know ; but it 's here at last and so am I. '' He laughed propitiatingly .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 6]: Ray yielded now at once .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 26]: She moved him aside with her gloved forearm as if he were merely an awkward stranger who unwittingly stood between her and the claiming partner .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 28]: Carrying the gesture farther , she took the latter 's arm , and smilingly , and without a backward glance , passed onward and left the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 48]: The lieutenant , who had met her once or twice before , was her partner for the succeeding dance as well , and , having noted the advantages of the place where he had discovered her , persuaded her to return there to sit through the second .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 10]: Then without any fatiguing preamble , he proposed marriage .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 34]: Cora did not accept , but effected a compromise , which , for the present , was to consist of an exchange of photographs -LRB- his to be in uniform -RRB- and letters .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: She was having an evening to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 48]: Ray 's attack on Corliss had no dimming effect ; her thought of it being that she was `` used to his raving '' ; it meant nothing ; and since Ray had prophesied she would tell Corliss about it , she decided not to do so .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 49]: The naval young gentleman and Valentine Corliss were the greatest of all the lions among ladies that night ; she had easily annexed the lieutenant , and Corliss was hers already ; though , for a purpose , she had not yet been seen in company with him .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 9]: He was visibly `` making an impression . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 61]: His name , as he had said to Richard Lindley , was held in honour in the town ; and there was a flavour of fancied romance in his absence since boyhood in unknown parts , and his return now with a ` foreign air ' and a bow that almost took the breath of some of the younger recipients .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 38]: He was , too , in his way , the handsomest man in the room ; and the smiling , open frankness of his look , the ready cordiality of his manner , were found very winning .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 6]: He caused plenty of flutter .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 16]: Cora waited till the evening was half over before she gave him any visible attention .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 50]: Then , during a silence of the music , between two dances , she made him a negligent sign with her hand , the gesture of one indifferently beckoning a creature who is certain to come , and went on talking casually to the man who was with her .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 47]: Corliss was the length of the room from her , chatting gayly with a large group of girls and women ; but he immediately nodded to her , made his bow to individuals of the group , and crossed the vacant , glistening floor to her .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 25]: Cora gave him no greeting whatever ; she dismissed her former partner and carelessly turned away with Corliss to some chairs in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 7]: `` Do you see that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 12]: asked Vilas , leaning over the balcony railing with Richard Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 3]: `` Look !
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 12]: She 's showing the other girls -- do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 32]: He 's the New Man ; she let 'em hope she was n't going in for him ; a lot of them probably did n't even know that she knew him .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 48]: She sent him out on parade till they 're all excited about him ; now she shows 'em he 's entirely her property -- and does it so matter-of-factly that it 's rubbed in twice as hard as if she seemed to take some pains about it .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 25]: He does n't dance : she 'll sit out with him now , till they all read the tag she 's put on him .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 8]: She says she hates being talked about .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 5]: She lives on it !
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 8]: -- so long as it 's envious .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 12]: And did you see her with that chap from the navy ?
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 21]: Neptune thinks he 's dallying with Venus perhaps , but he 'll get -- '' Lindley looked at him commiseratingly .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 9]: `` I think I never saw prettier decorations .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 6]: Have you noticed , Ray ?
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 8]: Must have used a thousand chrysanthemums . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 4]: `` Toreador ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 50]: whispered the other between his teeth , looking at Corliss ; then , turning to his companion , he asked : `` Has it occurred to you to get any information about Basilicata , or about the ancestral domain of the Moliterni , from our consul-general at Naples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 3]: Richard hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 5]: `` Well -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 8]: Yes , I did think of that .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 8]: Yes , I thought of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 9]: `` But you did n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 8]: That is , I have n't yet .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 19]: You see , Corliss explained to me that -- '' His friend interrupted him with a sour laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 5]: `` Oh , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 14]: He 's one of the greatest explainers ever welcomed to our city ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 28]: Richard said mildly : `` And then , Ray , once I 've gone into a thing I -- I do n't like to seem suspicious . ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 6]: `` Poor old Dick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 4]: returned Vilas compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 15]: `` You kind , easy , sincere men are so conscientiously untruthful with yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 45]: You know in your heart that Cora would be furious with you if you seemed suspicious , and she 's been so nice to you since you put in your savings to please her , that you ca n't bear to risk offending her .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 31]: She 's twisted you around her little finger , and the unnamed fear that haunts you is that you wo n't be allowed to stay there -- even twisted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 16]: `` Pretty decorations , Ray , '' said Richard ; but he grew very red .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 36]: `` Do you know what you 'll do , '' asked Ray , regarding him keenly , `` if this Don Giovanni from Sunny It ' is shown up as a plain get-rich-quick swindler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 20]: `` I have n't considered -- '' `` You would do precisely , '' said Ray , `` nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 6]: Cora 'd see to that .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 25]: You 'd sigh and go to work again , beginning at the beginning where you were years ago , and doing it all over .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 8]: Admirable resignation , but not for me !
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 16]: I 'm a stockholder in his company and in shape to ` take steps ' !
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 19]: I do n't know if I 'd be patient enough to make them legal -- perhaps I should .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 9]: He may be safe on the legal side .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 25]: I 'll know more about that when I find out if there is a Prince Moliterno in Naples who owns land in Basilicata . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 8]: `` You do n't doubt it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 5]: `` I doubt everything !
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 19]: In this particular matter I 'll have less to doubt when I get an answer from the consul-general .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 10]: _ I _ 've written , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 4]: Lindley looked disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 5]: `` You have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 7]: Vilas read him at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 9]: `` You 're afraid to find out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 11]: Then he set his hand on the other 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 17]: `` If there ever was a God 's fool , it 's you , Dick Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 22]: Really , I wonder the world has n't kicked you around more than it has ; you 'd never kick back !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 9]: You 're as easy as an old shoe .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 71]: Cora makes you unhappy , '' he went on , and with the very mention of her name , his voice shook with passion , -- `` but on my soul I do n't believe you know what jealousy means : you do n't even understand hate ; you do n't eat your heart -- '' `` Let 's go and eat something better , '' suggested Richard , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 16]: `` There 's a continuous supper downstairs and I hear it 's very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 10]: Ray smiled , rescued for a second from himself .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 24]: `` There is n't anything better than your heart , you old window-pane , and I 'm glad you do n't eat it .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 88]: And if I ever mix it up with Don Giovanni T. Corliss -- ` T ' stands for Toreador -- I do believe it 'll be partly on your -- '' He paused , leaving the sentence unfinished , as his attention was caught by the abysmal attitude of a figure in another part of the gallery : Mr. Wade Trumble , alone in a corner , sitting upon the small of his small back , munching at an unlighted cigar and otherwise manifesting a biting gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 11]: Ray drew Lindley 's attention to this tableau of pain .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 9]: `` Here 's a three of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 12]: He turned to look down into the rhythmic kaleidoscope of dancers .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 17]: `` And there goes the girl we all _ ought _ to be morbid about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 6]: `` Who is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 4]: `` Laura Madison .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 5]: Why are n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 23]: What a self-respecting creature she is , with that cool , sweet steadiness of hers -- she 's like a mountain lake .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 30]: She 's lovely and she plays like an angel , but so far as anybody 's ever thinking about her is concerned she might almost as well not exist .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 25]: Yet she 's really beautiful to-night , if you can manage to think of her except as a sort of retinue for Cora . ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 9]: `` She _ is _ rather beautiful to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 87]: Laura 's always a very nice-looking girl , '' said Richard , and with the advent of an idea , he added : `` I think one reason she is n't more conspicuous and thought about is that she is so quiet , '' and , upon his companion 's greeting this inspiration with a burst of laughter , `` Yes , that was a brilliant deduction , '' he said ; `` but I do think she 's about the quietest person I ever knew .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 23]: I 've noticed there are times when she 'll scarcely speak at all for half an hour , or even more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 12]: `` You 're not precisely noisy yourself , '' said Ray .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 10]: `` Have you danced with her this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 26]: `` Why , no , '' returned the other , in a tone which showed this omission to be a discovery ; `` not yet .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 7]: I must , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 11]: `` Yes , she 's really ` rather ' beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 15]: Also , she dances ` rather ' better than any other girl in town .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 8]: Go and perform your painful duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 16]: `` Perhaps I 'd better , '' said Richard thoughtfully , not perceiving the satire .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 14]: `` At any rate , I 'll ask her for the next . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 5]: He found it unengaged .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 24]: There came to Laura 's face an April change as he approached , and she saw he meant to ask her to dance .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 33]: And , as they swam out into the maelstrom , he noticed it , and remarked that it _ was _ rather warm , to which she replied by a cheerful nod .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 53]: Presently there came into Richard 's mind the thought that he was really an excellent dancer ; but he did not recall that he had always formed the same pleasing estimate of himself when he danced with Laura , nor realize that other young men enjoyed similar self-help when dancing with her .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 44]: And yet he repeated to her what Ray had said of her dancing , and when she laughed as in appreciation of a thing intended humorously , he laughed , too , but insisted that she did dance `` very well indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 14]: She laughed again at that , and they danced on , not talking .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 44]: He had no sense of `` guiding '' her ; there was no feeling of effort whatever ; she seemed to move spontaneously with his wish , not to his touch ; indeed , he was not sensible of touching her at all .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 18]: `` Why , Laura , '' he exclaimed suddenly , `` you dance _ beautifully _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 33]: She stumbled and almost fell ; saved herself by clutching at his arm ; he caught her ; and the pair stopped where they were , in the middle of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 25]: A flash of dazed incredulity from her dark eyes swept him ; there was something in it of the child dodging an unexpected blow .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 7]: `` Did I trip you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 4]: he asked anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 16]: `` No , '' she laughed , quickly , and her cheeks grew even redder .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 5]: `` I tripped myself .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 16]: Was n't that too bad -- just when you were thinking that I danced well !
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 5]: Let 's sit down .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 4]: May we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 9]: They went to some chairs against a wall .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 33]: There , as they sat , Cora swung by them , dancing again with her lieutenant , and looking up trancedly into the gallant eyes of the triumphant and intoxicated young man .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 15]: Visibly , she was a woman with a suitor 's embracing arm about her .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 6]: Richard 's eyes followed them .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 7]: `` Ah , do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 7]: said Laura in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 5]: He turned to her .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 6]: `` Do n't what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 15]: `` I did n't mean to speak out loud , '' she said tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 11]: `` But I meant : do n't look so troubled .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 16]: It does n't mean anything at all -- her coquetting with that bird of passage .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 9]: He 's going away in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 12]: `` I do n't think I was troubling about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 29]: `` Well , whatever it was '' -- she paused , and laughed with a plaintive timidity -- `` why , just do n't trouble about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 9]: `` Do I look very much troubled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 4]: he asked seriously .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 13]: And you do n't look very gay when you 're not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 7]: She laughed with more assurance now .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 15]: `` I think you 're always the wistfulest looking man I ever saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 17]: `` Everybody laughs at me , I believe , '' he said , with continued seriousness .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 11]: `` Even Ray Vilas thinks I 'm an utter fool .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 10]: Am I , do _ you _ think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 12]: He turned as he spoke and glanced inquiringly into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 8]: What he saw surprised and dismayed him .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 11]: `` For heaven 's sake , do n't cry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 4]: he whispered hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 11]: She bent her head , turning her face from him .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 12]: `` I 've been very hopeful lately , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 27]: `` Cora has been so kind to me since I did what she wanted me to , that I -- '' He gave a deep sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 22]: `` But if you 're _ that _ sorry for me , my chances with her must be pretty desperate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 30]: She did not alter her attitude , but with her down-bent face still away from him , said huskily : `` It is n't you I 'm sorry for .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 15]: You must n't ever give up ; you must keep on trying and trying .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 16]: If you give up , I do n't know what will become of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 10]: A moment later she rose suddenly to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 16]: `` Let 's finish our dance , '' she said , giving him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 11]: `` I 'm sure I wo n't stumble again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 50]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN The two girls let themselves into the house noiselessly , and , turning out the hall-light , left for them by their mother , crept upstairs on tiptoe ; and went through the upper hall directly to Laura 's room -- Cora 's being nearer the sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 24]: At their age it is proper that a gayety be used three times : in anticipation , and actually , and in after-rehearsal .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 22]: The last was of course now in order : they went to Laura 's room to `` talk it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 21]: There was no gas-fixture in this small chamber ; but they found Laura 's oil-lamp burning brightly upon her writing-table .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 5]: `` How queer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 12]: said Laura with some surprise , as she closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 20]: `` Mother never leaves the lamp lit for me ; she 's always so afraid of lamps exploding . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 39]: `` Perhaps Miss Peirce came in here to read , and forgot to turn it out , '' suggested Cora , seating herself on the edge of the bed and letting her silk wrap fall from her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 80]: `` Oh , Laura , was n't he gorgeous ... '' She referred to the gallant defender of our seas , it appeared , and while Laura undressed and got into a wrapper , Cora recounted in detail the history of the impetuous sailor 's enthrallment ; -- a resume predicted three hours earlier by a gleeful whisper hissed across the maritime shoulder as the sisters swung near each other during a waltz : '' _ proposed _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 16]: `` I 've always heard they 're horribly inconstant , '' she said , regretfully .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 15]: `` But , oh , Laura , was n't he beautiful to look at !
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 10]: Do you think he 's more beautiful than Val ?
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 10]: No -- do n't tell me if you do .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 8]: I do n't want to hear it !
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 15]: Val was so provoking : he did n't seem to mind it at all .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 23]: He 's nothing but a big brute sometimes : he would n't even admit that he minded , when I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 24]: I was idiot enough to ask ; I could n't help it ; he was so tantalizing and exasperating -- laughing at me .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 20]: I never knew anybody like him ; he 's so sure of himself and he can be so cold .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 20]: Sometimes I wonder if he really cares about anything , deep down in his heart -- anything except himself .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 66]: He seems so selfish : there are times when he almost makes me hate him ; but just when I get to thinking I do , I find I do n't -- he 's so deliciously strong , and there 's such a _ big _ luxury in being understood : I always feel he _ knows _ me clear to the bone , somehow !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 18]: But , oh , '' she sighed regretfully , `` does n't a uniform become a man ?
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 7]: They ought to all wear 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 26]: It would look silly on such a little goat as that Wade Trumble , though : nothing could make him look like a whole man .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 8]: Did you see him glaring at me ?
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 2]: Beast !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 26]: I was going to be so nice and kittenish and do all my prettiest tricks for him , to help Val with his oil company .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 37]: Val thinks Wade would come in yet , if I 'D only get him in the mood to have another talk with Val about it ; but the spiteful little rat would n't come near me .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 22]: I believe that was one of the reasons Val laughed at me and pretended not to mind my getting proposed to .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 17]: He _ must _ have minded ; he could n't have helped minding it , really .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 18]: That 's his way ; he 's so _ mean _ -- he wo n't show things .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 6]: He knows _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 37]: I ca n't keep anything from him ; he reads _ me _ like a signboard ; and then about himself he keeps me guessing , and I ca n't tell when I 've guessed right .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 14]: Ray Vilas behaved disgustingly , of course ; he was horrid and awful .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 6]: I might have expected it .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 23]: I suppose Richard was wailing _ his _ tiresome sorrows on your poor shoulder -- '' `` No , '' said Laura .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 6]: `` He was very cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 11]: He seemed glad you were having a good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 10]: `` He did n't look particularly cheerful at me .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 21]: I never saw so slow a man : I wonder when he 's going to find out about that pendant .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 12]: Val would have seen it the instant I put it on .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 6]: And , oh , Laura !
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 6]: is n't George Wattling funny ?
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 7]: He 's just _ soft _ !
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 29]: He 's good-looking though , '' she continued pensively , adding , `` I promised to motor out to the Country Club with him to-morrow for tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 12]: `` Oh , Cora , '' protested Laura , `` no !
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 5]: Please do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 14]: `` I 've promised ; so I 'll have to , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 3]: Cora laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 8]: `` It 'll do Mary Kane good .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 19]: Oh , I 'm not going to bother much with _ him _ -- he makes me tired .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 35]: I never saw anything so complacent as that girl when she came in to-night , as if her little Georgie was the greatest capture the world had ever seen ... '' She chattered on .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 13]: Laura , passive , listened with a thoughtful expression , somewhat preoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 6]: The talker yawned at last .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 28]: `` It must be after three , '' she said , listlessly , having gone over her evening so often that the colours were beginning to fade .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 4]: She yawned again .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 26]: `` Laura , '' she remarked absently , `` I do n't see how you can sleep in this bed ; it sags so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 12]: `` I 've never noticed it , '' said her sister .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 10]: `` It 's a very comfortable old bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 25]: Cora went to her to be unfastened , reverting to the lieutenant during the operation , and kissing the tire-woman warmly at its conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 16]: `` You 're always so sweet to me , Laura , '' she said affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 10]: `` I do n't know how you manage it .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 18]: You 're so good '' -- she laughed -- `` sometimes I wonder how you stand me .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 17]: If I were you , I 'm positive I could n't stand me at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 24]: Another kiss and a hearty embrace , and she picked up her wrap and skurried silently through the hall to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 25]: It was very late , but Laura wrote for almost an hour in her book -LRB- which was undisturbed -RRB- before she felt drowsy .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 15]: Then she extinguished the lamp , put the book away and got into bed .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 37]: It was almost as if she had attempted to lie upon the empty air : the mattress sagged under her weight as if it had been a hammock ; and something tore with a ripping sound .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 21]: There was a crash , and a choked yell from a muffled voice somewhere , as the bed gave way .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 28]: For an instant , Laura fought wildly in an entanglement of what she insufficiently perceived to be springs , slats and bedclothes with something alive squirming underneath .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 33]: She cleared herself and sprang free , screaming , but even in her fright she remembered her father and clapped her hand over her mouth that she might keep from screaming again .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 27]: She dove at the door , opened it , and fled through the hall to Cora 's room , still holding her hand over her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 3]: `` Cora !
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 5]: Oh , Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 12]: she panted , and flung herself upon her sister 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 14]: Cora was up instantly ; and had lit the gas in a trice .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 7]: `` There 's a burglar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 5]: Laura contrived to gasp .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 5]: `` In my room !
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 5]: Under the bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 6]: `` I fell on him !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 8]: Something 's the matter with the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 3]: It broke .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 6]: I fell on him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 6]: Cora stared at her wide-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 8]: `` Why , it ca n't be .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 8]: Think how long I was in there .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 14]: Your bed broke , and you just thought there was some one there .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 5]: You imagined it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 8]: `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 3]: wailed Laura .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 16]: `` I _ heard _ him : he gave a kind of dreadful grunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 7]: `` Are you sure ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 4]: _ Sure _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 5]: He wriggled -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 8]: I could _ feel _ him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 8]: Cora seized a box of matches again .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 9]: `` I 'm going to find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 8]: `` Oh , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 5]: protested Laura , cowering .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 6]: `` Yes , I am .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 16]: If there 's a burglar in the house I 'm going to find him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 8]: `` We must n't wake papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 7]: `` No , nor mamma either .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 46]: You stay here if you want to -- '' `` Let 's call Hedrick , '' suggested the pallid Laura ; `` or put our heads out of the window and scream for -- '' Cora laughed ; she was not in the least frightened .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 10]: `` That would n't wake papa , of course !
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 17]: If we had a telephone I 'd send for the police ; but we have n't .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 12]: I 'm going to see if there 's any one there .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 24]: A burglar 's a man , I guess , and I ca n't imagine myself being afraid of any _ man _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 22]: Laura clung to her , but Cora shook her off and went through the hall undaunted , Laura faltering behind her .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 29]: Cora lighted matches with a perfectly steady hand ; she hesitated on the threshold of Laura 's room no more than a moment , then lit the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 10]: Laura stifled a shriek at sight of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 6]: `` Look , look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 25]: `` There 's no one under it now , that 's certain , '' said Cora , and boldly lifted a corner of it .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 13]: `` Why , it 's been cut all to pieces from underneath !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 10]: You 're right ; there was some one here .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 5]: It 's practically dismembered .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 11]: Do n't you remember my telling you how it sagged ?
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 11]: And I was only sitting on the edge of it !
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 28]: The slats have all been moved out of place , and as for the mattress , it 's just a mess of springs and that stuffing stuff .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 11]: He must have thought the silver was hidden there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 8]: `` Oh , oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 3]: moaned Laura .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 9]: `` He _ wriggled _ -- ugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 6]: Cora picked up the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 19]: `` Well , we 've got to go over the house -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 7]: I 'll go alone then . ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 8]: `` You _ ca n't _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 7]: `` I will , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 10]: The two girls had changed places in this emergency .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 18]: In her fright Laura was dependent , clinging : actual contact with the intruder had unnerved her .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 24]: It took all her will to accompany her sister upon the tour of inspection , and throughout she cowered behind the dauntless Cora .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 15]: It was the first time in their lives that their positions had been reversed .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 52]: From the days of Cora 's babyhood , Laura had formed the habit of petting and shielding the little sister , but now that the possibility became imminent of confronting an unknown and dangerous man , Laura was so shaken that , overcome by fear , she let Cora go first .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 21]: Cora had not boasted in vain of her bravery ; in truth , she was not afraid of any man .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 23]: They found the fastenings of the doors secure and likewise those of all the windows , until they came to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 20]: There , the cook had left a window up , which plausibly explained the marauder 's mode of ingress .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 32]: Then , at Cora 's insistence , and to Laura 's shivering horror , they searched both cellar and garret , and concluded that he had escaped by the same means .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 62]: Except Laura 's bed , nothing in the house had been disturbed ; but this eccentricity on the part of a burglar , though it indeed struck the two girls as peculiar , was not so pointedly mysterious to them as it might have been had they possessed a somewhat greater familiarity with the habits of criminals whose crimes are professional .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 31]: They finally retired , Laura sleeping with her sister , and Cora had begun to talk of the lieutenant again , instead of the burglar , before Laura fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 35]: In spite of the short hours for sleep , both girls appeared at the breakfast-table before the meal was over , and were naturally pleased with the staccato of excitement evoked by their news .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 23]: Mrs. Madison and Miss Peirce were warm in admiration of their bravery , but in the same breath condemned it as foolhardy .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 9]: `` I never knew such wonderful girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 7]: exclaimed the mother , almost tearfully .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 6]: `` You crazy little lions !
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 9]: To think of your not even waking Hedrick !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 35]: And you did n't have even a poker and were in your bare feet -- and went down in the _ cellar _ -- '' `` It was all Cora , '' protested Laura .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 9]: `` I 'm a hopeless , disgusting coward .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 10]: I never knew what a coward I was before .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 11]: Cora carried the lamp and went ahead like a drum-major .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 17]: I just trailed along behind her , ready to shriek and run -- or faint ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 14]: `` Could you tell anything about him when you fell on him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 4]: inquired Miss Peirce .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 11]: `` What was his voice like when he shouted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 3]: `` Choked .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 10]: It was a horrible , jolted kind of cry .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 6]: It hardly sounded human . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 27]: `` Could you tell anything about whether he was a large man , or small , or -- '' `` Only that he seemed very active .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 6]: He seemed to be kicking .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 8]: He _ wriggled _ -- ugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 15]: They evolved a plausible theory of the burglar 's motives and line of reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 44]: `` You see , '' said Miss Peirce , much stirred , in summing up the adventure , `` he either jimmies the window , or finds it open already , and Sarah 's mistaken and she _ did _ leave it open !
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 13]: Then he searched the downstairs first , and did n't find anything .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 19]: Then he came upstairs , and was afraid to come into any of the rooms where we were .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 17]: He could tell which rooms had people in them by hearing us breathing through the keyholes .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 19]: He finds two rooms empty , and probably he made a thorough search of Miss Cora 's first .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 15]: But he is n't after silver toilet articles and pretty little things like that .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 60]: He wants really big booty or none , so he decides that an out-of-the-way , unimportant room like Miss Laura 's is where the family would be most apt to hide valuables , jewellery and silver , and he knows that mattresses have often been selected as hiding-places ; so he gets under the bed and goes to work .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 30]: Then Miss Cora and Miss Laura come in so quietly -- not wanting to wake anybody -- that he does n't hear them , and he gets caught there .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 10]: That 's the way it must have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 23]: `` But why , '' Mrs. Madison inquired of this authority , `` why do you suppose he lit the lamp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 12]: `` To see by , '' answered the ready Miss Peirce .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 6]: It was accepted as final .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 17]: Further discussion was temporarily interrupted by the discovery that Hedrick had fallen asleep in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 13]: `` Do n't bother him , Cora , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 24]: `` He 's finished eating -- let him sleep a few minutes , if he wants to , before he goes to school .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 7]: He 's not at all well .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 16]: He played too hard , yesterday afternoon , and hurt his knee , he said .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 11]: He came down limping this morning and looking very badly .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 15]: He ought n't to run and climb about the stable so much after school .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 7]: See how utterly exhausted he looks !
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 11]: -- Not even this excitement can keep him awake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 23]: `` I think we must be careful not to let Mr. Madison suspect anything about the burglar , '' said Miss Peirce .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 9]: `` It would be bad for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 17]: Laura began : `` But we ought to notify the police -- '' `` Police ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 20]: Hedrick woke so abruptly , and uttered the word with such passionate and vehement protest , that everybody started .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 16]: `` I suppose you want to _ kill _ your father , Laura Madison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 25]: `` Do you suppose he would n't know something had happened with a squad of big , heavy policemen tromping all over the house ?
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 26]: The first thing they 'd do would be to search the whole place -- '' `` Oh , no , '' said Mrs. Madison quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 9]: `` It would n't do at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 6]: `` I should think not !
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 21]: I 'm glad , '' continued Hedrick , truthfully , '' _ that _ idea 's out of your head !
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 10]: I believe Laura imagined the whole thing anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 18]: `` Have you looked at her mattress , '' inquired Cora , `` darling little boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 12]: He gave her a concentrated look , and rose to leave .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 25]: `` Nothin ' on earth but imagina -- '' He stopped with a grunt as he forgetfully put his weight on his left leg .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 21]: He rubbed his knee , swallowed painfully , and , leaving the word unfinished , limped haughtily from the room .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 31]: He left the house , gloomily swinging his books from a spare length of strap , and walking with care to ease his strains and bruises as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 11]: He was very low in his mind , that boy .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 16]: His fortunes had reached the ebb-tide , but he had no hope of a rise .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 7]: He had no hope of anything .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 40]: It was not even a consolation that , through his talent for surprise in waylayings , it had lately been thought necessary , by the Villard family , to have Egerton accompanied to and from school by a man-servant .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 39]: Nor was Hedrick more deeply depressed by the certainty that both public and domestic scandal must soon arise from the inevitable revelation of his discontinuing his attendance at school without mentioning this important change of career at home .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 26]: He had been truant a full fortnight , under brighter circumstances a matter for a lawless pride -- now he had neither fear nor vainglory .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 11]: There was no room in him for anything but dejection .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 62]: He walked two blocks in the direction of his school ; turned a corner ; walked half a block ; turned north in the alley which ran parallel to Corliss Street , and a few moments later had cautiously climbed into an old , disused refuse box which stood against the rear wall of the empty stable at his own home .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 44]: He pried up some loose boards at the bottom of the box , and entered a tunnel which had often and often served in happier days -- when he had friends -- for the escape of Union officers from Libby Prison and Andersonville .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 34]: Emerging , wholly soiled , into a box-stall , he crossed the musty carriage house and ascended some rickety steps to a long vacant coachman 's - room , next to the hayloft .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 19]: He closed the door , bolted it , and sank moodily upon a broken , old horsehair sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 6]: This apartment was his studio .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 38]: In addition to the sofa , it contained an ex-bureau , three chair-like shapes , a once marble-topped table , now covered with a sheet of zinc , two empty bird cages , and a condemned whatnot .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 24]: The walls were rather over-decorated in coloured chalks , the man-headed-snake motive predominating ; they were also loopholed for firing into the hayloft .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 51]: Upon the table lay a battered spy-glass , minus lenses , and , nearby , two boxes , one containing dried corn-silk , the other hayseed , convenient for the making of amateur cigarettes ; the smoker 's outfit being completed by a neat pile of rectangular clippings from newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 135]: On the shelves of the whatnot were some fragments of a dead pie , the relics of a `` Fifteen-Puzzle , '' a pink Easter-egg , four seashells , a tambourine with part of a girl 's face still visible in aged colours , about two thirds of a hot-water bag , a tintype of Hedrick , and a number of books : several by Henty , `` Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , '' `` 100 Practical Jokes , Easy to Perform , '' `` The Jungle Book , '' `` My Lady Rotha , '' a `` Family Atlas , '' `` Three Weeks , '' `` Pilgrim 's Progress , '' `` A Boy 's Life in Camp , '' and `` The Mystery of the Count 's Bedroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 26]: The gloomy eye of Hedrick wandered to `` The Mystery of the Count 's Bedroom , '' and remained fixed upon it moodily and contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 49]: His own mystery made that one seem tame and easy : Laura 's bedroom laid it all over the Count 's , in his conviction ; and with a soul too weary of pain to shudder , he reviewed the bafflements and final catastrophe of the preceding night .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 19]: He had not essayed the attempt upon the mattress until assured that the house was wrapped in slumber .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 30]: Then , with hope in his heart , he had stolen to Laura 's room , lit the lamp , feeling safe from intrusion , and set to work .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 12]: His implement at first was a long hatpin of Cora 's .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 41]: Lying on his back beneath the bed , and , moving the slats as it became necessary , he sounded every cubic inch of the mysterious mattress without encountering any obstruction which could reasonably be supposed to be the ledger .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 29]: This was not more puzzling than it was infuriating , since by all processes of induction , deduction , and pure logic , the thing was necessarily there .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 5]: It was nowhere else .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 5]: Therefore it was there .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 8]: It _ had _ to be there !
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 17]: With the great blade of his Boy Scout 's knife he began to disembowel the mattress .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 28]: For a time he had worked furiously and effectively , but the position was awkward , the search laborious , and he was obliged to rest frequently .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 35]: Besides , he had waited to a later hour than he knew , for his mother to go to bed , and during one of his rests he incautiously permitted his eyes to close .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 33]: When he woke , his sisters were in the room , and he thought it advisable to remain where he was , though he little realized how he had weakened his shelter .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 38]: When Cora left the room , he heard Laura open the window , sigh , and presently a tiny clinking and a click set him a-tingle from head to foot : she was opening the padlocked book .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 8]: The scratching sound of a pen followed .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 10]: And yet she had not come near the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 10]: The mattress , then , was a living lie .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 26]: With infinite caution he had moved so that he could see her , arriving at a coign of vantage just as she closed the book .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 41]: She locked it , wrapped it in an oilskin cover which lay beside it on the table , hung the key-chain round her neck , rose , yawned , and , to his violent chagrin , put out the light .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 22]: He heard her moving but could not tell where , except that it was not in his part of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 24]: Then a faint shuffling warned him that she was approaching the bed , and he withdrew his head to avoid being stepped upon .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 12]: The next moment the world seemed to cave in upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 39]: Laura 's flight had given him opportunity to escape to his own room unobserved ; there to examine , bathe and bind his wounds , and to rectify his first hasty impression that he had been fatally mangled .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 13]: Hedrick glared at `` The Mystery of the Count 's Bedroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 20]: By and by he got up , brought the book to the sofa and began to read it over .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 24]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The influence of a familiar and sequestered place is not only soothing ; the bruised mind may often find it restorative .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 24]: Thus Hedrick , in his studio , surrounded by his own loved bric-a-brac , began to feel once more the stir of impulse .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 7]: Two hours ' reading inspired him .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 36]: What a French reporter -LRB- in the Count 's bedroom -RRB- could do , an American youth in full possession of his powers -- except for a strained knee and other injuries -- could do .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 5]: Yes , and would !
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 8]: He evolved a new chain of reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 27]: The ledger had been seen in Laura 's room ; it had been heard in her room ; it appeared to be kept in her room .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 11]: But it was in no single part of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 7]: All the parts make a whole .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 10]: Therefore , the book was not in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 20]: On the other hand , Laura had not left the room when she took the book from its hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 26]: This was confusing ; therefore he determined to concentrate logic solely upon what she had done with the ledger when she finished writing in it .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 37]: It was dangerous to assume that she had restored it to the place whence she obtained it , because he had already proved that place to be both in the room and out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 17]: No ; the question he must keep in was : What did she do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 7]: Laura had not left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 8]: But the book had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 31]: Arrived at this inevitable deduction , he sprang to his feet in a state of repressed excitement and began to pace the floor -- like a hound on the trail .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 24]: Laura had not left the room , but the book had left the room : he must keep his mind upon this point .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 18]: He uttered a loud exclamation and struck the zinc table-top a smart blow with his clenched fist .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 10]: Laura had thrown the book out of the window !
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 59]: In the exaltation of this triumph , he forgot that it was not yet the hour for a scholar 's reappearance , and went forth in haste to search the ground beneath the window -- a disappointing quest , for nowhere in the yard was there anything but withered grass , and the rubbish of other frost-bitten vegetation .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 36]: His mother , however , discovered something else , and , opening the kitchen window , she asked , with surprise : `` Why , Hedrick , what on earth are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 3]: inquired Hedrick .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 8]: `` What are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 4]: `` Here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 5]: Evidently she puzzled him .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 4]: She became emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 11]: `` I want to know what you are doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 15]: `` Just standing here , '' he explained in a meek , grieved way .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 10]: `` But why are n't you at school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 16]: This recalled what he had forgotten , and he realized the insecurity of his position .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes , '' he said -- `` school .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 15]: Did you ask me -- '' `` Did n't you go to school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 6]: He began to speak rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 10]: `` Did n't I go to _ school _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 8]: Well , where else could I go ?
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 19]: Just because I 'm here now does n't mean I did n't _ go _ , does it ?
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 25]: Because a person is in China right now would n't have to mean he 'd never been in South America , would it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 8]: `` Then what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 72]: `` Well , I was going along , and you know I did n't feel very well and -- '' He paused , with the advent of a happier idea , then continued briskly : `` But that did n't stop me , because I thought I ought to go if I dropped , so I went ahead , but the teacher was sick and they could n't get a substitute .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 20]: She must have been pretty sick , she looked so pale -- '' `` They dismissed the class ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 12]: `` And I do n't have to go to-morrow either . ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 9]: `` I see , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 20]: `` But if you feel ill , Hedrick , had n't you better come in and lie down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 10]: `` I think it 's kind of passing off .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 11]: The fresh air seems to be doing me good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 11]: `` Be careful of your sore knee , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 16]: She closed the window , and he was left to continue his operations in safety .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 15]: Laura had thrown the ledger out of the window ; that was proved absolutely .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 12]: Obviously , she had come down before daylight and retrieved it .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 6]: Or , she had not .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 18]: Proceeding on the assumption that she had not , he lifted his eyes and searched the air .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 19]: Was it possible that the book , though thrown from the window , had never reached the ground ?
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 40]: The branches of an old and stalwart maple , now almost divested of leaves , extended in rough symmetry above him , and one big limb , reaching out toward the house , came close to Laura 's windows .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 25]: Triumph shown again from the shrewd countenance of the sleuth : Laura must have slid the ledger along a wire into a hollow branch .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 18]: However , no wire was to be seen -- and the shrewd countenance of the sleuth fell .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 23]: But perhaps she had constructed a device of silk threads , invisible from below , which carried the book into the tree .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 2]: Action !
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 28]: He climbed carefully but with many twinges , finally pausing in a parlous situation not far from the mysterious window which Laura had opened the night before .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 26]: A comprehensive survey of the tree revealed only the very patent fact that none of the branches was of sufficient diameter to conceal the ledger .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 8]: No silk threads came from the window .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 32]: He looked and looked and looked at that window ; then his eye fell a little , halted less than three feet below the window-ledge , and the search was ended .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 40]: The kitchen window which his mother had opened was directly beneath Laura 's , and was a very long , narrow window , in the style of the house , and there was a protecting stone ledge above it .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 32]: Upon this ledge lay the book , wrapped in its oil-skin covering and secured from falling by a piece of broken iron hooping , stuck in the mortar of the bricks .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 33]: It could be seen from nowhere save an upper window of the house next door , or from the tree itself , and in either case only when the leaves had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 6]: Laura had felt very safe .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 41]: No one had ever seen the book except that night , early in August , when , for a better circulation of air , she had left her door open as she wrote , and Hedrick had come upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 50]: He had not spoken of it again ; she perceived that he had forgotten it ; and she herself forgot that the memory of a boy is never to be depended on ; its forgettings are too seldom permanent in the case of things that ought to stay forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 13]: To get the book one had only to lean from the window .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 30]: * * * Hedrick seemed so ill during lunch that his mother spoke of asking Doctor Sloane to look at him , if he did not improve before evening .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 16]: Hedrick said meekly that perhaps that would be best -- if he did not improve .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 43]: After a futile attempt to eat , he courteously excused himself from the table -- a ceremony which made even Cora fear that his case might be serious -- and , going feebly to the library , stretched himself upon the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 28]: His mother put a rug over him ; Hedrick , thanking her touchingly , closed his eyes ; and she went away , leaving him to slumber .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 30]: After a time , Laura came into the room on an errand , walking noiselessly , and , noticing that his eyes were open , apologized for waking him .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: `` Never mind , '' he returned , in the tone of an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 7]: `` I did n't sleep sound .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 17]: I think there 's something the matter inside my head : I have such terrible dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 12]: I guess maybe it 's better for me to keep awake .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 10]: I 'm kind of afraid to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 12]: Would you mind staying here with me a little while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 34]: `` Certainly I 'll stay , '' she said , and , observing that his cheeks were flushed , and his eyes unusually bright , she laid a cool hand on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 13]: `` You have n't any fever , dear ; that 's good .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 7]: You 'll be all right to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 10]: Would you like me to read to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 29]: `` I believe , '' he answered , plaintively , `` reading might kind of disturb my mind : my brain feels so sort of restless and queer .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 10]: I 'd rather play some kind of game . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 4]: `` Cards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 7]: `` No , not cards exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 8]: Something ' I can do lying down .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 5]: Oh , I know !
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 18]: You remember the one where we drew pictures and the others had to guess what they were ?
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 10]: Well , I 've invented a game like that .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 15]: You sit down at the desk over there and take some sheets of paper .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 8]: I 'll tell you the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 3]: She obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 5]: `` What next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 32]: `` Now , I 'll describe some people and where they live and not tell who they are , and you see if you can guess their names and addresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 6]: `` Addresses , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 15]: `` Yes , because I 'm going to describe the way their houses look .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 35]: Write each name on a separate sheet of paper , and the number of their house below it if you know it , and if you do n't know it , just the street .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 31]: If it 's a woman : put ` Miss ' or ` Mrs. ' before their name and if it 's a man write ` Esquire ' after it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 10]: `` Is all that necessary for the game ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 27]: `` It 's the way I invented it and I think you might -- '' `` Oh , all right , '' she acquiesced , good-naturedly .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 10]: `` It shall be according to your rules . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 29]: `` Then afterward , you give me the sheets of paper with the names and addresses written on 'em , and we -- we -- '' He hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 7]: What do we do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you when we come to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 29]: But when that stage of his invention was reached , and Laura had placed the inscribed sheets in his hand , his interest had waned , it appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 7]: Also , his condition had improved .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 5]: `` Let 's quit .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 16]: I thought this game would be more exciting , '' he said , sitting up .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 22]: `` I guess , '' he added with too much modesty , `` I 'm not very good at inventing games .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 30]: I b ` lieve I 'll go out to the barn ; I think the fresh air -- '' `` Do you feel well enough to go out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 12]: `` You do seem to be all right , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 13]: `` Yes , I 'm a lot better , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 6]: He limped to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 13]: `` The fresh air will be the best thing for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 25]: She did not notice that he carelessly retained her contributions to the game , and he reached his studio with them in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 22]: Hedrick had entered the ` teens and he was a reader : things in his head might have dismayed a Borgia .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 14]: No remotest glimpse entered that head of the enormity of what he did .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 59]: To put an end to his punishing of Cora , and , to render him powerless against that habitual and natural enemy , Laura had revealed a horrible incident in his career -- it had become a public scandal ; he was the sport of fools ; and it might be months before the thing was lived down .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 21]: Now he had the means , as he believed , to even the score with both sisters at a stroke .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 14]: To him it was turning a tremendous and properly scathing joke upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 5]: He did not hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 31]: * * * That evening , as Richard Lindley sat at dinner with his mother , Joe Varden temporarily abandoned his attendance at the table to answer the front doorbell .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 16]: Upon his return , he remarked : `` Messenger-boy mus ' been in big hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 10]: Wouldn ' wait till I git to door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 3]: asked Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 5]: `` Boy with package .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 9]: Least , I reckon it were a boy .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 14]: Call ' back from the front walk , say he couldn ' wait .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: Say he lef ' package in vestibule . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 8]: `` What sort of a package ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 9]: `` Middle-size kind o ' big package . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 13]: `` Why do n't you see what it is , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 7]: Mrs. Lindley asked of her son .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 10]: `` Bring it to the table , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 13]: When it was brought , Richard looked at the superscription with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 35]: The wrapper was of heavy brown paper , and upon it a sheet of white notepaper had been pasted , with the address : `` Richard Lindley , Esq. , 1218 Corliss Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 16]: `` It 's from Laura Madison , '' he said , staring at this writing .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 12]: `` What in the world would Laura be sending me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 14]: `` You might possibly learn by opening it , '' suggested his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 17]: `` I 've seen men puzzle over the outside of things quite as often as women .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 8]: Laura Madison is a nice girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 11]: She never volunteered similar praise of Laura Madison 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 21]: Mrs. Lindley had submitted to her son 's plans concerning Cora , lately confided ; but her submission lacked resignation .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 23]: `` It 's a book , '' said Richard , even more puzzled , as he took the ledger from its wrappings .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 12]: `` Two little torn places at the edge of the covers .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 24]: Looks as if it had once had clasps -- '' `` Perhaps it 's the Madison family album , '' Mrs. Lindley suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 7]: `` Pictures of Cora since infancy .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 9]: I imagine she 's had plenty taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 18]: He opened the book and glanced at the pages covered in Laura 's clear , readable hand .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 11]: `` No , it 's about half full of writing .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 7]: Laura must have turned literary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 10]: He read a line or two , frowning mildly .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 4]: `` My soul !
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 7]: I believe it 's a novel !
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 16]: She must think I 'm a critic -- to want me to read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 10]: Smiling at the idea , he closed the ledger .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 24]: `` I 'll take it upstairs to my hang-out after dinner , and see if Laura 's literary manner has my august approval .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 19]: Who in the world would ever have thought she 'd decide to set up for a writer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 17]: `` I imagine she might have something to write worth reading , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 12]: `` I 've always thought she was an interesting-looking girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 6]: `` Yes , she is .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 7]: She dances well , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 38]: `` Of course , '' continued Mrs. Lindley , thoughtfully , `` she seldom _ says _ anything interesting , but that may be because she so seldom has a chance to say anything at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 7]: Richard refused to perceive this allusion .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 15]: `` Curious that Laura should have sent it to me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 12]: `` She 's never seemed interested in my opinion about anything .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 18]: I do n't recall her ever speaking to me on any subject whatever -- except one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 25]: He returned his attention to his plate , but his mother did not appear to agree with him that the topic was exhausted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 6]: ` Except one ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 9]: she repeated , after waiting for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' he replied , in his habitual preoccupied and casual tone .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 5]: `` Or perhaps two .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 23]: Not more than two , I should say -- and in a way you 'd call that only one , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 5]: Bread , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 7]: `` What two , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 16]: `` Cora , '' he said , with gentle simplicity , `` and me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 45]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Mrs. Lindley had arranged for her son a small apartment on the second floor , and it was in his own library and smoking-room that Richard , comfortable in a leather-chair by a reading-lamp , after dinner , opened Laura 's ledger .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 26]: The first page displayed no more than a date now eighteen months past , and the line : `` Love came to me to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 28]: The next page was dated the next day , and , beneath , he read : `` That was all I _ could _ write , yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 9]: I think I was too excited to write .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 9]: Something seemed to be singing in my breast .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 12]: I could n't think in sentences -- not even in words .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 35]: How queer it is that I had decided to keep a diary , and bound this book for it , and now the first thing I have written in it was _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 7]: It will not be a diary .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 8]: It shall be _ your _ book .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 14]: I shall keep it sacred to You and write to You in it .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 18]: How strange it will be if the day ever comes when I shall show it to You !
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 23]: If it should , you would not laugh at it , for of course the day could n't come unless you understood .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 12]: I can not think it will ever come -- that day !
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 39]: But maybe -- No , I must n't let myself hope too much that it will , because if I got to hoping too much , and you did n't like me , it would hurt too much .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 15]: People who expect nothing are never disappointed -- I must keep that in mind .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 27]: Yet _ every _ girl has a _ right _ to hope for her own man to come for her some time , has n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 16]: It 's not easy to discipline the wanting to hope -- since _ yesterday _ !
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 17]: `` I think I must always have thought a great deal about you without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 23]: We really know so little what we think : our minds are going on all the time and we hardly notice them .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 37]: It is like a queer sort of factory -- the owner only looks in once in a while and most of the time has n't any idea what sort of goods his spindles are turning out .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 6]: `` I saw You yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 11]: It seems to me the strangest thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 28]: I 've seen you by chance , probably two or three times a month nearly all my life , though you so seldom come here to call .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 28]: And this time was n't different from dozens of other times -- you were just standing on the corner by the Richfield , waiting for a car .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 35]: The only possible difference is that you had been out of town for several months -- Cora said so this morning -- and how ridiculous it seems now , did n't even know it !
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 54]: I had n't noticed it -- not with the top part of my mind , but perhaps the deep part that does the real thinking had noticed it and had mourned your absence and was so glad to see you again that it made the top part suddenly see the wonderful truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 10]: Lindley set down the ledger to relight his cigar .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 25]: It struck him that Laura had been writing `` very odd Stuff , '' but interesting ; and certainly it was not a story .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 14]: Vaguely he recalled Marie Bashkirtseff : had n't she done something like this ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 81]: He resumed the reading : `` You turned and spoke to me in that lovely , cordial , absent-minded way of yours -- though I 'd never thought -LRB- with the top part -RRB- what a lovely way it was ; and for a moment I only noticed how nice you looked in a light gray suit , because I 'd only seen you in black for so long , while you 'd been in mourning for your brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 22]: Richard , disturbed by an incredible idea , read these last words over and then dismissed the notion as nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 23]: ... While you 'd been in mourning for your brother -- and it struck me that light gray was becoming to you .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 16]: Then such a queer thing happened : I felt the great kindness of your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 99]: I thought they were full of -- the only word that seems to express it at all is _ charity _ -- and they had a sweet , faraway look , too , and I 've _ always _ thought that a look of wistful kindness was the loveliest look in the world -- and you had it , and I saw it and then suddenly , as you held your hat in your hand , the sunshine on your hair seemed brighter than any sunshine I had ever seen -- and I began to tremble all over .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 70]: I did n't understand what was the matter with me or what had made me afraid with you not of you -- all at once , but I was so hopelessly rattled that instead of waiting for the car , as I 'd just told you I meant to , I said I 'd decided to walk , and got away -- without any breath left to breathe with !
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 22]: I _ could n't _ have gotten on the car with you -- and I could n't have spoken another word .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 69]: `` And as I walked home , trembling all the way , I saw that strange , dazzling sunshine on your hair , and the wistful , kind look in your eyes -- you seemed not to have taken the car but to have come with me -- and I was uplifted and exalted oh , so strangely -- oh , how the world was changing for me !
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 45]: And when I got near home , I began to walk faster , and on the front path I broke into a run and rushed in the house to the piano -- and it was as if my fingers were thirsty for the keys !
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 16]: Then I saw that I was playing to you and knew that I loved you .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 5]: `` I love you !
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 10]: `` How different everything is now from everything before .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 15]: Music means what it never did : Life has leaped into blossom for me .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 19]: Everywhere there is colour and radiance that I had never seen -- the air is full of perfume .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 15]: Dear , the sunshine that fell upon your head has spread over the world !
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 29]: `` I understand , as I never understood , that the world -- so dazzling to me now -- was made for love and is meaningless without it .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 31]: The years until yesterday are gray -- no , not gray , because that was the colour You were wearing -- not gray , because that is a beautiful colour .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 11]: The empty years until yesterday had no colour at all .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 19]: Yes , the world has meaning only through loving , and without meaning there is no real life .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 25]: We live only by loving , and now that this gift of life has come to me I love _ all _ the world .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 19]: I feel that I must be so kind , kind , _ kind _ to _ everybody _ !
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 11]: Such an odd thing struck me as my greatest wish .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 57]: When I was little , I remember grandmother telling me how , when she was a child in pioneer days , the women made the men 's clothes -- homespun -- and how a handsome young Circuit Rider , who was a bachelor , seemed to her the most beautifully dressed man she had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 20]: The women of the different churches made his clothes , as they did their husbands ' and brothers . '
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 6]: you see -- only better !
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 22]: It came into my head that that would be the divinest happiness that I could know -- to sew for you !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 55]: If you and I lived in those old , old times -- you _ look _ as if you belonged to them , you know , dear -- and You were the young minister riding into the settlement on a big bay horse -- and all the girls at the window , of course !
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 11]: -- and I sewing away at the homespun for you !
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 28]: -- I think all the angels of heaven would be choiring in my heart -- and what thick , warm clothes I 'd make you for winter !
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 20]: Perhaps in heaven they 'll let some of the women sew for the men they love -- I wonder !
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 12]: `` I hear Cora 's voice from downstairs as I write .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 11]: She 's often so angry with Ray , poor girl .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 28]: It does not seem to me that she and Ray really belong to each other , though they _ say _ so often that they do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 17]: Richard having read thus far with a growing , vague uneasiness , looked up , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 13]: He hoped Laura had no Marie Bashkirtseff idea of publishing this manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 19]: It was too intimate , he thought , even if the names in it were to be disguised .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 13]: ... `` Though they _ say _ so often that they do .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 21]: I think Ray is in love with _ her _ , but it ca n't be like _ this _ .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 17]: What he feels must be something wholly different -- there is violence and wildness in it .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 18]: And they are bitter with each other so often -- always ` getting even ' for something .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 23]: He does care -- he is frantically ` _ in _ love ' with her , undoubtedly , but so insanely jealous .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 7]: I suppose all jealousy is insane .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 7]: But love is the only sanity .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 10]: How can what is insane be part of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 8]: I could not be jealous of You .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 14]: I owe life to you -- I have never lived till now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 42]: The next writing was two days later : ... `` To-day as I passed your house with Cora , I kept looking at the big front door at which you go in and out so often -- _ your _ door !
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 12]: I never knew that just a door could look so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 43]: And unconsciously I kept my eyes on it , as we walked on , turning my head and looking and looking back at it , till Cora suddenly burst out laughing , and said : ` Well , _ Laura _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 13]: And I came to myself -- and found her looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 34]: It was like getting back after a journey , and for a second I was a little dazed , and Cora kept on laughing at me , and I felt myself getting red .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 20]: I made some silly excuse about thinking your house had been repainted -- and she laughed louder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 15]: I was afraid then that she understood -- I wonder if she could have ?
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 34]: I hope not , though I love her so much I do n't know why I would rather she did n't know , unless it is just my _ feeling _ about it .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 29]: It is a _ guardian _ feeling -- that I must keep for myself , the music of these angels singing in my heart -- singing of You .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 14]: I hope she did not understand -- and I so fear she did .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 10]: Why should I be so _ afraid _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 44]: ... ... `` Two days since I have talked to You in your book after Cora caught me staring at your door and laughed at me -- and ten minutes ago I was sitting beside the _ actual _ You on the porch !
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 5]: I am trembling yet .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 35]: It was the first time you 'd come for months and months ; and yet you had the air of thinking it rather a pleasant thing to do as you came up the steps !
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 32]: And a dizzy feeling came over me , because I wondered if it was seeing me on the street _ that _ day that put it into your head to come .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 27]: It seemed too much happiness -- and risking too much -- to let myself _ believe _ it , but I could n't help just wondering .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 37]: I began to tremble as I saw you coming up our side of the street in the moonlight -- and when you turned in here I was all panic -- I nearly ran into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 12]: I do n't know how I found voice to greet you .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 12]: I did n't seem to have any breath left at all .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 27]: I was so relieved when Cora took a chair between us and began to talk to you , because I 'm sure I could n't have .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 17]: She and poor Ray had been having one of their quarrels and she was punishing him .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 42]: Poor boy , he seemed so miserable -- though he tried to talk to me -- about politics , I think , though I 'm not sure , because I could n't listen much better than either of us could talk .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 31]: I could only hear Your voice -- such a rich , quiet voice , and it has a sound like the look you have -- friendly and faraway and wistful .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 15]: I have thought and thought about what it is that makes you look wistful .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 17]: You have less to wish for than anybody else in the world because you have Yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 6]: So why are you wistful ?
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 11]: I think it 's just because you _ are _ !
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 31]: `` I heard Cora asking you why you had n't come to see us for so long , and then she said : ` Is it because you dislike me ?
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 14]: You look at me , sometimes , as if you dislike me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 9]: And I wished she had n't said it .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 38]: I had a feeling you would n't like that ` personal ' way of talking that she enjoys -- and that -- oh , it did n't seem to be in keeping with the dignity of You !
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 16]: And I love Cora so much I wanted her to be finer -- with You .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 17]: I wanted her to understand you better than to play those little charming tricks at you .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 34]: You are so good , so _ high _ , that if she could make a real friend of you I think it would be the best thing for her that could happen .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 11]: She 's never had a man - _ friend _ .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 22]: Perhaps she _ was _ trying to make one of you and has n't any other way to go about it .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 19]: She can be so _ really _ sweet , I wanted you to see that side of her .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 53]: `` Afterwhile , when Ray could n't bear it any longer to talk to me , and in his desperation brazenly took Cora to the other end of the porch almost by force , and I was left , in a way , alone with you what did you think of me ?
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 4]: I was tongue-tied !
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 6]: Oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 13]: You were quiet -- but _ I _ was _ dumb _ !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 9]: My heart was n't dumb -- it hammered !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 14]: All the time I kept saying to myself such a jumble of things .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 40]: And into the jumble would come such a rapture that You were there -- it was like a paean of happiness -- a chanting of the glory of having You near me -- I _ was _ mixed up !
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 18]: I could _ play _ all those confused things , but writing them does n't tell it .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 19]: Writing them would only be like this : ` He 's here , he 's _ here _ !
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 6]: Speak , you little fool !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 8]: He 's here , he 's here !
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 6]: He 's sitting beside you !
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 13]: _ speak _ , idiot , or he 'll never come back !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 18]: He 's here , he 's beside you you could put out your hand and touch him !
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 10]: Are you dead , that you ca n't speak ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 15]: He 's here , he 's here , he 's _ here _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 26]: `` Ah , some day I shall be able to talk to you -- but not till I get more used to this inner song .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 20]: It seems to _ will _ that nothing else shall come from my lips till _ it _ does !
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 25]: `` In spite of my silence -- my outward woodenness -- you said , as you went away , that you would come again !
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 6]: You said ` soon ' !
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 24]: I could only nod but Cora called from the other end of the porch and asked : ` _ How _ soon ? '
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 18]: Oh , I bless her for it , because you said , ` Day after to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 4]: Day after tomorrow !
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 4]: Day after to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 6]: _ Day after tomorrow _ !
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 20]: ... `` Twenty-one hours since I wrote -- no , _ sang _ -- ` Day after to-morrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 8]: And now it is ` To-morrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 12]: Oh , the slow , golden day that this has been !
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 18]: I could not stay in the house -- I walked -- no , I _ winged _ !
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 14]: I was in the open country before I knew it -- with You !
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 6]: For You are in everything .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 10]: I never knew the sky was blue , before .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 10]: Until now I just thought it was the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 37]: The whitest clouds I ever saw sailed over that blue , and I stood upon the prow of each in turn , then leaped in and swam to the next and sailed with _ it _ !
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 22]: Oh , the beautiful sky , and kind , green woods and blessed , long , white , dusty country road !
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 21]: Never in my life shall I forget that walk -- this day in the open with my love -- You !
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 2]: To-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 2]: To-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 2]: To-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 5]: _ To-morrow _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 27]: The next writing in Laura 's book was dated more than two months later : ... `` I have decided to write again in this book .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 31]: I have thought it all out carefully , and I have come to the conclusion that it can do no harm and may help me to be steady and sensible .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 31]: It is the thought , not its expression , that is guilty , but I do not believe that my thoughts are guilty : I believe that they are good .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 8]: I know that I wish only good .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 18]: I have read that when people suffer very much the best thing is for them to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 39]: And so I 'll let myself _ write _ out my feelings -- and perhaps get rid of some of the silly self-pity I 'm foolish enough to feel , instead of going about choked up with it .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 34]: How queer it is that even when we keep our thoughts respectable we ca n't help having absurd _ feelings _ like self-pity , even though we know how rotten stupid they are !
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 35]: Yes , I 'll let it all out here , and then , some day , when I 've cured myself all whole again , I 'll burn this poor , silly old book .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 18]: And if I 'm not cured before the wedding , I 'll burn it then , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 7]: `` How funny little girls are !
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 29]: From the time they 're little bits of things they talk about marriage -- whom they are going to marry , what sort of person it will be .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 16]: I think Cora and I began when she was about five and I not seven .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 23]: And as girls grow up , I do n't believe there was ever one who genuinely expected to be an old maid .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 21]: The most unattractive young girls discuss and plan and expect marriage just as much as the prettier and gayer ones .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 22]: The only way we can find out that men do n't want to marry us is by their not asking us .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 26]: We do n't see ourselves very well , and I honestly believe we all think -- way deep down -- that we 're pretty attractive .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 37]: At least , every girl has the idea , sometimes , that if men only saw the whole truth they 'd think her as nice as any other girl , and really nicer than most others .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 16]: But I do n't believe I have any hallucinations of that sort about myself left .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 23]: I ca n't imagine -- now -- _ any _ man seeing anything in me that would make him care for me .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 13]: I ca n't see anything about me to care for , myself .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 62]: Sometimes I think maybe I could make a man get excited about me if I could take a startlingly personal tone with him from the beginning , making him wonder all sorts of you-and-I perhapses -- but I could n't do it very well probably -- oh , I could n't make myself do it if I could do it well !
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 20]: And I should n't think it would have much effect except upon very inexperienced men -- yet it does !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 30]: Now , I wonder if this is a streak of sourness coming out ; I do n't feel bitter -- I 'm just thinking honestly , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 52]: `` Well , here I am facing it : all through my later childhood , and all through my girlhood , I believe what really occupied me most -- with the thought of it underlying all things else , though often buried very deep -- was the prospect of my marriage .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 26]: I regarded it as a certainty : I would grow up , fall in love , get engaged , and be married -- of course !
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 36]: So I grew up and fell in love with You -- but it stops there , and I must learn how to be an Old Maid and not let anybody see that I mind it .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 22]: I know this is the hardest part of it , the beginning : it will get easier by-and-by , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 21]: If I can just manage this part of it , it 's bound not to hurt so much later on .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 20]: `` Yes , I grew up and fell in love with You -- for you will always be You .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 14]: I 'll never , never get over _ that _ , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 39]: You 'll never , never know it ; but I shall love You always till I die , and if I 'm still Me after that , I shall keep right on loving you then , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 18]: You see , I did n't fall in love with you just to have you for myself .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 7]: I fell in love with You !
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 54]: And that can never bother you at all nor ever be a shame to me that I love unsought , because you wo n't know , and because it 's just an ocean of good-will , and every beat of my heart sends a new great wave of it toward you and Cora .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 25]: I shall find happiness , I believe , in service -- I am sure there will be times when I can serve you both .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 16]: I love you both and I can serve her for You and you for her .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 32]: This is n't a hysterical mood , or a fit of ` exaltation ' : I have thought it all out and I know that I can live up to it .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 25]: You are the best thing that can ever come into her life , and everything I can do shall be to keep you there .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 20]: I must be very , very careful with her , for talk and advice do not influence her much .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 17]: You love her -- she has accepted you , and it is beautiful for you both .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 6]: It must be kept beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 40]: It has all become so clear to me : You are just what she has always needed , and if by any mischance she lost you I do not know what would become -- '' `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 3]: cried Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 30]: He sprang to his feet , and the heavy book fell with a muffled crash upon the floor , sprawling open upon its face , its leaves in disorder .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 13]: He moved away from it , staring at it in incredulous dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 4]: But he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 65]: CHAPTER NINETEEN Memory , that drowsy custodian , had wakened slowly , during this hour , beginning the process with fitful gleams of semi-consciousness , then , irritated , searching its pockets for the keys and dazedly exploring blind passages ; but now it flung wide open the gallery doors , and there , in clear light , were the rows of painted canvasses .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 35]: He remembered `` that day '' when he was waiting for a car , and Laura Madison had stopped for a moment , and then had gone on , saying she preferred to walk .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 37]: He remembered that after he got into the car he wondered why he had not walked home with her ; had thought himself `` slow '' for not thinking of it in time to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 40]: There had seemed something very `` taking '' about her , as she stopped and spoke to him , something enlivening and wholesome and sweet -- it had struck him that Laura was a `` very nice girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 40]: He had never before noticed how really charming she could look ; in fact he had never thought much about either of the Madison sisters , who had become `` young ladies '' during his mourning for his brother .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 30]: And this pleasant image of Laura remained with him for several days , until he decided that it might be a delightful thing to spend an evening with her .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 46]: He had called , and he remembered , now , Cora 's saying to him that he looked at her sometimes as if he did not like her ; he had been surprised and astonishingly pleased to detect a mysterious feeling in her about it .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 47]: He remembered that almost at once he had fallen in love with Cora : she captivated him , enraptured him , as she still did -- as she always would , he felt , no matter how she treated him or what she did to him .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 23]: He did not analyze the process of the captivation and enrapturement -- for love is a mystery and can not be analyzed .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 17]: This is so well known that even Richard Lindley knew it , and did not try !
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 10]: ... Heartsick , he stared at the fallen book .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 19]: He was a man , and here was the proffered love of a woman he did not want .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 48]: There was a pathos in the ledger ; it seemed to grovel , sprawling and dishevelled in the circle of lamp-light on the floor : it was as if Laura herself lay pleading at his feet , and he looked down upon her , compassionate but revolted .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 24]: He realized with astonishment from what a height she had fallen , how greatly he had respected her , how warmly liked her .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 13]: What she now destroyed had been more important than he had guessed .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 15]: Simple masculine indignation rose within him : she was to have been his sister .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 24]: If she had been unable to stifle this misplaced love of hers , could she not at least have kept it to herself ?
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 5]: Laura , the self-respecting !
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 14]: No ; she offered it -- offered it to her sister 's betrothed .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 27]: She had written that he should `` never , never know it '' ; that when she was `` cured '' she would burn the ledger .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 6]: She had not burned it !
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 20]: There were inconsistencies in plenty in the pitiful screed , but these were the wildest -- and the cheapest .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 26]: In talk , she had urged him to `` keep trying , '' for Cora , and now the sick-minded creature sent him this record .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 6]: She wanted him to know .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 9]: Then what else was it but a plea ?
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 5]: `` I love you .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 4]: Let Cora go .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 4]: Take me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 15]: He began to walk up and down , wondering what was to be done .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 28]: After a time , he picked up the book gingerly , set it upon a shelf in a dark corner , and went for a walk outdoors .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 15]: The night air seemed better than that of the room that held the ledger .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: At the corner a boy , running , passed him .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 36]: It was Hedrick Madison , but Hedrick did not recognize Richard , nor was his mind at that moment concerned with Richard 's affairs ; he was on an errand of haste to Doctor Sloane .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 18]: Mr. Madison had wakened from a heavy slumber unable to speak , his condition obviously much worse .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 30]: Hedrick returned in the doctor 's car , and then hung uneasily about the door of the sick-room until Laura came out and told him to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 48]: In the morning , his mother did not appear at the breakfast table , Cora was serious and quiet , and Laura said that he need not go to school that day , though she added that the doctor thought their father would get `` better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 22]: She looked wan and hollow-eyed : she had not been to bed , but declared that she would rest after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 22]: Evidently she had not missed her ledger ; and Hedrick watched her closely , a pleasurable excitement stirring in his breast .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 43]: She did not go to her room after the meal ; the house was cold , possessing no furnace , and , with Hedrick 's assistance , she carried out the ashes from the library grate , and built a fire there .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 26]: She had just lighted it , and the kindling was beginning to crackle , glowing rosily over her tired face , when the bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 13]: `` Will you see who it is , please , Hedrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 15]: He went with alacrity , and , returning , announced in an odd voice .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 6]: `` It 's Dick Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 7]: He wants to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 6]: she murmured , wanly surprised .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 31]: She was kneeling before the fireplace , wearing an old dress which was dusted with ashes , and upon her hands a pair of worn-out gloves of her father 's .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 18]: Lindley appeared in the hall behind Hedrick , carrying under his arm something wrapped in brown paper .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 22]: His expression led her to think that he had heard of her father 's relapse , and came on that account .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 28]: `` Do n't look at me , Richard , '' she said , smiling faintly as she rose , and stripping her hands of the clumsy gloves .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 11]: `` It 's good of you to come , though .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 12]: Doctor Sloane thinks he is going to be better again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: Richard inclined his head gravely , but did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 25]: `` Well , '' said Hedrick with a slight emphasis , `` I guess I 'll go out in the yard a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 9]: And with shining eyes he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 39]: In the hall , out of range from the library door , he executed a triumphant but noiseless caper , and doubled with mirth , clapping his hand over his mouth to stifle the effervescings of his joy .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 21]: He had recognized the ledger in the same wrapping in which he had left it in Mrs. Lindley 's vestibule .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 27]: His moment had come : the climax of his enormous joke , the repayment in some small measure for the anguish he had so long endured .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 18]: He crept silently back toward the door , flattened his back against the wall , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 21]: `` Richard , '' he heard Laura say , a vague alarm in her voice , `` what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 6]: What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 14]: Then Lindley : `` I did not know what to do about it .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 9]: I could n't think of any sensible thing .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 34]: I suppose what I am doing is the stupidest of all the things I thought of , but at least it 's honest -- so I 've brought it back to you myself .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 6]: Take it , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 21]: There was a crackling of the stiff wrapping paper , a little pause , then a strange sound from Laura .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 20]: It was not vocal and no more than just audible : it was a prolonged scream in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 17]: Hedrick ventured an eye at the crack , between the partly open door and its casing .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 18]: Lindley stood with his back to him , but the boy had a clear view of Laura .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 30]: She was leaning against the wall , facing Richard , the book clutched in both arms against her bosom , the wrapping paper on the floor at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 45]: `` I thought of sending it back and pretending to think it had been left at my mother 's house by mistake , '' said Richard sadly , `` and of trying to make it seem that I had n't read any of it .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 31]: I thought of a dozen ways to pretend I believed you had n't really meant me to read it -- '' Making a crucial effort , she managed to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 27]: `` You -- think I -- did mean -- '' `` Well , '' he answered , with a helpless shrug , `` you sent it !
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 15]: But it 's what 's in it that really matters , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 20]: I could have pretended anything in a note , I suppose , if I had written instead of coming .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 54]: But I found that what I most dreaded was meeting you again , and as we 've got to meet , of course , it seemed to me the only thing to do was to blunder through a talk with you , somehow or another , and get that part of it over .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 27]: I thought the longer I put off facing you , the worse it would be for both of us -- and -- and the more embarrassing .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 15]: I 'm no good at pretending , anyhow ; and the thing has happened .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 9]: What use is there in not being honest ?
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 8]: She did not try again to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 12]: Her state was lamentable : it was all in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 12]: Richard hung his head wretchedly , turning partly away from her .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 20]: `` There 's only one way -- to look at it , '' he said hesitatingly , and stammering .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 19]: `` That is -- there 's only one thing to do : to forget that it 's happened .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 15]: I 'm -- I -- oh , well , I care for Cora altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 9]: She 's got never to know about this .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 15]: She has n't any idea or -- suspicion of it , has she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 7]: Laura managed to shake her head .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 10]: `` She never must have , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 12]: `` Will you promise me to burn that book now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 4]: She nodded slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 15]: `` I -- I 'm awfully sorry , Laura , '' he said brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 15]: `` I 'm not idiot enough not to see that you 're suffering horribly .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 12]: I suppose I have done the most blundering thing possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 13]: He stood a moment , irresolute , then turned to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 4]: `` Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 22]: Hedrick had just time to dive into the hideous little room of the multitudinous owls as Richard strode into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 18]: Then , with the closing of the front door , the boy was back at his post .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 20]: Laura stood leaning against the wall , the book clutched in her arms , as Richard had left her .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 31]: Slowly she began to sink , her eyes wide open , and , with her back against the wall , she slid down until she was sitting upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 24]: Her arms relaxed and hung limp at her sides , letting the book topple over in her lap , and she sat motionless .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 17]: One of her feet protruded from her skirt , and the leaping firelight illumined it ruddily .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 16]: It was a graceful foot in an old shoe which had been re-soled and patched .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 17]: It seemed very still , that patched shoe , as if it might stay still forever .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 17]: Hedrick knew that Laura had not fainted , but he wished she would move her foot .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 4]: He went away .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 17]: He went into the owl-room again , and stood there silently a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 28]: Then he stole back again toward the library door , but caught a glimpse of that old , motionless shoe through the doorway as he came near .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 6]: Then he spied no more .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 20]: He went out to the stable , and , secluding himself in his studio , sat moodily to meditate .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 5]: Something was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 5]: Something had gone wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 60]: He had thrown a bomb which he had expected to go off with a stupendous bang , leaving him , as the smoke cleared , looking down in merry triumph , stinging his fallen enemies with his humour , withering them with satire , and inquiring of them how it felt , now _ they _ were getting it .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 24]: But he was decidedly untriumphant : he wished Laura had moved her foot and that she had n't that patch upon her shoe .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 10]: He could not get his mind off that patch .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 17]: He began to feel very queer : it seemed to be somehow because of the patch .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 19]: If she had worn a pair of new shoes that morning ... Yes , it was that patch .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 11]: Thirteen is a dangerous age : nothing is more subtle .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 25]: The boy , inspired to play the man , is beset by his own relapses into childhood , and Hedrick was near a relapse .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 15]: By and by , he went into the house again , to the library .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 16]: Laura was not there , but he found the fire almost smothered under heaping ashes .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 6]: She had burned her book .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 38]: He went into the room where the piano was , and played `` The Girl on the Saskatchewan '' with one finger ; then went out to the porch and walked up and down , whistling cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 55]: After that , he went upstairs and asked Miss Peirce how his father was `` feeling , '' receiving a noncommital reply ; looked in at Cora 's room ; saw that his mother was lying asleep on Cora 's bed and Cora herself examining the contents of a dressing-table drawer ; and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 16]: A moment later , he stood in the passage outside Laura 's closed door listening .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 5]: There was no sound .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 38]: He retired to his own chamber , found it unbearable , and , fascinated by Laura 's , returned thither ; and , after standing a long time in the passage , knocked softly on the door .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 24]: `` Laura , '' he called , in a rough and careless voice , `` it 's kind of a pretty day outdoors .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 20]: If you 've had your nap , if I was you I 'd go out for a walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 5]: There was no response .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 19]: `` I 'll go with you , '' he added , `` if you want me to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 7]: He listened again and heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 7]: Then he turned the knob softly .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 12]: The door was unlocked ; he opened it and went in .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 20]: Laura was sitting in a chair , with her back to a window , her hands in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 9]: She was staring straight in front of her .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 29]: He came near her hesitatingly , and at first she did not seem to see him or even to know that she was not alone in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 27]: Then she looked at him wonderingly , and , as he stood beside her , lifted her right hand and set it gently upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 42]: `` Hedrick , '' she said , `` was it you that took my book to -- '' All at once he fell upon his knees , hid his face in her lap , and burst into loud and passionate sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 39]: CHAPTER TWENTY Valentine Corliss , having breakfasted in bed at a late hour that morning , dozed again , roused himself , and , making a toilet , addressed to the image in his shaving-mirror a disgusted monosyllable .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 4]: `` Ass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 26]: However , he had not the look of a man who had played cards all night to a disastrous tune with an accompaniment in Scotch .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 18]: His was a surface not easily indented : he was hard and healthy , clear-skinned and clear-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 47]: When he had made himself point-device , he went into the `` parlour '' of his apartment , frowning at the litter of malodorous , relics , stumps and stubs and bottles and half-drained glasses , scattered chips and cards , dregs of a night session .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 6]: He had been making acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 24]: He sat at the desk and wrote with a steady hand in Italian : MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MOLITERNO : We live but learn little .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 12]: As to myself it appears that I learn nothing -- nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 15]: You will at once convey to me by _ cable _ five thousand lire .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 48]: No ; add the difference in exchange so as to make it one thousand dollars which I shall receive , taking that sum from the two-hundred and thirty thousand lire which I entrusted to your safekeeping by cable as the result of my enterprise in this place .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 45]: I should have returned at once , content with that success , but as you know I am a very stupid fellow , never pleased with a moderate triumph , nor with a large one , when there is a possible prospect of greater .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 45]: I am compelled to believe that the greater I had in mind in this case was an illusion : my gentle diplomacy avails nothing against a small miser -- for we have misers even in these States , though you will not believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 7]: I abandon him to his riches !
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 47]: From the success of my venture I reserved four thousand dollars to keep by me and for my expenses , and it is humiliating to relate that all of this , except a small banknote or two , was taken from me last night by amateurs .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 20]: I should keep away from cards -- they hate me , and alone I can do nothing with them .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 68]: Some young gentlemen of the place , whose acquaintance I had made at a ball , did me the honour of this lesson at the native game of poker , at which I -- though also native -- am not even so expert as yourself , and , as you will admit , Antonio , my friend , you are not a good player -- when observed .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 10]: Unaided , I was a child in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 15]: It was also a painful rule that one paid for the counters upon delivery .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 21]: This made me ill , but I carried it off with an air of carelessness creditable to an adopted Neapolitan .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 20]: Upon receipt of the money you are to cable me , I shall leave this town and sail immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 24]: Come to Paris , and meet me there at the place on the Rue Auber within ten days from your reading this letter .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 39]: You will have , remaining , two hundred and twenty-five thousand francs , which it will be safer to bring in cash , and I will deal well with you , as is our custom with each other .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 50]: You have done excellently throughout ; your cables and letters for exhibition concerning those famous oil wells have been perfection ; and I shall of course not deduct what was taken by these thieves of poker players from the sum of profits upon which we shall estimate your commission .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 43]: I have several times had the feeling that the hour for departure had arrived ; now I shall delay not a moment after receiving your cable , though I may occupy the interim with a last attempt to interest my small miser .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 26]: Various circumstances cause me some uneasiness , though I do not believe I could be successfully assailed by the law in the matter of oil .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 36]: You do own an estate in Basilicata , at least your brother does -- these good people here would not be apt to discover the difference -- and the rest is a matter of plausibility .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 60]: The odious coincidence of encountering the old cow , Pryor , fretted me somewhat -LRB- though he has not repeated his annoying call -RRB- , and I have other small apprehensions -- for example , that it may not improve my credit if my loss of last night becomes gossip , though the thieves professed strong habits of discretion .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: My little affair of gallantry grows embarrassing .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 13]: Such affairs are so easy to inaugurate ; extrication is more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 19]: However , without it I should have failed to interest my investor and there is always the charm .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 10]: Your last letter is too curious in that matter .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 50]: Licentious man , one does not write of these things while under the banner of the illustrious Uncle Sam -- I am assuming the American attitude while here , or perhaps my early youth returns to me -- a thing very different from your own boyhood , Don Antonio .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 12]: Nevertheless , I promise you some laughter in the Rue Auber .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 35]: Though you will not be able to understand the half of what I shall tell you -- particularly the portraits I shall sketch of my defeated rivals -- your spirit shall roll with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 11]: To the bank , then , the instant you read .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 19]: Cable me one thousand dollars , and be at the Rue Auber not more than ten days later .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 4]: To the bank !
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 6]: Thence to the telegraph office .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 2]: Speed !
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 3]: V. C .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 20]: He was in better spirits as he read over this letter , and he chuckled as he addressed it .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 70]: He pictured himself in the rear room of the bar in the Rue Auber , relating , across the little marble-topped table , this American adventure , to the delight of that blithe , ne'er - do-well outcast of an exalted poor family , that gambler , blackmailer and merry rogue , Don Antonio Moliterno , comrade and teacher of this ductile Valentine since the later days of adolescence .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 20]: They had been school-fellows in Rome , and later roamed Europe together unleashed , discovering worlds of many kinds .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 40]: Valentine 's careless mother let her boy go as he liked , and was often negligent in the matter of remittances : he and his friend learned ways to raise the wind , becoming expert and making curious affiliations .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 15]: At her death there was a small inheritance ; she had not been provident .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 44]: The little she left went rocketing , and there was the wind to be raised again : young Corliss had wits and had found that they could supply him -- most of the time -- with much more than the necessities of life .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 35]: He had also found that he possessed a strong attraction for various women ; already -- at twenty-two -- his experience was considerable , and , in his way , he became a specialist .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 12]: He had a talent ; he improved it and his opportunities .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 43]: Altogether , he took to the work without malice and with a light heart ... He sealed the envelope , rang for a boy , gave him the letter to post , and directed that the apartment should be set to rights .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 12]: It was not that in which he had received Ray Vilas .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 30]: Corliss had moved to rooms on another floor of the hotel , the day after that eccentric and somewhat ominous person had called to make an `` investment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 52]: Ray 's shadowy forebodings concerning that former apartment had encountered satire : Corliss was a `` materialist '' and , at the mildest estimate , an unusually practical man , but he would never sleep in a bed with its foot toward the door ; southern Italy had seeped into him .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 17]: He changed his rooms , a measure of which Don Antonio Moliterno would have wholly approved .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 39]: Besides , these were as comfortable as the others , and so like them as even to confirm Ray 's statement concerning `` A Reading from Homer '' : evidently this work had been purchased by the edition .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 33]: A boy came to announce that his `` roadster '' waited for him at the hotel entrance , and Corliss put on a fur motoring coat and cap , and went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 31]: A door leading from the hotel bar into the lobby was open , and , as Corliss passed it , there issued a mocking shout : `` Tor ` dor !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 9]: Oh , look at the Tor ` dor !
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 8]: Ai n't he the handsome Spaniard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 29]: Ray Vilas stumbled out , tousled , haggard , waving his arms in absurd and meaningless gestures ; an amused gallery of tipplers filling the doorway behind him .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 15]: `` Goin ' take Carmen buggy ride in the country , ai n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 7]: Good ole Tor ` dor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 9]: he quavered loudly , clutching Corliss 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 22]: `` How much you s ` pose he pays f ' that buzz-buggy by the day , jeli 'm ` n ?
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 18]: Naughty Tor ` dor , stole thousand dollars from me -- makin ' presents -- diamond cresses .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 11]: Tor ` dor , I hear you been playing cards .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 6]: Tha 's s n't nice .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 30]: Tor ` dor , you 're not a goo ' boy at all -- _ you _ know you ought n't waste Dick Lindley 's money like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 18]: Corliss set his open hand upon the drunkard 's breast and sent him gyrating and plunging backward .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 10]: Some one caught the grotesque figure as it fell .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 20]: `` Oh , my God , '' screamed Ray , `` I have n't got a gun on me !
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 13]: He _ knows _ I have n't got my gun with me !
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 13]: _ Why _ have n't I got my gun with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 15]: They hustled him away , and Corliss , enraged and startled , passed on .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 21]: As he sped the car up Corliss Street , he decided to anticipate his letter to Moliterno by a cable .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 6]: He had stayed too long .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 25]: Cora looked charming in a new equipment for November motoring ; yet it can not be said that either of them enjoyed the drive .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 72]: They lunched a dozen miles out from the city at an establishment somewhat in the nature of a roadside inn ; and , although its cuisine was quite unknown to Cora 's friend , Mrs. Villard -LRB- an eager amateur of the table -RRB- , they were served with a meal of such unusual excellence that the waiter thought it a thousand pities patrons so distinguished should possess such poor appetites .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 21]: They returned at about three in the afternoon , and Cora descended from the car wearing no very amiable expression .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 10]: `` Why wo n't you come in now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 8]: she asked , looking at him angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 9]: `` We 've got to talk things out .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 6]: We 've settled nothing whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 11]: I want to know why you ca n't stop . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 18]: `` I 've got some matters to attend to , and -- '' `` What matters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 9]: She shot him a glance of fierce skepticism .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 9]: `` Are you packing to get out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 4]: `` Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 18]: he cried reproachfully , `` how can you say things like that to _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 12]: `` Oh , it would n't surprise me in the least !
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 11]: How do _ I _ know what you 'll do ?
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 15]: For all I know , you may be just that kind of a man .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 30]: You _ said _ you ought to be going -- '' `` Cora , '' he explained , gently , `` I did n't say I meant to go .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 19]: I said only that I thought I ought to , because Moliterno will be needing me in Basilicata .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 19]: I ought to be there , since it appears that no more money is to be raised here .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 25]: I ought to be superintending operations in the oil-field , so as to make the best use of the little I have raised . ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 4]: `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 16]: `` Of course _ I _ did n't have anything to do with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 4]: He sighed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 12]: `` You know perfectly well that I appreciate all you did .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 16]: We do n't seem to get on very well to-day -- '' `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 6]: She laughed again , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 14]: `` So you think you 'll be going , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 11]: `` To my rooms to write some necessary letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 10]: `` Of course not to pack your trunk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 16]: `` Cora , '' he returned , goaded ; `` sometimes you 're just impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 7]: I 'll come to-morrow forenoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 8]: `` Then do n't bring the car .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 14]: I 'm tired of motoring and tired of lunching in that rotten hole .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 10]: We can talk just as well in the library .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 14]: Papa 's better , and that little fiend will be in school to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 6]: Come out about ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 5]: He started the machine .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 16]: `` Do n't forget I love you , '' he called in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 13]: She stood looking after him as the car dwindled down the street .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 7]: `` Yes , you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 19]: She walked up the path to the house , her face thoughtful , as with a tiresome perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 19]: In her own room , divesting herself of her wraps , she gave the mirror a long scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 36]: It offered the picture of a girl with a hard and dreary air ; but Cora saw something else , and presently , though the dreariness remained , the hardness softened to a great compassion .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 26]: She suffered : a warm wave of sorrow submerged her , and she threw herself upon the bed and wept long and silently for herself .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 14]: At last her eyes dried , and she lay staring at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 21]: The doorbell rang , and Sarah , the cook , came to inform her that Mr. Richard Lindley was below .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 8]: `` Tell him I 'm out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 8]: `` Ca n't , '' returned Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 9]: `` Done told him you was home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 5]: And she departed firmly .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 39]: Thus abandoned , the prostrate lady put into a few words what she felt about Sarah , and , going to the door , whisperingly summoned in Laura , who was leaving the sick-room , across the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 5]: `` Richard is downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 15]: Will you go and tell him I 'm sick in bed -- or dead ?
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 7]: Anything to make him go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 19]: And , assuming Laura 's acquiescence , Cora went on , without pause : `` Is father worse ?
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 10]: What 's the matter with you , Laura ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 11]: He 's a little better , Miss Peirce thinks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 6]: `` You look ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 7]: `` I 'm all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 18]: `` Then run along like a duck and get rid of that old bore for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 8]: `` Cora -- please see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 4]: `` Not me !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 14]: I 've got too much to think about to bother with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 25]: Laura walked to the window and stood with her back to her sister , apparently interested in the view of Corliss Street there presented .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 22]: `` Cora , '' she said , `` why do n't you marry him and have done with all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 3]: Cora hooted .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 12]: Why not marry him as soon as you can get ready ?
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 13]: Why do n't you go down now and tell him you will ?
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 6]: Why not , Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 18]: `` I 'd as soon marry a pail of milk -- yes , tepid milk , skimmed !
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 17]: I -- '' `` Do n't you realize how kind he 'd be to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 13]: `` I do n't know about that , '' said Cora moodily .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 23]: `` He might object to some things -- but it does n't matter , because I 'm not going to try him .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 22]: I do n't mind a man 's being a fool , but I ca n't stand the absent-minded breed of idiot .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 46]: I 've worn his diamond in the pendant right in his eyes for weeks ; he 's never once noticed it enough even to ask me about the pendant , but bores me to death wanting to know why I wo n't wear the ring !
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 10]: Anyhow , what 's the use talking about him ?
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 30]: He could n't marry me right now , even if I wanted him to -- not till he begins to get something on the investment he made with Val .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 43]: Outside of that , he 's got nothing except his rooms at his mother 's ; she has n't much either ; and if Richard should lose what he put in with Val , he could n't marry for years , probably .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 10]: That 's what made him so obstinate about it .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 62]: No ; if I ever marry right off the reel it 's got to be somebody with -- '' `` Cora '' -- Laura still spoke from the window , not turning -- `` are n't you tired of it all , of this getting so upset about one man and then another and -- '' '' _ Tired _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 11]: Cora uttered the word in a repressed fury of emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 9]: `` I 'm sick of _ everything _ !
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 19]: I do n't care for anything or anybody on this earth -- except -- except you and mamma .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 9]: I thought I was going to love Val .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 17]: I thought I _ did _ -- but oh , my Lord , I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 12]: I do n't think I _ can _ care any more .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 11]: Or else there is n't any such thing as love .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 10]: How can anybody tell whether there is or not ?
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 48]: You get kind of crazy over a man and want to go the limit -- or marry him perhaps -- or sometimes you just want to make him crazy about you -- and then you get over it -- and what is there left but hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 7]: She choked with a sour laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 3]: `` Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 13]: For heaven 's sake , Laura , do n't make me talk .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 13]: Everything 's gone to the devil and I 've got to think .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 18]: The best thing you can do is to go down and get rid of Richard for me .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 9]: I _ ca n't _ see him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 14]: `` Very well , '' said Laura , and went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 14]: `` You 're a darling , '' whispered Cora , kissing her quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 33]: `` Tell him I 'm in a raging headache -- make him think I wanted to see him , but you would n't let me , because I 'm too ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 19]: `` Give me a little time , old dear : I may decide to take him yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 41]: It was Mrs. Madison who informed the waiting Richard that Cora was unable to see him , because she was `` lying down '' ; and the young man , after properly inquiring about Mr. Madison , went blankly forth .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 18]: Hedrick was stalking the front yard , mounted at a great height upon a pair of stilts .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 20]: He joined the departing visitor upon the sidewalk and honoured him with his company , proceeding storkishly beside him .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 7]: `` Been to see Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 6]: `` Yes , Hedrick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 11]: `` What 'd you want to see her about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 6]: asked the frank youth seriously .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 6]: Richard was able to smile .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 8]: `` Nothing in particular , Hedrick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 12]: `` You did n't come to tell her about something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 8]: `` Nothing whatever , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 17]: I wished merely the honour of seeing her and chatting with her upon indifferent subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 7]: `` Did you see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 25]: `` No , I 'm sorry to -- '' `` She 's home , all right , '' Hedrick took pleasure in informing him .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 15]: She was lying down and I told your mother not to disturb her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 16]: `` Worn out with too much automobile riding , I expect , '' Hedrick sniffed .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 16]: `` She goes out about every day with this Corliss in his hired roadster . ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 6]: They walked on in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 16]: Not far from Mrs. Lindley 's , Hedrick abruptly became vocal in an artificial laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 43]: Richard was obviously intended to inquire into its cause , but , as he did not , Hedrick , after laughing hollowly for some time , volunteered the explanation : `` I played a pretty good trick on you last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 9]: `` Odd I did n't know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 8]: `` That 's why it was good .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 10]: You 'd never guess it in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 9]: `` No , I believe I should n't .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 24]: You see what makes it so hard , Hedrick , is that I ca n't even remember seeing you , last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 5]: `` Nobody saw me .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: Somebody heard me though , all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 13]: `` The nigger that works at your mother 's -- Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 5]: `` What about it ?
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 6]: Were you teasing Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 11]: `` No , it was you I was after . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 3]: `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 6]: Did you get me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 9]: Hedrick made another somewhat ghastly pretence of mirth .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 20]: `` Well , I guess I 've had about all the fun out of it I 'm going to .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 6]: Might as well tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 14]: It was that book of Laura 's you thought she sent you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 23]: Richard stopped short ; whereupon Hedrick turned clumsily , and began to stalk back in the direction from which they had come .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 12]: `` That book -- I thought she -- sent me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 5]: Lindley repeated , stammering .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 16]: `` She never sent it , '' called the boy , continuing to walk away .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 11]: `` She kept it hid , and I found it .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 26]: I faked her into writing your name on a sheet of paper , and made you think she 'd sent the old thing to you .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 11]: I just did it for a joke on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 49]: With too retching an effort to simulate another burst of merriment , he caught the stump of his right stilt in a pavement crack , wavered , cut in the air a figure like a geometrical proposition gone mad , and came whacking to earth in magnificent disaster .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 9]: Richard took him to Mrs. Lindley for repairs .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 16]: She kept him until dark : Hedrick was bandaged , led , lemonaded and blandished .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 11]: Never in his life had he known such a listener .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 18]: CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE That was a long night for Cora Madison , and the morning found her yellow .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 36]: She made a poor breakfast , and returned from the table to her own room , but after a time descended restlessly and wandered from one room to another , staring out of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 51]: Laura had gone out ; Mrs. Madison was with her husband , whom she seldom left ; Hedrick had departed ostensibly for school ; and the house was as still as a farm in winter -- an intolerable condition of things for an effervescent young woman whose diet was excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 32]: Cora , drumming with her fingers upon a window in the owl-haunted cell , made noises with her throat , her breath and her lips not unsuggestive of a sputtering fuse .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 5]: She was heavily charged .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 12]: `` Now what in thunder do _ you _ want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 20]: she inquired of an elderly man who turned in from the sidewalk and with serious steps approached the house .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 17]: Pryor , having rung , found himself confronted with the lady he had come to seek .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 31]: Ensued the moment of strangers meeting : invisible antennae extended and touched ; -- at the contact , Cora 's drew in , and she looked upon him without graciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 28]: `` I just called , '' he said placatively , smiling as if some humour lurked in his intention , `` to ask how your father is .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 13]: I heard downtown he was n't getting along quite so well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 19]: `` He 's better this morning , thanks , '' said Cora , preparing to close the door .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 12]: `` I thought I 'd just stop and ask about him .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 16]: I heard he 'd had another bad spell -- kind of a second stroke . ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 7]: `` That was night before last .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 12]: The doctor thinks he 's improved very much since then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 16]: The door was closing ; he coughed hastily , and detained it by speaking again .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 32]: `` I 've called several times to inquire about him , but I believe it 's the first time I 've had the pleasure of speaking to you , Miss Madison .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 6]: I 'm Mr. Pryor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 48]: She appeared to find no comment necessary , and he continued : `` Your father did a little business for me , several years ago , and when I was here on my vacation , this summer , I was mighty sorry to hear of his sickness .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 33]: I 've had a nice bit of luck lately and got a second furlough , so I came out to spend a couple of weeks and Thanksgiving with my married daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 9]: Cora supposed that it must be very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 19]: `` But I was mighty sorry to hear your father was n't much better than when I left .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 57]: The truth is , I wanted to have a talk with him , and I 've been reproaching myself a good deal that I did n't go ahead with it last summer , when he was well , only I thought then it might n't be necessary -- might be disturbing things without much reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 18]: `` I 'm afraid you ca n't have a talk with him now , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 21]: `` The doctor says -- '' `` I know , I know , '' said Pryor , `` of course .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 23]: I wonder '' -- he hesitated , smiling faintly -- `` I wonder if I could have it with you instead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 16]: `` Oh , it is n't business , '' he laughed , observing her expression .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: `` That is , not exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 6]: His manner became very serious .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 19]: `` It 's about a friend of mine -- at least , a man I know pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 21]: Miss Madison , I saw you driving out through the park with him , yesterday noon , in an automobile .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 4]: Valentine Corliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 5]: Cora stared at him .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 13]: Honesty , friendliness , and grave concern were disclosed to her scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 12]: There was no mistaking him : he was a good man .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 30]: Her mouth opened , and her eyelids flickered as from a too sudden invasion of light -- the look of one perceiving the close approach of a vital crisis .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 9]: But there was no surprise in her face .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 8]: `` Come in , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 30]: * * * ... When Corliss arrived , at about eleven o'clock that morning , Sarah brought him to the library , where he found Cora waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 28]: He had the air of a man determined to be cheerful under adverse conditions : he came in briskly , and Cora closed the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 19]: `` Keep away from me , '' she said , pushing him back sharply , the next instant .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 14]: `` I 've had enough of that for a while I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 9]: He sank into a chair , affecting desolation .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 7]: `` Caresses blighted in the bud !
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 10]: Cora , one would think us really married . ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 28]: She walked across the floor to a window , turned there , with her back to the light , and stood facing him , her arms folded .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 7]: he exclaimed , noting this attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 12]: `` Is it the trial scene from a faded melodrama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 8]: She looked steadily at him without replying .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 9]: `` What 's it all about to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 4]: he asked lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 25]: `` I 'll try to give you the proper cues if you 'll indicate the general nature of the scene , Cora mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 9]: She continued to look at him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 10]: `` It 's very effective , '' he observed .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 8]: `` Brings out the figure , too .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 26]: Do forgive me if you 're serious , dear lady , but never in my life was I able to take the folded-arms business seriously .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 21]: It was used on the stage of all countries so much that I believe most new-school actors have dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 7]: They think it lacks genuineness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 9]: Cora waited a moment longer , then spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 17]: `` How much chance have I to get Richard Lindley 's money back from you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 4]: He was astounded .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 7]: `` Oh , I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 15]: `` I had a caller , this morning , '' she said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 10]: `` He talked about you -- quite a lot !
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 10]: He 's told me several things about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 5]: `` Mr. Vilas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 11]: he asked , with a sting in his quick smile .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 8]: `` No , '' she answered coolly .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 5]: `` Much older . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 22]: At that he jumped up , stepped quickly close to her , and swept her with an intense and brilliant scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 7]: `` Pryor , by God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 11]: `` He knows you pretty well , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: `` So do I now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 19]: He swung away from her , back to his chair , dropped into it and began to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 4]: `` Old Pryor !
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 4]: Doddering old Pryor !
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 7]: Doddering old ass of a Pryor !
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 4]: So he did !
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 5]: Blood of an angel !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 9]: what a stew , what a stew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 6]: He rose again , mirthless .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 9]: `` Well , what did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 10]: She had begun to tremble , not with fear .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 8]: `` He said a good deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 7]: `` Well , what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 7]: What did he tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 10]: `` I think you 'll find it plenty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 6]: `` Come on ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 5]: _ You _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 5]: She pointed at him .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 7]: `` Let 's have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 21]: `` He told me '' -- she burst out furiously -- `` he said you were a professional sharper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 9]: Old Pryor does n't talk like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 5]: She came toward him .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 17]: `` He told me you were notorious over half of Europe , '' she cried vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 32]: `` He said he 'd arrested you himself , once , in Rotterdam , for smuggling jewels , and that you were guilty , but managed to squirm out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 23]: He said the police had put you out of Germany and you 'd be arrested if you ever tried to go back .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 49]: He said there were other places you did n't dare set foot in , and he said he could have you arrested in this country any time he wanted to , and that he was going to do it if he found you 'd been doing anything wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 12]: Oh , yes , he told me a few things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 7]: He caught her by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 14]: `` See here , Cora , do you believe all this tommy-rot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 7]: She shook his hand off instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 4]: `` Believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 4]: I know it !
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 19]: There is n't a straight line in your whole soul and mind : you 're crooked all over .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 12]: You 've been crooked with _ me _ from the start .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 17]: The moment that man began to speak , I knew every word of it was true .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 30]: He came to me because he thought it was right : he has n't anything against you on his own account ; he said he _ liked _ you !
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 13]: I _ knew _ it was true , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 39]: He tried to put his hand on her shoulder again , beginning to speak remonstratingly , but she cried out in a rage , broke away from him , and ran to the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 4]: `` Keep away !
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 10]: Do you suppose I like you to touch me ?
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 12]: He told me you always had been a wonder with women !
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 16]: Said you were famous for ` handling them the right way ' -- using them !
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 15]: Ah , that was pleasant information for _ me _ , was n't it !
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 11]: Yes , I could have confirmed him on that point .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 17]: He wanted to know if I thought you 'd been doing anything of that sort here .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 12]: What he meant was : Had you been using me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 8]: `` What did you tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 8]: The question rang sharply on the instant .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 9]: That gets into you , does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 4]: she returned bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 24]: `` You ca n't overdo your fear of that man , I think , but _ I _ did n't tell him anything .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 22]: I just listened and thanked him for the warning , and said I 'd have nothing more to do with you .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 8]: How _ could _ I tell him ?
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 21]: Was n't it I that made papa lend you his name , and got Richard to hand over his money ?
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: Where does that put _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 8]: She choked ; sobs broke her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 23]: `` Every -- every soul in town would point me out as a laughing-stock -- the easiest fool out of the asylum !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 17]: Do you suppose _ I _ want you arrested and the whole thing in the papers ?
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 18]: What I want is Richard 's money back , and I 'm going to have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 12]: `` Can you be quiet for a moment and listen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 4]: he asked gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 16]: `` If you 'll tell me what chance I have to get it back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 16]: `` Cora , '' he said , `` you do n't want it back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 3]: `` Oh ?
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 5]: Do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 8]: He smiled faintly , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 15]: `` Now , all this nonsense of old Pryor 's is n't worth denying .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 28]: I have met him abroad ; that much is true -- and I suppose I have rather a gay reputation -- '' She uttered a jeering shout .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 20]: `` I told you I 'd cut quite a swathe , when I first talked to you about myself .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 21]: Let it go for the present and come down to this question of Lindley 's investment -- '' `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 12]: That 's what I want you to come down to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 36]: `` As soon as Lindley paid in his check I gave him his stock certificates , and cabled the money to be used at once in the development of the oil-fields -- '' `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 25]: That man told me you 'd ` promoted ' a South American rubber company once , among people of the American colony in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 10]: The details he gave me sounded strangely familiar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 10]: `` You 'd as well be patient , Cora .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 35]: Now , that money has probably been partially spent , by this time , on tools and labour and -- '' `` What are you trying to -- '' `` I 'll show you .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 16]: But first I 'd like you to understand that nothing can be done to me .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 8]: There 's nothing ` on ' me !
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 38]: I 've acted in good faith , and if the venture in oil is unsuccessful , and the money lost , I ca n't be held legally responsible , nor can any one prove that I am .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 17]: I could bring forty witnesses from Naples to swear they have helped to bore the wells .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 13]: I 'm safe as your stubborn friend , Mr. Trumble , himself .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 38]: But now then , suppose that old Pryor is right -- as of course he is n't -- suppose it , merely for a moment , because it will aid me to convey something to your mind .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 44]: If I were the kind of man he says I am , and , being such a man , had planted the money out of reach , for my own use , what on earth would induce me to give it back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 6]: `` I knew it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 3]: she groaned .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 8]: `` I knew you would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 15]: `` You see , '' he said quietly , `` it would be impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 31]: We must go on supposing for a moment : if I had put that money away , I might be contemplating a departure -- '' `` You 'd better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 4]: she cried fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 13]: `` He 's going to find out everything you 've been doing .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 4]: He said so .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 36]: He 's heard a rumour that you were trying to raise money here ; he told me so , and said he 'd soon -- '' `` The better reason for not delaying , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 6]: Cora , see here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 5]: He moved nearer her .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 29]: `` Would n't I need a lot of money if I expected to have a beautiful lady to care for , and -- '' `` You idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 11]: `` Do you think I 'm going with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 4]: He flushed heavily .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 8]: `` Well , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 19]: He paused , to stare at her , as she wrung her hands and sobbed with hysterical laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 22]: `` I thought , '' he went on , slowly , `` that you would possibly even insist on that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 10]: `` Oh , Lord , Lord , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 21]: She stamped her foot , and with both hands threw the tears from her eyes in wide and furious gestures .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 22]: `` He told me you were married -- '' `` Did you let him think you had n't known that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 3]: demanded Corliss .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 14]: `` I tell you I did n't let him think _ anything _ !
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 61]: He said you would never be able to get a divorce : that your wife hates you too much to get one from you , and that she 'll never -- '' `` See here , Cora , '' he said harshly , `` I told you I 'd been married ; I told you before I ever kissed you .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 10]: You understood perfectly -- '' `` I did not !
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: You said you _ had _ been .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 5]: You laughed about it .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 15]: You made me think it was something that had happened a long time ago .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 23]: I thought of course you 'd been divorced -- '' `` But I told you -- '' `` You told me after !
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 42]: And then you made me think you could easily get one -- that it was only a matter of form and -- '' `` Cora , '' he interrupted , `` you 're the most elaborate little self-deceiver I ever knew .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 19]: I do n't believe you 've ever faced yourself for an honest moment in -- '' `` Honest !
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 9]: _ you _ talk about ` honest ' !
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 11]: You use that word and face _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 10]: He came closer , meeting her distraught eyes squarely .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 22]: `` You love to fool yourself , Cora , but the role of betrayed virtue does n't suit you very well .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 27]: You 're young , but you 're a pretty experienced woman for all that , and you have n't done anything you did n't want to .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 15]: You 've had both eyes open every minute , and we both know it .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 19]: You are just as wise as -- '' `` You 're lying and _ you _ know it !
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 15]: What did _ I _ want to make Richard go into your scheme for ?
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 8]: You made a fool of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 15]: `` I 'm not speaking of the money now , '' he returned quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 11]: `` You 'd better keep your mind on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 8]: Are you coming away with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 7]: `` What _ for _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 4]: he echoed incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 10]: `` I want to know if you 're coming .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 48]: I promise you I 'll get a divorce as soon as it 's possible -- '' `` Val , '' she said , in a tone lower than she had used since he entered the room ; `` Val , do you want me to come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 4]: `` Much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 6]: She looked at him eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 6]: His answer sounded quite genuine .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 11]: `` Will it hurt you if I do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 7]: `` Of course it will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 11]: `` Thank heaven for that , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 9]: `` You honestly mean you wo n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 12]: `` It makes me sick with laughing just to imagine it !
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 29]: I 've done some hard little thinking , lately , my friend -- particularly last night , and still more particularly this morning since that man was here .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 12]: I 'd cut my throat before I 'd go with you .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 22]: If you had your divorce I would n't marry you -- not if you were the last man on earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 17]: `` Cora , '' he cried , aghast , `` what 's the matter with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 8]: You 're too many for me sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 10]: I thought I understood a few kinds of women !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 21]: Now listen : I 've offered to take you , and you ca n't say -- '' `` Offered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 9]: It was she who came toward him now .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 16]: She came swiftly , shaking with rage , and struck him upon the breast . ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 4]: ` Offered ' !
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 19]: Do you think I want to go trailing around Europe with you while Dick Lindley 's money lasts ?
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 12]: What kind of a life are you ` offering ' me ?
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 18]: Do you suppose I 'm going to have everybody saying Cora Madison ran away with a jail-bird ?
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 29]: Do you think I 'm going to dodge decent people in hotels and steamers , and leave a name in this town that -- Oh , get out !
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 9]: I do n't want any help from you !
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 22]: I can take care of myself , I tell you ; and I do n't have to marry _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 16]: I 'd kill you if I could -- you made a fool of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 5]: Her voice rose shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 9]: `` You made a fool of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 9]: `` Cora -- '' he began , imploringly .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 9]: `` You made a fool of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 5]: She struck him again .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 8]: `` Strike me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 6]: `` I love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 4]: `` Actor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 7]: `` Cora , I want you .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 15]: I want you more than I ever -- '' She screamed with hysterical laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 7]: `` Liar , liar , liar !
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 5]: The same old guff .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 16]: Do n't you even see it 's too late for the old rotten tricks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 10]: `` Cora , I want you to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 25]: `` You poor , conceited fool , '' she cried , `` do you think you 're the only man I can marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 15]: `` Cora , '' he gasped , `` you would n't do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 6]: `` Oh , get out !
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 6]: Get out _ now _ !
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 6]: I 'm tired of you .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 10]: I never want to hear you speak again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 7]: `` Cora , '' he begged .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 12]: `` For the last time -- '' '' _ No _ !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 8]: You made a fool of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 17]: She beat him upon the breast , striking again and again , with all her strength .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 8]: `` Get out , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 7]: I 'm through with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 17]: He tried to make her listen , to hold her wrists : he could do neither .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 8]: `` Get out -- get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 14]: She pushed and dragged him toward the door , and threw it open .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 22]: Her voice thickened ; she choked and coughed , but kept on screaming : `` Get out , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 9]: Get out , get out , damn you !
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 8]: Damn you , _ damn _ you !
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 4]: get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 18]: Still continuing to strike him with all her strength , she forced him out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 7]: CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO Cora lost no time .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 17]: Corliss had not closed the front door behind him before she was running up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 29]: Mrs. Madison , emerging from her husband 's room , did not see her daughter 's face ; for Cora passed her quickly , looking the other way .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 7]: `` Was anything the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 5]: asked the mother anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 21]: `` I thought I heard -- '' `` Nothing in the world , '' Cora flung back over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 19]: `` Mr. Corliss said I could n't imitate Sara Bernhardt , and I showed him I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 33]: She began to hum ; left a fragment of `` rag-time '' floating behind her as she entered her own room ; and Mrs. Madison , relieved , returned to the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 6]: Cora changed her clothes quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 24]: She put on a pale gray skirt and coat for the street , high shoes and a black velvet hat , very simple .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 18]: The costume was almost startlingly becoming to her : never in her life had she looked prettier .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 46]: She opened her small jewel-case , slipped all her rings upon her fingers ; then put the diamond crescent , the pendant , her watch , and three or four other things into the flat , envelope-shaped bag of soft leather she carried when shopping .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 15]: After that she brought from her clothes-pantry a small travelling-bag and packed it hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 32]: Laura , returning from errands downtown and glancing up at Cora 's window , perceived an urgently beckoning , gray-gloved hand , and came at once to her sister 's room .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 37]: The packed bag upon the bed first caught her eye ; then Cora 's attire , and the excited expression of Cora 's face , which was high-flushed and moist , glowing with a great resolve .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 6]: `` What 's happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 4]: asked Laura quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 9]: `` You look exactly like a going-away bride .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 30]: What -- '' Cora spoke rapidly : `` Laura , I want you to take this bag and keep it in your room till a messenger-boy comes for it .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 17]: When the bell rings , go to the door yourself , and hand it to him .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 12]: Do n't give Hedrick a chance to go to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 18]: Just give it to the boy ; -- and do n't say anything to mamma about it .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 12]: I 'm going downtown and I may not be back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 6]: Laura began to be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 12]: `` What is it you want to do , Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 5]: she asked , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 6]: Cora was swift and business-like .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 16]: `` See here , Laura , I 've got to keep my head about me .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 25]: You can do a great deal for me , if you wo n't be emotional just now , and help me not to be .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 33]: I ca n't afford it , because I 've got to do things , and I 'm going to do them just as quickly as I can , and get it over .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 10]: If I wait any longer I 'll go insane .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 8]: I _ can _ ' T wait !
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 26]: You 've been a wonderful sister to me ; I 've always counted on you , and you 've never once gone back on me .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 18]: Right now , I need you to help me more than I ever have in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 18]: Will you -- '' `` But I must know -- '' `` No , you need n't !
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 38]: I 'll tell you just this much : I 've got myself in a devil of a mess -- '' Laura threw her arms round her : `` Oh , my dear , dear little sister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 5]: But Cora drew away .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 11]: `` Now that 's just what you must n't do .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 6]: I ca n't stand it !
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 9]: You 've got to be _ quiet _ .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 15]: I ca n't -- '' `` Yes , yes , '' Laura said hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 8]: I 'll do whatever you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 40]: `` It 's perfectly simple : all I want you to do is to take charge of my travelling-bag , and , when a messenger-boy comes , give it to him without letting anybody know anything about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 28]: `` But I 've got to know where you 're going -- I ca n't let you go and not -- '' `` Yes , you can !
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 7]: Besides , you 've promised to .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 18]: I 'm not going to do anything foolish -- '' `` Then why not tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 3]: Laura began .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 30]: She went on , imploring Cora to confide in her , entreating her to see their mother -- to do a dozen things altogether outside of Cora 's plans .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 23]: `` You 're wasting your breath , Laura , '' said the younger sister , interrupting , `` and wasting my time .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 22]: You 're in the dark : you think I 'm going to run away with Val Corliss and you 're wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 22]: I sent him out of the house for good , a while ago -- '' `` Thank heaven for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 3]: cried Laura .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 16]: `` I 'm going to take care of myself , '' Cora went on rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 27]: `` I 'm going to get out of the mess I 'm in , and you 've got to let me do it my own way .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 9]: I 'll send you a note from downtown .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 25]: You see that the messenger -- '' She was at the door , but Laura caught her by the sleeve , protesting and beseeching .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 4]: Cora turned desperately .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 4]: `` See here .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 14]: I 'll come back in two hours and tell you all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 35]: If I promise that , will you promise to send me the bag by the -- '' `` But if you 're coming back you wo n't need -- '' Cora spoke very quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 10]: `` I 'll go to pieces in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 19]: Really , I do think I 'd better jump out of the window and have it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 24]: `` I 'll send the bag , '' Laura quavered , `` if you 'll promise to come back in two hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 5]: `` I promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 31]: Cora gave her a quick embrace , a quick kiss , and , dry-eyed , ran out of the room , down the stairs , and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 7]: She walked briskly down Corliss Street .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 40]: It was a clear day , bright noon , with an exhilarating tang in the air , and a sky so glorious that people outdoors were continually conscious of the blue overhead , and looked up at it often .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 32]: An autumnal cheerfulness was abroad , and pedestrians showed it in their quickened steps , in their enlivened eyes , and frequent smiles , and in the colour of their faces .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 12]: But none showed more colour or a gayer look than Cora .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 41]: She encountered many whom she knew , for it was indeed a day to be stirring , and she nodded and smiled her way all down the long street , thinking of what these greeted people would say to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 25]: _ I _ saw her yesterday , walking down Corliss Street , about noon , in a gray suit and looking fairly radiant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 18]: Some of those she met were enemies she had chastened ; she prophesied their remarks with accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 48]: Some were old suitors , men who had desired her ; one or two had place upon her long list of boy-sweethearts : she gave the same gay , friendly nod to each of them , and foretold his morrow 's thoughts of her , in turn .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 35]: Her greeting of Mary Kane was graver , as was aesthetically appropriate , Mr. Wattling 's engagement having been broken by that lady , immediately after his drive to the Country Club for tea .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 20]: Cora received from the beautiful jilt a salutation even graver than her own , which did not confound her .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 8]: Halfway down the street was a drug-store .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 13]: She went in , and obtained appreciative permission to use the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 13]: She came out well satisfied , and went swiftly on her way .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 14]: Ten minutes later , she opened the door of Wade Trumble 's office .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 17]: He was alone ; her telephone had caught him in the act of departing for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 15]: But he had been glad to wait -- glad to the verge of agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 7]: `` By George , Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 22]: he exclaimed , as she came quickly in and closed the door , `` but you _ can _ look stunning !
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 8]: Believe me , that 's some get-up .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 27]: But let me tell you right here and now , before you begin , it 's no use your tackling me again on the oil proposition .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 34]: If there was any chance of my going into it which there was n't , not one on earth -- why , the very fact of your asking me would have stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 35]: I 'm no Dick Lindley , I beg to inform you : I do n't spend my money helping a girl that I want , myself , to make a hit with another man .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 30]: You treated me like a dog about that , right in the street , and you need n't try it again , because I wo n't stand for it .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 11]: You ca n't play _ me _ , Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 33]: `` Wade , '' she said , coming closer , and looking at him mysteriously , `` did n't you tell me to come to you when I got through playing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 19]: He grew very red , took a step back from her , staring at her distrustfully , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 15]: `` I 've got through playing '' , she said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 9]: `` And I 've come to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 4]: He was staggered .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 11]: `` You 've come -- '' he said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 8]: `` Here I am , Wade . ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 19]: He had flushed , but now the colour left his small face , and he grew very white .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 10]: `` I do n't believe you mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: `` Listen , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 11]: `` I was rotten to you about that oil nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 12]: It _ was _ nonsense , nothing on earth but nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 9]: I tell you frankly I was a fool .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 23]: I did n't care the snap of my finger for Corliss , but -- oh , what 's the use of pretending ?
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 27]: You were always such a great ` business man , ' always so absorbed in business , and put it before everything else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 15]: You cared for me , but you cared for business more than for me .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 11]: Well , no woman likes _ that _ , Wade .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 18]: I 've come to tell you the whole thing : I ca n't stand it any longer .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 11]: I suffered horribly because -- because -- '' She faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 15]: `` Wade , that was no way to _ win _ a girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 4]: `` Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 5]: His incredulity was strong .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 11]: `` I thought I hated you for it , Wade .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 25]: Yes , I did think that ; I 'm telling you everything , you see just blurting it out as it comes , Wade .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 26]: Well , Corliss asked me to help him , and it struck me I 'd show that I could understand a business deal , myself .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 23]: Wade , this is pretty hard to say , I was such a little fool , but you ought to know it .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 57]: You 've got a right to know it , Wade : I thought if I put through a thing like that , it would make a tremendous hit with you , and that then I could say : ` So this is the kind of thing you put ahead of _ me _ , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 23]: Simple little things like this , that _ I _ can do , myself , by turning over my little finger ! '
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 35]: So I got Richard to go in -- that was easy ; and then it struck me that the crowning triumph of the whole thing would be to get you to come in yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 11]: That _ would _ be showing you , I thought !
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 32]: But you would n't : you put me in my place -- and I was angry -- I never was so angry in my life , and I showed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 6]: Tears came into her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 28]: `` Oh , Wade , '' she said , softly , `` it was the very wildness of my anger that showed what I really felt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 9]: `` About -- about _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 7]: His incredulity struggled with his hope .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 6]: He stepped close to her .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 13]: `` What an awful fool I 've been , '' she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 16]: `` Why , I thought I could show you I was your _ equal _ !
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 12]: And look what it 's got me into , Wade ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 11]: `` What has it got you into , Cora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 25]: `` One thing worth while : I can see what I really am when I try to meet you on your own ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 15]: She bent her head , humbly , then lifted it , and spoke rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 9]: `` All the rest is dreadful , Wade .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 38]: I had a distrust of Corliss from the first ; I did n't like him , but I took him up because I thought he offered the chance to show _ you _ what I could do .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 12]: Well , it 's got me into a most horrible mess .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 14]: He 's a swindler , a rank -- '' `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 3]: Wade shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 14]: `` Cora , you 're talking out now like a real woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 3]: `` Listen .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 48]: I got horribly tired of him after a week or so , but I 'd promised to help him and I did n't break with him ; but yesterday I just could n't stand him any longer and I told him so , and sent him away .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 35]: Then , this morning , an old man came to the house , a man named Pryor , who knew him and knew his record , and he told me all about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 5]: She narrated the interview .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 10]: `` But you had sent Corliss away first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 5]: Wade asked , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 8]: `` Yesterday , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 11]: She set her hand on the little man 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 14]: `` Wade , there 's bound to be a scandal over all this .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 22]: Even if Corliss gets away without being arrested and tried , the whole thing 's bound to come _ out _ .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 34]: I 'll be the laughing-stock of the town -- and I deserve to be : it 's all through having been ridiculous idiot enough to try and impress you with my business brilliancy .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 9]: Well , I ca n't stand it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 10]: `` Cora , do you -- '' He faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 23]: She leaned toward him , her hand still on his shoulder , her exquisite voice lowered , and thrilling in its sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 8]: `` Wade , I 'm through playing .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 14]: I 've come to you at last because you 've utterly conquered me .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 17]: If you 'll take me away to-day , I 'll _ marry _ you to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 11]: He gave a shout that rang again from the walls .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 7]: `` Do you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 10]: she whispered ; then smiled upon his rapture indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 4]: Rapture it was .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 12]: With the word `` marry , '' his incredulity sped forever .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 38]: But for a time he was incoherent : he leaped and hopped , spoke broken bits of words , danced fragmentarily , ate her with his eyes , partially embraced her , and finally kissed her timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 9]: `` Such a wedding we 'll have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 6]: he shouted , after that .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 4]: she said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 31]: `` We 'll be married by a Justice of the Peace and not a soul there but us , and it will be now , or it never will be !
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 14]: If you do n't -- '' He swore she should have her way .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 21]: `` Then we 'll be out of this town on the three o'clock train this afternoon , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 23]: She went on with her plans , while he , growing more accustomed to his privilege , caressed her as he would .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 18]: `` You shall have your way , '' she said , `` in everything except the wedding-journey .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 25]: That 's got to be a long one -- I wo n't come back here till people have forgotten all about this Corliss mix-up .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 14]: I 've never been abroad , and I want you to take me .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 9]: We can stay a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 19]: I 've brought nothing -- we 'll get whatever we want in New York before we sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 5]: He agreed to everything .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 33]: He had never really hoped to win her ; paradise had opened , dazing him with glory : he was astounded , mad with joy , and abjectly his lady 's servant .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 13]: `` Had n't you better run along and get the license ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 15]: `` We 'll have to be married on the way to the train . ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 4]: `` Cora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 5]: `` You angel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 12]: `` I 'll wait here for you , '' she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 10]: `` There wo n't be too much time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 11]: He obtained a moderate control of his voice and feet .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 18]: `` Enfield -- that 's my cashier -- he 'll be back from his lunch at one-thirty .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 13]: Tell him about us , if I 'm not here by then .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 9]: Tell him he 's got to manage somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 9]: Good-bye till I come back Mrs. Trumble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 6]: At the door he turned .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 13]: `` Oh , have you -- you -- '' He paused uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 15]: `` Have you sent Richard Lindley any word about -- '' `` Wade ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 8]: She gave his inquiry an indulgent amusement .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 17]: `` If I 'm not worrying about him , do you think you need to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 15]: `` I meant about -- '' `` You funny thing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 38]: `` I never had any idea of really marrying him ; it was n't anything but one of those silly half-engagements , and -- '' `` I did n't mean that , '' he said , apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 27]: `` I meant about letting him know what this Pryor told you about Corliss , so that Richard might do something toward getting his money back .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 15]: We ought to -- '' `` Oh , yes , '' she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 9]: `` Yes , that 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 6]: `` You saw Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 6]: I sent him a note .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 17]: He knows all about it by this time , if he has been home this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 7]: You 'd better start , Wade .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 10]: Send a messenger to our house for my bag .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 14]: Tell him to bring it here and then take a note for me .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 10]: You 'd really better start -- dear ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 5]: _ Cora _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 13]: he shouted , took her in his arms , and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 20]: His departing gait down the corridor to the elevator seemed , from the sounds , to be a gallop .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 15]: Left alone , Cora wrote , sealed , and directed a note to Laura .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 31]: In it she recounted what Pryor had told her of Corliss ; begged Laura and her parents not to think her heartless in not preparing them for this abrupt marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 20]: She was in such a state of nervousness , she wrote , that explanations would have caused a breakdown .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 35]: The marriage was a sensible one ; she had long contemplated it as a possibility ; and , after thinking it over thoroughly , she had decided it was the only thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 6]: She sent her undying love .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 28]: She was sitting with this note in her hand when shuffling footsteps sounded in the corridor ; either Wade 's cashier or the messenger , she supposed .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 15]: The door-knob turned , a husky voice asking , `` Want a drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 5]: as the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 26]: Cora was not surprised -- she knew Vilas 's office was across the hall from that in which she waited -- but she was frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 6]: Ray stood blinking at her .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 8]: `` What are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 6]: he asked , at last .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 19]: CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE It is probable that he got the truth out of her , perhaps all of it .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 26]: That will remain a matter of doubt ; Cora 's evidence , if she gave it , not being wholly trustworthy in cases touching herself .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 20]: But she felt no need of mentioning to any one that she had seen her former lover that day .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 68]: He had gone before the return of Enfield , Mr. Trumble 's assistant , who was a little later than usual , it happened ; and the extreme nervousness and preoccupation exhibited by Cora in telling Enfield of his employer 's new plans were attributed by the cashier to the natural agitation of a lady about to wed in a somewhat unusual -LRB- though sensible -RRB- manner .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 24]: It is the more probable that she told Ray the whole truth , because he already knew something of Corliss 's record abroad .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 51]: On the dusty desk in Ray 's own office lay a letter , received that morning from the American Consul at Naples , which was luminous upon that subject , and upon the probabilities of financial returns for the investment of a thousand dollars in the alleged oil-fields of Basilicata .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 36]: In addition , Cora had always found it very difficult to deceive Vilas : he had an almost perfect understanding of a part of her nature ; she could never far mislead him about herself .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 20]: With her , he was intuitive and jumped to strange , inconsistent , true conclusions , as women do .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 30]: He had the art of reading her face , her gestures ; he had learned to listen to the tone of her voice more than to what she said .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 17]: In his cups , too , he had fitful but almost demoniac inspirations for hidden truth .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 35]: And , remembering that Cora always `` got even , '' it remains finally to wonder if she might not have told him everything at the instance of some shadowy impulse in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 31]: There may have been a luxury in whatever confession she made ; perhaps it was not entirely forced from her , and heaven knows how she may have coloured it .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 38]: There was an elusive , quiet satisfaction somewhere in her subsequent expression ; it lurked deep under the surface of the excitement with which she talked to Enfield of her imminent marital abduction of his small boss .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 35]: Her agitation , a relic of the unknown interview just past , simmered down soon , leaving her in a becoming glow of colour , with slender threads of moisture brilliantly outlining her eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 25]: Mr. Enfield , a young , well-favoured and recent importation from another town , was deliciously impressed by the charm of the waiting lady .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 34]: They had not met ; and Enfield wondered how Trumble had compassed such an enormous success as this ; and he wished that he had seen her before matters had gone so far .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 9]: He thought he might have had a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 37]: She seemed pleasantly interested in him , even as it was -- and her eyes were wonderful , with their swift , warm , direct little plunges into those of a chance comrade of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 58]: She went to the window , in her restlessness , looking down upon the swarming street below , and the young man , standing beside her , felt her shoulder most pleasantly though very lightly -- in contact with his own , as they leaned forward , the better to see some curiosity of advertising that passed .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 37]: She turned her face to his just then , and told him that he must come to see her : the wedding journey would be long , she said , but it would not be forever .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 24]: Trumble bounded in , shouting that everything was attended to , except instructions to Enfield , whom he pounded wildly upon the back .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 25]: He began signing papers ; a stenographer was called from another room of his offices ; and there was half an hour of rapid-fire .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 40]: Cora 's bag came , and she gave the bearer the note for Laura ; another bag was brought for Wade ; and both bags were carried down to the automobile the bridegroom had left waiting in the street .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 76]: Last , came a splendid cluster of orchids for the bride to wear , and then Wade , with his arm about her , swept her into the corridor , and the stirred Enfield was left to his own beating heart , and the fresh , radiant vision of this startling new acquaintance : the sweet mystery of the look she had thrown back at him over his employer 's shoulder at the very last .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 9]: `` Do not forget _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 6]: it had seemed to say .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 10]: `` We shall come back -- some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 35]: The closed car bore the pair to the little grim marriage-shop quickly enough , though they were nearly run down by a furious police patrol automobile , at a corner near the Richfield Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 17]: Their escape was by a very narrow margin of safety , and Cora closed her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 23]: Then she was cross , because she had been frightened , and commanded Wade cavalierly to bid the driver be more careful .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 4]: Wade obeyed sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 28]: `` Of course , though , it was n't altogether his fault , '' he said , settling back , his arm round his lady 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 16]: `` It 's an outrage for the police to break their own rules that way .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 20]: I guess they do n't need to be in a hurry any more than _ we _ do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 8]: The Justice made short work of it .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 99]: As they stood so briefly before him , there swept across her vision the memory of what she had always prophesied as her wedding : -- a crowded church , `` The Light That Breathed O'er Eden '' from an unseen singer ; then the warm air trembling to the Lohengrin march ; all heads turning ; the procession down the aisle ; herself appearing -- climax of everything -- a delicious and brilliant figure : graceful , rosy , shy , an imperial prize for the groom , who in these foreshadowings had always been very indistinct .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 25]: The picture had always failed in outline there : the bridegroom 's nearest approach to definition had never been clearer than a composite photograph .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 14]: The truth is , Cora never in her life wished to be married .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 4]: But she was .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 23]: CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR Valentine Corliss had nothing to do but to wait for the money his friend Antonio would send him by cable .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 29]: His own cable , anticipating his letter , had been sent yesterday , when he came back to the hotel , after lunching in the country with Cora .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 44]: As he walked down Corliss Street , after his tumultuous interview with her , he was surprised to find himself physically tremulous : he had not supposed that an encounter , however violent , with an angry woman could so upset his nerves .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 10]: It was no fear of Pryor which shook him .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 16]: He knew that Pryor did not mean to cause his arrest -- certainly not immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 11]: Of course , Pryor knew that Cora would tell him .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 10]: The old fellow 's move was a final notification .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 13]: It meant : `` Get out of town within twenty-four hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 6]: And Corliss intended to obey .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 18]: He would have left that evening , indeed , without the warning ; his trunk was packed .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 5]: He would miss Cora .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 32]: He had kept a cool head throughout their affair until the last ; but this morning she had fascinated him : and he found himself passionately admiring the fury of her .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 11]: She had confused him as he had never been confused .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 32]: He thought he had tamed her ; thought he owned her ; and the discovery of this mistake was what made him regret that she would not come away with him .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 30]: Such a flight , until to-day , had been one of his apprehensions : but now the thought that it was not to be , brought something like pain .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 15]: At least , he felt a vacancy ; had a sense of something lacking .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 33]: She would have been a bright comrade for the voyage ; and he thought of gestures of hers , turns of the head , tricks of the lovely voice ; and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 23]: Of course it was best for him that he could return to his old trails alone and free ; he saw that .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 25]: Cora would have been a complication and an embarrassment without predictable end , but she would have been a rare flame for a while .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 15]: He wondered what she meant to do ; of course she had a plan .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 10]: Should he try again , give her another chance ?
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 21]: No ; there was one point upon which she had not mystified him : he knew she really hated him .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 29]: ... The wind was against the smoke that day ; and his spirits rose , as he walked in the brisk air with the rich sky above him .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 25]: After all , this venture upon his native purlieus had been fax from fruitless : he could not have expected to do much better .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 16]: He had made his coup ; he knew no other who could have done it .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 25]: It was a handsome bit of work , in fact , and possible only to a talented native thoroughly sophisticated in certain foreign subtleties .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 8]: He knew himself for a rare combination .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 31]: He had a glimmer of Richard Lindley beginning at the beginning again to build a modest fortune : it was the sort of thing the Richard Lindleys were made for .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 5]: Corliss was not troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 27]: Richard had disliked him as a boy ; did not like him now ; but Corliss had not taken his money out of malice for that .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 11]: The adventurer was not revengeful ; he was merely impervious .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 49]: At the hotel , he learned that Moliterno 's cable had not yet arrived ; but he went to an agency of one of the steamship lines and reserved his passage , and to a railway ticket office and secured a compartment for himself on an evening train .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 10]: Then he returned to his room in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 33]: The mirror over the mantelpiece , in the front room of his suite , showed him a fine figure of a man : hale , deep-chested , handsome , straight and cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 5]: He nodded to it .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 23]: `` Well , old top , '' he said , reviewing and summing up his whole campaign , `` not so bad .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 15]: Not so bad , all in all ; not so bad , old top .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 5]: Well played indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 31]: At a sound of footsteps approaching his door , he turned in casual expectancy , thinking it might be a boy to notify him that Moliterno 's cable had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 14]: But there was no knock , and the door was flung wide open .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 14]: It was Vilas , and he had his gun with him this time .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 4]: He had two .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 27]: There was a shallow clothes-closet in the wall near the fireplace , and Corliss ran in there ; but Vilas began to shoot through the door .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 23]: Mutilated , already a dead man , and knowing it , Corliss came out , and tried to run into the bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 5]: It was no use .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 8]: Ray saved his last shot for himself .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 5]: It did the work .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 33]: CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE There is a song of parting , an intentionally pathetic song , which contains the line , `` All the tomorrows shall be as to-day , '' meaning equally gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 33]: Young singers , loving this line , take care to pronounce the words with unusual distinctness : the listener may feel that the performer has the capacity for great and consistent suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 22]: It is not , of course , that youth loves unhappiness , but the appearance of it , its supposed picturesqueness .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 13]: Youth runs from what is pathetic , but hangs fondly upon pathos .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 39]: It is the idea of sorrow , not sorrow , which charms : and so the young singer dwells upon those lingering tomorrows , happy in the conception of a permanent wretchedness incurred in the interest of sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 6]: For youth believes in permanence .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 39]: It is when we are young that we say , `` I shall never , '' and `` I shall always , '' not knowing that we are only time 's atoms in a crucible of incredible change .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 30]: An old man scarce dares say , `` I have never , '' for he knows that if he searches he will find , probably , that he has .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 8]: `` All , all is change . ''
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 38]: It was an evening during the winter holidays when Mrs. Lindley , coming to sit by the fire in her son 's smoking-room , where Richard sat glooming , narrated her legend of the Devil of Lisieux .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 44]: It must have been her legend : the people of Lisieux know nothing of it ; but this Richard the Guileless took it for tradition , as she alleged it , and had no suspicion that she had spent the afternoon inventing it .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 25]: She did not begin the recital immediately upon taking her chair , across the hearth from her son ; she led up to it .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 33]: She was an ample , fresh-coloured , lively woman ; and like her son only in being a kind soul : he got neither his mortal seriousness nor his dreaminess from her .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 34]: She was more than content with Cora 's abandonment of him , though , as chivalrousness was not demanded of her , she would have preferred that he should have been the jilt .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 18]: She thought Richard well off in his release , even at the price of all his savings .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 98]: But there was something to hope , even in that matter , Pryor wrote from Paris encouragingly : he believed that Moliterno might be frightened or forced into at least a partial restitution ; though Richard would not count upon it , and had `` begun at the beginning '' again , as a small-salaried clerk in a bank , trudging patiently to work in the morning and home in the evening , a long-faced , tired young man , more absent than ever , lifeless , and with no interest in anything outside his own broodings .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 22]: His mother , pleased with his misfortune in love , was of course troubled that it should cause him to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 33]: She knew she could not heal him ; but she also knew that everything is healed in time , and that sometimes it is possible for people to help time a little .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 28]: Her first remark to her son , this evening , was that to the best of her memory she had never used the word `` hellion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 55]: And , upon his saying gently , no , he thought it probable that she never had , but seeking no farther and dropping his eyes to the burning wood , apparently under the impression that the subject was closed , she informed him brusquely that it was her intention to say it now .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 12]: `` What is it you want to say , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 44]: `` If I can bring myself to use the word ` hellion ' , '' she returned , `` I 'm going to say that of all the heaven-born , whole-souled and consistent ones I ever knew Hedrick Madison is the King . ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 7]: `` In what new way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 4]: `` Egerton Villard .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 32]: Egerton used to be the neatest , best-mannered , best-dressed boy in town ; but he looks and behaves like a Digger Indian since he 's taken to following Hedrick around .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 25]: Mrs. Villard says it 's the greatest sorrow of her life , but she 's quite powerless : the boy is Hedrick 's slave .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 20]: The other day she sent a servant after him , and just bringing him home nearly ruined her limousine .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 48]: He was solidly covered with molasses , over his clothes and all , from head to foot , and then he 'd rolled in hay and chicken feathers to be a _ gnu _ for Hedrick to kodak in the African Wilds of the Madisons ' stable .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 24]: Egerton did n't know what a gnu was , but Hedrick told him that was the way to be one , he said .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 37]: Then , when they 'd got him scraped and boiled , and most of his hair pulled out , a policemen came to arrest him for stealing the jug of molasses at a corner grocery . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 9]: Richard nodded , and smiled faintly for comment .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 8]: They sat in silence for a while .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 12]: `` I saw Mrs. Madison yesterday , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 23]: `` She seemed very cheerful ; her husband is able to talk almost perfectly again , though he does n't get downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 9]: Laura reads to him a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 12]: He nodded again , his gaze not moving from the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 12]: `` Laura was with her mother , '' said Mrs. Lindley .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 32]: `` She looked very fetching in a black cloth suit and a fur hat -- old ones her sister left , I suspect , but very becoming , for all that .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 12]: Laura 's ` going out ' more than usual this winter .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 13]: She 's really the belle of the holiday dances , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 16]: Of course she would be '' , she added , thoughtfully -- `` now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 13]: `` Why should she be ` now ' more than before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 13]: `` Oh , Laura 's quite blossomed , '' Mrs. Lindley answered .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 11]: `` I think she 's had some great anxieties relieved .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 20]: Of course both she and her mother must have worried about Cora as much as they waited on her .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 21]: It must be a great burden lifted to have her comfortably settled , or , at least , disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 7]: I thought they both looked better .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 24]: But I have a special theory about Laura : I suppose you 'll laugh at me -- '' `` Oh , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 18]: `` I wish you would sometimes , '' she said wistfully , `` so only you laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 17]: My idea is that Laura was in love with that poor little Trumble , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 6]: He looked up at that .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 10]: `` Yes ; girls fall in love with anybody .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 22]: I fancy she cared very deeply for him ; but I think she 's a strong , sane woman , now .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 24]: She 's about the steadiest , coolest person I know -- and I know her better , lately , than I used to .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 52]: I think she made up her mind that she 'd not sit down and mope over her unhappiness , and that she 'd get over what caused it ; and she took the very best remedy : she began going about , going everywhere , and she went gayly , too !
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 28]: And I 'm sure she 's cured ; I 'm sure she does n't care the snap of her fingers for Wade Trumble or any man alive .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 32]: She 's having a pretty good time , I imagine : she has everything in the world except money , and she 's never cared at all about _ that _ .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 52]: She 's young , and she dresses well -- these days -- and she 's one of the handsomest girls in town ; she plays like a poet , and she dances well -- '' `` Yes , '' said Richard ; -- reflectively , `` she does dance well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 34]: `` And from what I hear from Mrs. Villard , '' continued his mother , `` I guess she has enough young men in love with her to keep any girl busy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 9]: He was interested enough to show some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 7]: `` In love with Laura ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 7]: `` Four , I hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 12]: The best of women are sometimes the readiest with impromptu statistics .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 5]: he said , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 21]: `` You see , Laura has taken to smiling on the world , and the world smiles back at her .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 12]: It 's not a bad world about that , Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 7]: `` No , '' he sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 6]: `` I suppose not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 16]: `` But there 's more than that in this case , my dear son . ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 5]: `` Is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 37]: The intelligent and gentle matron laughed as though at some unexpected turn of memory and said : `` Speaking of Hedrick , did you ever hear the story of the Devil of Lisieux , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 15]: `` I think not ; at least , I do n't remember it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 13]: `` Lisieux is a little town in Normandy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 17]: `` I was there a few days with your father , one summer , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 26]: It 's a country full of old stories , folklore , and traditions ; and the people still believe in the Old Scratch pretty literally .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 12]: This legend was of the time when he came to Lisieux .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 33]: The people knew he was coming because a wise woman had said that he was on the way , and predicted that he would arrive at the time of the great fair .

Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 52]: The wise woman was able to give them a little comfort ; she said some one was coming with the devil , and that the people must not notice the devil , but keep their eyes fastened on this other -- then they would be free of the fiend 's influence .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 72]: But , when the devil arrived at the fair , nobody even looked to see who his companion was , for the devil was so picturesque , so vivid , all in flaming scarlet and orange , and he capered and danced and sang so that nobody could help looking at him -- and , after looking once , they could n't look away until they were thoroughly under his spell .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 35]: So they were all bewitched , and began to scream and howl and roll on the ground , and turn on each other and brawl , and ` commit all manner of excesses . '
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 43]: Then the wise woman was able to exorcise the devil , and he sank into the ground ; but his companion stayed , and the people came to their senses , and looked , and they saw that it was an angel .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 16]: The angel had been there all the time that the fiend was , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 28]: So they have a saying now , that there may be angels with us , but we do n't notice them when the devil 's about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 28]: She did not look at her son as she finished , and she had hurried through the latter part of her `` legend '' with increasing timidity .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 31]: The parallel was more severe , now that she put it to him , than she intended ; it sounded savage ; and she feared she had overshot her mark .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 65]: Laura , of course , was the other , the companion ; she had been actually a companion for the vivid sister , everywhere with her at the fair , and never considered : now she emerged from her overshadowed obscurity , and people were able to see her as an individual -- heretofore she had been merely the retinue of a flaming Cora .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 12]: But the `` legend '' was not very gallant to Cora !
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 24]: Mrs. Lindley knew that it hurt her son ; she felt it without looking at him , and before he gave a sign .

Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 63]: When Richard came home from his cold night-prowl in the snowy streets , he found a sheet of note paper upon his pillow : `` Dearest Richard , I did n't mean that anybody you ever cared for was a d -- l. I only meant that often the world finds out that there are lovely people it has n't noticed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 28]: ... He reproached himself , then , for the reproach his leaving her had been ; he had a susceptible and annoying conscience , this unfortunate Richard .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 39]: He found it hard to get to sleep , that night ; and was kept awake long after he had planned how he would make up to his mother for having received her `` legend '' so freezingly .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 62]: What kept him awake , after that , was a dim , rhythmic sound coming from the house next door , where a holiday dance was in progress -- music far away and slender : fiddle , ` cello , horn , bassoon , drums , all rollicking away almost the night-long , seeping through the walls to his restless pillow .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 38]: Finally , when belated drowsiness came , the throbbing tunes mingled with his half-dreams , and he heard the light shuffling of multitudinous feet over the dancing-floor , and became certain that Laura 's were among them .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 42]: He saw her , gliding , swinging , laughing , and happy and the picture did not please him : it seemed to him that she would have been much better employed sitting in black to write of a hopeless love .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 13]: Coquetting with four suitors was not only inconsistent ; it was unbecoming .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 15]: It `` suited Cora 's style , '' but in Laura it was outrageous .

Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 5]: Richard thought it scandalous .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 26]: His indignation with her had not worn off when he descended to breakfast , but he made up to his mother for having troubled her .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 46]: Then , to cap his gallantry , he observed that several inches of snow must have fallen during the night ; it would be well packed upon the streets by noon ; he would get a sleigh , after lunch , and take her driving .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 5]: It was a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 7]: She thanked him , but half-declined .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 30]: `` I 'm afraid it 's too cold for me , but there are lots of nice girls in town , Richard , who wo n't mind weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 9]: `` But I asked _ you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 26]: It was finally left an open question for the afternoon to settle ; and , upon her urging , he went out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 43]: She stood at the window to watch him , and , when she saw that he turned northward , she sank into a chair , instead of going to give Joe Varden his after-breakfast instructions , and fell into a deep reverie .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 35]: Outdoors , it was a biting cold morning , wind-swept and gray ; and with air so frosty-pure no one might breathe it and stay bilious : neither in body nor bilious in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 53]: It was a wind to sweep the yellow from jaundiced cheeks and make them rosy ; a wind to clear dulled eyes ; it was a wind to lift foolish hearts , to lift them so high they might touch heaven and go winging down the sky , the wildest of wild-geese .

Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 4]: She had none .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 5]: He came toward her .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 8]: She rose and stepped back a little .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 24]: Ashes had blown upon her , and , oh , the old , old thought of the woman born to be a mother !
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 14]: she was afraid his clothes might get dusty if he came too close .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 34]: But to Richard she looked very beautiful ; and a strange thing happened : trembling , he saw that the firelight upon her face was brighter than any firelight he had ever seen .
