Parsing [sent. 1 len. 31]: The Independence of Claire By Mrs George de Horne Vaizey This is a rather typical Horne Vaizey book , about the life led by young well-brought-up women in Edwardian times .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 51]: Worries about money , about who to marry , whether to go or not to parties to be given by elderly hostesses , about clothes , about hair-styles , and even , as so often in this author 's books , with a bit of illness thrown in as well .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 26]: There 's a time when Claire seems on the way to making a big mistake , but it all gets sorted out in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 17]: Make an audiobook of this book - that is probably the best way to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 13]: THE INDEPENDENCE OF CLAIRE BY MRS. GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 9]: `` I 'LL HAVE TO DO IT . ''
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 32]: Claire Gifford stood in the salon of the Brussels pension which had been her home for the last three years , and bent her brows in consideration of an all-absorbing problem .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 7]: `` Can I marry him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 27]: she asked herself once and again , with the baffling result that every single time her brain answered instantly , '' _ You must _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 18]: the while her heart rose up in rebellion , and cried , `` I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 36]: Many girls have found themselves in the same predicament before and since , but few have had stronger reasons for sacrificing personal inclination on the altar of filial duty than Claire knew at this minute .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 39]: To begin with , the relationship between herself and her mother was more intimate than is usually the case , for Claire was an only child , and Mrs Gifford a widow only eighteen years older than herself .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 97]: Briefly stated , the family history was as follows -- Eleanor Guyther had been the only child of stern , old-world parents , and at seventeen had run away from the house which had been more like a prison than a home , to marry a handsome young artist who had been painting in the neighbourhood during the summer months ; a handsome merry-faced boy of twenty-one , whose portrait Claire treasured in an old-fashioned gold locket , long since discarded by her mother , who followed the fashion in jewellery as well as in dress .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 53]: It was strange to look at the face of a father who was no older than oneself , and Claire had spent many hours gazing at the pictured face , and trying to gain from it some idea of the personality of the man of whom her mother persistently refused to speak .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 43]: Mrs Gifford shrank from all disagreeables , great and small , and systematically turned her back on anything which was disturbing or painful , so that it was only from chance remarks that her daughter had gained any information about the past .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 21]: She knew that her father had been a successful artist , although not in the highest sense of the term .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 41]: He had a trick of turning out pretty domestic pictures which appealed to the taste of the million , and which , being purchased by enterprising dealers , were reproduced in cheap prints to deck the walls of suburban parlours .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 49]: While he lived he made a sufficient income , and before his death a formal reconciliation had taken place between the runaway daughter and her north-country parents , from whom she later inherited the money which had supported herself and her daughter throughout the years of her widowhood .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 70]: Claire had the vaguest idea as to the amount of her mother 's means , for until the last few years the question of money had never arisen , they had simply decided what they wished to do , without considering the cost , but of late there had been seasons of financial tightness , and the morning on which this history begins had brought a most disagreeable awakening .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 21]: Mrs Gifford was seated in the salon staring disconsolately at a note which had just arrived by the afternoon post .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 42]: It was a very disagreeable note , for it stated in brief and callous terms that her account at the bank was overdrawn to the extent of three hundred francs , and politely requested that the deficit should be made good .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 13]: Claire looked flushed and angry ; Mrs Gifford looked pathetic and pale .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 47]: It seemed , in the first place , quite ludicrous that such a relationship as that of mother and daughter should exist between two women who looked so nearly of an age , and Mrs Gifford 's youthful appearance was a standing joke in the Pension .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 63]: Every new visitor was questioned by Madame as to the relationship between the two English ladies , and never had one of the number failed to reply `` sisters , '' and to be convulsed with astonishment when corrected ; and in good truth Mrs Gifford was a wonderful specimen of the prolonged youth which is a phenomenon of the present day .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 63]: She was slight , she was graceful , her waving brown hair was as naturally luxuriant as that of a girl , her complexion was smooth and fair , her pretty features were unchanged , she dressed with good taste , and , though secretly proud of her youthful looks , was never so foolish as to adopt kittenish airs to match .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 35]: Her manner was quiet , gracious , appealing ; a little air of pathos enveloped her like a mist ; on strangers she made the impression of a lovely creature who had known suffering .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 21]: Everybody was kind to Mrs Gifford , and she in return had never been known to utter an unkind word .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 55]: She had been born with the faculty of loving everybody a little , and no one very much , which -- if one comes to think of it -- is the most powerful of all factors towards securing an easy life , since it secures the owner from the possibility of keen personal suffering .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 66]: At the present moment Mrs Gifford did , however , look really perturbed , for , after shutting her eyes to a disagreeable fact , and keeping them shut with much resolution and -- it must be added -- ease , for many years past , she was now driven to face the truth , and to break it to her daughter into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 8]: `` But I do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 4]: Claire repeated blankly .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 10]: `` How _ can _ the money be gone ?
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 12]: We have spent no more this year than for years past .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 8]: I should think we have spent less .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 8]: I have n't been extravagant a bit .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 27]: You offered me a new hat only last week , and I said I could do without -- '' `` Yes , yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 15]: It 's quite true , _ cherie _ , you have been most good .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 30]: But , you see , ours has not been a case of an income that goes on year after year -- it never was , even from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 5]: There was not enough .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 14]: And you _ did _ have a good education , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 6]: I spared nothing on it .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 11]: It 's folly to stint on a girl 's education .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 12]: -- It was one of the best schools in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 14]: `` It was , mother ; but we are not talking about schools .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 12]: Do let us get to the bottom of this horrid muddle !
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 16]: If it is n't a case of ` income , ' what can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 29]: I 'm ignorant about money , for you have always managed business matters , but I ca n't see what else we can have been living upon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 15]: Mrs Gifford crinkled her delicate brows , and adopted an air of plaintive self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 32]: `` I 'm sure it 's as great a shock to me as it is to you ; but , under the circumstances , I do think I managed very well .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 26]: It was only nine thousand pounds at the beginning , and I 've made it last over thirteen years , _ with _ your education !
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 31]: And since we 've been here , for the last three years , I 've given you a good time , and taken you to everything that was going on .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 5]: Naturally it all costs .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 17]: Naturally money ca n't last for ever ... '' The blood flooded the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 17]: Now at last she _ did _ understand , and the knowledge filled her with awe .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 3]: `` Mother !
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 17]: Do you mean that we have been living all this time on _ capital _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 16]: Mrs Gifford shrugged her shoulders , and extended her hands in an attitude typically French .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 10]: `` What would you , _ ma chere _ ?
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 6]: Interest is so ridiculously low .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 7]: They offered me three per cent .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 5]: Four was considered high .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 13]: How could we have lived on less than three hundred a year ?
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 24]: Your school bills came to nearly as much , and I had to live , too , and keep you in the holidays .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 9]: I did what I thought was the best .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 17]: We should both have been miserable in cheap pensions , stinting ourselves of everything we liked .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 11]: The money has made us happy for thirteen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 12]: Claire rose from her seat and walked over to the window .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 19]: The road into which she looked was wide and handsome , lined with a double row of trees .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 24]: The sun shone on the high white houses with the green _ jalousies _ , which stood _ vis-a-vis _ with the Pension .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 39]: Along the cobble-stoned path a dog was dragging a milk-cart , the gleaming brass cans clanking from side to side ; through the open window came the faint indescribable scent which distinguishes a continental from a British city .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 13]: Claire stared with unseeing eyes , her heart beating with heavy thuds .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 40]: She conjured up the image of a man 's face -- a strong kindly face -- a face which might well make the sunshine of some woman 's life , but which made no appeal to her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 17]: She set her lips , and two bright spots of colour showed suddenly in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 42]: So smooth and uneventful had been her life that this was the first time that she had found herself face to face with serious difficulty , and , after the first shock of realisation , her spirit rose to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 33]: She straightened her shoulders as if throwing off a weight , and her heart cried valiantly , `` It 's my own life , and I will _ not _ be forced !
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 7]: There must be some other way .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 9]: It 's for me to find it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 12]: Suddenly she whirled round , and walked back to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 27]: `` Mother , if you knew how little money was left , why would n't you let me accept Miss Farnborough 's offer at Christmas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 12]: For a moment Mrs Gifford 's face expressed nothing but bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 4]: Then comprehension dawned .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 8]: `` You mean the school-mistress from London ?
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 6]: What was it she suggested ?
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 10]: That you should go to her as a teacher ?
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 12]: It was only a suggestion , so far as I remember .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 7]: She made no definite offer . ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , she did .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 26]: She said that she had everlasting difficulty with her French mistresses , and that I was the very person for whom she 'd been looking .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 9]: Virtually French , yet really English in temperament .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 16]: She made me a definite offer of a hundred and ten pounds a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 10]: Mrs Gifford laughed , and shrugged her graceful shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 30]: She appeared to find the proposal supremely ridiculous , yet when people were without money , the only sane course seemed to be to take what one could get .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 11]: Claire felt that she had not yet mastered the situation .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 12]: There must be something behind which she had still to grasp .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 14]: `` Well , never mind the school for a moment , mother dear .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 10]: Tell me what _ you _ thought of doing .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 19]: You must have had some plan in your head all these years while the money was dwindling away .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 18]: Tell me your scheme , then we can compare the two and see which is better . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 22]: Mrs Gifford bent her head over the table , and scribbled aimlessly with a pen in which there was no ink .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 36]: She made no answer in words , yet as she waited the blood flamed suddenly over Claire 's face , for it seemed to her that she divined what was in her mother 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 8]: `` I expected that you would marry .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 15]: I have done my best to educate you and give you a happy youth .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 19]: I expected that you would accept your first good offer , and look after _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 47]: That was what a French mother would naturally say to her daughter ; that was what Claire Gifford believed that her own mother was saying to her at that moment , and the accusation brought little of the revolt which an English girl would have experienced .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 44]: Claire had been educated at a Parisian boarding school , and during the last three years had associated almost entirely with French-speaking Andrees and Maries and Celestes , who took for granted that their husbands should be chosen for them by their parents .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 33]: Claire had assisted at betrothal feasts , and played _ demoiselle d'honneur _ at subsequent weddings , and had witnessed an astonishing degree of happiness as an outcome of these business-like unions .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 20]: At this moment she felt no anger against her own mother for having tried to follow a similar course .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 15]: Her prevailing sensation was annoyance with herself for having been so difficult to lead .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 8]: `` It must be my English blood .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 15]: Somehow , when it came to the point , I never _ could _ .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 9]: But Mr Judge is different from most men .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 9]: He is so good and generous and unmercenary .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 19]: He 'd be kind to mother , and let her live with us , and make no fuss .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: He is as charming to her as he is to me .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 10]: Oh , dear , I _ am _ selfish !
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 7]: I _ am _ a wretch !
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 13]: It is n't as if I were in love with anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 4]: I 'm not .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 6]: Perhaps I never shall be .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 19]: I 'll never have the chance if I live in lodgings and spend my life teaching irregular verbs .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 18]: Why ca n't I be sensible and French , and marry him and live happily ever after ?
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 6]: _ Pauvre petite mere _ !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 11]: Why ca n't I think of _ her _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 25]: Suddenly Claire swooped down upon her mother 's drooping figure , wrapped her in loving arms , and swung her gently to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 27]: She was a tall , strikingly graceful girl , with a face less regularly beautiful than her mother 's , but infinitely more piquant and attractive .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 58]: She was more plump and rounded than the modern English girl , and her complexion less pink and white , but she was very neat and dainty and smart , possessed deep-set , heavily-lashed grey eyes , red lips which curled mischievously upward at the corner , and a pair of dimples on her soft left cheek .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 35]: The dimples were in full play at this moment ; the large one was just on the level with the upward curl of the lips , the smaller one nestled close to its side .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 37]: In repose they were almost unnoticed , but at the slightest lighting of expression , at the first dawn of a smile , they danced into sight and became the most noticeable feature of her face .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 14]: Claire without her dimples would have been another and far less fascinating personality .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 7]: `` Mother darling , forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 12]: Kiss me , _ cherie _ -- do n't look sad !
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 30]: I _ have _ had a good time , and we 'll have a good time yet , if it is in my power to get it for you .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: Cheer up !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 10]: Things wo n't be as bad as you fear .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 9]: We wo n't allow them to be bad .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 13]: ... How much does the horrid old bank say that we owe ?
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 4]: Three hundred francs .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 11]: I can pay it out of my own little savings .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 20]: Does it mean literally that there is nothing more , nothing at all -- not a single sou ? ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 4]: `` Oh no .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 5]: I have some shares .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 15]: They have been worthless for years , but just lately they have gone up .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 9]: I was asking Mr Judge about them yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 12]: He says I might get between two and three hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 10]: They were worth a thousand , years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 9]: Claire brightened with the quick relief of youth .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 15]: Two or three hundred English pounds were a considerable improvement on a debit account .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 12]: With two or three hundred pounds much might yet be done .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 12]: Thousands of people had built up great fortunes on smaller foundations .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 29]: In a vague , indefinite fashion she determined to devote these last pounds to settling herself in some business , which would ensure a speedy and generous return .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 24]: School teaching was plainly out of the question , since two gentlewomen could not exist on a hundred and ten pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 10]: She must think of something quicker , more lucrative .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 46]: All through dinner that evening Claire debated her future vocation as she sat by her mother 's side , halfway down the long dining-table which to English eyes appeared so bare and unattractive , but which was yet supplied with the most appetising of food .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 46]: Claire 's eyes were accustomed to the lack of pretty detail ; she had quite an affection for the Pension which stood for home in her migratory life , and a real love for Madame Dupre , the cheery , kindly , most capable proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 55]: Such of the _ pensionnaires _ as were not purely birds of passage she regarded as friends rather than acquaintances ; the only person in the room to whom she felt any antagonism was Mr Judge himself , but unfortunately he was the one of all others whom she was expected to like best .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 38]: As she ate her salad and broke fragments of delicious crusty roll , Claire threw furtive glances across the table at the man who for the last weeks had exercised so disturbing an element in her life .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 32]: Was it six weeks or two months , since she and her mother had first made his acquaintance at the tennis club at which they spent so many of their afternoons ?
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 34]: Claire had noticed that a new man had been present on that occasion , had bestowed on him one critical glance , decided with youthful arrogance : `` Oh , quite old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 41]: and promptly forgotten his existence , until an hour later , when , as she was sitting in the pavilion enjoying the luxury of a real English tea , the strange man and her mother had entered side by side .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 36]: Claire summoned in imagination the picture of her mother as she had looked at that moment , slim and graceful in the simplest of white dresses , an untrimmed linen hat shading her charming face .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 47]: She looked about twenty-five , and Claire was convinced that she knew as much , and that it was a mischievous curiosity to see her companion 's surprise which prompted her to lead the way across the floor , and formally introduce `` My daughter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 60]: Mr Judge exhibited all the expected signs of bewilderment , but he made himself exceedingly amiable to the daughter , and it was not until a week later that it was discovered that he had concluded that the relationship must surely be `` step , '' when fresh explanations were made , and all the bewilderment came over again .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 22]: Since then , oh , since then , Claire told herself , there had been no getting away from the man !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 26]: He was , it appeared , an Indian merchant spending a few months on the Continent , at the conclusion of a year 's leave .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 45]: He had come to Brussels because of the presence of an old school friend -- the same friend who was responsible for the introduction at the tennis club -- but week after week passed by , and he showed no disposition to move on .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 43]: Now Brussels is a very gay and interesting little city , but when Paris looms ahead , and Berlin , Vienna , to say nothing of the beauties of Switzerland and the Tyrol , and the artistic treasures of Italy -- well !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 18]: it _ did _ seem out of proportion to waste six whole weeks in that one spot !
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 44]: At the end of the last fortnight , too , Mr Judge declared that he was sick to death of hotels and lonely evenings in smoking rooms , and approached Madame Dupre with a view to joining the party at Villa Beau Sejour .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 26]: Madame was delighted to receive him , but Claire Gifford told her mother resentfully that she considered Mr Judge 's behaviour `` very cool . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 23]: How did he know that it would be pleasant for them to have him poking about morning , noon , and night ?
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 48]: `` It is n't _ our _ Pension , darling , and he is very nice to you , '' Mrs Gifford had said in return , and as it was impossible to contradict either statement , Claire had tossed her head , and relapsed into silence .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 18]: For the first weeks of her acquaintance with Mr Judge , Claire had thoroughly enjoyed his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 47]: It was agreeable to know a man who had a habit of noting your wishes , and then setting to work to bring them about forthwith , and who was also delightfully extravagant as regards flowers , and seemed to grow chocolates in his coat pockets .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 42]: It was only when he spoke of moving to the Pension , and her girl friends at the tennis club began to tease , roll meaning eyes , and ask when she was to be congratulated , that she took fright .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 15]: Did people really think that she was going to _ marry _ Mr Judge ?
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 30]: Lately things had moved on apace , and as a result of the unwelcome revelations of the morning 's post , Claire was to-day asking herself a different question .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 24]: She was no longer occupied with other people ; she was thinking of herself ... `` Am I going to marry Mr Judge ?
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 35]: Oh , good gracious , is that _ My Husband _ sitting over there , and have I got to live with him every day , as long as we both shall live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 21]: She shuddered at the thought , but in truth there was nothing to shudder at in Robert Judge 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 19]: He was a man of forty , bronzed , and wiry , with agreeable if not regular features .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 29]: Round his eyes the skin was deeply furrowed , but the eyes themselves were bright and youthful , and the prevailing expression was one of sincerity and kindliness .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 20]: He wore a loose grey tweed suit , with a soft-coloured shirt which showed a length of brown neck .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 12]: The fingers of his right band were deeply stained with tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 38]: During _ dejeuner _ he carried on a conversation with his right-hand companion , in exceedingly bad French , but ever and anon he glanced across the table as though his thoughts were not on his words .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 37]: Once , on looking up suddenly , Claire found his eyes fixed upon herself , with a strained , anxious look , and her heart quickened as she looked , then sank down heavy as lead .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 6]: `` It 's coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 5]: `` It 's coming !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 6]: There 's no running away .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 11]: I 'll have to stay , and see it out .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 12]: Oh , why ca n't I be French , and sensible ?
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 25]: I ought to be thankful to marry such a kind , good man , and be able to give mother a comfortable home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 13]: But as a matter of fact she was neither glad nor thankful .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 17]: Despite her French training , the English instinct survived and clamoured for liberty , for independence .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 7]: `` It 's my own life .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 34]: If I marry at all , I want to choose the man for no other reason than that I love him ; not as a duty , and to please somebody else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 45]: Then she glanced at her mother sitting by her side , slim , and graceful , with the little air of pathos and helplessness which even strangers found so appealing , and as she did so , a shiver passed through Claire 's veins .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 10]: `` But I 'll have to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 6]: she said to herself helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 9]: `` I 'll have to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 3]: TOO SUCCESSFUL !
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 9]: The next few days passed by slowly enough .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 32]: It is a great trial for a young creature to realise that a change is inevitable and , at the same time , that one must be cautious about making it .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 29]: The impulse is always to rush into action , and it is difficult to sit still and agree with the elderly precept in favour of consideration and delay .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 76]: If matters had been left to Claire she would have started out forthwith to search for a cheap Pension , and would have also despatched a letter to Miss Farnborough by the first post , to inquire if the school post were still open , but her mother vetoed both proposals , and pleaded so urgently for delay , that there was nothing left but to agree , and compose herself as best she might .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 20]: The weather was too hot for tennis , and in truth Claire was not in the mood for games .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 32]: With every hour she realised more keenly that she had come to the parting of the ways , and in the prospect of a new life old interests lost their savour .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 51]: Her mother seemed to share her restlessness , but while Claire preferred to stay indoors , in the privacy of her own room , Mrs Gifford seemed to find relief in action , and was often out for hours at a time , without vouchsafing any explanation of her absence .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 5]: Claire was not curious .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 39]: She was content to close the green shutters of her windows , slip into a muslin wrapper , and employ herself at some simple piece of needlework , which kept her hands busy while leaving her thoughts free .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 9]: Where would she be this time next year ?
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 59]: It was a question which no mortal can answer with certainty , but many of us are happy in the probability that we shall be still living in the same dear home , surrounded by the people and the objects which we love , whereas Claire 's one certainty was that she must move on to fresh scenes .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 10]: Bombay or London -- that seemed the choice ahead !
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 4]: Matrimony or teaching .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 46]: On the one hand a luxurious home , carriages and horses , a staff of servants , and apparently as much society as one desired , with the incubus of a husband whom she did not love , and who was twenty years her senior .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 17]: On the other hand , work and poverty , with the advantages of freedom and independence .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 57]: Claire 's eyes brightened at the sound of those two words , for dear as liberty is to the heart of an Englishwoman , it was in prospect dearer still to this girl who had been educated in a country still enslaved by chaperonage , and had never known a taste of real freedom of action .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 41]: Mrs Gifford had been as strict as or stricter than any Belgian mother , being rightly determined that no breath of scandal should touch her daughter 's name ; therefore wherever Claire went , some responsible female went with her .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 37]: She was chaperoned to church , chaperoned on her morning constitutional , a chaperon sat on guard during the period of music and drawing lessons , and at their conclusion escorted her back to the Pension .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 20]: What wonder that the thought of life as a bachelor girl in London seemed full of a thrilling excitement !
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 16]: Suppose for one minute that she decided on London -- what would become of mother ?
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 34]: Again and again Claire asked herself this question , again and again she recalled the interview between herself and the headmistress , Miss Farnborough , when the subject of teaching had been discussed .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 45]: It had happened one morning in the salon of the Pension , when Claire had been coaching an English visitor in preparation for a French interview which lay ahead , and Miss Farnborough , laying down her book , had listened with smiling interest .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 24]: Then the Englishwoman left the room , and Miss Farnborough had said , `` You did that very cleverly ; very cleverly indeed !
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 13]: You have a very happy knack of putting things simply and forcibly .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 8]: I 've noticed it more than once .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 8]: Have you ever done any teaching ? ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 20]: `` None professionally , '' Claire had replied with a laugh , `` but a great deal by chance .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 17]: I seem to drift into the position of coach to most of the English visitors here .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 9]: It pleases them , and it interests me .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 15]: And I used to help the French girls with their English at school . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 50]: Then Miss Farnborough had inquired with interest as to the details of Claire 's education , the schools she had attended , the examinations she had passed , and finally had come the critical question , `` Have you ever thought of taking up teaching as a profession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 43]: Claire had never thought of taking up work of any kind , but the suggestion roused a keen interest , as one of the temporary `` tight '' times was in process , so that the prospect of money-making seemed particularly agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 20]: She discussed the subject carefully , and out of that discussion had arisen the final offer of a post .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 19]: The junior French mistress in the High School of which Miss Farnborough was head was leaving at midsummer .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 22]: If Claire wished she could take her place , at a salary beginning at a hundred and ten pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 63]: In Trust Schools , of which Saint Cuthbert 's was one , there was no fixed scale of advancement , but a successful teacher could reach a salary of , say , two hundred a year by the time she was thirty-eight or forty , as against the permanent sixty or seventy offered to mistresses in residential schools of a higher grade .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 41]: Miss Farnborough 's mistresses were women trained at the various universities ; the school itself was situated in a fashionable neighbourhood , and its pupils were for the most part daughters of professional men , and gentlefolk of moderate incomes .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 30]: There was no pension scheme , and mistresses had to live out , but with care and economy they could take out some insurance to provide for old age .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 48]: Claire took little interest in her own old age , which seemed too far away to count , but she was intensely interested in the immediate future , and had been hurt and annoyed when her mother had waved aside the proposal as unworthy of serious consideration .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 29]: And now , only three months after Miss Farnborough 's departure , the crisis had arisen , and that hundred and ten pounds assumed a vastly increased value .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 47]: Supposing that the post was accepted , and mother and daughter started life in London with a capital of between two and three hundred pounds , and a salary of one hundred and ten , as regular income -- how long would the nest-egg last out ?
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 21]: Judging from the experience of past years , a very short time indeed , and what would happen after that ?
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 69]: Claire had read gruesome tales of the struggles of women in like positions , overtaken by illness , losing the salaries which represented their all , brought face to face with actual starvation , and in the midst of the midsummer heat , little shivers of fear trickled up and down her spine as she realised how easily she and her mother might drift into a like position .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 9]: Then , on the other hand , Bombay !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 12]: Indian houses were large ; mother could have her own rooms .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 17]: In the hot weather they would go together to the hills , leaving Mr Judge behind .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 13]: How long did the hot season last , four or five months ?
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 7]: Nearly half the year , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 27]: It would be only half as bad as marrying a man for money in Europe , for you would get rid of him all that time !
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 24]: Claire shrugged her shoulders and laughed , and two minutes later whisked away a tear , dedicated to the memory of girlish dreams .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 20]: Useless to dream any longer , she was awake now , and must face life in a sensible manner .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 17]: Her duty was to marry Robert Judge , and to make a home for her mother .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 35]: Another girl might have cherished anger against the recklessness which had landed her in such a trap , but after the first shock of discovery there had been no resentment in Claire 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 38]: She implicitly believed her mother 's assurance that according to her light she had acted for the best , and echoed with heartiness the assertion that the money had provided a good time for thirteen long years .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 15]: They had not been rich , but there had been a feeling of sufficiency .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 33]: They had had comfortable quarters , pretty clothes , delightful holiday journeys , a reasonable amount of gaiety , and , over and beyond all , the advantages of an excellent education .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 16]: Claire 's happy nature remembered her benefits , and made short work of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 5]: Poor , beautiful mother !
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 19]: who could expect her to be prudent and careful , like any ordinary , prosaic , middle-aged woman ?
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 25]: Even as the thought passed through the girl 's mind the door of the bedroom opened , and Mrs Gifford appeared on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 37]: She wore a large shady hat , and in the dim light of the room her face was not clearly visible , but there was a tone in her voice which aroused Claire 's instant curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 19]: Mother was trying to speak in her ordinary voice , but she was nervous , she was agitated .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 8]: She was not feeling ordinary at all .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 17]: `` Claire , _ cherie _ , we are going to the forest to have tea .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 15]: It is impossibly hot indoors , but it will be delightful under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 19]: Mr Judge has sent for a _ fiacre _ , and Miss Benson has asked to come too .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 10]: Put on your blue muslin and your big hat .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 5]: Be quick , darling !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 7]: I 'll fasten you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 12]: `` I 'd rather not go , thank you , mother .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 6]: I 'm quite happy here .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 7]: Do n't trouble about me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 6]: Mrs Gifford was obviously discomposed .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 31]: She hesitated , frowned , walked restlessly up and down , then spoke again with an added note of insistence -- `` But I want you to come , Claire .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 24]: I 've not troubled you before , because I saw you wanted to be alone , but -- it ca n't go on .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 7]: Mr Judge wants you to come .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 12]: He suggested the drive because he thought it would tempt you .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 12]: If you refuse to-day , he will ask you again to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 11]: I think , dear , you ought to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 4]: Claire was silent .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 33]: She felt sick and faint ; all over her body little pulses seemed to be whizzing like so many alarm clocks , all crying in insistent voices , `` Time 's up !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 4]: Time 's up !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 4]: No more lazing .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 10]: Up with you , and do your duty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 31]: Her forehead felt very damp and her throat felt very dry , and she heard a sharp disagreeable voice saying curtly -- `` Oh , certainly , I will come .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 7]: No need to make a fuss .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 8]: I can dress myself , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 10]: I 'll come down when I 'm ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 31]: Mrs Gifford turned without a word and went out of the room , but Claire was too busy being sorry for herself to have sympathy to spare for anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 64]: She threw off her wrapper and slipped into the cool muslin dress which was at once so simple , and so essentially French and up-to - date , and then , throwing open the door of a cupboard , stared at a long row of hats ranged on a top shelf , and deliberately selected the one which she considered the least becoming .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 14]: `` I will _ not _ be decked up for the sacrifice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 24]: she muttered rebelliously , then bent forward , so that her face approached close to the flushed , frowning reflection in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 13]: `` You are going to be proposed to , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 4]: she said scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 18]: `` You are going to be good and sensible , and say ` Yes , please ! '
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 11]: When you see yourself next , you will be Engaged !
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 22]: It wo n't be dear little Claire Gifford any more , it will be the horrible future Mrs Robert Judge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 96]: She stuck hat-pins through the straw hat with savage energy ; for once in her life noticed with distinct satisfaction that it was secured at an unbecoming angle , then , hearing through the _ jalousies _ the sound of approaching wheels , marched resolutely forth to meet her fate ... In the _ fiacre _ Mrs Gifford and Miss Benson took the seats of honour , leaving Claire and Mr Judge to sit side by side , and the one furtive glance which she cast in his direction showed him looking confident and unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 23]: Just like a French _ pretendu _ , already assured by Maman that Mademoiselle was meekly waiting to assent to his suit !
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 14]: `` He might at least pay me the compliment of _ pretending _ !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 16]: It is dreadfully dull to be taken for granted , '' reflected Claire in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 8]: The next hour was a horrible experience .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 18]: Everything happened exactly as Claire had known it would , from the moment the quartette set forth .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 32]: Arrived at the forest , they took possession of one of the little tables beneath the trees , and made fitful conversation the while they consumed delicious cakes and execrable tea .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 34]: Then the meal being finished , Mrs Gifford and her companion announced a wish to sit still and rest , while Mr Judge nervously invited Miss Claire to accompany him in a walk .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 15]: She assented , of course ; what was the use of putting it off ?
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 22]: and as soon as they were well started , he spied another seat , and insisted upon sitting down once more .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 11]: `` Now he 'll begin , '' thought Claire desperately .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 41]: `` He 'll talk about India , and being lonely , and say how happy he has felt since he 's been here , '' and even as the thought passed through her mind , Mr Judge began to speak .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 15]: `` Awfully jolly old forest this is -- awfully nice place Brussels , altogether .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 6]: Nicest place in the world .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 15]: Never been so happy in my life as I 've been the last month .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 30]: Of course , naturally , you must realise that , when a fellow hangs on week after week , there -- er , there must be some special attraction .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 15]: Not that it is n't a rattling old city , and all that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 27]: Mr Judge was growing a little mixed : his voice sounded flurried and nervous , but Claire was not in the least inclined to help him .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 11]: She sat rigid as a poker , staring stolidly ahead .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 14]: There was not the ghost of a dimple in her soft pink cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 30]: `` I -- er , your mother tells me that she has said nothing to you , but she is sure , all the same , that you suspect .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 11]: I asked her to let me speak to you to-day .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: Naturally she feels the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 6]: She is devoted to you .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 7]: You know that , of course .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 14]: I have told her that I will make your happiness my special charge .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 14]: There is nothing in the world I would not do to ensure it .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 12]: You know that too , do n't you , Claire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 23]: He stretched out his hand and touched her tentatively on the arm , but Claire drew herself back with a prickly dignity .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 26]: If he wanted to propose at all , he must propose properly ; she was not going to commit herself in response to an insinuation .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 6]: `` You are very kind .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 9]: I am quite happy as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 32]: `` Er -- yes -- yes , of course , but -- but things do n't go on , you know , ca n't go on always without a change ! ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 26]: Mr Judge took off his straw hat , twirled it nervously to and fro , and laid it down on the bench by his side .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 27]: Claire , casting a quick glance , noticed that his hair was growing noticeably thin on the temples , and felt an additional sinking of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 4]: `` Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 15]: cried the man desperately , `` do n't let us beat about the bush .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 19]: I 'm not used to this sort of thing -- do n't make it harder than you need !
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 10]: You _ have _ noticed , have n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 10]: You know what I want to tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 4]: Claire nodded dumbly .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 35]: In the case of previous Belgian admirers affairs had been checked before they reached the extreme stage , and she found this , her first spoken proposal much less exciting than she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 51]: As a friend pure and simple , she had thoroughly liked Mr Judge , and at the bottom of her heart there lived a lingering hope that perhaps if he loved her very much , and expressed his devotion in very eloquent words , her heart might soften in response .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 10]: But so far he had not even mentioned love !
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 20]: She was silent for several minutes , and when she did speak it was to ask a side question .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 10]: `` Is mother willing to go to India ? ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 25]: She was looking at the man as she spoke , and the change which passed over his face , startled her by its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 16]: His eyes shone , the rugged features were transfigured by a very radiance of joy .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 15]: He looked young at that moment , young and handsome , and blissfully content .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 12]: Claire stared at him in amazement , not unmingled with irritation .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 17]: Even if mother _ were _ willing , her own consent had still to be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: It was tactless to make so sure !
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 22]: Her own face looked decidedly sulky as she twitched round on her seat , and resumed her stolid staring into space .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 42]: Again there was silence , till a hand stretched out to clasp her arm , and a voice spoke in deep appealing accents -- `` Claire , dear child , you are young ; you have never known loneliness or disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 3]: We have !
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 16]: Happiness is fifty times more precious , when it comes to those who have suffered .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 11]: You would not be cruel enough to damp our happiness !
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 21]: You _ can _ do it , you know , if you persist in an attitude of coldness and disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 9]: I do n't say you can destroy it .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 3]: Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 13]: it goes too deep for anyone to be able to do that .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: But you can rub off the bloom .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 7]: Do n't do it , Claire !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 3]: Be generous .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 3]: Be yourself .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 6]: Wish us good luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 8]: `` Wish _ who _ good luck ?
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 11]: What , oh , what are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 12]: Claire was gasping now , quivering with a frenzy of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 14]: Robert Judge stared in return , his face full of an honest bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 8]: `` Of our engagement , of course .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 7]: Your mother 's engagement to me .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 11]: I have been talking about it all the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 17]: Then Claire threw up both her hands , and burst into a wild peal of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 70]: Peal after peal rang out into the air , she rocked to and fro on her seat , her eyes disappeared from view , her teeth shone , her little feet in their dainty French shoes danced upon the ground ; she laughed till the tears poured down her cheeks , and her gloved hands pressed against her side where a `` stitch '' was uncomfortably making itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 44]: Stout Belgian couples passing past the end of the avenue , looked on with indulgent smiles , a little shocked at so much demonstration in public , but relieved to perceive that _ une Anglaise _ could laugh with such _ abandon _ .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 7]: Monsieur they observed looked not sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 12]: Monsieur had an air injured , annoyed , on his dignity .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 12]: On his cheeks was a flush , as of wounded pride .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 17]: When at length the paroxysm showed signs of lessening , he spoke in cold stilted tones .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 8]: `` You appear to find it ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 8]: It seems to amuse you very much .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 13]: I may say that to us it is a serious matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 13]: You do n't understand -- you _ do n't _ understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 4]: gasped Claire feebly .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 8]: `` I am not laughing at you .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 6]: I 'm laughing at myself .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 18]: Oh , Mr Judge , you 'll never guess , it 's too screamingly funny for words .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 20]: I thought all this time , from the very beginning I thought , it was _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 28]: `` You thought it was -- you thought I wanted -- that I was talking of -- that I meant to propose to -- '' `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 2]: Me !
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 2]: Me !
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 2]: Me !
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 5]: Of course I did .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 8]: I 've been thinking it for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 4]: Everyone thought so .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 7]: They 've teased me to death .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 11]: You were attentive to me , you know you were .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 15]: You were always giving me things ... '' `` Well , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 9]: Poor Mr Judge defended himself with honest indignation .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 7]: `` What else could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 10]: I could not give them to _ her _ !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 15]: And I wanted -- naturally I wanted , to get you on my side .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 5]: You were the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 31]: I knew that if she had only herself to consider I could win her round , but if you ranged yourself against me , it would be a hard fight .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 7]: Naturally I tried to ingratiate myself .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 31]: It appears that I have rather overdone the part , but I ca n't flatter myself , '' his eyes twinkled mischievously , `` that I 've been too successful !
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 10]: You do n't appear exactly overcome with disappointment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 10]: They laughed together , but only for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 13]: Then he was serious again , appealing to her in earnest tones .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 11]: `` You wo n't range yourself against me , Claire ?
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 6]: You wo n't dissuade her .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 16]: -- I love her very dearly , and I know I can make her happy .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 10]: You wo n't make it hard for us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 7]: `` Indeed , I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 5]: Why should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 4]: Claire cried heartily .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 7]: `` I 'm only too thankful .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 19]: Mother needs someone to look after her , and I 'd sooner you did it than anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 38]: I like you awfully -- always did , until I began to be afraid -- I did n't want to marry you myself , but if mother does , I think it 's a splendid thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 12]: `` Thank you , dear , thank you a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 9]: That 's a _ great _ relief . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 11]: Robert Judge stretched himself with a deep breath of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 13]: Then he grew confidential , reviewing the past with true lover-like enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 15]: `` I fell in love with her that first afternoon at the tennis club .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 28]: Thought Bridges introduced her as Miss Gifford , put her down at twenty - five , and hoped she would n't think me a hopeless old fogey .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 14]: Never had such a surprise in my life as when she introduced you .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 12]: Thought for a time I should have to give it up .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 29]: Then she asked my advice on one or two business matters , and I discovered -- '' He hesitated , flushing uncomfortably , and Claire finished the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 13]: `` That we are coming to the end of our resources ? ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 4]: Mr Judge nodded .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 17]: `` And so , of course , '' he continued simply , `` that settled it .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 13]: I could n't go away and leave her to face a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 15]: I was jolly thankful to feel that I had met her in time . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 11]: `` I think you are a dear , good man .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: I think mother is very lucky .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 10]: Thank you so much for being my step-papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 36]: cried Claire , her grey eyes softening with a charming friendliness as they dwelt on the man 's honest face , and he took her hand in his , and squeezed it with affectionate ardour .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 7]: `` Thank you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 5]: Thank _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 12]: I shall be jolly proud of having such a pretty daughter .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 28]: I 'm not a rich man , but I am comfortably well - off , and I 'll do my best to give you a good time .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 11]: Your mother feels sure she will enjoy the Indian life .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 7]: Most girls think it great fun .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 10]: And of course I have lots of friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 13]: Claire stared at him , a new seriousness dawning in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 17]: She looked very pretty and very young , and not a little pathetic into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 28]: For the first time since the realisation of her mistake the personal application of the situation burst upon her , and a chill crept through her veins .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 43]: If she herself had married Robert Judge , her mother would have made her home with them as a matter of course ; but it was by no means a matter of course that she should make her home with her mother .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 43]: She stared into the honest face of the man before her -- the man who was not rich , the man who was in love for the first time in his life , and a smile twisted the corner of her lips .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 23]: `` Mr Judge , if I ask you a question , will you promise to give me an absolutely honest answer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 7]: `` Yes , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 22]: `` Well , then , will you _ like _ having a third person living with you all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 11]: Up to the man 's forehead rushed the treacherous blood .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 27]: He frowned , he scowled , he opened his lips to protest ; but that flush had answered for him , and Claire refused to listen .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 8]: `` No , no -- do n't !
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 6]: Of course you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 7]: Who would , in your place ?
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 7]: Poor darlings -- I quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 28]: You _ are _ middle-aged , you know , though you feel about nineteen , and mother is prettier and more charming than half the girl brides .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 41]: And you will want to be just as young and foolish as you like , not to be _ obliged _ to be sensible because a grown-up daughter is there all the time , staring at you with big eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 46]: I should be in the way , and I should _ feel _ in the way , and -- '' Mr Judge interrupted in an urgent voice : `` Look here , Claire , I do n't think you ought to corner me like this .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 5]: It 's not fair .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 15]: I 've told you that I am prepared to do everything for your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 36]: You ought surely to realise that I -- '' `` And _ you _ ought to realise that I -- '' Claire broke off suddenly , and held out her hand with a charming smile .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 18]: `` Oh , but there 's plenty of time -- we can arrange all that later on .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 14]: Let 's go and find mother and put her out of her misery .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 11]: She will be longing to see us come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 31]: They walked down the avenue together , and , as they went , Claire turned her head from side to side , taking in the well-known scene with wistful intensity .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 9]: How many times would she see it again ?
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 29]: As she had said , many discussions would certainly take place as to her future destination , but she knew in her heart that the result was sure .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 6]: Providence had decided or her .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 7]: The future was London and work !
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 5]: MRS. GIFFORD IS MARRIED .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 33]: Claire lost no time in writing to Miss Farnborough to apply for the post of French mistress if it were still vacant , and by return of post received a cordial reply .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 52]: Several applications had been received , but no appointment had been made , and the Head was pleased to confirm her previous offer of a commencing salary of a hundred and ten pounds , and would expect Miss Gifford to take up her duties at the beginning of the autumn term .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 39]: She congratulated her on her decision , and felt sure she would never regret devoting her life to so interesting and valuable a work , instead of being content to waste it in the pursuit of idle pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 13]: Poor Claire looked a little dubious as she read those last words .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 32]: The pursuit of pleasure does not as a rule begin to pall at twenty-one ; and the old life looked very sweet and pleasant viewed from the new standpoint of change .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 27]: She put on a bright face , however , and sternly repressed all signs of depression in discussing the matter with her mother and Mr Judge .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 25]: Her determination evoked the expected opposition , but slowly and surely the opposition decreased , and her arguments were listened to with increasing respect .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 49]: The lovers were sincerely desirous of securing the girl 's happiness , but middle-aged though they were , they were deeply in love , and felt a natural desire to begin their married life without the presence of a third person , however dear that person might be .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 16]: Mr Judge applauded Claire 's spirit , and prophesied her rapid success as a teacher .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 28]: Mrs Gifford murmured sweetly , `` And if you _ do n't _ like it , dear , you can always come out by the next boat .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 6]: Try it for a year .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 16]: It will be quite an amusing experience to live the life of a bachelor girl .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 16]: And , of course , in a year or two we 'll be coming home .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 10]: Then you must spend the whole leave with us .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 8]: We 'll see , wo n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 14]: We wo n't make any plans , but just be guided by circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 29]: If you want somewhere to go in the holidays , there 's my old Aunt Mary in Preston , but you 'd be bored to sobs , darling .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 29]: No doubt Miss Farnborough will introduce you to lots of nice people in London , and you will have all the fifteen other mistresses to take you about .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 8]: I expect you 'll be quite gay !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 23]: ... Claire , darling , _ would _ you have gold tissue under this ninon , or just a handsome lace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 9]: For the next few weeks things moved quickly .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 36]: In answer to inquiries about lodgings , Miss Farnborough wrote a second time to say that Miss Rhodes , the English mistress , had comfortable rooms which she was sharing with the present French teacher .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 27]: She was willing to continue the arrangement , and , as a stranger in town , Claire would doubtless find it agreeable as well as economical .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 41]: The letter was entirely business - like and formal , and , as such , a trifle chilling to Claire , for Miss Farnborough had been so warm in her spoken invitation that Claire had expected a more cordial welcome .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 14]: Could it be that the shadow of officialdom was already making itself felt ?
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 35]: The next few weeks were given up to trousseau-hunting and farewell visits , and no girl could have shown a livelier interest in the selection of pretty things than did this bride of thirty-nine .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 53]: Claire came in for a charming costume to wear at the wedding , and for the rest , what fitted her mother fitted herself , and as Mrs Gifford said sweetly , `` It would be a sin to waste all my nice things , but they 're quite unsuitable for India .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 44]: Just use them out , darling , for a month or two , and then get what you need , '' an arrangement which seemed sensible enough , if one could only be sure of money to supply that need when it arose !
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 26]: The day before her marriage Mrs Gifford thrust an envelope into her daughter 's hand , blushing the while with an expression of real distress .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 14]: `` I 'm so sorry , darling , that it 's so little .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 13]: I 've tried to be careful , but the money has flown .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 19]: Going out to India one needs so many clothes , and there were quite a number of bills .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 18]: I 'll send more by and by , and remember always to say if you run short .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 11]: I want you to have plenty for all you need .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 25]: With what you have , this will see you nicely through your first term , and after that you 'll be quite rich . ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 18]: Claire kissed her , and was careful not to look at the cheque until she was alone .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 21]: She had counted on at least a hundred to put in the bank as a refuge against a rainy day .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 42]: Surely at this parting of the ways mother would wish her to have this security ; but when she looked at her cheque , it was to discover that it was made out for fifty pounds -- only half that sum .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 21]: Claire felt sore at that moment , and for the first time a chill of fear entered into her anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 14]: Fifty pounds seemed a dreadfully small sum to stand between herself and want .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 19]: A hundred might be only twice its value , but its three figures sounded so much more substantial .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 49]: She struggled hard to allow no signs of resentment to be seen , and felt that virtue was rewarded , when late that evening Mr Judge presented her with yet another envelope , saying awkwardly -- `` That 's -- er -- that 's the bridesmaid 's present .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 9]: Thought you 'd like to choose for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 20]: Something to do , you know , some fine half-holiday , to go out and look in the shops .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 13]: I 've no views -- do n't get jewellery unless you wish .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 13]: Just -- er -- ` blew it ' your own way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 50]: Claire kissed him , and remarked that he was a sweet old dear ; and this time the opening of the envelope brought a surprise of an agreeable nature , for this cheque also was for fifty pounds , so that the desired hundred was really in her possession .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 5]: No jewellery for her !
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 43]: Into the bank the money should go -- every penny of it , and her bridesmaid present should be represented by peace of mind , which , after the financial shock of the last month , seemed more precious than many rubies .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 51]: Mr and Mrs Judge were married at the Embassy , and afterwards at an English church , the bride looking her most charming self in a costume of diaphanous chiffon and lace and the most fascinating of French hats , and the bridegroom his worst in his stiff conventional garments .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 36]: They were a very radiant couple , however , and the _ dejeuner _ held after the ceremony at the `` Hotel Britannique '' was a cheerful occasion , despite the parting which lay ahead .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 80]: The gathering was quite a large one , for Mr Judge had insisted upon inviting all the friends who had been kind to his _ fiancee _ and her daughter during their three years ' sojourn in the city , while the _ pensionnaires _ at `` Villa Beau Sejour '' came _ en masse _ , headed by Madame herself , in a new black silk costume , her white transformation elaborately waved and curled for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 9]: There were speeches , and there were toasts .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 43]: There were kindly words of farewell and cheerful anticipations of future meetings , there were good wishes for the bride and bridegroom , and more good wishes for the bridesmaid , and many protestations that it was `` her turn next . ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 9]: Then the bride retired to change her dress .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 33]: Claire went with her , and tried valiantly not to cry as she fastened buttons and hooks , and realised how long it might be before she next waited on her mother .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 27]: Mrs Judge was tearful , too , and the two knew a bitter moment as they clung together for the real farewell before rejoining the guests .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 14]: `` I 've been careless ; I 've made a mess of things .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 36]: I 've not been half as thoughtful as I should have been , '' sobbed the bride , `` but I _ have _ loved you , Claire , and this will make no difference !
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 9]: I shall love you just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 13]: Claire flushed and nodded , but could not trust herself to speak .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 24]: The love of a mother in far-off India could never be the same as the love of the dear companion of every day .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 53]: But she was too generous to add to her mother 's distress by refusing to be comforted , and the bride nervously powdered her eyes , and re-arranged her veil before descending to the hall , anxious as ever to shelve a painful subject , and turn her face to the sun .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 27]: Five minutes later Mr and Mrs Judge drove away from the door , and the girl who was left behind turned slowly to re-enter the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 26]: It was very big , and fine , and spacious , but at that moment it was a type of desolation in Claire 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 15]: With a sickening wave of loneliness she realised that she was motherless and alone !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 6]: A FELLOW TRAVELLER INTRODUCES HERSELF .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 11]: The next afternoon Claire started on her journey to London .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 22]: She had spent the night with friends , and been seen off at the station by quite a crowd of well-wishers .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 26]: Little souvenirs had been showered upon her all the morning , and everyone had a kindly word , and a hopeful prophecy of the future .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 64]: There were invitations also , and promises to look her up in her London home , and a perfect shower of violets thrown into the carriage as the train steamed out of the station , and Claire laughed and waved her hand , and looked so complacent and beaming that no one looking on could have guessed the real nature of her journey .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 40]: She was not pretending to be cheerful , she _ was _ cheerful , for , the dreaded parting once over , her optimistic nature had asserted itself , and painted the life ahead in its old rosy colours .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 24]: Mother was happy and secured from want ; she herself was about to enjoy a longed-for taste for independence ; then why grumble ?
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 23]: asked Claire sensibly of herself , and anything less grumbling than her appearance at that moment it would be hard to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 63]: She was beautifully dressed , in the simplest but most becoming of travelling costumes , she was agreeably conscious that the onlookers to her send-off had been unanimously admiring in their regard , and , as she stood arranging her bags on the rack overhead , she saw her own face in the strip of mirror and whole-heartedly agreed in their verdict .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad I 'm pretty !
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 8]: It 's a comfort to be pretty .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 15]: I should grow so tired of being with myself if I were plain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 25]: she reflected complacently as she settled herself in her corner , and flicked a few grains of dust from the front of her skirt .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 32]: She had taken a through first-class ticket from sheer force of habit , for Mrs Gifford had always travelled first , and the ways of economy take some time to acquire .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 46]: In the opposite corner of the carriage sat an elderly woman , obviously English , obviously also of the _ grande dame _ species , with aquiline features , white hair dressed pompadour fashion , and an expression compounded of indifference and quizzical good humour .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 36]: The good humour was in the ascendant as she watched the kindly Belgians crowd round her fellow-passenger , envelop her in their arms , murmur tearful farewells , and kiss her soundly on either cheek .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 31]: The finely marked eyebrows lifted themselves as if in commiseration for the victim , and as the door closed on the last farewell she heaved an involuntary sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 40]: It was evident that the scene appealed to her entirely from the one standpoint ; she saw nothing touching about it , nothing pathetic ; she was simply amused , and carelessly scornful of eccentricities in manner or appearance .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 30]: On the seat beside this imposing personage sat a young woman in black , bearing the hall mark of lady 's maid written all over her in capital letters .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 26]: She sat stiffly in her seat , one gloved hand on her knee , the other clasped tightly round the handle of a crocodile dressing-bag .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 86]: Claire felt a passing interest in the pair ; reflected that if it were her lot in life to be a maid , she would choose to live on the Continent , where an affectionate intimacy takes the place of this frigid separation , and then , being young and self-engrossed , promptly forgot all about them , and fell to building castles in the air , in which she herself lived in every circumstance of affluence and plenty , beloved and admired of all .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 31]: There was naturally a prince in the story , a veritable Prince Charming , who was all that the most exacting mind could desire , but the image was vague .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 9]: Claire 's heart had not yet been touched .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 14]: She was still in ignorance as to what manner of man she desired .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 18]: Engaged in these pleasant day-dreams Antwerp was reached before Claire realised that half the distance was covered .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 17]: On the quay the wind blew chill ; on the boat itself it blew chillier still .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 31]: Claire became aware that she was in for a stormy crossing , but was little perturbed by the fact , since she knew herself to be an unusually good sailor .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 37]: She tipped the stewardess to fill a hot bottle , put on a cosy dressing-jacket , and lay down in her berth , quite ready for sleep after the fatigue and excitement of the past week .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 46]: In five minutes the ship and all that was in it was lost in dreams , and , so far as Claire was concerned , it might have been but another five minutes before the stewardess aroused her to announce the arrival at Parkeston Pier .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 20]: The first glance around proved , however , that the other passengers had found the time all too long .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 34]: The signs of a bad crossing were written large on the faces of her companions , and there was a trace of resentment in the manner in which they surveyed her active movements .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 36]: An old lady in a bunk immediately opposite her own seemed especially injured , and did not hesitate to put her feelings into words , '' _ You _ have had a good enough night !
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 29]: I believe you slept right through ... Are you aware that the rest of us have been more ill than we 've ever been in our lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 6]: she asked in accusing tones .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 31]: And Claire laughed her happy , gurgling little laugh , and said -- `` I 'm _ so _ sorry , but it 's all over , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 11]: And people always say that they feel better afterwards ! ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 5]: The old lady grunted .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 32]: She certainly looked thoroughly ill and wretched at the moment , her face drawn and yellow beneath her scanty locks , and her whole appearance expressive of an extremity of fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 37]: It seemed to her that it was years since she had left the quay at Antwerp , and here was this young thing as blooming as though she had spent the night in her own bed !
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 22]: She hitched a shawl more closely over her shoulders , and called aloud in a high imperious tone -- `` Mason !
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 2]: Mason !
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 10]: You must really rouse yourself and attend to me .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 10]: We shall have to land in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 11]: Get up at once and bring me my things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 22]: The covering of another bunk stirred feebly , and two feet encased in black merino stockings descended slowly to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 39]: A moment later a ghastly figure was tottering across the floor , lifting from a box a beautifully waved white wig , and dropping it carefully over the head of the aggrieved old lady of the straggly locks .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 61]: It was all that Claire could do to keep from exclaiming aloud , as it burst upon her astonished senses that this poor , huddled creature was none other than the _ grande dame _ of the railway carriage , the haughtily indifferent , cynically amused personage who had seemed so supremely superior to the agitations of the common ruck !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 17]: Strange what changes a few hours ' conflict with the forces of Nature could bring about !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 32]: Ill as the mistress was , the maid was even worse , and it was pitiful to see the poor creature 's efforts to obey the exigent demands of her employer .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 25]: In the end faintness overcame her , and if Claire had not rushed to the rescue , she would have fallen on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 9]: `` It 's no use struggling against it !
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 9]: You must keep still until the boat stops .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 18]: You 'll feel better at once when we land , and you get into the air . ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 34]: Claire laid the poor soul in her bunk , and turned back to the old lady who was momentarily growing younger and more formidable , as she continued the stages of her toilette .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 7]: `` Can I help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 13]: she asked smilingly , and the offer was accepted with gracious composure .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 4]: `` Please do .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 5]: I should be grateful .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 14]: That hook fastens over here , and the band crosses to this side .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 23]: The brooch is in my bag -- a gold band with some diamonds -- and the hat-pins , and a clean handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 4]: Can you manage ?
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 7]: ... The clasp slides back . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 28]: Claire opened the bag and gazed with admiration at a brown _ moire _ antique lining , and fittings of tortoiseshell , bearing raised monograms in gold .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: `` I shall have one exactly to match , when I marry my duke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 23]: was the mental reflection , as she selected the articles mentioned and put the final touches to the good lady 's costume .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 55]: Later on there was Mason to be dressed ; later on still , Claire found herself carrying the precious dressing-bag in one hand , and supporting one invalid with the other , while Mason tottered in the wake , unable for the moment to support any other burden than that of her own body .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 29]: Mrs Fanshawe -- Claire had discovered the name on a printed card let into the lining of the bag -- had no sympathy to spare for poor Mason .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 70]: She plainly considered it the height of bad manners for a maid to dare to be sea-sick ; but being unused to do anything for herself , gratefully allowed Claire to lead the way , reply to the queries of custom-house officials , secure a corner of a first-class compartment of the waiting train , and bid an attendant bring a cup of tea before the ordinary breakfast began .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 27]: Mason refused any refreshment , but Mrs Fanshawe momentarily regained her vigour , and was all that was gracious in her acknowledgment of Claire 's help .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 32]: The quizzical eyes roved over the girl 's face and figure , and evidently approved what they saw , and Claire , smiling back , was conscious of an answering attraction .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 32]: Thoughtless and domineering as was her behaviour to her inferior , there was yet something in the old lady 's personality which struck an answering chord in the girl 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 23]: She was enough of a physiognomist to divine the presence of humour and generosity , combined with a persistent cheerfulness of outlook .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 20]: The signs of physical age were unmistakable , but the spirit within was young , young as her own !
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 18]: The mutual scrutiny ended in a mutual laugh , which was the last breaking of the ice .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 17]: `` My dear , '' cried Mrs Fanshawe , `` you must excuse my bad manners !
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 21]: You are so refreshing to look at after all those horrors on the boat that I ca n't help staring .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 7]: And you 've been so kind !
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 13]: Positively I do n't know how I should have survived without you .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 7]: Will you tell me your name ?
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 16]: I should like to know to whom I am indebted for so much help . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 8]: `` My name is Claire Gifford . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 6]: `` Er -- yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 8]: Plainly Mrs Fanshawe felt the information insufficient .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 3]: `` Gifford !
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 5]: I knew some Giffords .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 9]: Do you belong to the Worcestershire branch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 11]: Claire hitched her shoulders in the true French shrug . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 5]: _ Sais pas _ !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 23]: I have no English relations nearer than second cousins , and we have lived abroad so much that we are practically strangers .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 9]: My father died when I was a child .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 24]: I went to school in Paris , and for the last few years my mother and I have made our headquarters in Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 16]: She married again , only yesterday , and is going to live in Bombay . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 6]: Mrs Fanshawe arched surprised brows .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 8]: `` And you are staying behind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 6]: They asked me to go .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 6]: Mr Judge is very kind .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 9]: He is my -- er -- stepfather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 10]: Claire shrugged again at the strangeness of that word .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: `` He gave me the warmest of invitations , but I refused .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 7]: I preferred to be left . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 26]: Mrs Fanshawe hitched herself into her corner , planted her feet more firmly on the provisionary footstool , and folded her hands on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 30]: She had the air of a person settling down to the enjoyment of a favourite amusement , and indeed her curiosity was a quality well-known to all her acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 24]: she asked boldly , and such was the force of her personality that Claire never dreamt for a moment of refusing to reply .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 9]: `` Because I want to be independent . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 9]: Mrs Fanshawe rolled her eyes to the hat-rail .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 6]: `` My dear , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 6]: You 're far too pretty .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 19]: Leave that to the poor creatures who have no chance of finding other people to work for them .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 13]: You should change your mind , you know , you really should .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 13]: India 's quite an agreeable place to put in a few years .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 21]: The English girl is a trifle overdone , but with your complexion you would be bound to have a success .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 4]: Think it over !
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 13]: Do n't be in a hurry to let the chance slip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 7]: `` It _ has _ slipped .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 18]: They sail from Marseilles a week from to-day , and besides I do n't want to change .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 13]: I like the prospect of independence better even than being admired . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 9]: `` Though you like that , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 4]: Who does n't ?
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 16]: I 'm hoping -- with good luck -- to be admired in England instead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 9]: `` Then you must n't be independent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 6]: Mrs Fanshawe said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 34]: `` It was the rage a year or two ago ; girls had a craze for joining Settlements , and running about in the slums , but it 's quite out of date .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 5]: Hobble skirts killed it .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 26]: It 's impossible to be utilitarian in a hobble skirt ... And how do you propose to show your independence , may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 38]: `` I am going to be French mistress in a High School , '' Claire said sturdily , and hated herself because she winced before the eloquent change of expression which passed over her companion 's face .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 9]: Mrs Fanshawe said , `` Oh , really !
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 7]: How _ very _ interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 14]: and looked about as uninterested the while as a human creature could be .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 44]: In the pause which followed it was obvious that she was readjusting the first impression of a young gentlewoman belonging to her own leisured class , and preparing herself to cross-question an entirely different person -- an ordinary teacher in a High School !
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 42]: There was a touch of patronage in her manner , but it was still quite agreeable Mrs Fanshawe was always agreeable for choice : she found it the best policy , and her indolent nature shrank from disagreeables of every kind .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 23]: This pretty girl had made herself quite useful , and a chat with her would enliven a dull hour in the train .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 11]: Curiosity shifted its point , but remained actively in force .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 8]: `` Tell me all about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 4]: she said suavely .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 7]: `` I know nothing about teachers .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 6]: Shocking , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 6]: They alarm me too much .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 8]: I have a horror of clever women .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 8]: You do n't look at all clever .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 25]: I mean that as a compliment -- far too pretty and smart , but I suppose you are dreadfully learned , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 8]: What are you going to teach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 3]: `` French .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 19]: I am almost as good as a Frenchwoman , for I 've talked little else for sixteen years .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 16]: Mother and I spoke English together , or I should have forgotten my own language .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 26]: It seems , from a scholastic point of view , that it 's a useful blend to possess -- perfect French and an English temperament .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 12]: ` Mademoiselle ' is not always a model of patience ! ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 8]: `` And you think you will be ?
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 4]: I prophesy differently .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 19]: You 'll throw the whole thing up in six months , and fly off to mamma in India .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 23]: You have n't the least idea what you are in for , but you 'll find out , you 'll find out !
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 6]: Where is this precious school ?
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 7]: In town , did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 11]: Shall you live in the house or with friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 24]: `` I have no friends in London except Miss Farnborough , the head mistress , but there are fifteen other mistresses besides myself .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 7]: That will be fifteen friends ready-made .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 21]: I am going to share lodgings with one of them , and be a bachelor girl on my own account .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 7]: I 'm so excited about it .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 29]: After living in countries where a girl ca n't go to the pillar-box alone , it will be thrilling to be free to do just as I like .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 6]: Please do n't pity me !
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 9]: I 'm going to have great fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 17]: Mrs Fanshawe hitched herself still further into her corner and smiled a lazy , quizzical smile .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 13]: `` Oh , I do n't pity you -- not one bit !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 24]: All young people nowadays think they are so much wiser than their parents ; it 's a wholesome lesson to learn their mistake .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 36]: You 're a silly , blind , ridiculous little girl , and if I 'd been your mother , I should have insisted upon taking you with me , whether you liked it or not .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 25]: I always wanted a daughter like you -- sons are so dull ; but perhaps it 's just as well that she never appeared .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 18]: She might have wanted to be independent , too , in which case we should have quarrelled .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 15]: -- So those fifteen school-mistresses make up your whole social circle , do they ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 21]: I would n't mind prophesying that you 'll never want to speak a word to them out of school hours !
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 20]: I have a friend living in town , quite a nice woman , with a daughter about your age .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 10]: Shall I ask her to send you a card ?
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 36]: It would be somewhere for you to go on free afternoons , and she entertains a good deal , and has a craze for the feminist movement , and for girls who work for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 9]: You might come in for some fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 22]: Claire 's flush of gratification made her look prettier than ever , and Mrs Fanshawe felt an agreeable glow of self-satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 44]: Nothing she liked better than to play the part of Lady Bountiful , especially when any effort involved was shifted onto the shoulders of another , and in her careless fashion she was really anxious to do this nice girl a good turn .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 49]: She made a note of Claire 's address in a dainty gold-edged pocket-book , expressed pleasure in the belief that through her friend she would hear reports of the girl 's progress , and presently shut her eyes , and dozed peacefully for the rest of the ride .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 24]: Round London a fine rain was falling , and the terminus looked bleak and cheerless as the train slowed down the long platform .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 51]: Mason , still haggard , roused herself to step to the platform and look around as if expecting to see a familiar face , and in the midst of collecting her own impedimenta Claire was conscious that Mrs Fanshawe was distinctly ruffled , when the familiar figure failed to appear .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 53]: Once more she found herself coming to the rescue , marshalling the combined baggage to the screened portion of the platform where the custom-house officials went through the formalities incidental to the occasion , while the tired passengers stood shiveringly on guard , looking bleached and grey after their night 's journey .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 30]: The bright-haired , bright-faced girl stood out in pleasant contrast to the rest , trim and smart and dainty as though such a thing as fatigue did not exist .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 32]: Mrs Fanshawe , looking at her , stopped short in the middle of a mental grumble , and turned it round , so that it ended in being a thanksgiving instead .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 29]: `` Most neglectful of Erskine to fail me after promising he would come ... Perhaps , after all , it 's just as well he did not . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 15]: And at that moment , with the usual contrariety of fate , Erskine appeared !
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 32]: He came striding along the platform , a big , loosely-built man , with a clean-shaven face , glancing to right and left over the upstanding collar of a tweed coat .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 33]: He looked at once plain and distinguished , and in the quizzical eyes and beetling eyebrows there was an unmistakable likeness to the _ grande dame _ standing by Claire 's side .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 40]: Just for a moment he paused , as he came in sight of the group of passengers , and Claire , meeting his glance , knew who he was , even before he came forward and made his greeting .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 5]: `` Holla , Mater !
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 5]: Sorry to be late .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 6]: Not my fault this time .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 14]: I was ready all right , but the car did not come round .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: Had a good crossing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 6]: `` My dear , appalling !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 6]: Do n't talk of it .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 16]: I was prostrate all night , and Mason too ill to do anything but moan .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 7]: She 's been no use . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 4]: `` Poor beggar !
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 5]: She looks pretty green .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 33]: But -- er -- '' The plain face lighted with an expectant smile as he turned towards the girl who stood by his mother 's side , still holding the precious bag .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 18]: `` You seem to have met a friend ... '' `` Oh -- er -- yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 20]: With a gesture of regal graciousness Mrs Fanshawe turned towards the girl , and held out her gloved hand .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 11]: `` Thank you _ so _ much , Miss Gifford !
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 7]: You 've been quite too kind .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 8]: I 'm really horribly in your debt .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 17]: I hope you will find everything as you like , and have a very good time .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 4]: Thank you again .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 4]: _ Good-bye _ .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 7]: I 'm really dropping with fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 12]: What a relief it will be to get to bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 14]: She turned aside , and laid her hand on her son 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 11]: `` Erskine , where _ is _ the car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 23]: Mother and son turned away , and made their way down the platform , leaving Claire with crimson cheeks and fast-beating heart .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 15]: The little scene which had just happened had been all too easy to understand .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 41]: The nice son had wished for an introduction to the nice girl who a moment before had seemed on such intimate terms with his mother : the mother had been quite determined that such an introduction should not take place .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 43]: Claire knew enough of the world to realise how different would have been the proceedings if she had announced herself as a member of the `` idle rich , '' bound for a course of visits to well-known houses in the country .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 10]: `` May I introduce my son , Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 13]: Miss Gifford has been an angel of goodness to me , Erskine .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 13]: Positively I do n't know what I should have done without her !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 13]: Do look after her now , and see her into a taxi .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 11]: Such a mercy to have a man to help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 42]: That was what would have happened to the Claire Gifford of a week before , but now for the first time Claire experienced a taste of the disagreeables attendant on her changed circumstances , and it was bitter to her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 96]: All very well to remind herself that work was honourable , that anyone who looked down on her for choosing to be independent was not worth a moment 's thought , the fact remained that for the first , the very first time in her life she had been made to feel that there was a barrier between herself and a member of her own class , and that , however willing Mrs Fanshawe might be to introduce her to a casual friend , she was unwilling to make her known to her own son !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 25]: Claire stood stiff and poker-like at her post , determined to make no movement until Mrs Fanshawe and her attendants had taken their departure .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 84]: The storm of indignation and wounded pride which was surging through her veins distracted her mind from her surroundings ; she was dimly conscious that one after another , her fellow-passengers had taken their departure , preceded by a porter trundling a truck of luggage ; conscious that where there had been a crowd , there was now a space , until eventually with a shock of surprise she discovered that she was standing alone , by her own little pile of boxes .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 26]: At that she shook herself impatiently , beckoned to a porter and was about to walk ahead , when an uneasy suspicion made itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 3]: The luggage !
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 4]: Something was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 12]: The pile looked smaller than it had done ten minutes before .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 12]: She made a rapid circuit , and made a horrible discovery .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 5]: A box was missing !
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 22]: The dress-box containing the skirts of all her best frocks , spread at full length and carefully padded with tissue paper .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 18]: It had been there ten minutes ago ; the custom-house officer had given it a special rap .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 11]: She distinctly remembered noticing a new scratch on the leather .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 14]: Where in the name of everything that was inexplicable could it have disappeared ?
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 10]: Appealed to for information the porter was not illuminating .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 15]: `` If it had been there before , why was n't it there now ?
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 11]: Was the lady _ sure _ she had seen it ?
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 10]: Might have been left behind at Antwerp or Parkeston .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 5]: Better telegraph and see !
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 14]: If it had been there before , why was n't it there now ?
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 4]: Mistakes did happen .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 5]: Boxes were much alike .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 8]: P'raps it was left in the van .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 22]: If it was there ten minutes before , why was n't it -- '' Claire stopped him with an imperious hand .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 5]: `` That 's enough !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 10]: It _ was _ there : I saw it .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 11]: I counted the pieces before the custom-house officer came along .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 5]: I noticed it especially .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 9]: Someone must have taken it by mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 7]: The porter shook his head darkly .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 7]: `` On purpose , more like !
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 7]: Funny people crosses by this route .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 17]: Funny thing that you did n't notice -- '' Claire found nothing funny in the reflection .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 21]: She was furious with herself for her carelessness , and still more furious with Mrs Fanshawe as the cause thereof .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 28]: Down the platform she stalked , a picture of vivid impetuous youth , head thrown back , cheeks aflame , grey eyes sending out flashes of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 28]: Every porter who came in her way was stopped and imperiously questioned as to his late load , every porter was in his turn waved impatiently away .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 6]: Claire was growing seriously alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 6]: Suppose the box was lost !
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 23]: It would be as bad as losing _ two _ boxes , for of what use were bodices minus skirts to match ?
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 20]: Never again would she be guilty of the folly of packing bits of the same costumes in different boxes .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 18]: How awful -- how awful beyond words to arrive in London without a decent dress to wear !
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 33]: Whirling suddenly round to pursue yet another porter , Claire became aware of a figure in a long tweed coat standing on the space beside the taxi-stand , intently watching her movements .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 32]: She recognised him in a moment as none other than `` Erskine '' himself , who , having seen his mother into her car , was presumably bound for another destination .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 7]: But why was he standing there ?
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 10]: Why had he been so long in moving away ?
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 61]: Claire hastily averted her eyes , but as she cross-questioned porter number four , she was aware that the tall figure was drawing nearer , and presently he was standing by her side , taking off his hat , and saying in the most courteous and deferential of tones -- `` Excuse me -- I 'm afraid something is wrong !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 8]: Can I be of any assistance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 27]: Claire 's glance was frigid in its coldness ; but it was difficult to remain frigid in face of the man 's obvious sincerity and kindliness .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 9]: `` Thank you , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 6]: `` Please do n't trouble .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 6]: I can manage quite well .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 12]: It 's only a trunk ... '' `` Is it lost ?
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 7]: I say -- what a fag !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 5]: Do let me help .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 7]: I know this station by heart !
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 18]: If it is to be found , I am sure I can get it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 14]: This time there was a distinct air of appeal in his deep voice .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 24]: Claire divined that the nice man was anxious to atone for his mother 's cavalier behaviour , and her heart softened towards him .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 11]: After all , why should she punish herself by refusing ?
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 38]: Five minutes more or less on the station platform could make no difference one way or another , for at the end they would wish each other a polite adieu , and part never to meet again .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 9]: And she _ did _ want that box !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 31]: She smiled , and sighed , and looked delightfully pretty and appealing , as she said frankly -- `` Thank you , I _ should _ be grateful for suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 36]: It 's the most extraordinary and provoking thing -- '' They walked slowly down the platform while she explained the situation , and reiterated the fact that she had seen the box ten minutes before .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 34]: Erskine Fanshawe did not dispute the statement as each porter had done before him ; he contented himself with asking if there was any distinctive feature in the appearance of the box itself .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 5]: Claire shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 14]: `` The ordinary brown leather , with strappings and C.G. on one side .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 17]: Just like a thousand other boxes , but it had a label , beside the initials .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 14]: I do n't see how anyone can have taken it by mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 13]: She set her teeth , and her head took a defiant tilt .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 25]: `` There 's one comfort ; if it _ is _ stolen , whoever has taken it will not get much for her pains !
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 8]: There 's nothing in it but skirts .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 13]: Skirts wo n't be much good without the bodices to match ! ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 16]: The man looked down at her , his expression comically compounded of sympathy and humour .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 19]: At that moment , despite the irregularity of his features , he looked wonderfully like his handsome mother .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 6]: `` Er -- just so !
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 19]: Unfortunately , however , from the opposite point of view , you find yourself in the same position !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 19]: Bodices , I presume , without skirts -- '' Claire groaned , and held up a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 6]: I ca n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 5]: It 's really devastating .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 10]: My whole outfit -- at one fell sweep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 43]: `` Is n't it -- excuse my suggesting it -- rather a mistake to -- er -- divide pieces of the same garment , _ so _ that if one trunk should be lost , the loss practically extends to two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 7]: `` No , it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 14]: It 's the only sensible thing to do , '' Claire said obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 19]: `` Skirts must be packed at full length , and a dress-box is made for that very purpose .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 11]: All the same , I shall never do it again .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 18]: It 's no use being sensible if you have to contend with -- _ thieves _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 14]: `` I do n't think we need leap to that conclusion just yet .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 10]: You have only spoken to two or three porters .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 16]: We 'd better wait about a few minutes longer until the other men come back .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 40]: Very likely the box was put on a truck by accident , and if the mistake was discovered before it was put on the taxi , it would be sent back to see if its owner were waiting here .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 15]: If it does n't turn up at once , you must n't be discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 41]: The odds are ten to one that it 's only a mistake , and in that case when the taxi is unloaded , the box will be sent back to the lost luggage office , or forwarded to your address .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 13]: Was the full address on the box , by the way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 4]: Claire nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 13]: `` Oh , yes ; I have that poor satisfaction at least .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 37]: I was most methodical and prudent , but I do n't know that that 's going to be much consolation if I lose my nice frocks , and am too poor to buy any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 40]: The last phrase was prompted by a proud determination to sail under no false colours in the eyes of Mrs Fanshawe 's son ; but the picture evoked thereby was sufficiently tragic to bring a cloud over her face .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 38]: The memory of each separate gown rose before her , looking distractingly dainty and becoming ; she saw a vision of herself as she might have been , and faced a future bounded by eternal blue serge .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 26]: All the tragedy of the thought was in her air , and her companion cried quickly -- `` You wo n't need to buy them !
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 14]: They 'll turn up all right , I am quite sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 13]: The worst that can happen is a day or two 's delay .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 34]: After all , you know , there are thousands of honest folk to a single thief , and even a thief would probably prefer a small money reward to useless halves of dresses !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 14]: If you hear nothing by to-morrow , you might offer a reward . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 7]: `` Oh , I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 4]: Claire said gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 9]: `` Thank you for thinking of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 21]: No more porters having for the moment appeared in sight , they now turned , and slowly retraced their steps .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 44]: Claire , covertly regarding her companion , wondered why she felt convinced that he was a soldier ; Erskine Fanshawe in his turn covertly regarded Claire , and wondered why it was that she seemed different from any girl he had seen before .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 8]: Then tentatively he put a personal question .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 10]: `` Do you know London well , Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 24]: My mother told me you were -- er -- coming to settle -- '' `` Not at all well , as a whole .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 29]: I know the little bit around Regent Street , and the Park , and the places one sees in a week 's visit , but that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 12]: We never stayed long in town when we came to England .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 14]: I shall enjoy exploring on half holidays when I am free from work .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 6]: I am a school-mistress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 28]: said Claire with an air , and gathered from her companion 's face that he knew as much already , and considered it a subject for commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 19]: He looked at her with sympathetic eyes , and asked deeply -- `` Hate it very much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 4]: Quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 4]: I adore it .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 24]: At least , that 's to say , I have n't begun yet , but I feel sure I _ shall _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 21]: Claire cried ardently ; and at that they both laughed with a delightful sense of understanding and _ camaraderie _ .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 54]: At that moment Claire felt a distinct pang at the thought that never again would she have the opportunity of speaking and laughing with this attractive , eminently companionable man ; then her attention was distracted by the appearance of two more porters , who had each to be interviewed in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 42]: They had no good news to give , however , so the searchers left the platform in disgust , and repaired to the office for lost luggage , where the story of the missing box was recounted to an unsympathetic clerk .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 48]: When a man spends his whole life listening to complaints of missing property , he can hardly be expected to show a vehement distress at the loss of yet another passenger , but to Claire at this moment there was something quite brutal in his callous indifference .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 30]: The one suggestion which he had to make was that she could leave her name , and the manner in which it was given was a death-blow to hope .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 69]: At this very moment , however , just as Claire was bending forward to dictate the desired information she felt a touch on her arm , and looking in the direction of Mr Fanshawe 's outstretched hand , beheld a porter approaching the office , trundling before him a truck on which reposed in solitary splendour , a long brown dress-box , and oh , joy of joys !
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 18]: even at the present distance the white letters C.G. could be plainly distinguished on the nearer side !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 27]: Claire 's dignity went to the winds at that sight , and she dashed forward to meet her property with the joyous impetuosity of a child .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 23]: The explanation was simple to a degree , and precisely agreed with Mr Fanshawe 's surmise as to what had really happened .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 70]: During Claire 's trance of forgetfulness , the box had been wheeled away , with a large consignment of luggage , and the mistake discovered only when the various items were in process of being packed into a company 's omnibus , when , there being no one at hand to claim it , it had been conveyed -- by very leisurely stages -- to the lost luggage office .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 7]: All 's well that ends well !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 45]: Claire gleefully collected her possessions , feeling a glow of delight in the safety which an hour before she would have taken as a matter of course , and stood at attention while each separate item was placed on the roof of the taxi .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 32]: The little addresses of which she had boasted were duly inserted in leather framings on each box , the delicate writing too small to be deciphered , except near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 28]: Claire saw her companion 's eyes contract in an evident effort to distinguish the words , and immediately moved her position so as to frustrate his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 11]: She did not intend Mr Fanshawe to know her address !
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 55]: When she was seated in the taxi , however , there came an awkward moment , for her companion waved the chauffeur to his seat , and stood by the window looking in at her , with a face which seemed unduly serious and earnest , considering the extremely slight nature of their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 8]: I am thankful the box turned up .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 18]: I shall think of you enjoying your re-united frocks ... Sure you 've got everything all right ?
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 10]: Where shall I tell the man to drive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 19]: For the fraction of a second Claire 's eyes flickered , then she spoke in decided tones . ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: ` The Grand Hotel . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 17]: Mr Fanshawe 's eyes flickered too , and turned involuntarily towards the boxes on the roof .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 29]: What exactly were the words on the labels he could not see , but at least it was certain that they were not `` The Grand Hotel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 13]: He turned from the inspection to confront a flushed , obstinate face .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 13]: `` Do you wish me to give the man that address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 47]: Very deliberately and quietly Mr Fanshawe stepped back a pace , opened his long coat , and fumbled in an inner pocket for a leather pocket-book ; very quietly and deliberately he drew from one bulging division a visiting card , and held it towards her .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 32]: Claire caught the word `` Captain '' and saw that an address was printed in the corner , but she covered it hastily with her hand , refusing a second glance .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 24]: Captain Fanshawe leant his arm on the window sash and said hesitatingly -- `` Will you allow me to give you my card !
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 37]: As you are a stranger in town and your people away , there may possibly be -- er -- occasions , when it would be convenient to know some man whom you could make of use .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 9]: Please remember me if they do come along !
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 28]: It would be a privilege to repay your kindness to my mother ... Send me a wire at any time , and I am at your service .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 8]: I hope you _ will _ send .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 4]: Good morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 4]: `` Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 3]: said Claire .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 30]: Red as a rose was she at that moment , but very dignified and stately , bending towards him in a sweeping bow , as the taxi rolled away .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 31]: The last glimpse of Captain Fanshawe showed him standing with uplifted hat , the keen eyes staring after her , with not a glint of humour in their grey depths .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 8]: Quite evidently he meant what he said .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 19]: Quite evidently he was as keen to pursue her acquaintance as his mother had been to drop it .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 27]: Claire Gifford sat bolt upright on her seat , the slip of cardboard clasped within her palms , and as she sat she thought many thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 19]: A physiognomist would have been interested to trace the progress of those thoughts on the eloquent young face .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 30]: There was surprise written there , and obvious gratification , and a demure , very feminine content ; later on came pride , and a general stiffening of determination .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 25]: The spoiled child of liberty and the High School-Mistress of the future had fought a heated battle , and the High School-Mistress had won .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 39]: Deliberately turning aside her eyes , so that no word of that printed address should obtrude itself on her notice , Claire tore the card sharply across and across , and threw the fragments out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 20]: A moment later she whistled through the tube , and instructed the chauffeur as to her change of address .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 13]: Adieu to the Fanshawes , and all such luxuries of the past .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 13]: Heigh-ho for hard work , and lodgings at fifteen shillings a week !
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 5]: MISS RHODES , POISONER .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 93]: It is a somewhat dreary feeling to arrive even at a friend 's house before seven o'clock in the morning , and be received by sleepy-looking people who have obviously been torn unwillingly from their beds in deference to the precepts of hospitality , but it is infinitely worse to arrive at a lodging-house at the same hour , ring several times at the bell before a dingy servant can be induced to appear , and to realise a moment later that in a tireless parlour you perceive your journey 's goal !
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 43]: Claire Gifford felt a creep of the blood at the sight of that parlour , though if her first introduction had been at night , when the curtains were drawn and the lamps lit , she would have found it cosy enough .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 72]: There was no sign of her room-mate ; perhaps it was too much to expect her to get up at so early an hour to welcome a stranger , but Claire _ had _ expected it , felt perfectly sure that -- had positions been reversed -- she herself would have taken pains to deck both herself and her room in honour of the occasion , and so felt correspondingly downcast .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 29]: Presently she found herself following the dingy maid up three separate nights of stairs , and arriving at a tiny box of a bedroom on the top floor .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 25]: There was a bed , a washstand , a chest of drawers doing service as a dressing-table , two chairs and a sloping roof .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 40]: Claire would have been quite disappointed if that last item had been missing , for whoever heard of a girl who set out to make her own living who had not slept in a room with a sloping roof ?
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 17]: On the whole , despite its tiny proportions , the little room made a pleasant impression .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 39]: It was clean , it was bright , walls and furniture were alike of a plain unrelieved white , and through the open casement window could be seen a distant slope of green overtopping the intervening chimney tops .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 47]: Claire 's eyes roved here and there with the instinct of a born home-maker , saw what was lacking here , what was superfluous there , grasped neglected possibilities , and mentally re-arranged and decorated the premises before a slower person would have crossed the floor .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 34]: Then she took up her stand before the small mirror , and devoted a whole minute to studying her own reflection from the point of view of Captain Erskine Fanshawe of unknown address .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 54]: By her own deliberate choice she had cut herself off from future chance of meeting this acquaintance of an hour ; nevertheless it was distinctly reviving to discern that her hat was set at precisely the right angle , and that for an all-night voyager her whole appearance was remarkably fresh and dainty .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 17]: Claire first smiled , and then sighed , and pulled out the hat-pins with impatient tugs .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 16]: To be prudent and self-denying is not always an exhilarating process for sweet and twenty .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 34]: Presently the maid came staggering upstairs with the smaller boxes , and Claire busied herself in her room until the clock had struck eight , when she again descended to the joint sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 32]: This time the fire was lighted , and the table laid for breakfast , and behind the tea-tray sat Miss Rhodes , the English mistress , already halfway through her meal .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 18]: She rose , half smiling , half frowning , and held out a thin hand in welcome .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 3]: `` Morning .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 8]: Hope you 've had a good crossing .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 9]: Did n't know when you 'd be down .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 6]: Do you take coffee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 4]: `` Please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 21]: Claire felt that a cup of coffee would be just what she needed , but missed the familiar fragrant scent .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 23]: She seated herself at the table , and while Miss Rhodes went on with her preparation , studied her with curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 39]: She saw a woman of thirty-two or three , with well-cut features , dark eyes , and abundant dark hair -- a woman who ought to have been distinctly good-looking but who succeeded in being plain and commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 44]: She was badly-dressed , in a utility blouse of grey flannel , her expression was tired and listless , and her hair , though neat , showed obvious lack of care , having none of the silky sheen which rewards regular systematic brushing .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 28]: So far bad , but , in spite of all drawbacks , it was an interesting face , and Claire felt attracted , despite the preliminary disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 9]: `` There 's some bacon in that dish .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 9]: It will be cold , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 31]: You can ring , if you like , and ask them to warm it up , but they 'll keep you waiting a quarter of an hour out of spite .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 8]: I 've given it up myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 10]: `` Oh , I 'm accustomed to French breakfasts .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 11]: I really want nothing but some bread and coffee . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 24]: Claire sipped at her cup as she finished speaking , and the sudden grimace of astonishment which followed roused her companion to laughter .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 7]: `` You do n't like it ?
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 10]: It is n't equal to your French coffee . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 8]: `` It is n't coffee at all .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 5]: It 's undrinkable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 8]: Claire pushed away her cup in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: `` Is it always as bad as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 4]: `` Worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 5]: said Miss Rhodes composedly .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 11]: `` They put in more this morning because of you .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 13]: Sometimes it 's barely coloured , and it 's always chicory . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 4]: She shrugged resignedly .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 8]: `` No English landlady can make coffee .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: It 's no use worrying .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: Have to make the best of what comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: `` Indeed I sha n't .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 5]: I sha n't try .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 9]: There 's no virtue in drinking such stuff .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 16]: We provide the coffee -- what 's to hinder us making it for ourselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 8]: `` No fire , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 14]: Ca n't afford one when you are going out immediately after breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 5]: Claire stared in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 17]: It had never occurred to her that she might have to be economical to this extent .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: `` But when it 's very cold ?
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: What do you do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 13]: `` Put on a jersey , and nurse the hot-water jug ! ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 11]: Claire grimaced , then nodded with an air of determination .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 7]: `` I 'll buy a machine !
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 8]: There can be no objection to that .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 21]: You would prefer good coffee , would n't you , if you could get it without any more trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 5]: `` Oh , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 10]: I 'll enjoy it -- while it lasts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 8]: `` Why should n't it last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 10]: Miss Rhodes stared across at the eager young face .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 9]: She looked tired , and a trifle impatient .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 13]: `` Oh , my dear girl , you 're _ New _ .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 23]: We are all the same at first -- bubbling over with energy , and determined to arrange everything exactly as we like .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 10]: It 's a phase which we all live through .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 6]: Afterwards you do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 7]: You are too tired to worry .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 24]: All your energy goes on your day 's work , and you are too thankful for peace and quietness to bother about details .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 14]: You take what comes , and are thankful it 's not worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 8]: Claire 's smile showed an elaborate forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 12]: `` Rather a poor-spirited attitude , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 6]: `` Wait and see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 5]: said the English mistress .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 23]: She rose and threw herself in a chair by the window , and Claire left the despised coffee and followed her example .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 19]: Through the half-opened panes she looked out on a row of brick houses depressingly dingy , depressingly alike .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 22]: About every second house showed a small black card on which the word `` Apartments '' was printed in gilt letters .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 18]: Down the middle of the street came a fruiterer 's cart , piled high with wicker baskets .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 16]: The cry of `` Bananas , cheap bananas , '' floated raucously on the air .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 12]: Claire swiftly averted her eyes and turned back to her companion .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 16]: `` It is very good of you to let me share your _ appartement _ .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 20]: Miss Farnborough said she had arranged it with you , but it must be horrid taking in a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 12]: I will try not to be too great a bore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 8]: But Miss Rhodes refused to be thanked .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 13]: `` I 'm bound to have somebody , '' said she ungraciously .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 7]: `` Could n't afford them alone .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 5]: You know the terms ?
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 9]: Thirty-five shillings a week for the three rooms .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 7]: That 's cheap in this neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 21]: We only get them at that price because we are out all day , and need so little catering . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: She looked round the room with her tired , mocking smile .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 9]: `` Hope you admire the scheme of decoration !
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 43]: I 've been in dozens of lodgings , but I do n't think I 've ever struck an uglier room ; but the people are clean and honest , and one has to put that before beauty , in our circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 12]: `` There 's a great _ deal _ of pattern about .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 12]: It has n't what one could call a restful effect ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 43]: said Claire , looking across at an ochre wall bespattered with golden scrawls , a red satin mantel-border painted with lustre roses , a suite of furniture covered in green stamped plush , a collection of inartistic pictures , and unornamental ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 21]: Even her spirit quailed before the hopelessness of beautifying a room in which all the essentials were so hopelessly wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 15]: She gave it up in despair , and returned to the question of finance .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 10]: `` Then my share will be seventeen and six !
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 5]: That seems very cheap .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 11]: I am to begin at a hundred and ten pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 10]: How much extra must I allow for food ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 7]: `` That depends upon your requirements .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 21]: We have dinner at school ; quite a good meal for ninepence , including a penny for coffee afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 13]: `` The same sort of coffee we have had this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 3]: `` Practically .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 5]: A trifle better perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 4]: Not much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 4]: `` Hurrah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 4]: cried Claire gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 9]: `` That 's a penny to the good !
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 13]: Eightpence for me -- a clear saving of fivepence a week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 7]: Miss Rhodes resolutely refused to smile .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 22]: She had the air of thinking it ribald to be cheerful on the serious question of pounds , shillings and pence .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 27]: `` Even so , it 's three-and-four , and you ca n't do breakfast and supper and full board on Saturday and Sunday under seven shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 9]: It 's tight enough to manage on that .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 9]: Altogether it often mounts up to twelve . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 6]: `` Seventeen and twelve . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 10]: Claire pondered deeply before she arrived at a solution .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 3]: `` Twenty-nine .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 20]: Call it thirty , to make it even , and I am to begin at a hundred and ten .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 6]: Over two pounds a week .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 15]: I ought to do it comfortably , and have quite a lot over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: Miss Rhodes laughed darkly .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 6]: `` What about extras ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 13]: `` What about laundry , and fires , and stationery and stamps ?
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 54]: What about boot-mending , and Tubes on wet days , and soap and candles , and dentist and medicines , and subs , at school , and collections in church , and travelling expenses on Saturdays and Sundays , when you invariably want to go to the very other side of the city ?
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 8]: London is not like a provincial town .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 17]: You ca n't stir out of the house under fourpence or sixpence at the very least .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 10]: What about illness , and amusement , and holidays ?
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 17]: What about -- '' Claire thrust her fingers in her ears with an air of desperation .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 3]: `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 2]: Stop !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 11]: For pity 's sake do n't swamp me any more .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 17]: I feel in the bankruptcy court already , and I had imagined that I was rich !
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 11]: A hundred and ten pounds seemed quite a big salary .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 18]: Everybody was surprised at my getting so much , and I suppose you have even more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 6]: `` A hundred and fifty .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 19]: You must remember that we do n't belong to the ordinary rut of worker -- we are experts .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 9]: Our education has been a long costly business .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 16]: No untrained worker could take our place ; we are entitled to expert 's pay .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 38]: Oh , yes , they are quite good salaries if you happen to have a home behind you , and people who are ready to help over rough times , instead of needing to be helped themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 19]: The pity of it is that most High School-mistresses come from families who are _ not _ rich .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 30]: The parents have made a big effort to pay for the girls ' education , and when they are fairly launched , they expect to be helped in return .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 17]: Some girls have been educated by relations , or have practically paid for themselves by scholarships .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 21]: Three out of four of us have people who are more in need of help than able to give it .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 19]: I give my own mother thirty pounds a year , so we are practically on the same salary .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 13]: Have _ you _ a home where you can spend your holiday ?
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 8]: Holidays run away terribly with your money .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 11]: They come to nearly four months in the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 19]: For the first time those prolonged holidays appeared to Claire as a privilege which had its reverse side .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 39]: Friends in Brussels might possibly house her for two or three weeks ; she could not expect , she would not wish them to do more ; and at the end there would still remain over three months !
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 17]: It was a new and disagreeable experience to look forward to holidays with _ dread _ !
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 33]: For a whole two minutes she looked thoroughly depressed , then her invincible optimism came to the top , and she cried triumphantly -- `` I 'll take a holiday engagement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 7]: The English mistress shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 5]: `` That 's fatal !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 7]: I tried it myself one summer .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 28]: Went with a family to the seaside , and was expected to play games with the children all day long , and coach them in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 14]: I began the term tired out , and nearly collapsed before the end .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 26]: Teaching is nerve-racking work , and if you do n't get a good spell off , it 's as bad for the pupils as yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: You snap their heads off for the smallest trifle .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 15]: Besides , it 's folly to wear oneself out any sooner than one need .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 15]: It 's bad enough to think of the time when one has to retire .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 14]: That 's the nightmare which haunts us more and more every year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 19]: `` Do n't you think when the time comes you will be _ glad _ to rest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 14]: asked innocent Claire , whereupon Miss Rhodes glared at her with indignant eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 40]: `` We should be glad to rest , no doubt , but we do n't exactly appreciate the prospect of resting in the workhouse , and it 's difficult to see where else some of us are to go !
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 30]: There is no pension for High School - mistresses , and we are bound to retire at fifty-five -- if we can manage to stick it out so long .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 27]: Fifty-five seems a long way off to you -- not quite so long to me ; when you reach forty it becomes to feel quite near .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 19]: Women are horribly long-lived , so the probability is that we 'll live on to eighty or more .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 22]: Twenty-five years after leaving off work , and -- _ where is the money to come from to keep us _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 40]: That 's the question which haunts us all when we look into our bank-books and find that , with all our pains , we have only been able to save at the utmost two or three hundred pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 21]: Claire looked scared , but she recovered her composure with a swiftness which her companion had no difficulty in understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 8]: She pounced upon her with lightning swiftness .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 15]: `` Ah , you think you 'll get married , and escape that way !
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 17]: We all do when we 're new , and pretty , and ignorant of the life .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 17]: But it 's fifty to one , my dear , that you _ wo n't _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 23]: You wo n't meet many men , for one thing ; and if you do , they do n't like school-mistresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 15]: `` Does n't that depend a good deal on the kind of school-mistress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 16]: `` Absolutely ; but after a few years we are all more or less alike .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 27]: We do n't _ begin _ by being dowdy and angular , and dogmatic and prudish ; we begin by being pretty and cheerful like you .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 16]: I used to change my blouse every evening , and put on silk stockings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 7]: `` Do n't you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 7]: `` I do _ not _ !
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 16]: Why should I , to sit over a lodging-house table correcting exercises till ten o'clock ?
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 7]: It 's not worth the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 15]: Besides , I 'm too tired , and it wears out another blouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 17]: Claire 's attention was diverted from clothes by the shock of the reference to evening work .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 37]: She had looked forward to coming home to read an interesting book , or be lazy in whatever fashion appealed to her most , and the corrections of exercises seemed of all things the most dull .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 10]: `` Shall I have evening work , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 12]: she inquired blankly , and Miss Rhodes laughed with brutal enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 3]: `` Rather !
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 22]: French compositions on the attributes of a true woman , or , ` How did you spend your summer holiday ? '
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 14]: with all the tenses wrong , and the idioms translated word for word .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 11]: And every essay a practical repetition of the one before .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 20]: It 's not once in a blue moon that one comes across a girl with any originality of thought .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 12]: that 's the way we shall spend five evenings a week .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 41]: You will sit at that side of the table , I will sit at this , and we 'll correct and yawn , and yawn and correct , and drink a cup of cocoa and go to bed at ten .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 7]: Lively , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 3]: `` Awful !
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 6]: I never thought of homework .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 15]: But if Saturday is a whole holiday there will still be one night off .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 14]: I shall make a point of doing something exciting every Saturday evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 28]: `` Exciting things cost money , and , as a rule , when you have paid up the various extras , there 's no money to spare .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 55]: I stay in bed till ten o'clock on Saturday , and then get up and wash blouses , and do my mending , and have a nap after lunch , and if it 's summer , go and sit on a penny chair in the park , or take a walk over Hampstead Heath .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 13]: In the evening I read a novel and have a hot bath .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 34]: Once in a blue moon I have an extravagant bout , and lunch in a restaurant , and go to an entertainment -- but I 'm sorry afterwards when I count the cost .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 17]: On Sunday I go to church , and wish some one would ask me to tea .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 7]: They do n't , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 49]: They may do once or twice , when you first come up , but you can never ask them back , and your clothes get shabby , and you know nothing about their interests , so they think you a bore , and quietly let you drop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 45]: A smothered exclamation burst from Claire 's lips ; with a sudden , swirling movement she leapt up , and fell on her knees before Miss Rhodes 's chair , her hands clasping its arms , her flushed face upturned with a desperate eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 4]: `` Miss Rhodes !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 22]: we are going to live together here , we are going to share the same room , and the same meals .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 56]: Would you -- if any one offered you a million pounds , would you agree to poison me slowly , day by day , dropping little drops of poison into everything I ate and everything I drank , while you sat by and watched me grow weaker and weaker till I _ died _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 10]: `` Good heavens , girl -- are you mad !
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 10]: What in the world are you raving about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 7]: Miss Rhodes had grown quite red .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 13]: She was indignant ; she was also more than a little scared .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 23]: The girl 's sudden change of mood was startling in itself , and she looked so tense , so overwhelmingly in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: What could she mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 13]: Was it possible that she was a little -- _ touched _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 21]: `` I suppose you do n't realise it , but it 's insulting even to put such a question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 9]: `` But you _ are _ doing it !
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 10]: It 's just exactly what you are beginning already .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 13]: Ever since I arrived you 've been poisoning me drop by drop .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 6]: Poisoning my _ mind _ !
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 24]: I am at the beginning of my work , and you 've been discouraging me , frightening me , painting it all black .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 28]: Every word that you 've said has been a drop of poison to kill hope and courage and confidence -- and oh , do n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 5]: do n't go on !
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 24]: I may be young and foolish , and full of ridiculous ideas , but let me keep them as long as I can !
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 61]: If all that you say is true , they will be knocked out of me soon enough , and I -- I 've never had to work before , or been alone , and -- and it 's only two days since my mother left me to go to India -- all that long way -- and left me behind !
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 36]: It 's hard enough to go on being alone , and believing it 's all going to be _ couleur de rose _ , but it will be fifty times harder if I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 11]: Please -- please do n't make it any worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 25]: With the last words tears came with a rush , the tears that had been resolutely restrained throughout the strain of the last week .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 36]: Claire dropped her head on the nearest resting-place she could find , which happened to be Miss Rhodes 's blue serge lap , and felt the quick pressure of a hand over the glossy coils .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 6]: `` Poor little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 6]: said the English mistress softly .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 5]: `` Poor little girl !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 4]: I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 5]: I 'm a beast !
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 6]: Take no notice of me .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 9]: I 'm a sour , disagreeable old thing .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 26]: It was more than half jealousy , dear , because you looked so pretty and spry , so like what I used to look myself .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 19]: The life 's all right , if you keep well , and do n't worry too much ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 6]: There , do n't cry !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 4]: I loathe tears !
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 15]: You will yourself , when you have to deal with silly , hysterical girls .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 45]: Come , I 'll promise I wo n't poison you any more -- at least , I 'll do my best ; but I 've a grumbling nature , and you 'd better realise it , once for all , and take no notice .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 7]: We 'll get on all right .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 4]: I like you .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 6]: I 'm glad you came .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 19]: My good girl , if you do n't stop , I 'll shake you till you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 17]: Claire sat back on her heels , mopped her eyes , and gave a strangled laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 16]: `` I hate crying myself , but I 'll begin again on the faintest provocation .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 8]: It 's always like that with me .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 21]: I hardly ever cry , but when I once begin -- '' Miss Rhodes rose with an air of determination .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 7]: `` We 'd better go out .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 6]: I am free till lunch-time .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 18]: I 'll take you round and show you the neighbourhood , and the usual places of call .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 7]: It will save time another day .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 7]: Anything you want to buy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 6]: Claire mopped away another tear .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 8]: `` C-certainly , '' she said feebly .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 6]: `` A c-offee machine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 3]: THE INVITATION .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 23]: The next morning Claire was introduced to the scene of her new labours , and was agreeably impressed with its outside appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 33]: Saint Cuthbert 's High School was situated in a handsome thoroughfare , and had originally been a large private house , to which long wings had been added to right and left .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 45]: On each side and across the road were handsome private houses standing in their own grounds , owned by tenants who regarded the High School with lively detestation , and would have borne up with equanimity had an earthquake swallowed it root and branch .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 63]: Viewed from inside , the building was less attractive , passages and class-rooms alike having the air of bleak austerity which seems inseparable from such buildings ; but when nine o'clock struck , and the flood of young life went trooping up the stairways and flowed into the separate rooms , the sense of bareness was replaced by one of tingling vitality .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 40]: As is usual on an opening day , every girl was at her best and brightest , decked in a new blouse , with pigtails fastened by crisp new ribbons , and good resolutions wound up to fever point .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 51]: To find a new French mistress in the shape of a pretty well-dressed girl , who was English at one moment , and at the next even Frenchier than Mademoiselle , was an unexpected joy , and Claire found the battery of admiring young eyes an embarrassing if stimulating experience .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 35]: Following Miss Farnborough 's advice , she spent the first day 's lessons in questioning the different classes as to their past work , and so turned the hour into an impromptu conversation class .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 42]: The ugly English accents made her wince , and she winced a second time as she realised the unpleasant fact that just as her pupils would have to prepare for her , so would she be obliged to prepare for them !
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 36]: Forgotten rules of grammar must be looked up and memorised , for French was so much her mother tongue that she would find it difficult to explain distinctions which came as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 13]: That meant more work at night , more infringement of holiday hours .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 12]: The girls themselves were for the most part agreeable and well-mannered .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 56]: The majority were the daughters of professional men , and of gentle - folks of limited means ; but there was also a sprinkling of the daughters of better-class artisans , who paid High School fees at a cost of much self-denial in order to train their girls for teachers ' posts in the future .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 16]: Here and there an awkward , badly-dressed child was plainly of a still lower class .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 37]: These were the free `` places '' -- clever children who had obtained scholarships from primary schools , and were undergoing the ordeal of being snubbed by their new school-mates as a consequence of their success .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 32]: From the teacher 's point of view these clever children were a welcome stimulus , but class feeling is still too strong in England to make them acceptable to their companions .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 60]: At lunch-time the fifteen mistresses assembled in the Staff-Room , a dull apartment far too small for the purpose , a common fault in High Schools , where the different governing bodies are apt to spare no expense in providing for the comfort of the scholar , but grudge the slightest expenditure for the benefit of those who teach .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 47]: Fifteen mistresses sat round the table eating roast lamb and boiled cabbage , followed by rhubarb pie and rice pudding , and Claire , looking from one to the other , acknowledged the truth of Miss Rhodes 's assertion that they were all of a type .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 45]: She herself was the only one of the number who had any pretensions to roundness of outline , all the rest were thin to angularity , half the number wore pince-nez or spectacles , and all had the same strained pucker round the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 46]: Each one wore a blue serge skirt and a white blouse , and carried herself with an air of dogmatic assurance , as who should say : `` I know better than any one else , and when I speak let no dog bark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 16]: The German mistress was the veteran of the party and was probably a good forty-five .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 17]: Miss Bryce , the Froebel mistress , paired with Claire herself for the place of junior .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 6]: Miss Blake , the Gym .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 21]: mistress , was a graceful girl with an air of delicacy which did not seem in accord with her profession .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 16]: Miss Rose , the Art mistress , was plain with a squat , awkward figure .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 39]: Rising from the table , Claire caught a glimpse of her own reflection in the strip of mirror over the chimney-piece , and at the sight a little thrill , half-painful , half-pleasant , passed through her veins .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 37]: The soft bloom of her complexion , the dainty finish of her dress , differentiated her almost painfully from her companions , and she felt a pang of dread lest that difference should ever grow less .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 83]: While she affected to read one of the magazines which lay on a side table , she was really occupied making a number of vehement resolutions : Never to slack in her care of her personal appearance ; never to give up brushing her hair at night ; never to wear a flannel blouse ; never to give up manicuring her hands ; never , no , never to allow herself to grow short-sighted , and be obliged to submit to specs !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 27]: The different mistresses seemed to be on friendly terms , but there was an absence of the camaraderie which comes from living under the same roof .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 44]: School was a common possession , but home hours were spent apart , except when , as in Claire 's own case , two mistresses shared the same rooms , and it followed as a matter of course that personal interests were divided .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 18]: To-day the conversation was less scholastic than usual , the intervening holidays forming a topic of interest .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 82]: The Art mistress had been on a bicycle sketching tour with a friend ; the German mistress had taken a cheap trip home ; Miss Blake announced that all her money had gone on `` hateful massage , '' and the faces of her listeners sobered as they listened , for Sophy Blake , who led the exercises with such verve and go , had of late complained of rheumatic pains , and her companions heard of her symptoms with dread .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 10]: What would become of Sophy if those pains increased ?
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 39]: One after another the mistresses drifted over to where Claire sat turning the pages of her magazine , and exchanged a few fragments of conversation , and then the great bell clanged again , and afternoon school began .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 14]: The first half-hour of afternoon school proved the most trying of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 20]: Claire was tired after the exertions of the morning , and a very passion for sleep consumed her being .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 26]: She fought against it with all her might , but the yawns would come ; she fought against the yawns , and the tears flowed .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 23]: To her horror the infection spread , and the girls began to yawn in their turn , with long , uncontrolled gapes .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 22]: It was a junior class , and the new mistress shrewdly suspected that the infection was welcomed as an agreeable interlude .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 15]: It was obvious that she could not afford to reject that cup of coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 8]: Good or bad it must be drunk !
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 19]: Rich or poor that penny must be dedicated to the task of vitalising that first hour of sleepiness .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 20]: At the end of six weeks Claire felt as though she had been a High School-mistress all her life .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 47]: The regular methodical days , in which every hour was mapped out , had a deadening effect on one who had been used to constant variety , and except for a difference in the arrangement of classes there seemed no distinction between one and the other .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 28]: She was a machine wound up to work steadily from Monday morning until Friday night , and absurdly ready to run down when the time was over .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 46]: Every morning after breakfast she started forth with Miss Rhodes , by foot if the weather were fine , by Tube if wet ; every mid-day she dined in the Staff-Room with the fifteen other mistresses , and gulped down a cup of chicory coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 33]: At four o'clock the mistresses met once more for tea , a free meal this time , supplemented by an occasional cake which one of the fifteen provided for the general good .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 22]: At five she and her table companion returned to their rooms , and rested an hour before taking the evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 39]: Claire was sufficiently French to be intolerant of badly cooked food , and instead of resigning herself to eat and grumble , after the usual habit of lodging-house dwellers , resolutely set to work to improve the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 31]: The coffee machine had now a chafing-dish as companion , and it was a delightful change of work to set the two machines to work to provide a dainty meal .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 26]: `` High Tea '' consisted as a rule of coffee and some light dish , the materials for which were purchased on the way home .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 47]: On hungry days , when work had been unusually trying , the butcher supplied cutlets , which were grilled with tomatoes , or an occasional quarter of a pound of mushrooms : on economical days the humble kipper -- legendary food of all spinsters in lodgings !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 36]: -- was transformed into quite a smart and restaurant-ey dish , separated from its bones , pounded with butter and flavouring , and served in neat little mounds on the top of hot buttered toast .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 43]: Moreover , Claire was a proficient in the making of omelettes , and it was astonishing how large and tempting a dish could be compounded of two eggs , and the minutest scrap of ham left over from the morning 's breakfast !
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 13]: `` Every luxury of the season , with the smell thrown in !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 13]: In _ nice _ cooking the smell is almost the best part .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 46]: All the cedars in Lebanon would n't smell as good at this moment as this nice ham-ey coffee-y frizzle , '' Claire declared one Friday evening as she served the meal on red-hot plates , and glowed with delight at her own sleight of hand .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 19]: `` Do n't you admire eggs for looking so small , when they possess such powers of expansion ?
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 6]: All the result of beating .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 13]: Might make a simile out of that , might n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 19]: `` Might , but wo n't , '' the English teacher replied , sipping luxuriously at her coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 12]: `` I 'm not a teacher any more at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 23]: I 'm a gourmand , pure and simple , and I 'll stay a gourmand straight on till this omelette is finished .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 47]: When all trades fail , you might go out as a missioner to women living in diggings , and teach them how to prepare their meals , and sell chafing-dishes by instalment payments at the door , as the touts sell sewing machines to the maids .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 8]: It would be a noble vocation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 4]: Claire smirked complacently .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 16]: `` I flatter myself I _ have _ made a difference to your material comfort !
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 33]: Poor we may be , but we do have nice , dainty little meals , and there 's no reason why every able-bodied woman should n't have them at the same cost .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 8]: I 've just remembered another nice dish .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 8]: We 'll have it to-morrow night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 34]: She paused , and a wistful look came into her eyes , for the next day was Saturday , and it was on holiday afternoons that the feeling of loneliness grew most acute .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 80]: School life was monotonous , but it was never lonely ; from morning to night one lived in a crowd , and already each class had furnished youthful adorers eager to sit at the feet of the pretty new mistress , and bring her offerings of chocolates and flowers ; for five long days there was always a crowd , always a hum and babble of voices , but at the end of the week came a dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 67]: On the first Saturday of the term Miss Farnborough had invited the new French mistress to tea , and had been all that was friendly and encouraging ; but since that time no word had passed between them that was not strictly concerned with the work in hand , and Claire realised that as one out of sixteen mistresses she could not hope for frequent invitations .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 6]: On one Sunday the Gym .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 17]: mistress had offered her company for a walk , and there the list of hospitalities ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 22]: No invitations came from that friend of Mrs Fanshawe 's who was so fond of girls who were working for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 14]: Claire had hardly expected it , but she was disappointed all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 74]: A longing was growing within her to sit again in a pretty , daintily-appointed room , and talk about something else than time-tables , and irregular verbs , and the Association of Assistant Mistresses which , amalgamated with the Association of Assistant Masters and the Teachers ' Guild , were labouring to obtain a settled scale of salaries , and that great safeguard , desired above all others , a pension on retirement !
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 47]: On this particular Friday evening the longing was so strong that she had deliberately gone out of her way to try to gain an invitation by walking home with a certain Flora Ross in the sixth form , who was the most ardent of her admirers .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 52]: Flora lived in a cheerful-looking house about a quarter of a mile from the school , and every morning hung over the gate waiting for the chance occasions when her beloved Miss Gifford approached alone , and she could have the felicity of accompanying her for the rest of the way .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 26]: On these occasions she invariably turned to wave her hand to a plump , smiling mother who stood at a bay window waving in return .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 20]: An upper window was barred with brass rods , against which two little flaxen heads bobbed up and down .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 66]: Both the house and its inmates had a cheerful wholesome air , which made a strong appeal to the heart of the lonely girl , and this Friday afternoon , meeting Flora waiting in the corridor , she had accepted her companionship on the way home with a lurking hope that when the green gate was reached , she would be invited to come inside .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 10]: no such thought seemed to enter Flora 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 25]: She gazed adoringly into Claire 's face and hung breathlessly on her words , but for all her adoration there was a gulf between .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 28]: Claire was the sweetest and duckiest of mistresses , but she _ was _ a mistress , a being shut off from the ordinary interests of life .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 20]: When Flora said , `` Is n't it jolly , we are going to have a musical party to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 15]: We have such lovely parties , and mother always lets me sit up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 29]: she might have been speaking to a creature without ears , for all the consciousness she exhibited that Claire might possibly wish to take part in the fray .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 48]: When the green gate was reached , the plump mamma was seen standing outside the drawing - room window and recognising the identity of her daughter 's companion , she bent her head in a courteous bow , but she made no attempt to approach the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 7]: `` See you on Monday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 30]: cried Flora fondly , then the gate clicked , and Claire walked along the road with her head held high , and two red spots burning on either cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 56]: That evening for the first time she felt a disinclination to change into the pretty summer frock which she had chosen as a compromise for evening dress ; that evening for the first time the inner voice whispered to her as it had done to so many before her : `` What 's the good ?
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 4]: Nobody sees you !
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 4]: Nobody cares . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 33]: Miss Rhodes finished her share of the omelette , turned on to bread and jam , and cast a glance of inquiry at her companion , who had relapsed into unusual silence .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 5]: `` Anything wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 7]: `` Yes , I think so .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 6]: Usual symptoms , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 21]: I want to wear all my best clothes and go out to do something gay and exciting , Cecil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 37]: The English teacher 's name being Rhodes , it was obvious that she should be addressed as Cecil , especially as her parents had been misguided enough to give her the unsuitably gentle name of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 16]: `` Cecil , do none of the parents _ ever _ ask us out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 6]: `` Why should they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: `` Why should n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 17]: If we are good enough to teach their children , we are good enough for them .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 29]: If they are interested in their children 's welfare , they ought to make a point of knowing us to see what kind of influence we use . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 5]: `` Quite so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 21]: `` Well , my dear , there 's only one thing to be said -- they _ do n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 13]: As I told you before , there 's a prejudice against mistresses .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 37]: They give us credit for being clever , and cultivated , and hard-working ; but they never grasp the fact that we are human girls , who would very much enjoy being frivolous for a change .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 31]: I _ have _ been asked out to tea at rare intervals , and the mothers have apologised for the ordinary conversation , and laboriously switched it on to books .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 8]: I did n't want to talk books .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 47]: I wanted to discuss hats and dresses , and fashionable intelligence , and sing comic songs , and play puss-in-the-corner , and be generally giddy and riotous ; but my presence cast a wet blanket over the whole party , and we discussed Science and Art .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 16]: Now I 'm old and resigned , but it 's hard on the new hands .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 26]: I think it was rather brutal of your mother to let you come to London without taking the trouble of getting _ some _ introductions .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 11]: Do n't mind me saying so , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 4]: Claire smiled feebly .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 8]: `` You have said it , anyhow !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 14]: I know it must seem unkind to anyone who does not know mother .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 29]: She 's really the kindest person in the world , but she 's very easy-going , and apt to believe that everything will happen just as she wishes .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 19]: She felt quite sure that Miss Farnborough and the staff would supply me with a whirl of gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 21]: There _ was _ one lady , who said she would write to a friend -- '' Cecil groaned deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 6]: `` I know that friend .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 5]: She comes from Sheffield .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 14]: A dear kind friend who would love to have you out on holidays .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 10]: A friend who takes a special interest in school-mistresses .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 24]: A friend who gives such nice inter-est - ing parties , and would certainly send you a card if she knew your address .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 15]: Was that it , my dear -- was that the kind of friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 13]: Cecil chuckled with triumph at the sight of Claire 's lengthening jaw .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 17]: In truth there seemed something uncanny in so accurate a reproduction of Mrs Fanshawe 's description .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 9]: Was there , indeed , no such person ?
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 19]: Did she exist purely as a dummy figure , to be dangled before the eyes of credulous beginners ?
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 42]: Claire sighed , and buried her last lingering hope ; and at that very moment the postman 's rap sounded at the door , and a square white envelope was handed in , addressed in feminine handwriting to Miss Claire Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 27]: Claire tore it open , pulled forth a white card , gasped and flushed , and tossed it across the table with a whoop of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 7]: `` Raven , look at that !
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 11]: What do you think now of your melancholy croaks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 22]: Cecil picked up the card , inscribed with the orthodox printed lines , beneath which a few words had been written .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 12]: Mrs Willoughby , At Home May 26th , 9 p.m. Music .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 10]: `` Have just received your address from Mrs Fanshawe .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 7]: Shall hope to see you to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 11]: -- E.B.W. '' Cecil screwed up her face in disparagement .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 4]: `` Nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 2]: Mayfair .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 7]: That means a taxi both ways .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 19]: Ca n't arrive at a house like that in a mackintosh , with your shoes in a bag .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 5]: Much wiser to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 13]: It will only unsettle you , and make you unfit for work .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 22]: She 's done the polite thing for once , because she was asked , but she 'll never do it again .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 13]: I 've been through it myself , and I know the ropes .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 16]: A woman like that has hundreds of friends ; why should she bother about you ?
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 8]: You 'll never be asked again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 14]: But at that Claire laughed , and beat her hand on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 7]: `` But I say I shall !
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 10]: I say I 'll be asked _ often _ !
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 17]: I do n't care if you 've had a hundred experiences , mine shall be different .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 25]: She has asked me once ; now , as the Yankees say , ` it 's up to me ' to do the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 17]: I 'll make up my mind to make her _ want _ to ask me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 4]: TRANSFORMATION OF CECIL .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 41]: In the days to come when Claire looked back and reviewed the course of events which followed , she realised that Mrs Willoughby 's invitation had been a starting-point from which to date happenings to others as well as herself .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 22]: It was , for instance , on the morning after its arrival that Cecil 's chronic discontent reached an acute stage .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 32]: She appeared at breakfast with a clouded face , grumbled incessantly throughout the meal , and snapped at everything Claire said , until the latter was provoked into snapping in return .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 49]: In the old days of idleness Claire had been noted for the sunny sweetness of her disposition , but she was already discovering that teaching lays a severe strain on the nerves , and at the end of a week 's work endurance seemed at its lowest ebb .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 29]: So , when her soft answers met rebuff after rebuff , she began to grumble in her turn , and to give back as good as she got .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 43]: `` Really , Cecil , I am exceedingly sorry that your form is so stupid , and your work so hard , but I am neither a pupil nor a chief , so I fail to see where my responsibility comes in .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 15]: Would n't it be better if you interviewed Miss Farnborough instead of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 20]: It was the first time that Claire had answered sharply , and for the moment surprise held Cecil dumb .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 15]: Then the colour flamed into her cheeks , and her eyes sparkled with anger .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 16]: Though forbearance had failed to soothe her , opposition evidently added fuel to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 5]: `` Miss Farnborough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 4]: she repeated jeeringly .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 23]: `` What does Miss Farnborough care for the welfare of her mistresses , so long as they grind through their daily tasks ?
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 11]: It is the pupils she thinks about , not us .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 20]: The pupils who are to be pampered and considered , and studied , and amused in school and out .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 68]: They have to have games in summer , and a mistress has to give up her spare time to watch the pretty dears to see that they do n't get into trouble ; and they must have parties , and concerts , and silly entertainments in winter , with some poor wretch of a mistress to do all the work so that they may enjoy the fun .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 23]: Miss Farnborough is an exemplary Head so far as her scholars are concerned , but what does she do for her mistresses ?
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 12]: I ask you , does she do anything at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 7]: Claire considered , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 40]: Her first term was nearly over , and she could not truthfully say that the Head had taken any concern for her as an individual who might be expected to feel some interest in life beyond the school door .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 56]: It is true that almost every day brought the two in contact for the exchange of a few words which , if strictly on business , were always pleasant and kindly , but except for the one invitation to tea on the day before work began , they had never met out of school hours .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 47]: Claire was a stranger in London , yet the Head had never inquired as to her leisure hours , never invited her to her house , or offered , her an introduction to friends , never even engaged the sympathies of other mistresses on her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 27]: Claire had expected a very different treatment , and had struggled against a sense of injury , but she would not acknowledge as much in words .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 13]: `` I suppose Miss Farnborough is even more tired than we are .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 8]: She has a tremendous amount of responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 10]: And she has a brother and sister at home .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 13]: Perhaps they object to an incursion of school in free hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 19]: `` Then she ought to leave them , and live where she can do her duty without interference .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 35]: After all mistresses are girls , too , not very much older than some of the pupils when we begin work ; it 's inhuman to take _ no _ interest in our welfare .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 30]: It would n't kill a Head to give up a night a month to ask us to meet possible friends , or to write a few letters of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 15]: You agree with me in your heart , so it 's no use pretending .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 26]: It 's a moral obligation , if it is n't legal , and I say part of the responsibility is hers if things go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 27]: It 's inhuman to leave a young girl alone in lodgings without even troubling to inquire if she has anywhere to go in her leisure hours .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 9]: But it 's the same tale all round .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 3]: Nobody thinks .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 3]: Nobody cares .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 23]: I 've gone to the same church for three years , and not a soul has spoken to me all that time .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 26]: I 've no time to give to Church work , and the seats are free , so there 's no way of getting into touch .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 19]: I do n't suppose any one has ever noticed the shabby school-mistress in her shabby blue serge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 20]: Suddenly Mary Rhodes thrust back her chair , and rising impetuously began to storm up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 15]: `` Oh , I 'm tired , I 'm tired of this second-hand life .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 19]: Living in other people 's houses , teaching other people 's children , obeying other people 's orders .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 6]: I 'm sick of it .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 9]: I ca n't stand it a moment longer .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 12]: I 'd rather take any risk to be out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 8]: After all , what could be worse ?
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 15]: Any sort of life lived on one 's own must be better than this .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 18]: Nearly twelve years of it -- and if I have twenty more , what 's the end ?
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 8]: What is there to look forward to ?
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 13]: Slow starvation in a bed-sitting - room , for perhaps thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 10]: I wo n't do it , I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 5]: I 've had enough .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 8]: Now I shall choose for myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 35]: Like a whirlwind she dashed out of the room , and Claire put her elbow on the table and leant her head on her hands , feeling shaken , and discouraged , and oppressed .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 21]: For the first time a doubt entered her mind as to whether she could continue to live with Mary Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 29]: In her brighter modes there was much that was attractive in her personality , but to live with a chronic grumbler sapped one 's own powers of resistance .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 51]: Claire felt that for the sake of her own happiness and efficiency it would be wiser to make a change , but her heart sank at the thought of making a fresh start , of perhaps having to live alone with no one to speak to in the long evenings .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 13]: The life of a bachelor girl made little appeal at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 10]: Liberty seemed dearly bought at the price of companionship .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 24]: Claire spent the morning writing to her mother and reading over the series of happy letters which had reached her week after week .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 33]: Mrs Judge was in radiant spirits , delighted with the conditions of her new life , full of praise of her husband and the many friends to whom she had been introduced .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 27]: Three-fourths of the letter were taken up with descriptions of her own gay doings , the remaining fourth with optimistic remarks on her daughter 's life .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 9]: How delightful to share rooms with another girl !
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 12]: What a nice break to have every Saturday and Sunday free !
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 4]: What economical rooms !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 6]: Claire must feel quite rich .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 9]: What fun to have the girls so devoted !
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 14]: Claire made an expressive grimace as she read that `` quite rich . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 19]: This last week she had been obliged to buy new gloves , and to have her boots mended .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 47]: A new umbrella had been torn by the carelessness with which another teacher had thrust her own into the crowded stand , and one night she had been seized with a longing for a dainty well-cooked meal , and had recklessly stood treat at a restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 55]: She did not feel at all `` rich '' as she made up the week 's account , and reflected that next week the expense of driving to Mrs Willoughby 's `` At Home '' would again swell up the total of these exasperating `` extras '' which made such havoc of advance calculations .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 41]: Cecil did not appear until lunch was on the table , when she flung the door wide open and marched in with an air of bravado , as if wanting her companion to stare at once and get over it .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 21]: It would have been impossible not to stare , for the change in her appearance was positively startling to behold .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 9]: Her dark hair was waved and fashionably coiffed .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 56]: Her best coat and skirt had been embellished with frills of lace at neck and sleeves , a pretty little waistcoat had been manufactured out of a length of blue ribbon and a few paste buttons , while a blue feather necklet had been promoted a step higher , and encircled an old straw hat .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 45]: The ribbon bow at the end of the boa exactly matched the shade of the waistcoat , and was cocked up at a daring angle , while a becoming new veil and a pair of immaculate new gloves added still further to the effect .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 26]: Claire had always suspected that Cecil could be pretty if she chose to take the trouble , and now she knew it for a fact .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 38]: It was difficult to realise that this well-groomed-looking girl , with the bright eyes and softly-flushed cheeks , could really be the same person as the frumpy - looking individual who every morning hurried along the street .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 16]: Involuntarily Claire threw up her hands ; involuntarily she cried aloud in delight `` Cheers !
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 2]: Cheers !
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 7]: How do you do , Cecil ?
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 5]: Welcome home , Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 5]: -- the real Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 7]: How pretty you are , Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 7]: How well that blue suits you !
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 13]: Do n't dare to go back to your dull navy and black .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 9]: I shall insist that you always wear blue .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 13]: I feel quite proud of having such a fine lady to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 11]: You are going to have lunch , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 7]: Why those gloves and veil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 10]: `` Oh , well -- I 'm not hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 6]: I 'll have some coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 8]: I may have lunch in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 10]: Cecil was plainly embarrassed under her companion 's scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 41]: She pushed up her veil , so that it rested in a little ridge across her nose , craned forward her head , sipping her coffee with exaggerated care , so that no drop should fall on her lacy frills .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 36]: Claire longed to ask a dozen questions , but something in Cecil 's manner held her at bay , and she contented herself with one inquiry -- `` What time will you be home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 5]: Cecil shrugged her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 5]: `` Do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 6]: Perhaps not till late . ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 26]: She was silent for a moment , then added with sudden bitterness , `` You are not the _ only _ person who has invitations .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: If I chose , I could go out every Saturday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 14]: `` Then why on earth are you always grumbling about your loneliness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 14]: thought Claire swiftly , but she did not put the thought into words .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 27]: After the warmth of her own welcome , a kinder response was surely her due ; she was angry , and would not condescend to reply .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 23]: The meal was finished in silence , but when Cecil rose to depart , the usual compunction seized her in its grip .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 20]: She stood arranging her veil before the mirror over the mantelpiece , uttering the usual interjectory expressions of regret .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 5]: `` Sorry , Claire .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 5]: I 'm a wretch .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 5]: You must hate me .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 6]: I ought to be shot .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 8]: Nice Saturday morning I 've given you !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 10]: What are you going to do this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 23]: Claire 's eyes turned towards the window with an expression sad to see on so young a face -- an imprisoned look .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 21]: Her voice seemed to lose all its timbre as she replied in one flat dreary word -- `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 10]: A spasm of irresolution passed across Cecil 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 26]: For a moment she looked as if she were about to throw aside her own project and cast in her lot with her friend 's .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 12]: Then her face hardened , and she turned towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: `` Why not call for Sophie Blake , and see if she will go a walk ?
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 7]: She asked you once before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 15]: With that she was gone , and Claire was left to consider the proposition .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 60]: Sophie Blake , the Games mistress , was the single member of the staff who had shown any disposition towards real friendship , though the intimacy was so far confined to one afternoon 's walk , and an occasional chat in the dinner hour , but this afternoon the thought of her merry smile acted as an irresistible magnet .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 29]: Claire ran upstairs to get ready , in a panic lest she might arrive at Sophie 's lodgings to find she had already gone out for the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 26]: Cecil had hinted that she might not return until late , and suddenly it seemed unbearable to spend the rest of the day in solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 31]: Restlessness was in the air , first the pleasurable restlessness caused by the receipt of Mrs Willoughby 's invitation , then the disagreeable restlessness caused by Cecil 's erratic behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 26]: As she hurried through the streets towards Sophie Blake 's lodgings , Claire pondered over the mystery of this sudden development on Cecil 's part .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 5]: Where was she going ?
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 7]: Whom was she going to see ?
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 27]: Why declare with one breath that she was without a friend , and with the next that if she chose she might accept invitations every week ?
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 13]: What special reason had to-day inspired such unusual care in her appearance ?
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 5]: Sophie was at home .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 15]: Lonely Claire felt quite a throb of relief as she heard the welcome words .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 33]: She entered the oil-clothed passage and was shown into a small , very warm , very untidy front parlour wherein stood Sophie herself , staring with widened eyes at the opening door .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 10]: `` Oh , it 's _ you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 8]: `` What a fright you gave me !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 11]: I could n't think _ who _ it could be .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 3]: Come in !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 3]: Sit down !
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 7]: Can you find a free chair ?
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 6]: Saturday is my work day .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 28]: I 've been darning stockings , and trimming a hat , and ironing a blouse , and washing lace , and writing letters all in a rush .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 7]: I love a muddle on Saturdays .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 11]: It 's such a change after routine all the week .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 8]: What do you think of the hat ?
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 7]: Seven and sixpence , all told .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 11]: I flatter myself it looks worth every penny of ten .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 7]: Do n't pull down that cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 5]: The iron 's underneath .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 6]: Be careful of that table !
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 6]: The ink-pot 's somewhere about .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 7]: How sweet of you to call !
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 18]: I 'll clear this muddle away and then we can talk ... Oh , my arm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter with the arm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 4]: Sophie shrugged carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 6]: `` Rheumatism , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 10]: Cheerful , is n't it , for a gym .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 2]: mistress ?
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 11]: It 's been giving me fits all the week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 8]: `` The east winds , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 8]: I know they make rheumatism worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 4]: `` They do .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 4]: So does damp .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 4]: So does snow .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 4]: So does fog .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 4]: So does cold .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: So does heat .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 19]: If you could tell me of anything that makes it _ better _ , I 'd be obliged .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 3]: Bother rheumatism !
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 15]: Do n't let 's talk of it ... It 's Saturday , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 8]: I never think of disagreeables on Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 8]: Where 's Miss Rhodes this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 18]: She made herself look very nice and smart -- she can be very nice-looking when she likes !
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 9]: -- and went out for the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 17]: Sophie pursed her lips and contracted her brows as if in consideration of a knotty point .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 15]: `` She was awfully pretty when I came to the school ten years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 6]: And quite jolly and bright .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 10]: You would n't know her for the same girl .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 15]: She 's a worrier , of course , but it 's more than that .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 18]: Something happened about six years ago , which took the starch out of her once for all .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 7]: A love affair , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 44]: Perhaps she 's told you ... I 'm not fishing , and it 's not my business , but I 'm sorry for the poor thing , and I was sorry for you when I heard you were going to share her room .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 13]: She ca n't be the most cheerful companion in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 20]: `` Oh , she 's quite lively at times , '' Claire said loyally , `` and very appreciative .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 21]: I 'm fond of her , you know , but I wish she did n't grumble quite so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 32]: She looked round the parlour , which was at once bigger and better furnished than the joint apartment in Laburnum Crescent , and seized upon an opportunity of changing the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 9]: `` You have a very nice room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 13]: Sophie Blake looked round with an air half proud , half guilty .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 3]: `` Y-es .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: Too nice .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 20]: I 've no business to spend so much , but I simply ca n't stand those dreadful cheap houses .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 14]: People are always fussing and telling one to save up for old age .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 15]: I think it matters far more to have things nice in one 's youth .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 26]: I get a hundred and thirty a year , and have to keep myself all the year round and help to educate a young sister .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 14]: We are orphans , and the grown-ups have to keep her between us .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 17]: I could n't save if I wanted to , so what 's the use of worrying ?
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 11]: I do n't care very much what happens after fifty-five .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 6]: Perhaps I shall be married .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 6]: Perhaps I shall be dead .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 19]: Perhaps some nice kind millionaire will have taken a fancy to me , and left me a fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 47]: If the worst comes to the worst , I 'll go into a home for decayed gentlewomen and knit stockings -- no , not stockings , I should never be able to turn the heels -- long armlet things , like mittens , without the thumbs .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 3]: Look here .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 5]: Where shall we go ?
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 15]: Is n't it a shame that all the nice shops close early on Saturday ?
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 20]: We might have had such sport walking along Knightsbridge , choosing what we 'd like best from every window .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 6]: Have you ever done that ?
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 5]: It 's ripping fun .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 4]: What about Museums ?
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 5]: Do you like Museums ?
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 11]: Rather cold for the feet , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 22]: What can we do that 's warm and interesting , and exciting , and does n't cost more than eighteenpence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 43]: Claire laughed gleefully , not at the thought of the eighteenpenny restriction , but from pure joy at finding a companion who could face life with a smile , and find enjoyment from such simple means as imaginary purchases from shop windows .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 10]: Oh , the blessed effect of a cheerful spirit !
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 21]: How inspiriting it was after the constant douche of discouragement from which she had suffered for the last nine weeks !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 6]: `` Oh , bother eighteenpence !
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 19]: This is my treat , and we are going to enjoy ourselves , or know the reason why .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 21]: I 've got a lot of money in the bank , and I 'm just in the mood to spend .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 19]: We 'll go to the Queen 's Hall , and then on to have tea in a restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 9]: You would like to hear some music ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 18]: `` So long as it is not a chorus of female voices -- I _ should _ !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 15]: I 'm a trifle fed up with female voices , '' cried Sophie gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 14]: She picked up her newly-trimmed hat from the table and caressed it fondly .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 6]: `` Come along , darling .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 11]: You 're going to make your _ debut _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 3]: THE RECEPTION .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 72]: It was almost worth while leading a life of all work and no play for six weeks on end , for the sheer delight of being frivolous once more ; of dressing oneself in one 's prettiest frock , drawing on filmy silk stockings and golden shoes , clasping a pearl necklace round a white throat and cocking a feathery aigrette at just the right angle among coppery swathes of hair .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 41]: No single detail was wanting to complete the whole , for in the old careless days Claire 's garments had been purchased with a lavish hand , the only anxiety being to secure the most becoming specimen of its kind .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 68]: There were long crinkly gloves , and a lace handkerchief , and a fan composed of curling feathers and mother-of-pearl sticks , and a dainty bag hanging by golden cords , and a cloak of the newest shape , composed of layers of different-tinted chiffons , which looked more like a cloud at sunset than a garment manufactured by human hands and supposed to be of use !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 48]: Claire tilted her little mirror to an acute angle , gave a little skip of delight as she surveyed the completed whole , and then whirled down the narrow staircase , a flying mist of draperies , through which the little gold-clad feet gleamed in and out .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 32]: She whirled into the sitting-room , where the solitary lamp stood on the table , and Cecil lay on the humpy green plush sofa reading a novel from the Free Library .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 28]: She put down the book and stared with wide eyes as Claire gave an extra whirl for her benefit , and cried jubilantly -- `` Admire me !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 3]: Admire me !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 7]: I 'm dying to be admired !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 12]: Do n't I look fine , and smart , and unsuitable !
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 14]: Will any one in the world mistake me for a High School-mistress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 14]: Cecil rose from the sofa , and made a solemn tour of inspection .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 19]: Obviously she was impressed , obviously she admired , obviously also she found something startling in her inspection .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 38]: There was pure feminine interest in the manner in which she fingered each delicate fabric in turn , there was pure feminine kindness in the little pat on the arm which announced the close of the inspection .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 8]: `` My dear , it 's ripping !
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 8]: Rich and rare is n't in it .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 5]: You look a dream .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 3]: Poor kiddie !
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 23]: If this is the sort of thing you 've been used to , it 's been harder for you than I thought !
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 22]: Yes , horribly unsuitable , and when it 's worn-out , you 'll never be able to have another like it .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 9]: White ponge will be your next effort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 22]: `` Bless your heart , I 've three others just as fine , and these skimpy skirts last for an age .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 23]: No chance of any one planting a great foot on the folds and tearing them to ribbons as in the old days .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 11]: There _ are _ no folds to tread on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 10]: But Cecil as usual was ready with her croak .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 15]: `` Next year , '' she said darkly , `` there will be flounces .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 28]: Before you have a chance of wearing your four dresses , everybody will be fussy and frilly , and they 'll be hopelessly out of date . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 19]: `` Then I 'll cut up two and turn them into flounces to fuss out the others ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 16]: cried Claire , the optimist , and gave another caper from sheer lightness of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 9]: `` How do you like my feet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 7]: `` I suppose you mean shoes .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 8]: A pretty price you paid for those .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: I 'm sure they 're too tight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 8]: `` Boats , my dear , boats !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 9]: I 've had to put in a sole .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 10]: Did n't you know my feet were so small ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: How do you like my cloak ?
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 9]: It 's meant to look like a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 19]: Layers of blue , pink and grey , ` superimposed , ' as the fashion papers have it .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 12]: Or should you say it was more like an opal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 7]: `` No , I should not .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 6]: Neither one nor the other .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 20]: Considered as a cloak for a foggy November evening , I should call it a delusion and a fraud .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 6]: You 'll get a chill .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 6]: I 've a Shetland shawl .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 13]: I 'll lend it to you to wrap round your shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 8]: `` No , you wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 4]: Claire cried defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 5]: `` Shetland shawl indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 13]: Who ever heard of a girl of twenty-one in a Shetland shawl ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 10]: I 'm going to a party , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 15]: The joy of that thought would keep me warm through a dozen fogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 22]: `` You 'll have to come back from the party , however , and you may n't feel so jubilant then .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 21]: It 's not too exciting when you do n't know a soul , and sit on one seat all evening .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 20]: I knew a girl who went to a big crush and did n't even get a cup of coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 8]: Nobody asked her to go down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 42]: Claire swept her cloak to one side , and sat down on a chair facing the sofa , her white gloves clasped on her knee , the embroidered bag hanging by its golden cords to the tip of the golden slippers .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 28]: She fixed her eyes steadily on her companion , and there was in them a spark of anger , before which Cecil had the grace to flush .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 3]: `` Sorry !
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 35]: Really I am sorry -- '' '' ` Repentance is to _ leave _ The sins we loved before , And show that we in earnest grieve By doing so No More ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 4]: quoted Claire sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 15]: `` Really , Cecil , you are the champion wet blanket of your age .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 5]: It is too bad .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 25]: I have to do all the perking up , and you ca n't even let me go to a party without damping my ardour .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 18]: I was thinking it over the other night , and I 've hit on a promising plan .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 16]: I 'm going to allow you a grumble day a week -- but only one .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 27]: On that day you can grumble as much as ever you like , from the moment you get up till the moment you go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 13]: You 'll be within your rights , and I shall not complain .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 33]: I 'll have my own day , too , when you can find out what it feels like to listen , but wo n't be allowed to say a word in return .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 16]: For the rest of the week you 'll just have to grin and bear it .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 10]: You wo n't be allowed a single growl . ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 22]: Cecil knitted her brows , and looked ashamed and uncomfortable , as she invariably did when taxed with her besetting sin .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 35]: Claire 's charge on mental poisoning had struck home , and she had honestly determined to turn over a new leaf ; but the habit had been indulged too long to be easily abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 31]: Unconsciously , as it were , disparaging remarks flowed from her lips , combined with a steady string of objections , adverse criticisms , and presentiments of darkness and gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 34]: At the present moment she felt a little startled to realise how firmly the habit was established , and the proposal of a licenced grumble day held out some promise of a cure .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 8]: `` Then I 'll have Monday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 4]: she cried briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 25]: `` I am always in a bad temper on Mondays , so I shall be able to make the most of my chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 18]: She was silent for a moment considering the prospect , then was struck with a sudden thought .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 25]: `` But now and then I _ do _ have a nice week-end , and then I should n't want to grumble at all .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 9]: I suppose I could change the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 11]: There was a ring of triumph in Claire 's laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 4]: `` Not you !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 13]: My dear girl , that 's just what I am counting upon !
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 59]: Sometimes the sun will shine , sometimes you 'll get a nice letter , sometimes the girls will be intelligent and interesting , and then , my dear , you 'll forget , and the day will skip past , and before you know where you are it will be Tuesday morning and your chance will have gone .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 5]: Cecil , fancy it !
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 7]: A whole fortnight without a grumble .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 10]: It seems almost too good to be true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 5]: `` It does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 6]: said the English mistress eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 39]: She sat upright on the green plush sofa , her shabby slippers well in evidence beneath the edge of her shabby skirt , staring with curious eyes at the radiant figure of the girl in the opposite chair .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 13]: `` I do n't think you need a day at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 10]: `` Because I 'm going to a solitary party ?
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 16]: Only two minutes ago , my love , you were sympathising with my hard lot !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 5]: I shall have Fridays .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 18]: I 'm tired on Fridays , and it 's getting near the time for making up accounts .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 11]: I can be quite a creditable grumbler on Fridays . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 8]: `` Well , just as you like !
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 12]: You _ are _ going to the party , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 18]: Have n't changed your mind by any chance , and determined to spend the evening hectoring me !
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 10]: If you are going , you 'd better go .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 18]: I 'll sit up for you and keep some cocoa -- '' Claire rose with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 6]: `` I appreciate the inference !
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 15]: Starved and disillusioned , I am to creep home and weep on your bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 6]: Well , we 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 5]: Good-bye for the present .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 39]: I 'll tell you all about it when I get back ... '' A minute 's whistling at the front door produced a taxi , in which Claire seated herself and was whirled westward through brightly lighted streets .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 32]: In the less fashionable neighbourhoods the usual Saturday crowd thronged round the shops and booths , making their purchases at an hour when perishable goods could be obtained at bargain prices .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 35]: Claire and Cecil had themselves made such expeditions before now , coming home triumphant with some savoury morsel for supper , and with quite a lavish supply of flowers to deck the little room .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 68]: At the time the expeditions had been pleasant enough , and there had seemed nothing in the least _ infra dig _ in taking advantage of the opportunity ; but to-night the girl in the cloudy cloak looked through the windows of her chariot with an ineffable condescension , and found it difficult to believe that she herself had ever made one of so insignificant a throng !
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 7]: `` How I do love luxury !
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 42]: It 's the breath of my nostrils , '' she said to herself with a little sigh of content , as she straightened herself in her seat , and smiled back at her own reflection in the strip of mirror opposite .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 9]: Her hair had `` gone '' just right .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 6]: What a comfort that was !
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 14]: Sometimes it took a stupid turn and could not be induced to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 36]: She opened the cloak at the top and peeped at the dainty whiteness within , with the daring , thoroughly French touch of vivid emerald green which gave a _ cachet _ to the whole .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 12]: Yes , it was quite as pretty as she had believed .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 5]: Every whit as becoming .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 14]: `` I do n't look a bit like a school - mistress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 17]: smiled Claire , and snoodled back again against the cushions with a deep breath of content .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 8]: She was not in the least shy .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 62]: Many a girl about to make her _ entree _ into a strange house would have been suffering qualms of misgiving by this time , but Claire had spent her life more or less in public , and was accustomed to meet strangers as a matter of course , so there was no dread to take the edge off her enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 51]: Even when the taxi slowed down to take its place in the stream of vehicles which were drawn up before Mrs Willoughby 's house , she knew only a heightened enjoyment in the realisation that it was not a party at all , but a real big fashionable At Home .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 39]: The usual crowd of onlookers stood on either side of the door , and as Claire descended from the taxi , the sight of her golden slippers and floating clouds of gauze evoked a gratifying murmur of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 39]: She passed on with her head in the air , looking neither to right nor left , but close against the rails stood a couple of working girls whose wistful eyes drew her own as with a magnet .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 42]: In their expression was a whole world of awe , of admiration ; they looked at her as at a denizen of another sphere , hardly presuming even to be envious , so infinitely was she removed from their grey-hued life .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 60]: As Claire met their eyes , an impulse seized her to stop and tell them that she was just a working girl like themselves , but convention being too strong to allow of such familiarities , she smiled instead , with such a frank and friendly acknowledgment of their admiration as brought a flash of pleasure to their faces .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 11]: `` She 's a real laidy , she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 22]: said Gladys to Maud ; and Maud sniffed in assent , and answered strongly , `` You bet your life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 15]: The inside of the house seemed out of all proportion with the outside appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 20]: This is a special peculiarity of the West End , which has puzzled many a visitor besides Claire Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 21]: What _ is _ the magic which transforms narrow slips of buildings into spacious halls and imposing flights of stairways ?
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 31]: Viewed from the street , the town houses of well-known personages seem quite inadequate for their purpose ; viewed from within , they are all that is stately and appropriate .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 15]: Those of us who live in less favoured neighbourhoods would fain solve the riddle .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 39]: Mrs Willoughby stood at the top of her own staircase , shaking hands with the stream of ascending guests , and motioning them forward to the suite of entertaining rooms from which came a steady murmur of voices .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 32]: She was a stout woman , with a vast expanse of white shoulders which seemed to join right on to her head without any preliminary in the shape of a neck .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 23]: Her hair was dark , and a plain face was lightened by a pair of exceedingly pleasant , exceedingly alert brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 35]: As soon as she met those eyes Claire felt assured that the kindness of which she had heard was a real thing , and that this woman could be counted upon as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 32]: There was , it is true , a slight vagueness in the manner in which she made her greeting , but a murmur of `` Mrs Fanshawe '' instantly revived recollections .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 8]: `` Of course -- of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 4]: she cried heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: `` So glad you could come , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 7]: I must see you later on .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 3]: Reginald ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 22]: -- she beckoned to a lad in an Eton suit -- `` I want you to take charge of Miss Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 16]: Take her to have some coffee , and introduce her to some one nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 70]: A nod and a smile , and Mrs Willoughby had turned back to welcome the next guest in order , while the Eton boy offered his arm with the air of a prince of the blood , and led the way to a refreshment buffet around which the guests were swarming with an eagerness astonishing to behold when one realised how lately they must have risen from the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 11]: Claire found her young cavalier very efficient in his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 37]: He settled her in a comfortable corner , brought her a cup of coffee heaped with foaming cream , and gave it as his opinion that it was going to be `` a beastly crush . ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 33]: Claire wondered if it would be tactful to inquire how he happened to be at home in the middle of a term ; but while she hesitated he supplied the information himself .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: `` I 'm home on leave .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 2]: Appendicitis .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 8]: Left the nursing home three weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 15]: Been at the sea , and came back yesterday in time for this show .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 8]: Getting a bit tired of slacking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 5]: `` You must be .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 6]: I _ am _ sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 18]: Too bad to begin so soon , '' murmured Claire pitifully ; but Master Reginald disdained sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 11]: `` Oh , I dunno , '' he said calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 13]: `` It 's quite the correct thing , do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 5]: Everybody 's doing it .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 8]: Just as well to get it through .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 24]: It might '' -- he opened his pale eyes with a startled look -- `` it might have come on in the hols !
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 17]: Pretty fool I should have looked if I 'd been done out of winter sports . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 11]: `` There 's that way of looking at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 4]: Claire said demurely .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 43]: For a moment she debated whether she should break the fact that she herself was a school-mistress , but decided that it would be wiser to refrain since the boy would certainly feel more at ease with her in her private capacity .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 37]: So for the next half-hour they sat happily together in their corner , while the boy discoursed on the subjects nearest his heart , and the girl deftly switched him back to the subjects more congenial .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 7]: `` Yes , I love cricket .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 35]: At least I 'm sure I should do , if I understood it better ... _ Do _ tell me who is the big old lady with the eyeglass and the diamond tiara ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 10]: `` Could n't tell you to save my life .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 8]: Rather an out-size , is n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 5]: Towers over the men .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 21]: you ought to go to Lord 's Will you turn up at Lord 's next year to see our match ?
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 11]: We might meet somewhere and I 'd give you tea .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 7]: Harrow wo n't have a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 13]: We 've got a bowler who -- '' `` Can he really ?
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 3]: How nice !
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 14]: Oh , that _ is _ a curious-looking man with the long hair !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 15]: I 'm sure he is something , or does something different from other people .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: Is he a musician , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 10]: Do you ever have music on these evenings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 3]: `` Rather !
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 15]: Sometimes the mater hires a big swell , sometimes she lets loose the amateurs .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 9]: She knows lots of amateurs , y' know .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 16]: People who are trying to be big-wigs , and want the chance to show off .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 5]: The mater encourages them .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 18]: Great mistake if you ask me , but you need n't listen if you do n't want .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 10]: She has one of these crushes once a month .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 7]: Beastly dull , I call them .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 8]: Ca n't think why the people come .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 9]: But she gives them a rattling good feed .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 12]: Supper comes on at twelve , in the dining-room downstairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 8]: But Claire was not interested in supper .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 55]: All her attention was taken up in watching the stream of people passing by , and for a time the youth of her companion had seemed an advantage , since it made it easy to indulge her curiosity concerning her fellow-guests by a succession of questions which might have been boring to an adult .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 49]: As time passed on , however , and she became conscious that more than one pair of masculine eyes turned in her direction , she wished frankly Master Reginald would remember his mother 's instructions and proceed without further delay to introduce her to `` someone nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 30]: To return home and confess to Cecil that she had spent the evening in company with a schoolboy would be almost as humiliating as sitting alone in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 56]: It was at this point that Claire became aware of the presence of a very small , very wizened old woman sitting alone at the opposite side of the room , her mittened hands clawing each other restlessly in her lap , her sunken eyes glancing to right and left with a glance distinctly hostile .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 35]: The passing of guests frequently hid her from view , but when a gap came again , there she sat , still alone , still twisting her mittened hands , still coldly staring around .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 20]: Claire thought she looked a very disagreeable old lady , but she was sorry for her all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 15]: Horrid to be old and cross , and to be alone in a crowd !
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 12]: She put yet another question to the boy by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 14]: `` That , '' said Master Willoughby seriously , `` is Great-aunt Jane .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 11]: Great - aunt Jane is the skeleton in our cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 11]: The mater says so , and she ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 30]: Every time the mater has a show , the moment the door is opened , in comes Great-aunt Jane , and sits it out until every one has gone .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 35]: If any one dares speak to her she snaps his head off , and if they let her alone , she 's furious , and gives it to the mater after they 're gone .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 24]: Most of the crowd know her by now , and pretend they do n't see , ... and she gets waxier and waxier .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: Would you like to be introduced ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 6]: `` Yes , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 4]: said Claire unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 34]: She was tired of sitting in one corner , and wanted to move her position , but she was also quite genuinely anxious to try her hand at cheering poor cross Great-aunt Jane .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 40]: The old lady _ pensionnaires _ in the `` Villa Beau Sejour '' had made a point of petting and flattering the pretty English girl , and Claire was complacently assured that this old lady would follow their example .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: But she was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 13]: `` Aunt Jane , Miss Gifford asks to be introduced to you .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 8]: Miss Gifford -- Lady Jane Willoughby . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 24]: Reginald beat a hurried retreat , and Claire seated herself at the end of the sofa and smilingly awaited her companion 's lead .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 5]: It did not come .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 35]: After one automatic nod of the head , Lady Jane resumed her former position , taking no more notice of the new-comer than if she had remained at the far end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 8]: Claire felt her cheeks begin to burn .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 23]: Her complacence had suffered a shock , but pride came to her rescue , and she made a determined effort at conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 15]: `` That nice boy has been telling me that he has had appendicitis . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 9]: Lady Jane favoured her with a frosty glance .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 6]: `` Yes , he has .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 10]: Perhaps you will excuse me from talking about it .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 12]: I object to the discussion of diseases at social gatherings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 7]: Claire 's cheeks grew hotter still .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 8]: A quick retort came to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 9]: `` I was n't going to discuss it !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 11]: I only mentioned it for -- for something to say .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 10]: I could n't think how else to begin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 19]: The droop of Lady Jane 's eyelids inferred that it was really quite superfluous to begin at all .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 16]: Claire waited a whole two minutes by the clock , and then made another effort .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 13]: `` I hear we are to have some music later on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 11]: `` Sorry to hear it , '' said Great-aunt Jane .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 3]: `` Really !
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 5]: I was so glad .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 10]: Are n't you fond of music , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 24]: `` I am very fond of music , '' said Aunt Jane , and there was a world of insinuation in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 43]: Without a definite word being spoken , the hearer was informed that good music , real music , music worthy the name , was a thing that no sane person would expect to hear at Mrs Willoughby 's `` At Homes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 26]: She was really the most terrifying and disconcerting of old ladies , and Claire heartily repented the impulse which had brought her to her side .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 21]: A pretty thing it would be if she were left alone on this sofa for the rest of the evening !
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 38]: But fortune was kind , and from across the room came a good angel who was so exactly a reproduction of Mrs Willoughby herself , minus half her age , that it must obviously be her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 35]: Janet Willoughby was not a pretty girl , but she looked gay , and bright , and beaming with good humour , and at this moment with a spice of mischief into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 25]: The manner in which she held out her hand to Claire was as friendly as though the two girls had been friends for years .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 4]: `` Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 8]: I was sure it must be you .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 8]: Mother told me to look for you .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 13]: Aunt Jane , will you excuse my running away with Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 8]: Several people are asking to be introduced .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 9]: Will you come with me , Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 11]: I want to take you into the music room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 29]: Claire rose with a very leap of eagerness , and as soon as they had gained a safe distance , Miss Willoughby turned to her with twinkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 11]: `` I am afraid you were having a bad time !
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 13]: I caught sight of you across the room and was so sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 6]: Who took you over there ?
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 7]: Was it that naughty Reginald ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 9]: `` He did , but I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 6]: I thought she looked lonely .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 9]: I thought perhaps she would be pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 9]: Janet Willoughby 's smile showed a quick approval .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 5]: `` That was kind !
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 17]: Thanks for the good intention , but I ca n't let you be victimised any more .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 24]: I want to talk to you myself , and half-a-dozen men have been asking for introductions to the girl with the green sash .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 9]: You know Mrs Fanshawe , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 5]: Is n't she charming ?
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 9]: She and I are the greatest of chums .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 13]: I always say she has never succeeded in growing older than seventeen .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: She is so delightfully irresponsible and impulsive .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 9]: She wrote mother a charming letter about you .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 21]: It made us quite anxious to meet you , but you know what town life is -- a continual rush !
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 6]: Everything gets put off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 22]: `` It was awfully good of you to ask me at all , and very kind of Mrs Fanshawe to write .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 10]: I only know her in the most casual way .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 52]: We crossed over from Antwerp together , and her maid was ill , and I was able to be of some use , and when she heard that I was coming to work in London and that I knew nobody here -- she -- '' Jane Willoughby stared in frank amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 10]: `` Do you really mean that that was all ?
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: You met her only that one time ?
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 11]: You know nothing of her home or her people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 5]: `` Only that time .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 35]: I hope -- I hope you do n't think -- '' Claire suffered an anxious moment before she realised that for some unexplained reason Miss Willoughby was more pleased than annoyed by the intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 12]: An air of something extraordinarily like relief passed over her features .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 23]: She laughed gaily and said -- `` I do n't think anything at all except that it is delightfully like Mrs Fanshawe .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 11]: She wrote as if she had known you for ages .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 15]: As a matter of fact she probably _ does _ know you quite well .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 26]: She is so extraordinarily quick and clever , that she crowds as much life into an hour as an ordinary person does into a week .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 25]: She told us that you had chosen to come to London to work , rather than go to India and have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 5]: How plucky of you !
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 23]: And you teach at one of the big High Schools ... You do n't look in the least like a school-mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 6]: I 'm off duty to-night !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 13]: You should see me in the morning , in my working clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 28]: You should see me at night , correcting exercises on the dining-table in a lodging-house parlour , and cooking sausages in a chafing-dish for our evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 28]: I ` dig ' with the English mistress , and do most of our cooking myself , as the landlady 's tastes and ours do n't agree .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 14]: I 'm getting to be quite an expert at manufacturing sixpenny dainties . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 20]: Janet Willoughby breathed a deep sigh ; the diamond star on her neck sent out vivid gleams of light .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 5]: `` What fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 4]: she sighed enviously .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 5]: `` What fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 63]: and as she spoke there flashed suddenly before the eyes of her listener a picture of the English mistress lying on the green plush sofa , her shabby slippers showing beneath the hem of her shabby skirt , spending the holiday Saturday evening at home because she had no invitations to go out , and no money to spare for an entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 11]: `` Oh , I _ do _ envy you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 4]: sighed Janet deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 31]: `` It 's one of my greatest ambitions to share rooms with a nice girl , and live the simple life , and be free to do whatever one liked .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 16]: Mother loves independence in other girls , but her principles do n't extend to me .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 11]: She says an only daughter 's place is at home .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 10]: But you are an only daughter , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 10]: `` I am ; but other circumstances were different .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 36]: It was a case of being dependent on a stepfather or of working for myself -- so I chose to work , and -- '' `` And I 'm sure you never regret it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 10]: Claire extended her hands in the expressive French shrug .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 7]: `` Ah , but I do !
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 5]: Horribly , at times .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 40]: Even now , after three months ' work I have a conviction that I shall regret it more and more as time goes on ; but if I had to decide again , I 'd do just the same .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 41]: It 's a question of principle versus so many things -- laziness and self-indulgence , and wanting to have a good time , and the habits of a lifetime , and irritation with stupid girls who wo n't work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 9]: Janet Willoughby gave a soft murmur of understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 6]: `` Yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 7]: Stupid of me to say that !
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 14]: Of course , you must get tired when you 've never taught before .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 8]: Does it bore you very much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 3]: `` Teaching ?
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 4]: Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 20]: As a rule I love it , and take a pride in inventing new ways to help the girls .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 37]: It 's the all work and no play that gets on one 's nerves , and the feeling of being cut off from the world by an impassable barrier of something that really does n't exist .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 7]: People have a prejudice against school-mistresses .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 12]: They think they are dull , and proper , and pedantic .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 19]: If they want to be complimentary they say , ` You do n't look like a school-mistress . '
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 9]: You did yourself , not two minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 26]: But really and truly they are just natural , everyday girls , wanting to have a good time in their leisure hours like other girls .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 24]: You ca n't think how happy I was to come here to-night and have the chance of putting on pretty things again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 17]: Janet Willoughby put her hand on Claire 's arm and piloted her deftly through the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 33]: `` Now , '' she said firmly , `` you just stay here , and I 'll bring up all the nicest men in the room , and introduce them in turns .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 32]: You _ shall _ have a good time , and you are wearing the very prettiest things in the room -- if it 's any comfort to you to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 9]: We wo n't talk about school any more .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 6]: To-night is for fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 48]: The next hour passed on flying feet , while Claire sat the queen of a little court , and Janet Willoughby flitted to and fro , bringing up fresh arrivals to be introduced , and drafting off the last batch to other parts of the crowded rooms .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 17]: All the men were agreeable and amusing , and showed a flattering appreciation of their position .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 36]: Claire felt no more interest in one than in another , but she liked them all , and felt a distinct pleasure in talking to men again after the convent-like existence of the last months .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 14]: She was pleased to welcome a new-comer , smiled unconcerned at a farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 36]: From time to time the buzz of voices was temporarily broken by the crash of the piano , but always before the end of each performance it rose again , and steadily swelled in volume .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 26]: In truth , the excellence of the performance was no great inducement to listen , and Mrs Willoughby 's forehead showed a pucker of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 24]: She drifted across to Claire 's corner , and spoke a few kindly words of welcome , which ended in a half apology .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: `` I am sorry the music is so poor .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 8]: It varies so much on different nights .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 16]: Sometimes we have quite a number of good singers , but to-night there are none .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 12]: I am afraid so much piano grows a little boring . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 12]: She looked in the girl 's face with a quick inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 8]: `` Do _ you _ sing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 4]: `` No-o . ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 16]: The word seemed final , yet there was an unmistakable hesitation in Claire 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: Mrs Willoughby 's glance sharpened .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 6]: `` But you do something ?
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 2]: Play ?
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 2]: Recite ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 10]: My dear , I should be so grateful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 6]: `` I -- whistle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 16]: confessed Claire with a blush , and a little babble of delight greeted the words .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 15]: Every one who heard hailed the chance of a variety in the monotonous programme .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 15]: Mrs Willoughby beamed with all the relief of a hostess unexpectedly relieved of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 3]: `` Delightful !
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 2]: Charming !
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 10]: My dear , it will be such a help !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 6]: You would like an accompaniment ?
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 8]: I 'll introduce you to Mr Helder .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 7]: He can play anything you like .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 5]: Will you come now !
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 10]: I am sure every one will be charmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 9]: There was no time for a second thought .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 19]: The next moment the long-haired Mr Helder was bowing over Claire 's hand , and professing his delight .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 30]: The little group in the corner were pressing forward to obtain a point of vantage , and throughout the company in general was passing a wordless hum of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 82]: Mr Helder was seating himself at the piano , a girl in a white dress had ascended the impromptu platform and now stood by his side , a pretty girl , a very pretty girl , a girl who acknowledged the scattered applause with a smile which showed two dimples on one cheek , a girl who looked neither shy nor conceited , but simply as if she were enjoying herself very much , and expected everybody to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 6]: She was going to sing .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 17]: It would be a relief to listen to singing after the continued performances upon the piano .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 9]: They hoped sincerely that she could sing well .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 7]: Why did n't the accompaniment begin ?
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 49]: Then suddenly a white-gloved hand gave a signal , Mr Helder 's hands descended on the keys , and at the same instant from between Claire 's pursed-up lips there flowed a stream of high , flute-like notes , repeating the air with a bird-like fluency and ease .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 43]: She had chosen the old-world ballad , `` Cherry Ripe , '' the quaint turns and trills of which lent themselves peculiarly well to this method of interpretation , and the swing and gaiety of the measure carried the audience by storm .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 25]: Looking down from her platform Claire could see the indifferent faces suddenly lighten into interest , into smiles , into positive beams of approval .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 18]: At the second verse heads began to wag ; unconsciously to their owners lips began to purse .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 22]: It was inspiring to watch those faces , to know that it was she herself who had wrought the magic change .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 9]: Those moments for Claire were pure undiluted joy .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 37]: Whistling had come to her as a natural gift , compensating to some extent for the lack of a singing voice ; later on she had taken lessons , and practised seriously to perfect her facility .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 67]: At school in Paris , later on in attending social gatherings with her mother , she had had abundant opportunities of overcoming the initial shyness ; but indeed shyness was never a serious trouble with Claire Gifford , who was gifted with that very agreeable combination of qualities , -- an amiable desire to please other people , and a comfortable assurance of her own powers .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 15]: At the end of the third verse the applause burst out with a roar .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 27]: `` Bravos '' sounded from every side , and `` Encores '' persisted so strenuously that Claire was not permitted even to descend from her platform .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 10]: Mrs Willoughby rustled forward full of gratitude and thanks .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 24]: Mr Helder rubbed his hands , and beamingly awaited further commands ... What would Cecil have to say to a success like this ?
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 35]: Claire 's second choice was one of Mendelssohn 's `` Songs without Words , '' a quieter measure this time , sweet and flowing , and giving opportunity for a world of delicate phrasing .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 50]: It was one of the pieces which she had practised with a master , and with which she felt most completely at home ; and if the audience found it agreeable to hear , they also , to judge from their faces , found it equally agreeable to watch .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 33]: Claire 's cheeks were flushed to a soft rose-pink , her head moved to and fro , unconsciously keeping time with the air ; one little golden shoe softly tapped the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 12]: Her unconsciousness of self added to the charm of the performance .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 33]: But once the audience noticed , with sympathetic amusement , her composure was seriously threatened , so that the bird-like notes quavered ominously , and the twin dimples deepened into veritable holes .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 32]: Claire had caught sight of Great-aunt Jane standing in solitary state at the rear of the throng of listeners , her mittened fingers still plucking , her eyes frosty with disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 37]: After that Claire safeguarded her composure by looking steadily downward at the points of her shoes until the end of the song approached , when it seemed courteous , once more , to face her audience .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 20]: She raised her eyes , and as she did so her heart leapt within her with a startling force .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 55]: She was thankful that it _ was _ the end , that the long final note was already on her lips , for there , standing in the doorway , his face upraised to hers , stood her knight of the railway station , the rescuer of the lost box -- Erskine Fanshawe himself !
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 3]: THE SUPPER .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 95]: Claire stepped down from the platform to be surrounded by a throng of guests all eager to express their admiration of her interesting performance , to marvel how she could `` do it , '' and to congratulate her upon so unusual an accomplishment ; and she smiled and bowed , declared that it was quite easy , and perjured herself by maintaining that anyone could do as well , acutely conscious all the time that Captain Fanshawe was drawing nearer with determined steps , edging his way towards the front of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 22]: The next moment her hand was in his , and he was greeting her with the assurance of a lifelong friend .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 7]: `` Good evening , Miss Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 10]: Had n't we better make straight for supper now ?
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 9]: I am sure you must need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 7]: It was practically the ordinary invitation .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 38]: There was nothing to find fault with in the words themselves , yet the impression of a previous arrangement was obviously left with the hearers , who fell back , giving way as to a superior right .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 48]: As for Claire , she laid her hand on the extended arm , with all the good will in the world , and made a triumphant passage through the crowd , which smiled upon her as though agreeing that it was now her turn to be amused .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: `` This table , I think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 64]: Captain Fanshawe said , leading the way to the furthest corner of the dining-room , and Claire found herself sipping a hot cup of soup , and realising that the world was an agreeable place , and that it was folly ever to allow oneself to be downhearted , since such delightful surprises awaited round corners ready to transform the grey into gold !
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 37]: Captain Fanshawe looked exactly as memory had pictured him -- plain of feature , distinguished in bearing , grave , self-contained , yet with that lurking light in his eyes which showed that humour lay beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 23]: Claire smiled at him across the table , and asked an obvious question -- `` Rather a different meeting-place from our last !
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 8]: Did you know me at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 20]: `` I did , '' he said , and added deliberately , `` Just as you knew me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 6]: `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 6]: Claire tried to look unconcerned .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 9]: `` Men are always pretty much the same .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 12]: Evening dress does not make the same difference to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 49]: She knew a momentary fear lest he should believe she was fishing for a compliment , and give the ordinary banal reply ; but he looked at her with a grave scrutiny , and asked quietly -- `` Was that one of the frocks which went astray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 4]: All of it .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: It was n't even divided in half . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 12]: `` It was a good thing the box turned up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 26]: he said ; and there , after all , was the compliment , but so delicately inferred that the most fastidious taste could not object .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 36]: With the finishing of the soup came the first reference to Claire 's work , for the Captain 's casual `` Do you care for anything solid , or would you prefer a sweet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 7]: evoked a round-eyed stare of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ please _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 4]: cried Claire deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: `` I want to go straight through .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 20]: I 've been living on mutton and cabbage for over two months , and cooking suppers on a chafing-dish .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 12]: I looked forward to supper as part of the treat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 9]: The plain face lightened into a delightful smile .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 7]: `` That 's all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 8]: `` Now we know where we are .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 13]: I had n't much dinner myself , so I 'm quite game .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 10]: Let us study the book of the words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 19]: A _ menu _ lay on the table , a square white card emblazoned with many golden words .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 26]: Captain Fanshawe drew his chair nearer , and ran his finger down the list , while Claire bent forward to signify a yea or nay .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 33]: Every delicacy in season and out of season seemed to find its place on that list , which certainly justified Master Reginald 's eulogy of his mother 's `` good feeds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 38]: Claire found it quite a serious matter to decide between so many good things , and even with various curtailments , made rather out of pride than inclination , the meal threatened to last some considerable time .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 69]: there was obvious satisfaction in the manner in which Captain Fanshawe delivered his orders , and for herself , she had been dignified and self-denying ; she had resolutely shut the door between this man and herself , and devoted herself to work , and now , since fate had thrown him in her way for a chance hour , she could enjoy herself with a light mind .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 25]: It was good to talk to a man again , to hear a deep masculine voice , to look at a broad strong frame .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 20]: Putting aside all question of love and marriage , the convent life is no more satisfying than the monastic .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 14]: Each sex was designed by God to be the complement of the other .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: Each must suffer from lack of the other 's companionship .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 16]: `` I arrived just as you began your performance , '' Captain Fanshawe informed her .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 9]: `` It was a great ` draw . '
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 7]: Everybody had crowded forward to listen .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 19]: It was only towards the end of your second -- er -- how exactly should one express it ?
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 14]: -- _ morceau _ , that I managed to get into seeing line .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 5]: It was a surprise !
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 8]: Have you known the Willoughbys long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 6]: Claire looked at him blankly .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 8]: `` I never saw them before to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: Your mother wrote to ask them if they would send me a card . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 45]: Captain Fanshawe was certainly surprised , and Claire mentally snubbed herself because at the bottom of her heart there had lain a suspicion that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he had come to-night in the hope of meeting his acquaintance of the railway station .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 16]: This was not the case ; no thought of her had been in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 12]: Probably until the moment of meeting he had forgotten her existence .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 13]: They _ had _ met , and he was agreeable and friendly .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 19]: Now for a delightful half-hour ... `` That was a good thought of the _ mater 's _ .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 5]: You will like them .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 5]: They are delightful people .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 13]: Just the people you ought to know as a stranger in town .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 10]: How goes the school teaching , by the way ?
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 7]: As well as you expected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 7]: Claire deliberated , with pursed lips .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 9]: I expected so much ; I always do .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 10]: But much better than other people expected for me .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 7]: Theoretically it 's a fine life .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 12]: There are times when it seems that nothing could be finer .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 8]: But -- '' `` But what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 18]: `` I do n't think it 's quite satisfying , as a _ whole _ life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 8]: `` Does anyone suppose it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 5]: `` They try to .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 4]: They have to .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 10]: For most teachers there is so little else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 27]: The waiter handed plates of lobster mayonnaise , and Captain Fanshawe said quietly -- `` Tell me about the times when the work seems fine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 6]: `` Ah -- many times !
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 22]: It depends on one 's own mood and health , because , of course , the circumstances are always the same .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 33]: There are mornings when one looks round a big class-room and sees all the girls ' faces looking upwards , and it gives one quite a thrilling sense of power and opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 11]: That is what the heaven-born teacher must feel every time .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 20]: -- ` Here is the fresh virgin soil , and mine is the joy of planting the right seed !
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 14]: Here are the women of the future , the mothers of the race .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 7]: For this hour they are mine .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 8]: What I say , they must hear .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 14]: They will listen with an attention which even their parents can not gain .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 15]: The words which I speak this morning may bear fruit in many lives . '
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 31]: That 's the ideal attitude , but the ordinary human woman has other mornings when all she feels is -- ` Oh , dear me , six hours of this !
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 6]: And what 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 11]: Everything I batter in to-day will be forgotten by to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 10]: What 's the ideal anyway in teaching French verbs ?
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 9]: I want to go to bed . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 18]: They laughed together , but Captain Fanshawe sobered quickly , and his brow showed furrows of distress .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 19]: Claire looked at him and said quickly -- `` Do you mind if we do n't talk school ?
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 13]: I am Cinderella to-night , wearing fine clothes and supping in state .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 11]: I 'd so much rather talk Cinderella to match . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 5]: `` Certainly , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 6]: Just as you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 31]: Lolling back in his chair , Captain Fanshawe adopted an air of _ blase _ indifference , and drawled slowly , `` Quite a good winter , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 4]: Lots going on .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 9]: Have you been to the Opera lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 24]: thought Claire with a gush , `` how refreshing to meet a grown - up man who can pretend like a child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 15]: She simpered , and replied artificially , `` Oh , yes -- quite often .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 21]: The dear Duchess is _ so _ kind ; her box is open to me whenever I choose to go .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 7]: Wonderful scene , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 8]: All those tiers rising one above another .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 9]: Do you ever look up at the galleries ?
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 16]: Such funny people sit there -- men in tweed suits ; girls in white blouses .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 10]: Who _ are _ they , should you think ?
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 13]: Clerks and typists and school-mistresses , and people of that persuasion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 7]: `` Possibly , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 4]: One never knows .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 13]: They look quite respectable and quiet , do n't you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 10]: The twinkle was alight in Captain Fanshawe 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 22]: It shone more brightly still as he added , `` Everybody turns up sooner or later in the Duchess 's box .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 10]: Have you happened to meet -- the Prince ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 13]: For a moment Claire groped for the connection , then dimpled merrily .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 4]: `` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 24]: but I am hoping -- '' The waiter approached with plates of chicken in aspic , and more rolls of crisp browned bread .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 22]: Claire sent a thought to Cecil finishing a box of sardines , with her book propped up against the cocoa jug .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 22]: The Cinderella _ role _ was forgotten while her eyes roved around , studying the silver dishes on the various tables .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 19]: `` When you were a small boy , Captain Fanshawe , did you go out to parties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 6]: Captain Fanshawe knitted his brows .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 22]: This charming girl was a little difficult to follow conversationally ; she leapt from one subject to another with disconcerting agility .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 6]: `` Er -- pardon me !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 18]: Is that question put to me in my -- er -- private , or imaginary capacity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 6]: `` Private , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 5]: But naturally you did .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 6]: Did you have pockets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 23]: `` To the best of my remembrance I was disguised as a midshipmite , with white duck trousers of a prodigious width .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 8]: They used to crackle , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 9]: There was room for a dozen pockets . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 17]: Claire laid her arms on the table , so that her face drew nearer his own .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 21]: Her voice fell to a stage whisper -- `` Did you -- ever -- take -- something -- home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 12]: The Captain threw back his head with a peal of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 8]: `` Miss Gifford , what a question !
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 7]: I was an ordinary human boy .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 7]: _ Of course _ I did .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 19]: And sat on my spoils in the carriage going back , and was scolded for spoiling my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 9]: I had a small brother at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 9]: `` Well -- I have a small friend !
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 24]: She has letters after her name , and is very learned and clever , but she has a _ very _ sweet tooth .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 18]: Do you think , perhaps -- in this bag -- '' `` Leave it to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 35]: he said firmly , and when the waiter next appeared , he received an order to bring more bon-bons -- plenty of bon-bons -- a selection of all the small dainties in silver dishes .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 12]: `` He thinks I _ am _ having a feast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 36]: Claire said demurely , as she watched the progress of selection ; then she met Erskine Fanshawe 's eyes , and nodded in response to an unspoken question , `` And I _ am _ !
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 8]: I 'm having a lovely time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 18]: `` I wish it were possible that you could oftener -- '' `` Well , who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 23]: A week ago I had made up my mind that nothing exciting would ever happen again , and then this invitation arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 11]: What a perfect dear Miss Willoughby seems to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 3]: `` Janet ?
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 6]: She _ is _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 4]: he said warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 22]: `` She is a girl who has had everything the world can give her , and yet has come through unspoiled .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 9]: It 's not often one can say that .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 17]: Many society girls are selfish and vain , but Janet never seems to think of herself .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 9]: You 'd find her an ideal friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 9]: Claire 's brain leapt swiftly to several conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 14]: Janet Willoughby was devoted to Mrs Fanshawe ; Mrs Fanshawe returned her devotion .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 10]: Janet Willoughby was rich , and of good birth .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 10]: Mrs Fanshawe had mentally adopted her as a daughter-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 27]: Given the non-appearance of a rival on the scene , her desire would probably be fulfilled , since such sincere liking could easily ripen into love .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 46]: Just for a moment Claire felt a stab of that lone and lorn feeling which comes to solitary females at the realisation of another 's happiness ; then she rallied herself and said regretfully -- `` I 'm afraid I sha n't have the chance !
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 15]: Our lives lie too far apart , and my time is not my own .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 13]: It is only an occasional Saturday-night that I can play Cinderella . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: `` What do you do on Sundays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 14]: `` Go to church in the morning , and sleep in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 7]: Sounds elderly , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 7]: But I do enjoy that sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 13]: The hour after lunch is the most trying of the school day .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 19]: It 's all I can do sometimes to smother my yawns , and not upset the whole class .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 32]: It 's part of the Sunday rest to be able to let go , lie down hugging a hot bottle , and sleep steadily till it 's time for tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 9]: `` Where do you go to church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 10]: Claire waved an airy hand , `` it depends !
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 6]: I 've not settled down .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 10]: I am still trying which I like best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 10]: Across the table the two pairs of eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 13]: The man 's questioning , protesting , the girl 's steadily defiant .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 9]: `` Why wo n't you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 5]: came the unspoken question .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 11]: `` Why wo n't you give me a chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 12]: `` I am too proud , '' came the unspoken answer .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 10]: `` Your mother did not think me good enough .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 9]: I will accept no acquaintance by stealth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 30]: Interruption came in the shape of the waiter bearing a tray of little silver dishes filled with dainties , which he proceeded to arrange in rows on the table .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 44]: Claire relapsed into giggles at the sight , and Captain Fanshawe took refuge , man-like , in preternatural solemnity ; but he made no comment , and the moment that the man had disappeared , both heads craned eagerly to examine the spoils .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 16]: `` Chocolates , _ marrons glacis _ , crystallised peaches , French bon-bons , plums .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 9]: I do n't recognise them by head mark .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 11]: These are too sticky ... These look uncommonly good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 31]: The big fingers hovered over each dish in turn , lifting sample specimens , and placing them on Claire 's plate , whence they were swiftly conveyed to her bag .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 9]: Not a single sweetmeat touched her own lips .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 22]: The unconventionality of the action seemed to receive some justification from the fact that she was confiscating only her own share .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 22]: When the waiter returned with ices , the little bag bulged suspiciously , and the silver dishes were no longer required .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 22]: The waiter was ordered to carry them away , and plainly considered that some people did not know what they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 9]: `` The only thing lacking is a cracker .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 12]: I invariably purloined a cracker , and doubled up the ends .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 10]: I suppose we are hardly near enough to Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 11]: By the by , what are you doing for Christmas ?
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 27]: You will have holidays , of course , '' Captain Fanshawe said , with an elaborate unconsciousness , and Claire kept her eyes on her plate .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: `` I may go to Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 6]: I have n't decided . ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 15]: `` There seem to be a good many things you can not -- decide .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 13]: Miss Gifford , you have n't forgotten what I asked you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 7]: `` What did you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 45]: `` That if ever I could help -- if you ever needed help -- '' `` I shall want help badly during the next few weeks , when the examinations come on , and I have all the papers to set and correct . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 6]: Captain Fanshawe refused to smile .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 18]: `` The kind of help that a man can give -- '' `` Yes , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 56]: You were very kind , and I am still so much under the influence of the old life that I do feel you might be a comfort ; but no doubt , after some more months of school-mistressing , I shall resent the idea that a man could do any more than I could myself .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 10]: So it 's a case of soon or never .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 14]: You will hardly be cruel enough to wish to hasten my extremity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 22]: `` I 'm not so sure about that , if I could have the satisfaction of putting things to rights ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 26]: It was while she was smiling her acknowledgment of this pretty speech that Claire became conscious of Janet Willoughby 's eyes bent searchingly upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 57]: She had entered the room on the arm of her supper partner , and came to a pause not a yard away from the table where a very animated , apparently very intimate conversation was taking place between the son of her old friend and the girl to whom she had believed him to be unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 20]: As she met Claire 's glance , Janet smiled automatically , but the friendliness was gone from her glance .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 18]: The next moment Captain Fanshawe , had turned , seen her , and sprung to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 3]: `` Janet !
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 7]: Are you waiting for a table ?
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 5]: We have nearly finished .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 12]: Wo n't you sit down and talk to Miss Gifford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 14]: `` Oh , please do n't hurry ... We 'll find another place .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 7]: You have met before , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 6]: I did n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 23]: `` I saw Miss Gifford when she was befriending my mother at Liverpool Street Station , and recognised her upstairs just now .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 6]: Do sit down , Janet .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 5]: You look tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 26]: Janet Willoughby took the offered chair and exchanged a few words with Claire as she gathered together her possessions , but the subtle change persisted .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 23]: Claire felt vaguely disturbed , but the next half-hour passed so pleasantly that she had no time to puzzle over the explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 73]: Captain Fanshawe never left her side ; they sat together on the same sofa which Great-aunt Jane had monopolised for the earlier part of the evening , and talked of many things , and discussed many problems , and sometimes agreed , and oftener disagreed , and when they disagreed most widely , looked into each other 's eyes and smiled , as who should say , `` What do words matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 4]: We understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 26]: At one o'clock Claire rose to depart , and said her adieu to her hostess and her daughter , who were standing side by side .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 9]: `` My dear , it is too bad .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 27]: I have had _ no _ time with you , and I am so grateful for the charming way in which you came to the rescue !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 9]: We shall hope to see you often again .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 6]: Sha n't we , Janet ?
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 12]: You girls must arrange a day which suits you both . ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , we must ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 47]: Janet said , as she shook hands , but she made no attempt to make the arrangement there and then , as her mother obviously expected , and Claire realised , with a sinking of the heart , that a promised friendship had received a check .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 25]: When she descended to the hall wrapped in her filmy cloak it was to find Captain Fanshawe waiting at the foot of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 19]: He looked worried and grave , and the front door was reached before he made the first remark .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 18]: Then , lingering tentatively on the threshold , he looked down at her with a searching glance .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 14]: `` Is -- er -- is your address still the Grand Hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 8]: Claire 's face set into firm lines .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 7]: `` Still the Grand Hotel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 26]: For a moment he looked her steadily in the eyes , then said quietly -- `` And my address is still the Carlton Club ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 9]: He bowed , and turned into the house .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 14]: The footman banged the door of the taxi , and stood awaiting instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 11]: `` T-wenty-two , Laburnum Crescent , '' said Claire weakly .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 12]: Halfway through the words a sudden obstacle arose in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: It was all she could do to struggle through .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 10]: She hoped to goodness the footman did not notice .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 4]: `` There now !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 6]: what did I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 13]: You look fagged to death , and as cross as two sticks .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 15]: Five shillings wasted on taxis , and nothing for it but getting thoroughly upset .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 11]: Next time I hope you will take my advice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 19]: said Cecil , and took up her candle to grope her way up the dark stairway to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 4]: NOWHERE TO GO .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 38]: Cecil 's observance of her day of licenced grumbling was somewhat obstructed by the fact that for several weeks after Mrs Willoughby 's At Home , Monday mornings found her in a condition of excitement and gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 65]: It was a restless gaiety , which seemed to spring rather from the head than the heart , and Claire looking on with puzzled eyes had an instinct that her companion was assiduously whipping up her own spirits , playing the part of happiness with all her force , with the object of convincing the most critical of all audiences -- her own heart !
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 40]: Life was a lonely thing to Claire in these days , for Cecil went out regularly every Saturday and Sunday , returning so late that the two girls did not meet from lunch one day until breakfast the next .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 65]: She vouchsafed no explanation of her sudden plunge into society , neither beforehand when she sat stitching at pathetic little pieces of finery , nor afterwards when letting herself in with her latch-key she crept slowly to bed , never deigning to enter Claire 's room for one of those `` tell-all-about - it '' _ seances _ dear to a girl 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 24]: It was the sight of those pathetic little pieces of finery which first suggested the idea of a man to Claire 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 52]: However dear and intimate a woman friend may be , the prospect of meeting her does not inspire a fellow-woman with sufficient energy to sit up until after midnight to cover a shabby lace blouse with ninon , or to put a new silk collar and cuffs on a half-worn coat .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 51]: It is only the prospect of meeting the eyes of some male creature , who in all probability will remain supremely unconscious of the result , which stimulates such effort , and Claire , noting Cecil 's restless excitement , cast anxious thoughts towards the particular man in this case .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 14]: Was Sophie Blake correct in her deduction as to a previous unhappy romance ?
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 19]: Claire had no tangible grounds to lead her to a conclusion , but instinct induced her to agree .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 21]: Something beyond the troubles of her professional life had gone towards warping a nature that was naturally generous and warm .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 9]: In imagination Claire lived over the pitiful romance .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 7]: Poor Cecil had been badly treated .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 58]: Some selfish man had made love to her , amusing his idle hours with the society of a pretty , clever woman ; he had never seriously intended marriage , but Cecil had believed in his sincerity , had given him her whole heart , had dreamt dreams which had turned the grey of life to gold .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 7]: And then had come the end .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 6]: How had the end come ?
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 23]: Some day when they were walking together , had he suddenly announced : `` I am sailing to India next month ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 26]: or , `` We have been such capital friends , you and I. I should like you to be the first to hear my news .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 15]: I am engaged to be married to the dearest girl in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 39]: Then , because convention decrees that when her heart is wounded a woman may make no moan , had Cecil twisted her lips into a smile , and cried , `` I am so glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 17]: I hope you will be very happy , '' while the solid earth rocked around her ?
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 11]: At such thoughts as these Claire flared with righteous anger .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 14]: `` If that should ever happen to me , I would n't pretend !
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 6]: I would n't spare him .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 25]: I should look him straight in the face , and say , ` And all this time you have been pretending to love me .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 11]: -- I thank God that it _ was _ pretence .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 23]: I thank God that He has preserved me from being the wife of man who could act a double part ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 9]: But perhaps there had been no real ending .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 17]: Perhaps the man had simply grown tired , and ceased to call , ceased to write .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 12]: Oh , surely that would be the greatest tragedy of all !
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 80]: Claire 's quick brain summoned pictures of Cecil creeping down the oil-clothed stairs in her dressing-gown at the sound of the postman 's earliest knock , and creeping back with no letter in her hand ; of Cecil entering the little parlour on her return from work with a swift hungry look at the table on which the day 's letters were displayed ; seeing no letter lying there ; never , never the letter for which she watched !
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 27]: And the days would pass , and the weeks , and the months , and the old routine of life would go on just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 61]: Whatever might be her private sufferings , the English mistress must be at her post each morning at nine o'clock ; she must wrestle all day with the minds of dull girls , listless girls , clever girls , girls who were eager to learn , and girls whose energies seemed condensed in the effort to avoid learning at all .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 43]: However sore might be the English mistress 's heart , it was her duty to be bright and alert ; however exhausted her own stock of patience , she must still be a female Job in her treatment of her many pupils .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 29]: A school-mistress must banish her individuality as a woman on the threshold of the form-room ; while on duty she must banish every outside interest from her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 19]: No lying in bed , with her face to the pillow ; no weeping far into the night .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 9]: Headache and swollen eyelids are not for her .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 16]: If her love-story goes wrong , she must lock her sorrow in her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 18]: What wonder if , as a result , her mind grows bitter and her tongue grows sharp !
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 8]: `` That 's a lesson for me !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 13]: I must never , never allow myself to fall in love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 5]: sighed Claire to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 25]: It was a depressing necessity , but vaguely she allowed herself to dream of a distant Someday , when the ban should be removed .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 8]: Something might happen to set her free .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 8]: Something most certainly _ would _ happen !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 23]: Optimistic one-and-twenty is ready enough to face a short term of renunciation , but it resolutely refuses to believe in its continuance .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 20]: A shadow fell over Claire 's happy face as the practical application of this resolve came into her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 3]: Erskine Fanshawe !
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 35]: At the moment he was the one masculine figure on her horizon , but she did not disguise from herself that of all the men she had met , he attracted her the most .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 29]: What a mercy that she had had the resolution to put a stop to a friendship which might have ended in unfitting her for the work in hand !
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 37]: It had been hard to refuse the desired information , but the fact that the second refusal had been twice as hard as the first was in itself a proof of the wisdom of her decision .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 23]: And then , in illogical girlish fashion , Claire fell to wondering if perchance Captain Fanshawe would discover her address for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 23]: It would be the easiest of tasks , since he had nothing to do but to put the question to Mrs Willoughby .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 39]: At one moment Claire openly hoped that he would ; at the next she recalled the expression on Janet Willoughby 's face as she stood staring across the supper room , and then she was not so sure .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 16]: What if the continuance of the friendship brought trouble on Janet as well as herself ?
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 40]: Laboriously Claire thrust the thought of Erskine Fanshawe from her mind , but just because inclination would have led her to so blithely meet him , she felt a keener sympathy with her companion 's preparations for similar meetings .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 39]: The time of examinations had come , and night after night the dining - table of the little parlour was littered with the sheets of foolscap which were to test the progress of the pupils throughout the term .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 41]: Cecil 's older forms had been studying _ The Merchant of Venice , Richard the Second _ , and the _ Essays of Elia _ ; the younger forms , _ Tanglewood Tales _ and Kingsley 's _ Heroes _ .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 23]: She had set the questions not only as a test of memory , but with a view of drawing out original thought .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 15]: But , to judge from her groans and lamentations , the result was poor .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 14]: `` Of all the dull , stupid , unimaginative -- _ sheep _ !
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 7]: Not an original idea between them .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 16]: Every answer exactly like the last -- a hash-up of my own remarks in class .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 19]: If there 's a creature on earth I despise more than another , it 's an English flapper .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 28]: Silly , vain , egotistical -- '' Then the French mistress would scowl across the table , and say , `` Now you 've put me out !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 8]: I was just counting up my marks .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 7]: Oh , do be quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 4]: `` Sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 21]: Cecil would say shortly , and taking up her pencil slash scathing comments at the side of the foolscap sheets .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 20]: Anon she would smile , and smile again , and forgetting Claire 's request , would interrupt once more .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 11]: `` Can you remember the name of Florence Mason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 16]: `` If I strain my intellect to its utmost , I believe I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 7]: `` Well , remember , then !
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: It will be worth while .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 8]: She 'll do something -- that girl .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 33]: When you are an insignificant old woman , you may be proud to boast that you used to sit at the very table on which her first English essays were corrected . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 13]: `` So they are not all dull , stupid , unimaginative ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 8]: `` The exception proves the rule ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 14]: cried Cecil , and swept the papers together with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 5]: `` Done at last .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 6]: Now for my blouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 8]: Claire cast a glance at the clock .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 4]: `` Half-past ten .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 6]: And you are so tired .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 12]: Surely you wo n't begin to sew at this hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 4]: `` I must .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 6]: I want it for Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 18]: I tried it on last night , and it was n't a bit nice at the neck .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 9]: I 've got to alter it somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 7]: `` I have some trimming upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 32]: Just be quiet for five minutes , while I finish my list , and then I 'll bring down my scrap-box , and we 'll see what we can find . ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 11]: That scrap-box was in constant request during the next weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 79]: It was filled with the dainty oddments which a woman of means and taste collects in the course of years ; trimmings and laces , and scraps of fine brocades ; belts and buckles , and buttons of silver and paste ; glittering ends of tinsel , ends of silk and ribbons that were really too pretty to throw away , and cunning little motifs which had the magic quality of disguising deficiencies and making both ends meet .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 17]: Claire gave with a lavish hand , and Cecil 's gratitude was pathetic in its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 53]: More and more as the weeks passed on did she become obsessed with the craze for decking herself in fine garments ; new gloves , shoes , and veils were purchased to supplement the home-made garments , and one memorable night there arrived a large dress-box containing an evening dress and cloak .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 11]: `` I have been out so little these last years .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 13]: I have no clothes to wear , '' Cecil said in explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 30]: `` It 's not fair to -- er -- people , when they take you about , to look as if you had come out of the Ark. . .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 11]: And these ready-made things are _ so _ cheap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 27]: She spoke with an air of excusing herself , and with a flush of embarrassment on her cheeks , and Claire hastened to sympathise and agree .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 26]: She wondered if the embarrassment arose from the fact that for the last two weeks Cecil had not paid her share of the joint expenses !
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 49]: The omission had happened naturally enough , for on each occasion when the landlady appeared with the bill , Cecil had been absent on one of her now frequent excursions , when it had seemed the simplest thing to settle in full , and await repayment next day .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 8]: Repayment , however , had not come .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 19]: Half a dozen times over Cecil had exclaimed , `` Oh , dear , there 's that money .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 7]: I _ must _ remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 16]: but apparently she never had remembered at a moment when her purse was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 5]: Claire was honestly indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 57]: The hundred pounds which she had deposited in a bank was considerably diminished , since it had been drawn on for all her needs , but the term 's salary would be paid in a short time , and the thought of that , added to the remainder , gave her a pleasant feeling of ease .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 25]: It was only when for the third Saturday Cecil hurried off with an air of fluster and embarrassment , that an unpleasant suspicion arose .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 21]: The weekly bill was again due , and Cecil had not forgotten , she was only elaborately pretending to forget !
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 40]: Claire was not angry , she was perfectly willing to play the part of banker until the end of the term , but she hated the thought that Cecil was acting a part , and deliberately trying to deceive .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 27]: What if she had been extravagant in her expenditure on clothes and had run herself short for necessary expenses , there was nothing criminal in that !
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 44]: Foolish it might be , but a fellow-girl would understand that , after being staid and sensible for a long , long time , it was a blessed relief to the feminine mind to have a little spell of recklessness for a change .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 14]: Cecil had only to say , `` I 've run myself horribly short .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 11]: Can you pay up till I get my screw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 12]: and the whole matter would have been settled in a trice .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 11]: But to pretend to forget was so _ mean _ !
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 21]: The next morning after breakfast the vexed question of the Christmas holidays came up for discussion for the twentieth time .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 29]: Cecil had previously stated that she always spent the time with her mother , but it now appeared that to a certain extent she had changed her plans .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 18]: `` I shall have to go down over Christmas Day and the New Year , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 21]: Old people make such a fuss over those stupid anniversaries , but I shall come up again on the second .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 7]: I prefer to be in town .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 20]: We have to pay for the rooms in any case , so we may as well use them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 6]: Claire 's face lengthened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 6]: _ Pay _ for them !
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 7]: Even if we go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 5]: What did you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 18]: The landlady is n't let off her own rent , because we choose to take a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 11]: There 's no saving except for the light and coal .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 13]: By the way , I owe you for a third week now .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 6]: I _ must _ remember !
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 11]: Have you decided what you are going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 5]: Claire shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 17]: It was a forlorn feeling that Christmas was coming , and she had nowhere to go .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 34]: Until now she had gone on in faith , feeling sure that before the time arrived , some one would remember her loneliness , and invite her if only for the day itself .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 29]: Possibly Cecil in virtue of three months ' daily companionship would ask her mother 's permission to invite her friend , if only for a couple of days .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 64]: Or bright , friendly Sophie Blake , who had sympathised with her loneliness , might have some proposition to make , or Mrs Willoughby , who was so interested in girls who were working for themselves , or Miss Farnborough , who knew that it was the French mistress 's first Christmas without her mother ; but no such suggestion had been made .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 6]: No one seemed to care .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 17]: `` I must say it 's _ strange _ that no one has invited you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 4]: said Cecil sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 21]: `` I do n't think much of your grand friends if they ca n't look after you on Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 7]: What about the people in Brussels ?
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 8]: Did no one send you an invitation ?
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 30]: If you lived there for three years , surely you must know some one intimately enough to offer to go , even if they do n't suggest it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 16]: `` It is not necessary , thank you , '' said Claire with an air .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 35]: `` I have an open invitation to several houses , but I am saving up Brussels for Easter , when the weather will be better , and it will be more of a change .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 21]: And I have an old grand-aunt in the North , but she is an invalid , confined to her room .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 10]: I should be an extra trouble in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 8]: I shall manage to amuse myself somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 10]: It will be an opportunity for exploring London . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 16]: `` Oh well , '' Cecil said vaguely , `` when I come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 9]: but she spoke no word of Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 20]: The next week brought the various festivities with which Saint Cuthbert 's celebrated the end of the Christmas term .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 99]: There was a school dance in the big class-room , a Christmas-tree party , given to the children in an East End parish , and last and most important of all the breaking-up ceremony in the local Town Hall , when an old girl , now developed into a celebrated authoress , presented the prizes , and gave an amusing account of her own schooldays , which evoked storms of applause from the audience , even Miss Farnborough smiling benignly at the recital of misdoings which would have evoked her sternest displeasure on the part of present-day pupils !
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 67]: Then the singing-class girls sang a short cantata , and the eldest girls gave a scene from Shakespeare , very dull and exceedingly correct , and the youngest girls acted a little French play , while the French mistress stood in the wings , ready to prompt , her face very hot , and her feet very cold , and her heart beating at express speed .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 34]: This moment was a public test of her work during the term , and she had a horror that the children would forget their parts and disgrace their leader as well as themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 61]: She need not have feared , however , for the publicity which she dreaded was just the stimulus needed to spur the juvenile actors to do their very best , and they shrugged , they gesticulated , they rolled their r 's , they reproduced Claire 's own little mannerisms with an _ aplomb _ which brought down the house .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 50]: Claire 's lack of teaching experience might make her less sound on rules and routine , but it was obvious that she had succeeded in one important point ; she had lifted `` French '' from the level of a task , and converted it into a living tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 14]: Miss Farnborough was very gracious in her parting words to her new mistress .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 20]: `` I have not come to my present position without learning to trust my perceptions , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 21]: `` I recognised at once that you possessed the true teaching instinct , and to-day you have justified my choice .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 12]: I have had many congratulations on your pupils ' performance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 11]: Then she held out her hand with a charming smile .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 11]: `` I hope you will have very pleasant holidays ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 19]: She made no inquiries as to the way in which this young girl was to spend her leisure .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 55]: She herself was worn-out with the strain of the long term , and when the morrow came she intended to pack her bag , and start off for a sunny Swiss height , where for the next few weeks it would be her chief aim to forget that she had ever seen a school .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 12]: But the new French mistress turned away with a heavy heart .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 10]: It seemed at that moment as if nobody cared .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 8]: That year Christmas fell on a Monday .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 21]: On the Saturday morning Cecil packed up her bag , and departed , grumbling , for her week at home .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 55]: Before she left , Claire presented her with a Christmas gift in the shape of a charming embroidered scarf , and Cecil kissed her , and flushed , and looked at the same time pleased and oppressed , and hastily pulling out her purse extracted two sovereigns and laid them down on the table .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 7]: `` I keep forgetting that money !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 7]: Three weeks , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 20]: There 's two pounds ; let me know the rest when I come back and I 'll settle up .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 6]: Christmas is an awful time .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 6]: The money simply melts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 24]: Claire had an uncomfortable and wholly unreasonable feeling of being paid for her present as she put the two sovereigns in her purse .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 28]: Cecil had given her no gift , and the lack of the kindly attention increased the feeling of desolation with which she returned to her empty room .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 19]: Even the tiniest offering to show that she had been thought of , would have been a comfort !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 34]: The landlady came into the room to remove the luncheon tray , her lips pursed into an expression which her lodger recognised as the preliminary to `` a bit of my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 23]: When the outlying cruets and dishes had been crowded together in a perilous pile , the bit of her mind came out .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 22]: `` I was going to say , miss , that of course you will arrange to dine out on Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 26]: I never take ladies as a rule , but Miss Rhodes , she said , being teachers , you would be away all holiday time .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 58]: I never had a lodger before who stayed in the house over Christmas , and of course you must understand that we go over to Highgate to my mother 's for the day and the girl goes out , and I could n't possibly think of cooking -- '' `` Do n't be afraid , Mrs Mason .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 9]: I am going out for the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 69]: Mrs Mason lifted the tray and carried it out of the room , shutting the door behind her by the skilful insertion of a large foot encased in a cashmere boot , and Claire stood staring at her , wondering if it were really her own voice which had spoken those last words , and from what source had sprung the confidence which had suddenly flooded her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 44]: At this last blow of all , when even the little saffron-coloured parlour closed the door against her , the logical course would have been to collapse into utter despair , instead of which the moment had brought the first gleam of hope .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 17]: `` Now , '' said the voice in her heart , `` everyone has failed me .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 8]: I am helpless , I am alone .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 6]: This is God 's moment .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 12]: I will worry no more , but leave it to Him .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 11]: Something will open for me when the time arrives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 17]: She went upstairs , put on her hat , and sallied out into the busy streets .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 45]: All the world was abroad , men and women and small eager children all bent on the same task , thronging the shops to the doors , waiting in rows for the favour of being served , emerging triumphant with arms laden with spoils .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 13]: On every side fragments of the same conversation floated to the ears .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 9]: `` What can I get for Kate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 15]: `` I ca n't think what in the world to buy for John . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 13]: `` Do try to give me an idea what Rose would like !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 40]: ... '' Claire mingled with the throng , pushed her way towards the crowded counters , waited a preposterous time for her change , and then hurried off to another department to go through the same struggle once more .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 26]: Deliberately she threw herself into the Christmas feeling , turning her thoughts from herself , considering only how she could add to the general happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 79]: She bought presents for everybody , for the cross landlady , for the untidy servant girl , for Sophie Blake , and Flora Ross , for the maid at Saint Cuthbert 's who waited upon the Staff-Room , with a selection of dainty oddments for girl friends at Brussels , and when the presents themselves had been secured she bought prettily tinted paper , and fancy ribbons , and decorated name cards for the adornment of the parcels .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 26]: The saffron parlour looked quite Christmas-like that evening , and Claire knew a happy hour as she made up her gifts in their dainty wrappings .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 26]: They looked so gay and seasonable that she decided to defer putting them into the sober outer covering of brown paper as long as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 10]: They were all the Christmas decoration she would have !
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 12]: On Sunday morning the feeling of loneliness took an acute turn .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 47]: Claire longed for a church which long association had made into a home ; for a clergyman who was also a friend ; for a congregation of people who knew her , and cared for her well-being , instead of the long rows of strange faces .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 37]: She remembered how Cecil had declared that in London a girl might attend the same church for years on end , and never hear a word of welcome , and hope died low in her breast .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 48]: The moment of exaltation had passed , and she told herself drearily that on Christmas afternoon she must take a book and sit by the fire in the waiting-room of some great station , dine at a restaurant , and perhaps go to a concert at night .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 24]: For weeks past Claire had been intending to go to a West End church to hear one of the finest of modern preachers .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 34]: She decided to go this morning , since the length of journey now seemed rather an advantage than a drawback , as helping to fill up another of the long , dragging hours .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 57]: She dressed herself with the care and nicety which was the result of her French training , and which had of late become almost a religious duty , for the study of the fifteen women who daily assembled round the table in the Staff-Room was as a danger signal to warn new-comers of the perils ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 24]: With the one exception of Sophie Blake , not one of the number seemed to make any effort to preserve their feminine charm .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 57]: They dressed their hair in the quickest and easiest fashion without considering the question of appearance ; they wore dun-coloured garments with collars of the same material ; though severely neat , all their skirts seemed to suffer from the same depressing tendency to drop at the back ; their bony wrists emerged from tightly-buttoned sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 27]: The point of view adopted was that appearance did not matter , that it was waste of time to consider the adornment of the outer woman .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 70]: Brain was the all-important factor ; every possible moment must be devoted to the cultivation of brain ; but an outsider could not fail to note that , with this destroying of a natural instinct , something which went deeper than the surface was also lost ; with the grace of the body certain feminine graces of soul died also , and the world was poorer for their loss .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 42]: The untidy servant maid peered out of the window to watch Claire as she left the house that morning , and evolved a whole feuilleton to account for the inconsistency of her appearance with her position as a first floor front .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 13]: `` You 'd take her for a lady to look at her !
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 11]: P'raps she _ is _ a lady in disguise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: and from , this point the making of the feuilleton began .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 28]: The service that morning was food to Claire 's hungering soul , for the words of the preacher might have been designed to meet her own need .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 25]: As she listened she realised that the bitterness of loneliness was impossible to one who believed and trusted in the great , all-compassing love .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 33]: Sad one might still be , so long as the human heart demanded a human companionship , but the sting of feeling uncared for , could never touch a child of God .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 42]: She took the comfort home to her heart , and stored it there to help her through the difficult time ahead , and on her knees at the end of the service she sent up her own little petition for help .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 11]: `` There are so many homes in this great city !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 11]: Is there no home for me on Christmas Day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 32]: With the words the tears sprang , and Claire mopped her eyes with her handkerchief , thankful that she was surrounded by strangers by whom her reddened eyes would pass unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 41]: Then rising to her feet , she turned to lift the furs which hung on the back of the pew , and met the brown eyes of a girl who had been sitting behind her the whole of the service .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 6]: The girl was Janet Willoughby .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: ENTER MAJOR CAREW .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 16]: In the street outside the church door the two girls shook hands and exchanged greetings .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 23]: Janet wore a long fur coat , and a toque of dark Russian sable , with a sweeping feather at one side .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 42]: The price of these two garments alone would equal the whole of Claire 's yearly salary , but it had the effect of making the wearer look clumsy and middle-aged compared with the graceful simplicity of the other 's French-cut costume .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 36]: Janet Willoughby was not thinking of clothes at that moment , however ; she was looking at reddened eyelids , and remembering the moment when she had seen a kneeling figure suddenly shaken with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 45]: The sight of those tears had wiped away the rankling grudge which had lain at her heart since the evening of her mother 's At Home , and revived the warm liking which at first sight she had taken to this pretty attractive girl .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 7]: `` Which way are you going ?
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 6]: May I walk with you ?
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 9]: It 's just the morning for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: I hope it will keep cold and bright over Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 9]: It 's so inappropriate when it 's muggy .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 33]: Last year we were in Switzerland , but mother is old-fashioned , and likes to have the day at home , so this time we do n't start till the new year .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 10]: You are not going sporting by any chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 6]: `` I 'm not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 25]: said Claire , and , for all her determination , could not resist a grimace , so far from sporting seemed the prospect ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 18]: Janet caught the grimace , and smiled in sympathy , but the next moment her face sobered .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 15]: `` But I hope you _ are _ going to have jolly holidays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 7]: `` Oh , I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 23]: Oh , yes , I mean to enjoy them very much , '' Claire said valiantly , and swiftly turned the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 9]: `` Where do you go in Switzerland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 4]: `` Saint Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 13]: We 've gone there for years -- a large party of friends .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 8]: It has become quite a yearly reunion .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 19]: It 's so comfy to have one 's own party , and be independent of the other hoteliers .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 18]: They may be quite nice , of course , but then , again , they may not .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 20]: I feel rather mean sometimes when I see a new arrival looking with big eyes at our merry table .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 17]: Theoretically , I think one _ ought _ to be nice to new-comers in an hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 7]: It 's such a pelican-in-the-wilderness feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 17]: I 'd hate it myself , but practically I 'm afraid I 'm not particularly friendly .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: We are so complete that we do n't want outsiders .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 6]: They 'd spoil the fun .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 17]: Do n't you think one is justified in being a little bit selfish at Christmas-time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 11]: Claire laughed , her old , happy , gurgling laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 13]: It warmed her heart to have Janet Willoughby 's companionship once more .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 12]: `` It is n't exactly the orthodox attitude , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 21]: Perhaps you will be more justified this year , after you have got through your Christmas duties at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 6]: That 's a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 24]: I _ shall _ , for it was pure unselfishness which prevented me running away last week with the rest of the party .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 19]: Mother would have given in if I 'd persisted , and I wanted to so dreadfully badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 13]: She sighed , and looked quite dejected , but Claire remained unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 9]: `` I do n't pity you one bit .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 8]: You have only a week to wait .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 10]: That 's not a great trial of patience ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , it is .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 4]: -- Sometimes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 13]: said Janet with an emphasis which gave the words an added eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 26]: Claire divined at once that Switzerland had an attraction apart from winter sports -- an attraction centred in some individual member of the merry party .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 9]: Could it by any chance be Erskine Fanshawe ?
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 7]: She longed to ask the question .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 12]: Not for a hundred pounds would she have asked the question .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 7]: She hoped it was Captain Fanshawe .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 9]: She hoped Janet would have a lovely time .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 5]: Some girls had everything .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 4]: Some had nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 8]: It was unfair -- it was cruel .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 24]: Oh , dear , what was the use of going to church , and coming out to have such mean , grudging thoughts ?
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 4]: Janet Willoughby too !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 4]: Such a dear !
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 6]: She deserved to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 20]: Claire forced a smile , and said bravely -- `` It will be all the nicer for waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 11]: `` It could n't be nicer , '' Janet replied .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 36]: Then she looked in the other girl 's face , and it struck her that the pretty eyelids had taken an additional shade of red , and her warm heart felt a throb of compunction .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 20]: `` Grumbling about my own little bothers , when she had so much to bear -- hateful of me !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 20]: I 've been mean not to ask her again ; mother wanted to ; but she 's so pretty .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 15]: I admired her so much that I was afraid -- other people might too !
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: But she was crying ; I saw her cry .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 22]: Perhaps she is lonely , and it 's my fault -- '' `` What do you generally do on Sundays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 4]: she asked aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 15]: `` There are lots of other mistresses at your school , are n't there ?
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 40]: I suppose you go about together , and have tea at each other 's rooms in the afternoon , and sit over the fire at night and talk , and brew cocoa , as the girls do in novels .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 6]: It all sounds so interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 22]: The girls are generally rather plain and very learned ; but there is always one among them who is like you .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 33]: I do n't mean that you are not learned -- I 'm sure you are -- but -- er -- pretty , you know , and attractive , and fond of things !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 31]: And all the others adore her , and are jealous if she is nicer to one than to the others ... '' Claire grimaced again , more unrestrainedly than before .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 7]: `` That 's not my part .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 5]: I wish it were .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 7]: I could play it quite well .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 19]: The other mistresses are quite civil and pleasant , but they do n't hanker after me one bit .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 27]: With two exceptions , the girl I live with , and one other , I have not spoken to one of them out of school hours .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 12]: I do n't even know where most of them live . ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 5]: Janet 's face lengthened .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 20]: Suddenly she turned and asked a sharp direct question : `` Where are you going on Christmas Day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 14]: Pride and weakness struggled together in Claire 's heart , and pride won .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 12]: She would _ not _ pose as an object of pity !
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 10]: `` Oh , I 'm going -- out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 20]: said she with an air , but Janet Willoughby was not to be put off so easily as that .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 10]: Her brown eyes sent out a flash of light .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 8]: She demanded sternly : `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 32]: `` Really -- '' Claire tossed her head with the air of a duchess who was so overburdened with invitations that she found it impossible to make a choice between them .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 31]: `` Really , do n't you know , I have n't quite decided -- '' `` Claire Gifford , you mean , horrid girl , do n't dare to quibble !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 10]: You are going nowhere , and you know it .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 24]: Nobody has invited you for Christmas Day ; that 's why you were crying just now -- because you had nowhere to go .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 27]: And you would have gone away this morning , and said nothing , and sat alone in your rooms ... I call it _ mean _ !
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 7]: Talk of the spirit of Christmas !
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 10]: It 's an insult to me and to mother .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 18]: How do you suppose we should have felt if we 'd found out _ afterwards _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 7]: `` W-what else could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 7]: How could I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 5]: stammered Claire , blushing .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 17]: `` It would have seemed such a barefaced _ hint _ , and I detest hints .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 9]: And really why should you have felt bad ?
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 5]: I 'm a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 7]: You 've only seen me once .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 8]: There could be no blame on you .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 7]: There 's no blame on anyone .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 23]: It just happens that it does n't quite fit in to visit friends at a distance , and in town -- well !
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: I 'm a stranger , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 8]: I _ have _ no friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 5]: Janet set her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 22]: `` Just as a matter of curiosity I should like to know exactly what you _ were _ going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 12]: You said , I believe , that you were going out .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 10]: And now you say you had nowhere to go .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 16]: Both statements ca n't be true -- '' `` Oh , yes , they can .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 37]: I have nowhere to go , but I had to find somewhere , because my good landlady is going to her mother 's at Highgate , and disapproves of lodgers who stay in on Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 18]: She gave me notice that I must go out as the house would be locked up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 14]: `` But where -- what -- where _ could _ you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 20]: `` I thought of a restaurant and a concert , and a station waiting-room to fill in the gaps .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 6]: Quite comfortable , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 34]: They have lovely fires , and with a nice book -- '' `` If you do n't stop this minute I shall begin to cry -- here , in the open street ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 4]: cried Janet hotly .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 11]: `` Oh , you poor dear , you poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 4]: A station waiting-room .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 8]: I never heard of anything so piteous .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 11]: Oh , how thankful I am that I met you !
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 14]: Tell me honestly , was it about that that you were crying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 6]: `` Y-yes , it was .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 24]: I was saying a little prayer and trying not to feel lonesome , and then I looked round and saw -- you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 7]: `` End of volume one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 4]: cried Janet briskly .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 8]: `` No more waiting-rooms , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 12]: You must come to us for the whole of Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 18]: I wish I could ask you to stay , but we are chock-a-block with cousins and aunts .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 28]: I 'll come round in my car in time to take you to church , and send you back at night after the Highgate revels are over .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 20]: We ca n't offer you anything very exciting , I 'm afraid -- just an old-fashioned homey gathering . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 8]: `` It 's just what I want .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 16]: I am thirsty for a home ; but your mother -- what will she say ?
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 26]: Will she care for a stranger -- '' `` Mother says what I say , '' Janet declared with the assurance of an only daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 13]: `` And she 'll say in addition , ` What a blessing !
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 12]: She 'll whistle for us , and amuse Aunt Jane . '
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 9]: Did you realise that Aunt Jane was coming ?
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 44]: She 's generally _ very _ cross all day , and makes a point of giving away her presents to other members of the party under the very noses of the givers , to let them see what she thinks of their choice .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 25]: The great idea is to sit down by her quickly when you see her begin to fumble with something you would like to have .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 12]: I got quite a nice bag that way last Christmas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 2]: Presents !
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 5]: That was another idea .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 30]: Claire went home mentally reviewing her own treasures with a view to selecting some trifle which Janet in the midst of her plenty might still be glad to receive .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 31]: She decided on a silver clasp of quaint Breton manufacture , which had the merit that in the whole of London it would be impossible to purchase another to match .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 21]: Claire returned to her room in a frame of mind vastly different from that in which she had started forth .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 59]: Her buoyant spirits soared upwards at the prospect of a Christmas spent in the midst of a happy family party , and all the difficulties of life seemed to dissolve into thin air , since , after the providential meeting just vouchsafed , it seemed faithless to doubt that future difficulties would be solved in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 57]: She intended to devote the afternoon to writing a long letter to her mother , which had been delayed owing to her recent depression of spirits , for it seemed cruel to write in a pessimistic strain to the happy bride , who now , more than ever , saw everything _ couleur de rose _ .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 39]: Mrs Judge 's present had arrived the week before , in the shape of a richly embroidered Indian table-cloth , for which her daughter had as much use as she herself would have found for a fur rug .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 61]: To use it in the saffron parlour was a sheer impossibility , for every separate article of furniture shrieked at it , and it shrieked at them in return ; so Claire folded it away at the bottom of her box , reflecting , between a sigh and a smile , that the choice was `` just like mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 42]: It was not agreeable to the bride to picture her daughter living in an ugly lodging-house parlour , so she had mentally covered the ugliness beneath the gorgeous embroidery of that cloth , and happily dismissed the subject from her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 60]: At the time of the opening of the parcel , Claire had felt a sense of sharp disappointment , amounting even to irritation , but this morning she could see the humour of the situation , and she chuckled softly to herself as she walked homeward , rehearsing words of thanks that would be at once cordial and truthful .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 46]: `` Just what I wanted , '' was plainly out of the question ; `` So useful '' was also ruled out , but she could honestly admire the workmanship of the cloth , and enlarge on the care with which it should be preserved !
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 23]: It was an easy task to satisfy a correspondent who was eager to interpret words into the meaning most agreeable to herself !
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 51]: Claire entered the house prepared to devote herself to writing letters to absent friends , but the excitements of the day were not yet over , for the little maid met her on the threshold with the exciting intelligence that a gentleman was in the parlour waiting to see her .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 34]: The feuilleton made an exciting leap forward , as Lizzie watched the blood rush into the `` first floor 's '' cheeks , and ebb away suddenly , leaving her white and tense .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 9]: `` Struck all of a heap , like !
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 13]: I should n't have thought meself as she 'd look at him !
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: Queer thing , love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 23]: soliloquised Lizzie , as she clumped down the kitchen stairs , and returned to her superintendence of Sunday 's `` jint . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 25]: The `` first floor '' meanwhile stood motionless in the oil-clothed hall , struggling to regain self-possession before turning the handle of the door .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 7]: A gentleman waiting to see her !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 6]: Who could the gentleman be ?
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 28]: But at the bottom of her heart Claire believed the question to be superfluous , for there was only one `` gentleman '' who could possibly come .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 25]: Captain Fanshawe had found out her address , and it was Christmas-time , when a visitor was justified in counting on a hospitable reception .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 14]: At Christmas-time it would be churlish for a hostess to deny a welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 17]: Every pulse in Claire 's body was throbbing with anticipation as she flung open that door .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 20]: The visitor was standing with his back towards her , bending low to examine a photograph on the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 28]: At the sound of her entrance he straightened himself and wheeled round , and at the sight of his face Claire 's heart dropped heavy as lead .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 26]: They stood for a moment staring in a mutual surprise , the girl 's face blank with disappointment , the man 's brightening with interest .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 28]: He was a tall , thickly-set man , trim and smart in his attire , yet with a coarseness of feature which aroused Claire 's instant antagonism .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 21]: Compared with the face she had expected to see , the florid good looks which confronted her were positively repugnant .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 13]: Before the obvious admiration of the black eyes she stiffened in displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 8]: `` You wished to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 7]: `` Miss Gifford , I believe !
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 13]: I called about a little matter of a parcel for Miss Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: To be sent on .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 13]: I wanted to ask if you -- '' `` Oh , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 6]: I shall be delighted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 40]: Claire thawed at the prospect of a present for Cecil , but could it be possible that it was this man with the flushed cheeks , and harsh , uncultivated voice , who had so revolutionised Cecil 's life !
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 24]: Could it be for the delectation of those bold eyes that she had worked far into the night , contriving her pitiful fineries ?
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 50]: Claire 's instinctive dislike was so strong that she would not seat herself and so give an opportunity for prolonging the interview ; she crossed the room to a bureau that stood in the corner , and took a slip of paper from one of the pigeon - holes .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 14]: `` Perhaps it would be simpler if I gave you the address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 5]: The man laughed complacently .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 22]: `` No need , thank you , I 've got it all right , but it 's safer not to write .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 7]: The old lady , you know !
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 20]: Parcel coming in for her daughter addressed in a man 's writing -- no end of fuss and questioning .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 7]: You know what old ladies are !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 15]: Never satisfied till they 've ferreted to the bottom of everything that comes along .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 18]: It 's not good enough , that sort of thing , but she 'll expect a present .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 28]: It 's all stamped and made up , if you 'll be good enough just to address it , and slip it into the post to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 40]: He put his hand in his pocket as he spoke and drew out a little package some two inches square , the sort of package which might contain an article of jewellery , such as a brooch or ring .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 10]: Could it by any chance be an engagement ring ?
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 18]: Claire 's blood shuddered as she took the little packet and dropped it quietly on the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 7]: `` Certainly I will post it .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 7]: Do you wish it registered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 32]: He looked at her sharply as though suspicious of an under-meaning to the inquiry , then , meeting the glance of her clear eyes , had the grace to look ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 3]: `` N-no .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 6]: It is not worth while .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 19]: A trifle , just a trifle -- Christmas , you know -- must do the proper thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 40]: He mumbled vaguely the while he collected his hat and gloves , the aloofness in Claire 's attitude making it impossible to prolong the interview ; but as he held out his hand in farewell , his self-possession returned .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 21]: He laughed meaningly , and said -- `` Odd , you know ; I imagined that you were quite old !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 7]: Miss Rhodes gave me that impression .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 16]: Nothing definite , you know ; no false statements ; just the way she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 6]: Clever of her , what ?
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 4]: -- very clever !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 10]: Knew better than to spoil her own game ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 19]: If looks could have slain , the saffron parlour would have seen a dead man at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 13]: Claire withdrew her hand , and surreptitiously rubbed it against her skirt .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 10]: She would not condescend to notice that last remark .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 8]: `` I 'll post the parcel to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 16]: Perhaps you will tell me your name , as I shall have to explain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 10]: He drew out a pocket-book and extracted a card .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 14]: Claire dropped it unread upon the table , and bowed stiffly in farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 15]: The next moment he was gone , and she could satisfy her curiosity unseen .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 32]: Then came surprise number two , for the card bore the inscription , `` Major J.F. Carew , '' and in the corner two well-remembered words , `` Carlton Club . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 12]: An officer in the Army -- who would have thought it !
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 63]: He was emphatically not a gentleman ; he was rough , coarse , mannerless , yet he was in a position which would bring him into intimate association with gentle people ; by a strange coincidence , he might know , he almost certainly would know , the man whom she had expected to see in his stead -- Erskine Fanshawe himself !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 25]: They could never be friends , but they would meet , they would sit in the same rooms , they would exchange occasional remarks .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 19]: Claire 's mood of intolerable disgust changed suddenly into something strangely approaching envy of this big rough man !
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 28]: Christmas morning brought Janet bright and early , to find Claire standing at the window ready to rush out the moment the car stopped at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 33]: It felt delightfully luxurious to seat herself on the springy cushions , draw the fur rug over her knees , and feel the warmth of a hot tin beneath her feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 8]: _ Was n't _ it lacerating ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 3]: Janet cried .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 23]: `` Just as I was starting the parcel post arrived , and there were about half-a-dozen parcels for me from Saint Moritz !
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 18]: There was no time to open them , and I simply die to know what 's inside .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 10]: I care about those presents more than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: We had our family presents this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 6]: Mother gave me this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 10]: She opened her coat to show a glittering crescent .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 16]: `` Quite pretty , is n't it , but I 'd rather have had pearls .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 16]: That 's the worst of Christmas presents , you so seldom get what you want .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 10]: Half the time you feel more disappointed than pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 29]: People cling to the idea that they ought to give you a surprise , and you _ are _ surprised , but not in the way they expect .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 10]: I have given mother thousands of hints about pearls .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 5]: Ah , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 10]: She hooked the coat with an air of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 10]: `` We must take the will for the deed .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 7]: Have you had nice things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 15]: `` My mother sent me a very handsome present , '' Claire said demurely .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 32]: She had no personal agitations about the day 's post ; but she did feel interested in the thought of those parcels from Switzerland which lay awaiting Janet Willoughby 's return .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 14]: Half eager , half shrinking , she looked forward to seeing their contents .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 13]: It was in Janet 's dainty boudoir that the unpacking took place .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 34]: The two girls went straight upstairs on their return from church , and there , on a gate-legged table , lay the pile of parcels which had arrived by the morning 's delivery .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: Janet pounced upon the Swiss packets , and cut the fastenings with eager haste .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 18]: From across the room Claire watched her eager face as she read the inscriptions one by one .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 34]: As she neared the end of the pile , the eagerness became tinged with anxiety ; she picked up the last parcel of all , and the light died out of her face .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 54]: Claire turned aside and affected to be absorbed in examining the contents of an old cabinet , and Janet moved to the nearer side of the table so that her face was hidden from view ; after a few minutes of silence , she broke the silence in a voice of forced lightness .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 11]: `` Wo n't you come and look at my trophies ?
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 18]: Switzerland is not a very happy hunting-ground , for there is so little variety to be had .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 13]: That 's my fifth carved chalet , and about the seventeenth bear .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: Rather a dear , though , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 14]: Such a nice man sent it -- one of the nicest of men .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 9]: That 's his photograph on the mantelpiece . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 24]: Claire looked , met a straight keen glance which lived in her memory , and felt a tingle of blood in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 20]: Janet 's eyes followed hers , and she said quickly -- `` Not that ; that 's Erskine Fanshawe .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 14]: He is a casual person , and does n't go in for presents .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: He has n't even troubled to send a card .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 9]: I meant the man in the leather frame .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 4]: He always remembers .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 9]: I do like that , in a man !
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 24]: They are all good enough in an emergency , but so few of them think of the nice _ little _ things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 14]: Janet sighed , and dropped the carved wooden bear on to the table .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 18]: However much she might appreciate the donor 's thoughtfulness , it had not had a cheering effect .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 31]: The light had died out of her eyes , and she turned over the various trophies without a trace of the enthusiasm with which she had torn open the parcel .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 15]: Claire standing beside her felt torn between sympathy and a guilty sense of relief .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 29]: She was sorry for Janet 's obvious disappointment , but she was also -LRB- it was a dog-in-the-manger feeling , for how could it possibly affect herself ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 14]: _ relieved _ that Captain Fanshawe was not the donor of the bear !
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 52]: As the two girls stood together turning over the little collection of carved toys , Claire slipped her hand through Janet 's arm with an affectionate pressure , which was an outward apology for the inward disloyalty , and Janet stretched out her own hand to clasp it with unexpected fervour .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 10]: `` Oh , I am glad you are here !
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 8]: I 'm glad to have another girl !
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 3]: Girls understand .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 11]: I wish I had n't opened those horrid old parcels .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 11]: It 's just as I said -- presents are disappointing .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 8]: Now I feel thoroughly humped and dumpy !
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 22]: It 's so stupid , too , for I know quite well that I 've every sane reason to be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 17]: How exasperating it is that one 's head and one 's heart so seldom agree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 14]: Claire gave the plump arm another squeeze , but made no further answer .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 10]: She was afraid to show how well she understood .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 57]: Janet would forget her hasty words , and believe that her secret was locked within her own breast ; but the other girl realised the position as clearly as if she had been told in so many words -- `` I am in love with one man , and another man is in love with me .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 11]: I am throwing away the substance for the shadow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 10]: `` Ah , well , such is life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 5]: continued Janet , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 16]: `` Now I 'm supposed to go downstairs and be the life of the party !
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 7]: How I do dislike family parties !
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 30]: Mother says it 's the ideal thing for relations to gather together for Christmas Day , but I 've been gathered together for so _ many _ years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 16]: `` You are too well-off , my dear , that 's what 's the matter !
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 23]: I have never met a girl before who had so much to make her happy , and yet you are not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 37]: How would you like to be a High School-mistress living in poky lodgings , not able to have a holiday because she ca n't afford two rents , and getting only one present all told ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 6]: Janet looked at her quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 8]: `` Have you had only one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 23]: `` I said _ a _ High School-mistress , not any special mistress , but I will be definite if you like .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 11]: How would you like to be _ Me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 20]: Janet turned suddenly , laid her free hand on Claire 's shoulder , and stared deeply into her face .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 9]: `` I -- do n't -- know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 4]: she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 12]: `` Sometimes I think it 's just what I should like .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 11]: I have a great deal , but you have more .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 10]: Look at our two faces in that glass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 35]: She drew Claire round so that they stood in front of the Chippendale mirror over the mantelpiece , from whence a row of pictured faces stared back , as though stolidly sitting in judgment .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 63]: The clear tints of Claire 's skin made Janet look sallow and faded , the dark curve of her eyebrows under the sweep of gold brown hair , the red lips and deeply cleft chin , made Janet 's indeterminate features look insignificant , the brown eyes seemed the only definite feature in her face , and they were clouded with depression .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 17]: `` Look at yourself , '' she said deeply , `` and look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 11]: It was an awkward moment , and Claire shrugged uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 15]: `` But my face is -- it has to be -- my fortune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 5]: `` Oh , beauty !
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 12]: I was n't thinking of beauty , '' Janet cried unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 16]: `` You are very pretty , of course , but heaps of girls are pretty .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 14]: It 's something more -- I suppose it is what is called Charm .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 17]: When people see you once , they remember you ; they want to see you again .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 7]: You make a place for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 7]: I am one in a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 17]: People like me well enough when they are with me , but -- they forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 9]: `` And I never meet anyone to remember .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 12]: We 're two love-lorn damsels , and this is Merrie Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 7]: Would you have thought it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 35]: cried Claire , and that wrought the desired effect , for Janet awoke with a shock to her responsibilities as hostess , and led the way downstairs to join the rest of the house-party .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 50]: The rest of the day was spent in conventional English fashion in a praiseworthy effort to sustain spirits at concert pitch , and keep up a continuous flow of gaiety , a mountainous task when guests are brought together by claims of birth , without consideration as to suitability !
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 66]: Mrs Willoughby 's party consisted of four distinct elements ; there were Great-aunt Jane , and second cousin William , two octogenarians , who for health 's sake dined early all the year round , and sipped a cup of Benger at eight , but who dauntlessly tackled sausages and plum pudding on Christmas Day , and suffered for it for a week to come .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 73]: There were Mr and Mrs Willoughby , and two cousin husbands and their wives , and a spinster aunt to represent the next generation , then came sweet and twenty as represented by Janet and Claire , followed by Reginald of Eton , on whom they looked down as a mere boy , the while he in his turn disdained to notice the advances of two curly-headed cousins of nine and ten !
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 46]: Claire enjoyed herself because it was in her nature to enjoy , and it felt good to be once more in a beautiful , well-appointed home , among friends ; but driving home in the taxi she yawned persistently from one door to the other .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 19]: It was dreadfully tiring work being pleasant at the same time to the whole five ages of man !
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 47]: With the opening of the door of the saffron parlour came an end of sleepiness , for on the table lay a square parcel , and the parcel bore the same stamp , the same markings which she had seen duplicated in Janet Willoughby 's boudoir !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 44]: Red as a rose was Claire as she stared at the bold masculine writing of the address , tore open the wrappings of the box , and drew forth a carved cuckoo clock with the well-known chalet roof and long pendulum and chains .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 53]: It was an exquisite specimen of its kind , the best that could be obtained , but for the moment Claire had no attention to spare for the gift itself ; she was absorbed in hunting among the paper and straw for a card which should settle the identity of the donor .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 8]: Not a line was to be found .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 9]: Pink deepened to crimson on Claire 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 10]: `` Who in the world could have sent it ?
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 8]: Who _ could _ it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 14]: She played at bewilderment , but in spite of herself the dimples dipped .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 14]: `` Now how in the world has he found out my address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 5]: asked Claire of herself .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 16]: For the next week Claire experienced the sensation of being `` alone in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 38]: From the evening of Christmas Day until Cecil returned on January 2nd , not one friendly word did she hear ; she walked abroad among a crowd of unknown faces , she returned to a solitary room .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 33]: Miss Farnborough was spending the Christmas abroad ; the other mistresses were either visiting or entertaining relations , the ladies of the committee were presumably making merry each in her own sphere .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 30]: It was no one 's business to look after the new member of the staff out of term time , and no one troubled to make it her business .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 53]: The only friendly sound which reached Claire 's ears during those days was the striking of the cuckoo clock , as a minute before every hour a sliding door flew open , and a little brown bird popped out and piped the due number of cuckoos in a clear , sweet note .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 28]: Claire loved that little bird ; the sight of him brought a warmth to her heart , which was as sunshine lighting up the grey winter days .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 4]: Someone had remembered !
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 4]: Someone had cared !
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 18]: In the midst of a merry holiday , time and thought had been spared for her benefit .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 37]: The presence of the cuckoo clock preserved Claire from personal suffering , but during that silent week there was borne in upon her a realisation of the loneliness of the great city which was never obliterated .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 29]: A girl like herself , coming to London without introductions , might lead this desert life , not for a week alone , but for _ years _ !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 43]: Her youth might fade , might pass away , she might grow middle-aged and old , and still pass to and fro through crowded street , unnoted , uncared for , unknown beyond the boundaries of the schoolroom or the office walls .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 51]: A working-woman was as a rule too tired and too poor to join societies , or take part in social work which would lead to the making of friends ; she was dependent on the thoughtfulness of her leisured sisters , and the leisured sisters were too apt to forget .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 38]: They invited their own well-off friends , exhausted themselves in organising entertainments which were often regarded as bores pure and simple , and cast no thought to the lonely women sitting night after night in lodging-house parlours .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 19]: `` If I am ever rich -- if I ever have a home , I 'll remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 5]: Claire vowed to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 14]: `` I 'll take a little trouble , and _ find out _ !
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 25]: I could n't do a hundredth or a thousandth part of what ought to be done , but I 'd do my share ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 60]: Cecil announced her return for the evening of January 2nd , and remindful of the depressing influence of her own arrival , Claire exerted herself to make the room look as homelike as possible , and arranged a dainty little meal on a table spread with a clean cloth and decorated with a bowl of holly and Christmas roses .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 33]: At the first sound of Cecil 's voice she ran out into the hall , hugged her warmly , and relieved her of a bundle of packages of all sorts and sizes .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 11]: `` You look a real Mother Christmas hidden behind parcels .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 5]: What are they all ?
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 2]: Trophies ?
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 8]: You _ have _ come off well !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 8]: It is lovely to see you back .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 16]: If you 'd stayed away the whole time I think I should have grown dumb .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 11]: My tongue would have withered from sheer lack of use .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 11]: I never realised before how much I love to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 7]: I do hope you feel sociable .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 23]: I want to talk and talk for hours at a time , and to hear _ you _ talk , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 6]: `` Even to grumble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 4]: Claire grinned eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 35]: `` Oh , well -- if you _ must _ , but it would be rather mean , would n't it , after a holiday , and when I 've got everything so nice ?
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 16]: I am driven to praise myself , because _ you _ take no notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 8]: `` You have given me no time .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 14]: You chatter so that no one else can get in a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 15]: Cecil took off hat and gloves , and threw them down on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 11]: `` I must say your looks do n't pity you .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 12]: You look as if you had been enjoying yourself all right .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 5]: That kettle 's boiling !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: I 'm dying for a cup of tea !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 12]: Let 's have it at once , and talk comfortably . ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 15]: She seated herself by the table , and helped herself to a buttered scone .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 10]: `` What did you do on Christmas Day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 6]: `` The Willoughbys asked me .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 13]: I went to church with them , and stayed until eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 13]: `` Anything going on , or just the ordinary family frumps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 3]: Claire laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 17]: `` Nobody but relations and my fascinating self ; but you need n't be so blighting .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 11]: I enjoyed every moment , and they were angelically kind .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 8]: Janet was like an old friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 9]: `` Did she give you a present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 6]: `` Yes , she did .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 8]: Half a dozen pairs of gloves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 8]: `` The wrong size , of course !
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 5]: They always are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 10]: `` No , my pessimist , they were not !
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 26]: She had diagnosed me as a six and a half , and six and a half I am , so all was peace and joy .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 17]: I put on a new pair the next day when I went out for a constitutional .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: It was quite a tonic .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 20]: Gloves are much cheaper abroad , and I never wore a shabby pair in my life until this winter .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 13]: It 's been one of the things I 've hated most . ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 20]: `` Six pairs will soon go , '' said Cecil ; `` I prefer to have things that last .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 11]: Oh , by the way , you addressed a parcel .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 5]: How did it come ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 8]: Was it left at the door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 8]: Instinctively Claire busied herself over the tea-tray .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 24]: She had a feeling that Cecil would rather be unobserved ; she was also afraid that her own expression might betray too much .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 7]: `` Oh no , he called .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 18]: When I came in after morning church on Sunday , Lizzie said that a gentleman was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 5]: It was Major Carew .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 15]: He asked me if I would address the parcel and send it on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 2]: Silence .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 58]: Claire bent over the tea-tray , but she knew without looking that Cecil 's face had fallen into the cold set lines which she had seen times and again , when things had gone wrong ; she knew that when she spoke again the coldness would be in her voice , but her own conscience was clear .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 7]: She had done nothing to offend .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 3]: `` Really !
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 4]: That 's curious .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 7]: _ Waiting _ , you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 7]: You did n't ask him in ?
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 6]: What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 11]: `` He said , ` Miss Gifford , I presume .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 21]: I have called to ask if you will be kind enough to address a small parcel for Miss Rhodes . '
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 17]: I said , ` Would n't it be better if I gave you her address ? '
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 14]: He said , ` I should prefer if you wrote it yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 11]: I said , ` I will do so with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 4]: Good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 8]: He said , ` Good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 9]: He then took up his hat and departed .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 12]: He showed himself out , and shut the door after him .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 10]: I went upstairs and took off my things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 9]: `` He did n't stay long then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 23]: `` About three minutes , I should say , perhaps four ; I ca n't tell you to a second , unfortunately .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 9]: I did n't look at the clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 9]: Cecil laughed , half apologetic , half relieved .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 11]: `` Oh , well , you need n't be sarcastic .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 6]: Naturally I wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 53]: I could n't make it out when I saw your writing , for you had given me the scarf -- I 'm going to buy your present at the sales , by the way -- but , of course , when I took off the paper , there was a message inside .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 7]: I was expecting that present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 9]: `` I hope it was very nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 8]: A brooch , '' Cecil said carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 37]: Claire hoped it was not the insignificant little golden bar which she was wearing at the moment , but she had never seen it before , and Cecil 's jewellery was of the most limited description .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 17]: She determined to ask no more questions on the subject , since evidently none were desired .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 21]: Cecil helped herself to a second scone , and asked suddenly -- `` Why did n't he sit down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 9]: `` It was n't necessary , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 13]: He gave his message , and then there was nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 9]: I was n't going to make conversation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 8]: `` You did n't like him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 33]: cried Cecil , but she laughed as she spoke , and her face relaxed ; it was evident that she was more pleased than disconcerted at her friend 's lack of approval .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 23]: `` You 're no good at hiding your feelings , Claire ; your voice gives you away as well as your face .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 10]: _ Why _ did n't you like Major Carew ?
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 14]: I suppose you do n't deny that he is a handsome man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 46]: `` I do n't think I care about handsome men , '' said Claire , seeing before her a clean-shaven face which could lay no claims to beauty , but in comparison with which the Major 's coarse good looks were abhorrent in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 8]: `` Prefer men plain , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 25]: Well , I do n't ; I should n't like Frank half so much , if he did n't look so big and imposing .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 8]: And other people admire him , too .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 8]: People stare at him as we pass .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 17]: I suppose you have guessed that it is with him that I 've been going out ?
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 51]: There did n't seem any need to speak of it before , but during the rest of the holidays you might expect me to go about with you , and sometimes -- often , I hope , I 'll be engaged , so it 's just as well to explain .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 23]: We can do things together in the morning , but naturally -- '' `` Yes , of course ; I quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 8]: Do n't worry about me , Cecil .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 10]: I 'd love you to have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 12]: Are you -- are you engaged to him , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 26]: There was in her voice that soft , almost awed note with which an unengaged girl regards a companion who has actually plighted her troth .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 6]: Cecil softened at the sound .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 8]: `` Well -- I suppose we are .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 3]: Between ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 14]: It 's not public yet , but I think it soon will be .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 17]: Half a dozen years ago I should have been sure , but I know better now .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 6]: You can never be sure !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 5]: Men are such brutes .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 13]: They think of nothing but themselves , and their own amusement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 5]: `` Some men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 4]: `` Most men !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 33]: Of course , every girl who falls in love thinks her own particular man is the exception , and believes in him blindly until she gets her heart broken for her pains .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 23]: I believed in a man , too , years ago , when I was not much older than you are now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 21]: She paused , as though waiting for comment , but Claire sat silent , listening with grave , tender eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 7]: Cecil sent her a flickering smile .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 14]: `` You are a nice child , Claire ; you have some sense !
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 13]: I 'll tell you , because you never pried or asked questions .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 26]: You would never have got anything out of me that way , but sometimes I feel as if it would be a relief to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 36]: I was twenty-three , and very pretty ; not as pretty as you are , perhaps , but very nearly , and he was twenty-eight , a lawyer -- brother of one of the girls .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 13]: He came to one of the prize-givings , and we were introduced .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 33]: After that he made his people invite me once or twice , and he found out where I was going in the summer holidays , and came down to the same inn .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 6]: He stayed a fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 10]: Cecil sighed , and stared dreamily at her cup .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 27]: `` Even now , Claire , after all that has happened , I can never quite make up my mind to be sorry that he came .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 17]: It made things harder when the parting came , but I _ had had it _ .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 19]: For two whole weeks I had been as perfectly , blissfully happy as a human creature can be !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 29]: I had wakened every morning to feel that life was too good to be true , I had gone to bed every night grudging the time for sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 21]: A fortnight is not very long , but it 's not every woman who gets even as much as that .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 21]: I shall never feel that happiness again , but I 'm glad that I know what it is like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 18]: `` But , Cecil dear , if -- if Major Carew -- '' Cecil shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 3]: Never again .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 13]: One may be happy enough , but it 's never the same .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 10]: I ca n't feel now as I did then .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 5]: The power has gone .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 21]: I cared so much , you see ; I would have given my life for him a dozen times over .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 22]: I thought of him night and day for over a year ; I lived for the times when we could meet .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 22]: It was n't very often , for his people had taken fright , and would not ask me to the house .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 21]: They were rich people , and did n't want him to marry a poor girl who was working for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 20]: It 's a great mistake , Claire , to be friends with a man when his relations ignore you .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 41]: If I 'd had any pride I would have realised that , but I had n't , and I did n't care ; I did n't care for anything but just to see him , and do what he wished .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 14]: And then , my dear , after a year he began to change .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 49]: He did n't write to me for weeks , and I had to go to school every day , and try to think of the work , and be patient with the girls , and seem bright and interested , as if I had nothing on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 14]: It was near Christmas - time , and we were rehearsing a play .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 38]: I used to feel as if I should go mad , staying behind after four o'clock to go over those wretched scenes , when I was panting to run home to see if a letter had come !
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 23]: But each time that we met again I forgot everything ; I was so happy that I had no time to grumble .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 8]: That surprises you , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 14]: You can hardly believe that of me , but I was different then .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 5]: I was quite nice .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 14]: You would have liked me , if you had known me then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 5]: `` Dear old Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 5]: I like you now .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 6]: You know I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 9]: `` Oh , you put up with me !
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 14]: We get along well enough , but we are not _ friends _ .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 16]: If we had not been thrown together , you would never have singled me out .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 12]: Do n't apologise , my dear ; there 's no need .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 14]: I 'm a grumbling old thing , and you 've been very patient .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 8]: Well , that 's how it happened .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 23]: I went out to meet him one night , and he told me quite calmly that he was going to be married .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 17]: She was the sweetest girl in the world , and he was the happiest of men .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 25]: Wanted me to know , because we had been such _ good _ friends , and he was sure I should be pleased ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 11]: Claire drew her breath with a sharp , sibilant sound .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 6]: `` And _ you _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 4]: Oh , Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 6]: What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 14]: Mary Rhodes compressed her lips ; the set look was in her face .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 7]: `` I said what I thought !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 13]: Quite plainly , and simply , and very much to the point .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 24]: I suppose it would have been dignified to congratulate him , and pretend to be delighted ; but I could n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 26]: He had broken my heart for his own amusement , and he knew it as well as I did , so why should I pretend ?
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 48]: Something inside me seemed to go snap at that moment , and I 've been sour and bitter ever since ; but I 've learnt _ one _ lesson , and that is , that it is folly to go on waiting for perfection in this world .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 15]: Much better take what comes along , and make the best of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 22]: Claire was silent , applauding the sentiment in the abstract , but shrinking from its application to the swarthy Major Carew .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 18]: She stretched her hand across the table , and laid it caressingly on Cecil 's arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 4]: _ Pauvre _ !
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 4]: Dear old girl !
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 16]: It 's no use saying he was n't worth having -- that 's no comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 44]: When you have loved a man , it must be the worst blow of all to be obliged to despise him ; but men are not all like that , Cecil ; you must n't condemn them all because of one bad specimen .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 8]: I 've a great admiration for men .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 22]: As a whole they are _ bigger _ than women -- I mean mentally bigger -- freer from mean little faults .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 11]: As a rule they have a stricter sense of honour .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 30]: That 's an old-fashioned attitude , I suppose , but I do n't care ; it 's been my experience , and I can only speak what I know .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 14]: The average man _ is _ honourable , _ is _ faithful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 25]: `` Ah , you are speaking of your experience as a leisured girl -- a girl living at home with her mother behind her .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 12]: It 's a different story when you are on your own .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 31]: A man finds it pleasant enough to be friends with a bachelor girl , to take her about , give her little presents , and play the fairy prince generally .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 24]: The dear little soul is so grateful '' -- Cecil 's voice took a bitter note -- `` so appreciative of his condescension !
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 13]: He can enjoy her society without being bothered with chaperons and conventions .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 12]: It is really an uncommonly jolly way of passing the time .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 22]: But , when it comes to _ marrying _ , does he want to _ marry _ the bachelor girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 25]: Claire pushed her chair from the table , her face looked suddenly white and tired , there was a suspicious quiver in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 11]: `` Oh , Cecil , do n't , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 6]: You are poisoning me again .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 7]: Leave me _ some _ faith !
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 22]: If I ca n't believe in my fellow-creatures , I 'd rather die at once , and be done with it .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 12]: It stifles me to breathe the atmosphere of distrust and suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 6]: And it is n't true .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 20]: There _ are _ good men , who would be all the more chivalrous because a girl was alone .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 4]: I know it !
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 6]: I 'm sure of it !
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 19]: I refuse to believe that every man is a blackguard because you have had an unfortunate experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 6]: Mary Rhodes stared , abashed .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 36]: Since the night when Claire had implored her not to poison her mind , she had never seen her merry , easy-going companion so aroused ; but for the moment regret was swamped in curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 44]: Ostensibly Claire was arguing in the plural , but in reality she was defending a definite man ; Cecil was sure of it ; saw her suspicion confirmed in the paling cheeks and distended eyes ; heard it confirmed in the shaking voice .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 7]: But who could the man be ?
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 53]: Claire was the most candid , the most open of colleagues ; she loved to talk and describe any experiences which came her way ; every time she returned from an afternoon in town she had a dozen amusing incidents to recount , which in themselves constituted a guide to her doings .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 36]: Cecil felt satisfied that Claire had had no masculine escort on any of these occasions , and with the one exception of Mrs Willoughby 's `` At Home '' she had paid no social visits .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 23]: Yet there did exist a man on whose honour she was prepared to pin her faith ; of that Cecil was convinced .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 15]: Probably it was someone in Brussels whom she was still hoping to meet again !
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 13]: `` Well , do n't get excited , '' she said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 23]: `` If you choose to look upon life as a fairy tale , it 's not my business to wake you up .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 11]: The Sleeping Beauty position is very soothing while it lasts .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 13]: Do n't say I did n't warn you , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 26]: I do n't call it exactly ` poisonous ' to try to prevent another girl from suffering as badly as one has suffered oneself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 16]: `` Perhaps not -- certainly not , but it was the way you did it .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 9]: Sorry , Cecil , if I was cross !
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 24]: I hope _ this _ time , dear , all will go well , and that you 'll be very , very happy .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 7]: Do tell me anything you can .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 14]: I wo n't ask questions , but I 'd love to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 9]: Cecil 's laugh had rather a hard intonation .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 5]: `` Oh , well !
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 6]: once bitten , twice shy .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 13]: I 'm older this time , and it 's a different thing .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 15]: Perhaps I shall be all the happier because I do n't expect too much .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 28]: He 's very devoted , and he 'll be rich some day , but his father gives him no allowance , which makes things tight just now .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 21]: He is an erratic old man , almost a miser , but there are pots of money in the family .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 31]: Frank showed me the name in _ Landed Gentry _ ; there 's quite a paragraph about them , and I 've seen a picture of the house , too .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 11]: A beautiful place ; and he 's the eldest son .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 10]: It 's in Surrey -- quite near town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 12]: `` He has n't taken you down to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 4]: `` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 6]: It 's a private engagement .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 6]: His father does n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 11]: He is waiting for a chance to tell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 14]: `` Would n't the father be glad for his heir to marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 14]: `` He would n't be glad for him to marry _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 14]: But the estate is entailed , so Frank can do as he likes .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 42]: But the old man is ill , always having asthma and heart attacks , so it would n't do to upset him , and of course till he knows , Frank ca n't tell any other members of the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 23]: Claire , standing by the fireplace , gave a vague assent , and was glad that her face was hidden from view .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 29]: For Cecil 's sake she intensely wanted to believe in Major Carew and his account of his own position , but instinctively she doubted , instinctively she feared .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 25]: She remembered the look of the man 's face as he had stood facing her across the little room , and her distrust deepened .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 12]: He did not look straight ; he did not look true .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 15]: Probably the old father had a good reason for keeping him short of money .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 46]: If he were really in love with Cecil , and determined to marry her , that was so much to his credit ; but Claire hated the idea of that secrecy , marvelled that Cecil could submit a second time to so humiliating a position .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 3]: Poor Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 13]: how _ awful _ it would be if she were again deceived !
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 9]: A protective impulse stirred in Claire 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 13]: `` She sha n't be , if I can help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 5]: cried the inner voice .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 13]: At that moment she vowed herself to the service of Mary Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 8]: `` A big country house in Surrey !
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 11]: That 's the ideal residence of the heroine of fiction .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 7]: It does sound romantic , Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 16]: I should love to think of you as the mistress of a house like that .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 12]: Come and sit by the fire , and let us talk .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 52]: It 's so exciting to talk of love affairs instead of exercises and exams ... Let 's pretend we are just two happy , ordinary girls , with no form-rooms looming ahead , and that one of us is just engaged , and telling the other ` all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 3]: Now begin !
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 5]: Begin at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 8]: How did you meet him first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 18]: But there a difficulty arose , for Cecil grew suddenly red , and stumbled over her words .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 12]: `` Oh -- well -- I -- We _ met _ !
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 14]: It was an accident -- quite an accident -- rather a romantic accident .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 11]: I was coming home one Sunday evening a year ago .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 27]: I had been to church in my best clothes , and when I was halfway here the skies opened , and the rain _ descended _ .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 3]: Such rain !
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 3]: A deluge !
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 11]: Dancing up from the pavement , streaming along the gutters .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 13]: I had n't an umbrella , of course -- just my luck !
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 13]: -- and I 'd had my hat done up that very week .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 32]: I tore it off , and wrapped it in the tails of my coat , and just as that critical moment Frank passed , saw me doing it , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 16]: Then he asked if I would allow him to shelter me home beneath his umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 51]: I 'm _ not _ the girl to allow men to speak to me in the street , but at that moment , in that deluge , when he 'd just seen me take off my hat , _ could _ a gentleman do less than offer to shelter me ?
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 9]: Would it have been sane to refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 10]: `` No ; I do n't think it would .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 9]: I should certainly have said yes , too .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 16]: That 's the sort of thing that would have been called chivalry in olden times .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 7]: It 's chivalry _ now _ .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 7]: He was quite right to offer .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 18]: It would have been horrible if he had passed by and left you to be drenched . ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 5]: Cecil brightened with relief .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 9]: `` That 's what _ I _ thought !
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 61]: So I said ` Yes ' ; and , of course , while we walked we talked , and the wind blew my hair into loose ends , and the damp made them curl , and the excitement gave me a colour ; and it was so nice to talk to a man again , Claire , after everlasting women !
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 27]: I _ did _ look pretty when I saw myself in the glass when I came in , almost as I used to look years before .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 25]: And he looked handsome , too , big and strong , and so delightfully like a man , and unlike a member of staff !
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 18]: We liked each other very much , and when we got to this door -- '' Silence .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 9]: Mary Rhodes waited wistfully for a helping word .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 12]: Claire stared into the fire , her brows knitted in suspense .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 11]: `` Well , naturally , we were sorry to part !
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 15]: He asked if I usually went to Saint C -- for the evening service .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 11]: I did n't , but I said ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 19]: I knew he meant to meet me again , and I _ wanted _ to be met . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 33]: Claire sent her thoughts back and recalled a certain Sunday evening when she had offered to accompany Cecil to church , and had been bluntly informed that her company was not desired .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 13]: She had taken the hint , and had not offered it again .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 14]: She was silent , waiting for the revelations which were still to come .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 10]: `` So after that it became a regular thing .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 13]: He met me outside the church door , and saw me home .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 43]: He often asked me to go out with him during the week , but I always refused , until suddenly this term I was so tired , so hungry for a change that I gave in , and promised that I would .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 9]: I suppose that shocks you into fits ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 5]: `` It does rather .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 26]: You see , '' explained Claire laboriously , `` I 've been brought up on the Continent , where such a thing would be impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 9]: It would be an insult to suggest it .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 10]: Even here in England it does n't seem right .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 28]: Do you think a really nice man who was attracted by a girl would n't find some other way -- get an introduction _ somehow _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 16]: It 's easy to talk , but _ how _ is he to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 6]: We live in different worlds .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 32]: I am a High School teacher , living in rooms in London , without a relation or a house open to me where I am intimate enough to take a friend .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 14]: He is an officer in a crack regiment , visiting at fashionable houses .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 24]: Ca n't you imagine how his hostesses would stare if he asked them to call upon me here , in this poky room !
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 31]: And if he loves me , if I interest him more than the butterflies of Society , if he wants to know me better , what is he to do ?
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 25]: Tell me that , my dear , before you blame me for taking a little bit of fun when I get the chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 8]: But Claire had no suggestion to make .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 37]: She herself had been strong enough to refuse a friendship on similar lines , but she had been living a working life for a bare four months , while Cecil had been teaching for twelve years .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 37]: Twelve years of a second-hand life , living in other women 's houses , teaching other women 's children , obeying other women 's rules ; with the one keen personal experience of a slighted love !
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 19]: The tale of close on four thousand nights represented a dreary parlour and a pile of exercise books .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 61]: For twelve long years this woman had worked away , losing her youth , losing her bloom , cut off from all that nature intended her to enjoy ; and then at the end behold a change in the monotony , the sudden appearance of a man who sought her , admired her , craved her society as a boon !
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 27]: The tears came to Claire 's eyes as she put herself in such a woman 's place , and realised all that this happening would mean .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 20]: Renewal of youth , renewal of hope , renewal of interest and zest ... `` I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 6]: I do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 4]: she said brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 8]: `` It 's all wrong , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 20]: You ought not to be forced into such a position , but I do n't blame you , Cecil .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 26]: It 's the _ other _ women who deserve the blame , the women who are better off , and could have opened their houses .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 21]: You have been so drearily dull all these long years that you would have been more than human to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 24]: But now , dear , now that you are engaged , surely he has some friends to whom he could introduce you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 6]: Mary Rhodes shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 7]: `` Not till his people know .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 27]: It might come round to their ears , and that would make things more difficult still ; but I am hoping it wo n't be long .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 64]: Now , Claire , I 've told _ you _ , because you are such a kind understanding little soul , and it 's a comfort to talk things out ; but I 'll kill you if you dare to breathe a word to another soul -- Sophie Blake , or Mrs Willoughby , or even your mother when you write to her .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 23]: You can never tell how these things are repeated , and Frank would never forgive me if it came out through me .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 15]: Promise faithfully that you 'll never mention his name in connection with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 6]: `` Of course I will .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 7]: What do you take me for ?
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 11]: I should n't dream of doing such a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 53]: `` Of course , at the Willoughbys ' , for instance , if anyone _ did _ mention his name -- they might , quite well , for I should think they were in much the same set -- there would be no harm in saying that you 'd heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 11]: I should rather like to hear what they said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 52]: Cecil 's face looked wistful as she spoke these last words , but the next moment her expression changed to one of pure amazement as the whirr of the cuckoo clock made itself heard , and the little brown bird hopped out of its niche , and sounded five clear notes .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 7]: `` Gracious , what 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 7]: Where did that come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 12]: `` It was a Christmas present to me from abroad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 37]: Claire added the last words in the fond hope that they would save further criticism , and Cecil rose from her seat , and stood in front of the hanging clock examining it with critical eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 7]: `` It 's a good one .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 7]: Most of them are so gimcrack .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 3]: From abroad ?
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 9]: One of your Belgian friends , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 9]: Does it make that awful row every hour ?
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 15]: I ca n't stand it here , you know , if it does . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 6]: `` Do n't trouble yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 6]: I 'll take it upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 10]: I _ like _ the ` awful row . '
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 20]: I put it here because I thought it would be a pleasure to you as well as to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 5]: I 'm sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 5]: `` What a tantrum !
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 8]: Evidently the clock is a tender point .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 9]: Better leave it here and stop the gong .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 9]: It will keep you awake all night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 8]: `` I wo n't stop the gong !
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 9]: I -- I like to be waked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 4]: declared Claire obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 19]: She lifted the clock from its nail , and stalked out of the room , head in air .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 7]: Cecil whistled softly between pursed lips .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 4]: AN UNPLEASANT TEA-PARTY .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 53]: In the inevitable fatigue which had marked Claire 's first experience of regular work , she had looked forward with joy to the coming of the holidays when she would be able to take her ease , and for a month on end laze through the hours at her own sweet will .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 14]: A teacher scores above other workers in the length of holidays she enjoys .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 37]: Several months in the year contrasts strongly with the fortnight or three weeks enjoyed by a female clerk or typist ; in no other profession is so large a proportion of the year given to rest .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 42]: Claire had condemned the staff at Saint Cuthbert 's for want of appreciation of this privilege ; but , before the four weeks of the Christmas holidays were over , her eyes were opened to the other side of the picture .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 5]: Holidays were horribly expensive !
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 75]: Living `` at home '' meant an added bill for fire and light to add to the necessary expenses abroad ; that the last items were necessary could hardly be denied , for a girl who had been shut up in a schoolroom through three months of term , naturally wished to amuse herself abroad during holiday time , and in London even the most carefully planned amusement has a habit of costing money .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 39]: Even that mild dissipation of shop-gazing , enjoyed by Sophie Blake , plus the additional excitement of choosing an imaginary present from every window , could only be enjoyed at the price of two Tube or omnibus fares .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 22]: Boots wore out , too , and gloves grew shabby , and the January sales furnished a very fire of temptation .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 68]: Claire had never before seen such bargains as confronted her down the length of Oxford and Regent Streets , and , though she might be firm as adamant on Monday or Tuesday , Wednesday was bound to bring about a weak moment which carried her over the threshold of a shop , and once inside , with sensational sacrifices dangling within reach , resistance melted like wax .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 14]: `` Where do you suppose you are going to wear that concoction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 28]: Mary Rhodes asked blightingly as Claire opened a cardboard box which had arrived by the morning delivery , and displayed a blue muslin dress inset with lace .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 43]: `` Lords , I suppose , or Ascot , or Ranelagh , or Hurlingham , or Henley ... They come on in June and July , just as poor High School - mistresses are in the thick of cramming for the Matric .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 13]: But _ no _ doubt you are the exception to the rule !
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 19]: ... You must think you are , at least , to have bought a frock like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 13]: `` Cecil , it was wickedly cheap -- it was , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 37]: It was one of a few summer dresses which were positively given away , and it 's made in the simple , picturesque style which I love , and which does not go out of date .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 39]: I had n't the least intention of buying anything , until I saw it hanging there , at that price , and it looked at me so longingly , as if it _ wanted _ to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 8]: `` It 's well to be rich !
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 25]: It might have longed at me as much as it liked , I could n't have bought it , if it had been two-and-six !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 39]: I need all my money for necessities , '' Mary Rhodes said , sighing ; and Claire felt a pang of reproach , for , since her return , Cecil had indeed seemed painfully short of loose cash .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 25]: The debt still outstanding had been increased by various small borrowings , insignificant in themselves , yet important as showing how the wind blew .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 24]: Claire wondered if perchance the poor soul had crippled herself by presenting her lover with a Christmas gift which was beyond her means .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 15]: The third week of the holidays arrived ; in another week school would begin .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 29]: Claire succumbed to temptation once more , purchased two good tickets for an afternoon concert at the Queen 's Hall , and invited Cecil to be her guest .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 26]: Cecil hesitated , evidently torn between two attractions , asked permission to defer her answer until the next day , but finally decided to accept .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 38]: From remarks dropped from time to time Claire had gathered that Major Carew was not fond of indoor entertainments , and somewhat disappointed his _ fiancee _ by his unwillingness to indulge her wishes in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 24]: In this instance she had evidently balanced the concert against an afternoon in the Major 's society , and the concert had won .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 7]: Claire found herself cordially in agreement .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 26]: When the afternoon arrived the two girls arrayed themselves in their best clothes , and set off in high spirits for their afternoon 's amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 20]: Their seats were in a good position , and the concert was one of the best of the season .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 75]: All went as happily as it could possibly go , until the last strains of `` God save the King '' had been played , and the audience filed out of the hall on to the crowded pavement , and then , with a throb of disgust , Claire recognised the figure of a man who was standing directly beneath a lamp-post , his black eyes curiously scanning the passing stream -- Major Carew !
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 24]: He had evidently been told of the girls ' destination , and had come with the express purpose of meeting them coming out .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 32]: For the moment , however , they were unrecognised , and Claire gave a quick swerve to the right , hurrying out of the patch of light into the dimness beyond .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 21]: The street was so full that , given a minute 's start , it would surely be easy to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 13]: She slid her hand through Cecil 's arm , drawing her forward .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 4]: `` Come along !
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 3]: Come along !
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 14]: Let 's hurry to Fuller 's before all the tables are taken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 4]: `` Fuller 's ?
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 2]: Tea ?
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 3]: How scrumptious !
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 6]: Just what I longed for .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 11]: Listening to classical music _ is _ thirsty work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 5]: Cecil replied , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 26]: She was so lively , so natural and unconcerted that Claire absolved her on the moment from any arrangement as to a _ rendez-vous _ .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 55]: In her anxiety to secure the longed-for cup of tea she broke into a half-run , but it was too late ; the sharp black eyes had spied them out , the tall figure loomed by their side , the large face , with its florid colouring , smiled a broad smile of welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 5]: `` Hulloa , Mary !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 5]: Thought it was you .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 6]: I was just passing along .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 6]: Good afternoon , Miss Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 11]: It _ is _ Miss Gifford , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 13]: Had a good concert , I hope -- a pleasant afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 12]: `` Very good , thank you , '' said Claire shortly .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 8]: Mary cried , `` Oh , Frank !
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 4]: _ You _ !
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 5]: How did you come ?
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 27]: I did n't expect -- '' And the tone of her voice showed that the surprise was hardly more agreeable to her than to her companion .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 26]: However welcome her lover might be on other occasions , it was obvious that she had not wished to see him at this particular moment .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 24]: `` Well , well , we must move on ; we must n't block up the pavement , '' the Major said hastily .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 23]: He took his place by the kerb , which placed him next to Claire , and bent over with an assiduous air .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 8]: `` You must let me escort you !
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 8]: Where were you bound for next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 3]: Claire hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 27]: She wished with all her heart that she had not mentioned Fuller 's , so that she could reply that they were bound for the Tube .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 41]: Oxford Circus was only a step away ; in five minutes they could have been seated in the train ; but Cecil had declared that she was longing for tea , so it would be ungracious to withdraw the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 9]: `` We were going to Fuller 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 4]: `` Right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 7]: The Major 's tone was complacent .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 4]: `` Good idea !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 5]: How shall we go ?
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 2]: Taxi ?
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 2]: Tube ?
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 6]: Which do you prefer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 7]: Claire stared at him in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 6]: `` But it 's here !
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 3]: Quite close .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 6]: We 're nearly there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 31]: He looked disconcerted , unnecessarily disconcerted , Claire thought ; for it was surely no disgrace for a man to be ignorant of the locality of a confectioner 's shop !
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 29]: From the other side came Cecil 's voice , cool and constrained -- `` If you were going anywhere , Frank , you need n't stay with us .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 7]: We can look after each other .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 9]: We are accustomed to going about alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 7]: `` Please allow me the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 6]: There 's plenty of time .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 7]: I should enjoy some tea immensely .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 10]: Always take it when I get the chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 35]: The block on the pavement made consecutive conversation impossible , and the three edged their way in and out in silence until Fuller 's was reached , and one of the last tables secured .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 28]: The room looked very bright and dainty , the Christmas garlands still festooning the walls and framing the mirrors , the hanging lights covered by rose-coloured shades .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 43]: The soft pink light was very kind to the complexions of the visitors , nevertheless Claire felt a guilty pang as she looked into the nearest mirror and beheld the reflection of herself and her friend as they sat side by side .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 47]: As a rule , it was pure pleasure to realise her own fair looks ; but for the moment they were of no importance , whereas poor dear Cecil had a lover to please , and there was no denying Cecil was not looking her best !
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 7]: Her expression was frowning and dissatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 43]: She had taken off her veil in the hall and her hair was disarranged ; compared with the fashionable groups round the other tables , she looked suddenly shabby and insignificant , her little attempts at decoration pitifully betraying the amateur hand .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 14]: `` Oh , dear me , why _ wo n't _ she smile ?
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 8]: She looks quite pretty when she smiles .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 17]: I 'll hold her before a mirror some day and show her the difference it makes .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 7]: Ten years disappear in a flash !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 19]: Now what in the world had I better be -- agreeable and chatty , or cold and stand-off ?
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 28]: I 'll do anything to please her , but it _ is _ hard lines having our afternoon spoiled , and being sulked at into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 11]: Cakes , please -- lots of sweet , sugary cakes !
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 7]: Wo n't that do , Cecil ?
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 8]: We can have bread-and-butter at home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 3]: `` Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 2]: Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 5]: Her name is Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 8]: Why do you call her Cecil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 12]: cried the Major quickly , looking from one girl to another .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 26]: Claire fancied there was a touch of suspicion in his voice , and wondered that he should show so much interest in a mere nickname .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 12]: `` Because she is ` Rhodes , ' of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 14]: For a moment his stare showed no understanding , then , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 4]: that fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 4]: he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 4]: `` I see !
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 7]: It 's a pretty name anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 5]: Beats Mary to fits .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 7]: Mary is so dull and prosaic .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 6]: Too many of them about .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 8]: One gets sick of the sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 11]: `` Is that intended for me by any chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 16]: asked Cecil in her most acid tones , whereupon the Major cried , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 13]: Put my foot in it that time , did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 19]: and burst into a long guffaw of laughter , which brought on him the eyes of the surrounders .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 46]: Claire 's interest had already been aroused by a little party of two men and two women who were sitting at a table in the corner of the room , and who were , to her thinking , by far the most attractive personalities present .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 24]: The men were tall , well set up , not especially handsome in any way , but possessing an unmistakable look of breeding .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 28]: One of the women was old , the other young , and it would have been hard to say which was the more attractive of the two .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 23]: They were quietly but very elegantly dressed , handsome furs being thrown back , to show pretty bodices of ninon and lace .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 47]: When Major Carew gave that loud unrestrained laugh , the four members of this attractive party turned to see whence the sound arose ; but whereas three faces remained blankly indifferent , the fourth was in the moment transformed into an expression of the liveliest surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 43]: He stared , narrowing his eyes as if doubting that they were really seeing aright , twisted his head to get a fuller view , and , obtaining it , twisted back into his original position , his lips twitching with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 34]: Then he spoke a few words , his companions leant forward to listen , and to two faces out of the three , the laughter spread on hearing what he had to say .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 11]: Only the elder of the two ladies retained her gravity .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 16]: Her sweet glance rested on Claire 's face , and her brow contracted in distress .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 20]: In the Major and Cecil she showed no interest , but Claire 's appearance evidently aroused curiosity and pity .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 14]: `` What is _ she _ doing in that _ galere _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 25]: The question was written on every line of the sweet high - bred face , and Claire read its significance and flinched with distaste .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 6]: `` How they stare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 4]: cried Mary Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 12]: `` The man looked as if he knew you , Frank .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 8]: Do you know who he is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 9]: `` He 's a member of the Club .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 5]: His name is Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 8]: We know each other by sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 57]: Major Carew 's florid colour had grown a shade deeper , he was evidently disconcerted by the encounter ; but he made a strong effort to regain his composure , smiled at the two girls in turn , and cried lightly , `` Envies me , I suppose , seeing me with two such charmers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 9]: `` He did n't look exactly envious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 4]: Cecil said drily .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 20]: She also had noticed that reflection in the mirror , and it had not helped to soothe her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 35]: She felt an unreasoning anger against Claire for appearing more attractive than herself , but it did not occur to her that she was heightening the contrast by her own dour , ungracious manner .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 22]: Altogether that tea-party was a difficult occasion , and as it proceeded , Claire 's spirits sank ever lower and lower .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 40]: She had spent more than she had any right to afford on those two expensive tickets , hoping thereby to give pleasure , and now Cecil was in a bad temper , and would snap for days to come .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 48]: -- It was not a cheerful outlook , and for the second time a feeling of restiveness overtook her , a longing for a companion who would help the gaiety of life -- such a companion as pretty , lively , happy-go-lucky Sophie Blake , for example .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 10]: How refreshing it would be to live with Sophie !
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 28]: Just for a moment Claire dwelt wistfully on the possibility , then banished it with a loyal `` She does n't need me , and Cecil does .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 10]: She 's fond of me in her funny way .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 76]: She must be , for she has confided in me already , more than in any of the others whom she 's known for years , and perhaps I may be able to help ... '' The Major passed his cup for a second supply ; a waitress brought a plate of hot cakes ; the occupants of the corner table stood up , fastening furs and coats , and passed out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 45]: With their going Major Carew regained his vivacity , chaffed the girls on their silence , recounted the latest funny stories , and to Claire 's relief addressed himself primarily to his _ fiancee _ , thus putting her in the place of honour .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 18]: Nevertheless Claire was conscious that from time to time keen glances were cast in her own direction .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 30]: She had a feeling that no detail of her attire escaped scrutiny , that the black eyes noted one and all , wondered , and speculated , and appraised .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 62]: She saw them dwell on the handsome fur stole and muff which Mrs Judge bequeathed to her daughter on sailing for India , on the old diamond ring and brooch which had been handed over to her on her twenty-first birthday ; she had an instinctive feeling that she rose in the man 's estimation because of her air of prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 10]: He made tentative efforts to arrange a further meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 13]: `` Where do _ you _ go on Sundays , Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 11]: I say , we must arrange another tea like this .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 8]: Lots of good tea places in town .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 6]: We must sample them together .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 9]: What do you say , Miss Gifford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 28]: Claire 's answers were politely evasive , and presently he began to grow restless , and finally pulled out his watch , and jumped to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 5]: `` How time flies !
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 9]: I had no idea it was so late .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 4]: I must run .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 9]: So sorry to leave you like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 6]: Mary Rhodes stared in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 3]: `` Leave !
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 2]: Frank !
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 20]: But you said -- I thought we were going -- '' `` Yes , I know , I know .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 16]: I 'm sorry , I thought I was free -- but -- a regimental engagement !
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 7]: Ca n't get out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 7]: I 'll fix up another night .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 5]: I 'll write . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 57]: There was no doubt that he was genuinely disconcerted at the lateness of the hour , and his leave-taking was of the most hasty description , though he found time to give a lingering pressure to Claire 's hand ; then he was gone , and the waitress came across the room and presented the bill .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 4]: Cecil flushed uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 6]: `` I must pay this .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 4]: Frank has forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 9]: He rushed off in such a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 13]: She pulled out her shabby purse , and Claire made no protest .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 26]: In a similar position she herself would have wished to pay , but it was inconceivable that she should ever be in such a position .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 21]: However hurried a man might be -- She rubbed her hand on her knee with a little shudder of distaste .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 3]: `` Wretch !
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 15]: He would make love to me , too , if I would allow it !
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 11]: How can Cecil possibly care for such a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 15]: And then she forgot Cecil 's feelings to ponder on a more perplexing problem .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 22]: Why had the man called Vavasour looked so amused , and why had the sweet - faced woman looked so distressed ?
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 4]: A DOUBLE INVITATION .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 37]: Janet Willoughby sent Claire a picture postcard , all white snow and strong shadow , and dazzling blue sky , and little black figures pirouetting on one leg with the other raised perilously in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 6]: `` This is me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 24]: was written across the most agile of the number , while a scrawling line across the top ran , `` Happy New Year !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 4]: Returning on Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 7]: Hope to see you soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 23]: Tuesday was the day on which school re-opened ; but Janet 's holiday was year long , not a short four weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 19]: Cecil moaned loudly , but Claire was tired of aimless days , and welcomed the return to work .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 53]: She determined to throw her whole heart into her task , and work as no junior French mistress had ever worked before ; she determined never to lose patience , never to grow cross , never to indulge in a sarcastic word , always to be a model of tact and forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 39]: She determined to wield such an ennobling influence over the girls in her form-room that they should take fire from her example , and go forth into the world perfect , high-souled women who should leaven the race .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 28]: She determined also to be the life and soul of the staff-room -- the general peace-maker , confidante , and consoler , beloved by one and all .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 26]: She determined to seize tactfully upon every occasion of serving the Head , and acting as a buffer between her and disagreeables of every kind .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 47]: She arranged a touching scene wherein Miss Farnborough , retiring from work and being asked by the Committee to name a worthy successor , pronounced unhesitatingly , `` Claire Gifford ; she is but young , but her wisdom and diplomacy are beyond all praise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 32]: She saw herself Head of Saint Cuthbert 's , raised to the highest step of her scholastic ladder , but somehow the climax was not so exhilarating as the climb itself .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 19]: To be head mistress was , no doubt , a fine achievement , but it left her cold .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 10]: Inside Saint Cuthbert 's all was life and bustle .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 33]: Girls streaming along the corridors , in and out of every room ; girls of all ages and sizes and shapes , but all to-day bearing an appearance of happiness and animation .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 51]: Bright-coloured blouses shone forth in their first splendour ; hair - ribbons stood out stiff and straight ; many of the girls carried bunches of flowers to present to the special mistress for whom they cherished the fashionable `` G.P. '' -LRB- grand passion -RRB- so characteristic of school life .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 10]: Flora had a bunch of early daffodils for Claire .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 31]: Another girl presented a pot of Roman hyacinths for the decoration of the form-room , a third a tiny bottle of scent ; three separate donors supplied buttonholes of violets .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 9]: The atmosphere was full of kindness and affection .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 17]: Girls encountering each other would fall into each other 's arms with exclamations of ecstatic affection .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 8]: `` Oh , you precious lamb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 6]: `` My angel child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 10]: `` You dear , old , darling duck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 27]: Claire heard a squat , ugly girl with spectacles and a turned-up nose addressed as `` a princely pet '' by an ardent adorer of fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 24]: The mistresses came in for their own share of adulation -- `` Darling Miss Gifford , I _ do _ adore you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 13]: `` Miss Gifford , darling , you are prettier than ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 18]: `` Oh , Miss _ Gifford _ , I was _ dying _ to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 15]: The morning flew past , and lunch-time brought the gathering of mistresses in staff-room .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 29]: Mademoiselle 's greetings were politely detached , Fraulein was kindly and discursive , Sophie 's smile was as bright as ever , but she did not look well .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 8]: `` Oh , I 'm all right !
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 4]: It 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 7]: Only this horrid old pain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 4]: she said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 12]: Into her glass of water she dropped three tabloids of aspirin .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 42]: Every one had been away for a longer or shorter time , visiting relatives and friends ; they compared experiences ; some had enjoyed themselves , some had not ; but they all agreed that they were refreshed by the change .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 10]: `` And where have _ you _ been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 20]: asked the drawing mistress of Claire , and exclaimed in surprise at hearing that she had remained in town .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 10]: `` Dear me , I wish I had known !
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 7]: I 've been back a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 7]: We might have done something together .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 8]: Were n't you _ dull _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 10]: asked the drawing mistress , staring with curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 4]: `` Very ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 16]: answered poor Claire , and for a moment struggled with a horrible inclination to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 23]: After lunch Miss Bates took her cup of coffee to Claire 's side , and made an obvious attempt to be pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: `` I feel quite remorseful to think of your holidays .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 16]: It 's astonishing how little we mistresses know of each other out of school hours .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 37]: The first school I was in -- a much smaller one by the sea , -- we were so friendly and jolly , just like sisters , but in the big towns every one seems detached .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 7]: It 's hard on the new-comers .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 28]: I do n't know _ what _ I should have done if I had n't a brother 's house to go to on Sundays and holiday afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 12]: Except through him , I have n't made a single friend .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 30]: At the other place people used to ask us out , and we had quite a good time ; but in town people are engrossed in their own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 9]: They have n't time to go outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 9]: `` I wonder you ever left that school !
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 8]: What made you want to change ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 5]: `` Oh , well !
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 5]: London was a lure .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 14]: Most people want to come to London , and I had my brother .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 14]: Do tell me , another time , if you are not going away .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 10]: It worries me to think of you being alone .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 18]: How did you come to get this post , if you have no connections in town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 26]: `` Miss Farnborough came to stay in Brussels , in the _ pension _ which my mother and I had made headquarters for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 7]: She offered me the post . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 7]: Miss Bates stared with distended eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 9]: `` How long had she known you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 8]: `` About a fortnight , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 7]: I do n't remember exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 9]: `` And you had never seen her before ?
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 7]: She knew nothing about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 18]: `` She had never seen me before , but she _ did _ know something about me .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 12]: Professionally speaking , she knew all there was to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 12]: `` That accounts for it , '' said Miss Bates enigmatically .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 14]: `` I wondered -- You are not a bit the usual type . ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 14]: `` I hope that does n't mean that I ca n't teach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 10]: Miss Bates laughed , and shrugged her thin shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 12]: I should say , personally , that you teach very well .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 6]: That play was extraordinarily good .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 6]: It absolutely sounded like French .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 11]: Ca n't think how you knocked the accent into them !
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 16]: English girls are so self - conscious ; they are ashamed of letting themselves go .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 47]: Mademoiselle thinks that your classes are too like play ; but it does n't matter what she thinks , so long as -- '' she paused a moment , lowered her voice , and added impressively , `` Keep on the right side of Miss Farnborough .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 14]: You are all right so long as you are in her good books .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 5]: Better be careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 20]: Claire stared , puzzled and discomposed , decidedly on the offensive ; but Miss Bates refused a definite answer .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 4]: she said tersely .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 16]: `` Only -- people who take sudden fancies , can take sudden dislikes , too .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 20]: Ask no more questions , but do n't say I did n't warn you , that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 21]: She lifted her coffee-cup , and strolled away , leaving Claire to reflect impatiently , '' _ More _ poison !
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 5]: It 's too bad .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 11]: They wo n't _ let _ one be happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 26]: Before the end of the week school work settled into its old routine , and the days passed by with little to mark their progress .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 25]: The English climate was at its worst , and three times out of four the journey to school was accomplished in rain or sleet .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 39]: The motor - ` buses were crammed with passengers , and manifested an unpleasant tendency to skid ; pale - faced strap-holders crowded the carriages of the Tube ; for days together the sky remained a leaden grey .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 13]: It takes a Mark Tapley himself to keep smiling under such conditions .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 55]: As Claire recalled the days when she and her mother had sat luxuriously under the trees in the gardens of Riviera hotels , listening to exhilarating bands , and admiring the outline of the Esterels against the cloudless blue of the sky , the drab London streets assumed a dreariness which was almost insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 30]: Also , though she would not acknowledge it to herself , she was achingly disappointed , because something which she had sub-consciously been expecting did not come to pass .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 30]: She had expected something to happen , but nothing happened ; all through February the weeks dragged on , unrelieved by any episode except the weekly mail from India .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 23]: The little brown bird still industriously piped the hour ; but his appearance no longer brought the same warm thrill of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 11]: And then one morning came a note from Janet Willoughby .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 26]: `` Dear Miss Gifford , -- `` I should really like to call you ` Claire , ' but I must wait to be asked !
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 43]: I have been meaning to write ever since we returned from Saint Moritz ; but you know how it is in town , such a continual rush , that one can never get through half the things that ought to be done !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 9]: We should all like to see you again .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 41]: Mother has another ` At Home ' on Thursday evening next , and would be glad to see you then , if you cared to come ; but what _ I _ should like is to have you to myself !
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 23]: On Saturday next I could call for you , as I did at Christmas , and keep you for the whole day .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 25]: Then we could talk as we could n't do at the ` At Homes , ' which are really rather dull , duty occasions .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 12]: `` Let me know which of these propositions suits you best .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 19]: Looking forward to seeing you , -- `` Your friend , -LRB- if you will have me ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 5]: `` Janet Willoughby . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 19]: Claire had opened the letter , aglow with expectation ; she laid it down feeling dazed and blank .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 34]: For the moment only one fact stood out to the exclusion of every other , and that was that Janet did not wish her to be present at the `` At Home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 21]: Mrs Willoughby had sent the invitation , but Janet had supplemented it by another , which could not be refused .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 10]: `` I would rather have you to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 13]: How was it possible to refuse an invitation couched in such terms ?
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 21]: How could one answer with any show of civility , `` I should prefer to come with the crowd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 20]: Claire carried the letter up to her cold bedroom , and sat down to do a little honest thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 12]: `` It 's very difficult to understand what one really wants !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 18]: We deceive ourselves as much as we do other people ... Why am I so hideously depressed ?
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 53]: I liked going to the ` At Home , ' I liked dressing up , and driving through the streets , and seeing the flowers and the dresses , and having the good supper ; but , if that were all , I believe I 'd prefer the whole day with Janet .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 17]: I suppose , really , it 's Captain Fanshawe that 's at the bottom of it .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 19]: I want to meet him , I thought I should meet him , and now it 's over .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 15]: I sha n't be asked again when there 's a chance of his coming .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 6]: Janet does n't want me .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 86]: She 's not jealous , of course -- that 's absurd -- but she wants to keep him to herself , and she imagines somehow that I should interfere -- '' Imagination pictured Janet staring with puzzled , uneasy eyes across the tables in the dining-room , of Janet drearily examining the piled-up presents in the boudoir , and then , like a flash of light , showed the picture of another face , now eager , animated , admiring , again grave and wistful .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 9]: `` Is your address still the Grand Hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 12]: -- _ My _ address is still the Carlton Club . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 8]: `` Ah , well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 15]: acknowledged Claire to her heart , `` we _ did _ like each other .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 21]: We did love being together , and he remembered me ; he sent me the clock when he was away .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 7]: But it 's all over now .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: That was our last chance , and it 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 52]: He 'll go to the At Home , and Mrs Willoughby will tell him I was asked , but preferred to come when they were alone , and he 'll think it was because I wanted to avoid him , and -- and , oh , goodness , goodness , goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 20]: how _ miserable _ I shall feel sitting here all Thursday evening , imagining all that is going on !
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 16]: Oh , mother , mother , your poor little girl is _ so _ lonesome !
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 9]: Why did you go so far away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 30]: Claire put her head down on the dressing-table , and shed a few tears , a weakness bitterly regretted , for like all weaknesses the consequences wrought fresh trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 35]: Now her eyelids were red , and she was obliged to hang shivering out of the window , until they had regained their natural colour , before she could face Cecil 's sharp eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 26]: Janet arrived soon after eleven o'clock on Saturday morning , and was shown into the saffron parlour where Claire sat over her week 's mending .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 45]: She wore a spring suit purchased in Paris , and a hat which was probably smart , but very certainly was unbecoming , slanting as it did at a violent angle over her plump , good-humoured face , and almost entirely blinding one eye .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 21]: She caught sight of her own reflection in the overmantel and exclaimed , `` What a fright I look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 14]: as she seated herself by the table , and threw off her furs .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 7]: `` Do n't hurry , please .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 6]: Let me stay and watch .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 5]: What are you doing ?
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 4]: Mending a blouse ?
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 17]: How clever of you to be able to use your fingers as well as your brains !
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 10]: I never sew , except stupid fancy-work for bazaars .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 6]: So this is your room !
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 7]: You told me about the walls .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 13]: Can you imagine any one in cold blood choosing such a paper ?
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 8]: But it looks cosy all the same .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 13]: I _ do _ like little rooms with everything carefully in reach .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 15]: They are ever so much nicer than big ones , are n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 5]: Janet pealed with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 8]: `` That 's right , snub me !
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 6]: I deserve to be snubbed .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 13]: Of course , I meant when you have big ones as well !
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 10]: Who is the pretty girl in the carved frame ?
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 3]: Your mother !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 7]: Do you mean it , really ?
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 5]: What a ridiculous mamma !
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 17]: I 'm afraid , Claire , I 'm afraid she is even prettier than you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 10]: `` Oh , she is ; I know it .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 43]: But I have more charm , '' returned Claire demurely , whereat they laughed again -- a peal of happy girlish laughter , which reached Lizzie 's ears as she polished the oilcloth in the hall , and roused an envious sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 10]: `` It 's well to be some folks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 4]: thought poor Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 21]: `` Motor-cars , and fine dresses , and nothing to do of a Saturday morning but sit still and laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 12]: I could laugh myself if I was in her shoes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 14]: Claire folded away her blouse , and took up a bundle of gloves .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 6]: `` These are your gloves .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 9]: They have been such a comfort to me .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 7]: There 's a button missing somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 7]: Tell me all about your holiday !
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 7]: Did you have a good time ?
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 9]: Was it as nice as you expected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 25]: It _ was _ a good time , but -- do you think anything ever _ quite _ comes up to one 's expectation ?
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 20]: I had looked forward to that month for the whole year , and had built so many fairy castles .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 6]: You have stayed in Switzerland ?
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 25]: You know how the scene changes when the sun sinks , how those beautiful alluring rose-coloured peaks become in a minute awesome and gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 10]: Well , it was rather like that with me .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 25]: I do n't mean that it was gloomy ; that 's exaggerating , but it was prose , and I had pictured it poetry .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 2]: Heigho !
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 7]: It 's a weary world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: Claire 's glance was not entirely sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 8]: `` There are different kinds of prose .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 18]: You will forgive my saying that your especial sort is an _ Edition de luxe _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 4]: `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 13]: You ca n't be harder on me than I am on myself .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 10]: My dear , I have a most sensible head .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 15]: I 'm about as practical and long - headed as any woman of forty .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 10]: It 's my silly old heart which handicaps me .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 15]: It _ wo n't _ fall into line ... Have you finished your mending ?
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 13]: May I come upstairs and see your room while you dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 10]: For just the fraction of a moment Claire hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 38]: Janet saw the doubt , and attributed it to disinclination to exhibit a shabby room ; but in reality Claire was proud of her attic , which a little ingenuity had made into a very charming abode .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 26]: Turkey red curtains draped the window , a low basket-chair was covered in the same material , a red silk eiderdown covered the little bed .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 23]: On the white walls were a profusion of photographs and prints , framed with a simple binding of leather around the glass .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 27]: The toilet table showed an array of well-polished silver , while a second table was arranged for writing , and held a number of pretty accessories .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 24]: A wide board had been placed over the narrow mantel , on which stood a few good pieces of china and antique silver .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 42]: There was nothing gimcrack to be seen , no one-and-elevenpenny ornaments , no imitations of any kind ; despite its sloping roof and its whitewashed walls , it was self-evidently a lady 's room , and Janet 's admiration was unfeigned .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: `` My dear , it 's a lamb !
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 7]: I love your touches of scarlet .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 9]: Dear me , you 've quite a view !
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 11]: I shall have sloping walls when I change my room .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 8]: They are _ ever _ so picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 12]: It 's a perfect duck , and everything looks so bright .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 10]: They _ do _ keep it well ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 8]: _ I _ keep it well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 3]: Claire corrected .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 37]: `` Lizzie ` does ' it every morning , but it 's not a doing which satisfies me , so I put in a little manual labour every afternoon as a change from using my brain .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 6]: I do all the polishing .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 13]: You ca n't expect lodging-house servants to clean silver and brass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 5]: `` Ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 9]: No ; I suppose you ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 11]: Janet 's voice of a sudden sounded flat and absent .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 20]: There was a moment 's pause , then she added tentatively , `` You have a cuckoo clock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 22]: Claire was thankful that her face was screened from view as she was in the process of tying on her veil .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 12]: A muffled , `` Yes , '' was her only reply .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 15]: Janet stood in front of the clock , staring at it with curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 22]: `` It 's -- it 's like -- there were some just like this in a shop at Saint Moritz . ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 13]: `` They are all much alike , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 6]: `` I suppose they are .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 6]: Yes -- in a way .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 7]: Some are much better than others .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 14]: This is one of the best -- '' `` Yes , it is .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 5]: It keeps beautiful time .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 16]: I had it in the sitting-room , but Miss Rhodes objected to the noise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 12]: `` Was it in Saint Moritz that you bought it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 7]: `` I did n't buy it .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 6]: It was a present . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 33]: That finished the cross-questioning , since politeness forbade that Janet should go a step further and ask the name of the friend , which was what she was obviously longing to do .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 29]: She stood a moment longer , staring blankly at the clock , then gave a little sigh , and moved on to examine the ornaments on the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 17]: Five minutes later the two girls descended the staircase , and drove away from the door .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 46]: The next few hours passed pleasantly enough , but Claire wondered if it were her own imagination which made her think that Janet 's manner was not quite so frank and bright as it had been before she had caught sight of the cuckoo clock .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 35]: She never again said , `` Claire '' ; but her brown eyes studied Claire 's face with a wistful scrutiny , and from time to time a sharp little sigh punctuated her sentences .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 9]: `` But what could I tell her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 9]: Claire asked unhappily of her sub - conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 32]: `` I do n't _ know _ -- I only think ; and even if he _ did _ send it , it does n't necessarily affect his feelings towards her .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 28]: He was going to see her in a few days ; and she is rich and has everything she wants , while I am poor and alone .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 9]: It was just kindness , nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 23]: But though her head was satisfied with such reasoning , her heart , like Janet 's , refused to fall into line .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 39]: At tea-time several callers arrived , foremost among them a tall man whom Claire at once recognised as the original of a portrait which stood opposite to that of Captain Fanshawe on the mantelpiece of Janet 's boudoir .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 38]: This was `` the kind man , the thoughtful man , '' the man who remembered `` little things , '' and in truth he bore the mark of it in every line of his good-humoured face .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 43]: Apart from his expression , his appearance was ordinary enough ; but he was self-evidently a man to trust , and Claire found something pathetic in the wistful admiration which shone in his eyes as they followed Janet Willoughby about the room .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 27]: To ordinary observers she was just a pleasant girl with no pretensions to beauty ; to him she was obviously the most lovely of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 35]: He had no attention to spare for Claire or the other ladies present ; he was absorbed in watching Janet , waiting for opportunities to serve Janet , listening eagerly to Janet 's words .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 30]: It is not often that an unengaged lover is so transparent in his devotion , but Malcolm Heward was supremely indifferent to the fact that he betrayed his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 16]: At ten o'clock Claire rose to take leave , and Mrs Willoughby made a request .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 15]: `` I am going to ask you to do me a favour , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 29]: A friend is having a Sale of Work at her house for a charity in which we are both interested , and she has asked me to help .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 25]: It is on a Saturday afternoon and evening , and I wondered if I might ask you to take part in the little concerts .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 12]: Whistling is always popular , and you do it so charmingly .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 23]: I would send the car for you , and take you home , of course , and be so very much indebted .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 8]: You do n't mind my asking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 10]: `` No , indeed ; I should be delighted .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 10]: Please let me help you whenever you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 12]: In the bedroom upstairs Janet deliberately introduced Malcolm Heward 's name .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 12]: `` That was the man I told you about at Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 10]: He was one of the party at Saint Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 8]: What did you think of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 6]: `` I liked him immensely .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 9]: He looks all that you said he was .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 7]: He has a fine face . ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 8]: `` He wants to marry me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 4]: Claire laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: `` That 's obvious !
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 12]: I never saw a man give himself away so openly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 11]: `` Do you think I ought to accept him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 8]: `` Oh , how can I say ?
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 8]: It 's not for me to advise .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 16]: I hope , whoever you marry , you 'll be very , very happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 13]: Suddenly Janet came forward and laid her hands on Claire 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 10]: `` Oh , Claire , I do like you !
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 16]: I do want to be friends , but sometimes I have the strangest thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 27]: Before Claire had time to answer , she had drawn back again , and was saying with a little apologetic laugh , `` I am silly !
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 8]: Take no notice of what I say .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 10]: Here 's your fur ; here 's your muff .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 11]: Are you quite sure you have all your possessions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: A QUESTION OF MONEY .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 19]: The next week was memorable to Claire as marking the beginning of serious anxiety with regard to Sophie .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 41]: She had looked ill since the beginning of the term , and the bottle of aspirin tabloids had become quite an accustomed feature on the luncheon table ; but when questioned she had always a smile and an easy excuse .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 9]: `` What can you expect in this weather ?
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 12]: No one but a fish could help aching in these floods .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 7]: I 'm perfectly all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 34]: But one morning this week , meeting her on an upper landing , Claire discovered Sophie apparently dragging herself along with her hands , and punctuating each step with a gasp of pain .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 22]: She stood still and stared , whereupon Sophie instantly straightened herself , and ascended the remaining steps in a normal manner .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 13]: `` Sophie , '' cried Claire sternly , `` do n't pretend !
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 8]: I heard you ; I saw you !
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 11]: My dear girl , is the rheumatism so bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 15]: Sophie twisted her head this way and that , her lips pursed in warning .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 3]: `` S-sh !
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 3]: Be careful !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 7]: You never know who is about .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: I _ am _ rather stiff to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 9]: This raw fog has been the last straw .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 12]: I shall be all right when we get through this month .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 4]: I hate March !
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 8]: It finds out all the weak spots .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 10]: Please , Claire , do n't take any notice .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 3]: A Gym .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 8]: mistress has no business to have rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 14]: It 's really very good for me to be obliged to keep going .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 12]: It is always worse at the beginning of the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 23]: Claire went away with a pain in her heart , and the pain grew steadily as she watched Sophie throughout the week .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 56]: The pretty face was often drawn with pain , she rose and sat down with an obvious effort ; and still the rain poured , and the dark fog enveloped the city , and Sophie struggled to and from her work in a thin blue serge suit which had already seen three winters ' wear .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 26]: One day the subject came up for discussion in the staff-room , and Claire was shocked and surprised at the attitude of the other teachers .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 41]: They were sorry for Sophie , they sympathised , to a certain extent they were even anxious on her account , but the prevailing sentiment seemed to be that the kindest thing was to take no notice of her sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 15]: No use pitying her ; that would only make her more sorry for herself .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 15]: No use suggesting cures ; cures take time , not to speak of money .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 15]: The Easter holidays would soon be here ; perhaps she might try something then .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 9]: In the meantime -- _ tant pis _ !
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 9]: she must get along as best she could .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 9]: There was simply no time to be ill .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 14]: `` I 've a churchyard cough myself , '' declared the Arts mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 35]: `` I stayed in bed all Saturday and Sunday , and it was really a little better , but it was as bad as ever after a day in this big draughty hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 14]: `` And I am racked with neuralgia , '' chimed in Miss Bates .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 11]: The subject of Sophie was lost in a general lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 30]: Friday evening came , and after the girls had departed Claire went in search of Sophie , hoping tactfully to be able to suggest remedial methods over the week-end .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 36]: She peeped into several rooms before at last , in one of the smallest and most out-of-the-way , she caught sight of a figure crouched with buried head at the far end of the table .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 23]: It was Sophie , and she was crying , and catching her breath in a weak exhausted fashion , pitiful to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 15]: Claire shut the door tightly , and put her arms round the shaking form .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 6]: `` Miss Blake -- Sophie !
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 6]: You poor , dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 5]: You are tired out .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 19]: You have been struggling all the week , but it 's Friday night , dear , remember that !
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 10]: You can go home and just tumble into bed .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 12]: Do n't give way when you 've been so brave . ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 11]: But for the moment Sophie 's bravery had deserted her .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 5]: `` It 's raining !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 4]: It 's raining !
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 6]: It _ always _ rains .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 6]: I ca n't face it .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 16]: The pain 's all over me , and the omnibuses _ wo n't _ stop !
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 13]: They expect you to jump in , and I ca n't jump !
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 10]: I do n't know how to get home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 7]: `` Well , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 4]: Claire cried briskly .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 8]: `` There 's no difficulty about that .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 8]: I 'm sick of wet walks myself .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 15]: I 'll whistle for a taxi , and we 'll drive home in state .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 32]: I 'll take you home first , and then go on myself ; or , if you like , I 'll come in with you and help you to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 3]: `` P-please .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 9]: Oh , yes , please , do come !
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 35]: I do n't want to be alone , '' faltered Sophie weakly ; but she wiped her eyes , and in characteristic fashion began to cheer up at the thought of the drive home .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 24]: There was a cheerful fire burning in Sophie 's sitting-room , and the table was laid for tea in quite an appetising fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 24]: The landlady came in at the sound of footsteps , and showed a sympathetic interest at the sight of Sophie 's tear-stained face .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 15]: `` I _ told _ you you were n't fit to go out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 4]: she said sagely .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 25]: `` Now just sit yourself down before the fire , and I 'll take your things upstairs and bring you down a warm shawl .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 7]: Then you shall have your teas .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 18]: I 'll bring in a little table , so you can have it where you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 14]: She left the room , and Sophie looked after her with grateful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 9]: `` That 's what I pay for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 4]: she said eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 6]: `` She 's so kind !
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 11]: I love that woman for all her niceness to me .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 13]: I told you I had no right to pay so much rent .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 29]: I came in just for a few weeks until I could find something else , and I have n't had the _ heart _ to _ move _ .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: I 've been in such holes , and had such awful landladies .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 19]: They seem divided into two big classes , kind and dirty , or clean and _ mad _ !
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 28]: When you get one who is kind _ and _ clean , you feel so grateful that you 'd pay your last penny rather than move away .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 5]: Oh , how lovely !
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 3]: how lovely !
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 3]: how lovely !
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 18]: It 's Friday night , and I can be ill comfortably all the time till Monday morning !
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 12]: Are n't we jolly well-off to have our Saturdays to ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 16]: How thankful the poor clerks and typists would be to be in our place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 19]: She was smiling again , enjoying the warmth of the fire , the ease of the cushioned chair .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 45]: When Mrs Rogers entered she snoodled into the folds of a knitted shawl , and lay back placidly while the kind creature took off her wet shoes and stockings and replaced them by a long pair of fleecy woollen bed-socks , reaching knee high .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 32]: The landlady knelt to her task , and Sophie laid a hand on the top of starched lace and magenta velvet , and cried , `` Rise , Lady Susan Rogers !
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 17]: One of the truest ladies that ever breathed ... '' `` How you do talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 9]: said the landlady , but her eyes shone .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 20]: As she expounded to her husband in the kitchen , `` Miss Blake had such a way with her .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 24]: When ladies were like that you did n't care what you did , but there was them as treated you like Kaffirs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 55]: Tea was quite a cheerful and sociable little meal , during which no reference was made to Sophie 's ailments , but when the cups had been replaced on the central table , Claire seated herself and said with an air of decision -- `` Now we 're going to have a disagreeable conversation !
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 26]: I do n't approve of the way you have been going on this last month , and it 's time it came to an end .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 17]: You are ill , and it 's your business to take steps to get better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 14]: `` Yes ; and you are going to take them , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 9]: `` What am I going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 12]: `` You are going to see a specialist next week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 6]: `` You surprise me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 6]: Sophie smiled with exaggerated lightness .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 9]: `` What funny things one does hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 9]: `` Why should n't you see a specialist ?
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 11]: I defy you to give me one sensible reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 8]: `` I 'll do better than that .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 7]: I 'll give you two . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 6]: `` So do , then !
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 5]: What are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 4]: `` Guineas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 3]: said Sophie .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 11]: For a moment Claire stared blankly , then she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 6]: `` Oh , I see !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 6]: It is rather a haul .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 18]: But it 's better to harden your heart once for all , and pay it down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 10]: `` The two guineas is only the beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 7]: `` The beginning of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 4]: `` Trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 4]: said Sophie grimly .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 8]: `` Baths , at a guinea apiece .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 6]: Massage , half-a-guinea a time .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 8]: Medicine , liniments , change of air .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 8]: My dear , it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 24]: What 's the use of paying two guineas to hear a man tell you to do a dozen things which are hopelessly impossible ?
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 12]: It 's paying good money only to be aggravated and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 24]: If it comes to that , I can prescribe for myself without paying a sou ... Knock off all work for a year .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 16]: Go to Egypt , or some perfectly dry climate , and build up your strength .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 10]: Always get out of London for the winter months .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 14]: Live in the fresh air , and avoid fatigue ... How 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 10]: Does n't that strike you as admirable advice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 36]: She put her head on one side with a gallant attempt at a smile , but her lips twitched , and the flare of the incandescent light showed her face lined and drawn with pain .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 10]: Claire was silent , her heart cramping with pain .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 21]: The clock ticked on for several minutes , before she asked softly -- `` Have you no savings , Sophie ?
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 15]: No money to keep you if you _ did _ take a rest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 5]: `` Not a sou .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 10]: It 's all I can do to struggle along .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 27]: I told you I had to help a young sister , and things run up so quickly , that it does n't seem possible to save .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 29]: I suppose many people would say one ought to be able to do it on a hundred a year ; that 's all I have left for myself !
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 34]: Hundreds of women manage on less , but as a rule they come from a different class , and can put up with a style of living which would be intolerable to us .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 8]: I do n't complain of the pay .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 26]: I do n't think it is bad as things go : it 's only when illness comes that one looks ahead and feels -- frightened !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 16]: Suppose I broke down now , suppose I broke down in ten years ' time !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 38]: I should be over forty , and after working hard for twenty years I should be left without a penny piece ; thrown on the scrap heap , as a worn-out thing that was no more use .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 11]: But I might still live on , years upon years .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 9]: why did you make me think of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 11]: It does no good ; only gives one the hump .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 18]: There _ is _ no Pension scheme , so I simply ca n't afford to be ill .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 8]: That 's the end of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 26]: `` Do n't you think if you went to Miss Farnborough , and explained to her -- '' Sophie turned a flushed , protesting face .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 11]: Not for the world , and you must n't either .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 14]: Promise me faithfully that you will never give so much as a hint .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 29]: Miss Farnborough is a capital head , but her great consideration is for the pupils ; we only count in so far as we are valuable to them .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 43]: She 'd be sorry for me , of course , and would give me quite a lot of advice , but she 'd think at once , ` If she 's rheumatic , she wo n't be so capable as a Gym .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 10]: mistress ; I must get some one else ! '
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 18]: No , no , my dear , I must go on , I must fight it out .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 21]: You 'd be surprised to see how I _ can _ fight when Miss Farnborough comes on the scene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 14]: You have had your say , now I 'm going to have mine !
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 30]: If you go on as you have been doing the last month , growing stiffer week by week , you wo n't be _ able _ to hide it !
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 8]: The other mistresses talk about it already .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 9]: They were discussing you in staff-room last week .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 14]: If you go on trusting to chance , you are simply courting disaster .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 12]: Now I 'll tell you what I am going to do .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 22]: I 'm going to find out the address of a good specialist , and make an appointment for next Saturday morning .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 28]: You sha n't have any trouble about it , and I 'll call in a taxi , and take you myself , and bring you safely back .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 18]: And it will be the wisest and the cheapest two guineas you ever spent in your life .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 2]: Now !
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 10]: What have you got to say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 13]: `` Oh , I do n't know , I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 5]: You are very kind .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 8]: I suppose I ought to be grateful .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 6]: I suppose you are right .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 13]: Oh , I 'll go , I suppose , I must go .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 5]: _ Bother _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 25]: cried Sophie ungraciously , whereupon Claire hastily changed the conversation , and made no further reference to health during the rest of her visit .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 50]: Mrs Willoughby supplied the name of a specialist ; the specialist granted an appointment for the following Saturday at noon , when the two girls duly appeared in his consulting-room ; and Sophie underwent the usual examination , during which the great doctor 's face assumed a serious air .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 21]: Finally he returned to the round-backed chair which stood against the desk , and faced his patient across the room .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 38]: Sophie was looking flushed and pretty , she was wearing her best clothes , and she wore them with an air which might well delude a masculine eye into believing them much better than they really were .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 9]: Claire had her usual smart , well-turned-out appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 13]: They seemed to the doctor 's eyes two prosperous members of Society .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 28]: `` I fear , '' he said gravely , `` I fear that there is no doubt that your rheumatism is the sort most difficult to treat .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 32]: It is a clear case of rheumatoid arthritis , but you are young , and the disease is in an early stage , so that we must hope for the best .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 32]: In olden times it was supposed to be an incurable complaint , but of late years we have had occasional cures , quite remarkable cures , which have mitigated that decision .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 24]: You must realise , however , that it is a difficult fight , and that you will need much patience and perseverance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 12]: `` How soon do you think you can cure me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 14]: The doctor looked into Sophie 's face , and his eyes were pitiful .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 14]: `` I wish I could say , but I fear that 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 8]: Different people are affected by different cures .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 29]: You must go on experimenting until you find one that will suit your case ; meanwhile there are certain definite instructions which you would do well to observe .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 10]: In what part of London do you live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 8]: He pursed-up his lips at the reply .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 3]: `` Clay !
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 3]: Heavy clay .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 7]: The worst thing you could have .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 7]: That must be altered at once .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 24]: It is essential that you live on light , gravelly soil , and even then you should not be in England in winter .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 11]: You should go abroad for four or five months . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 9]: Sophie cast a lightning glance at her companion .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 6]: `` It 's impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 4]: she said shortly .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 6]: `` I ca n't move .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 6]: I ca n't go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: I am a High School - mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 9]: I am obliged to stay at my work .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 7]: I am dependent on my salary .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 8]: I knew it was stupid to come .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 7]: I knew what you would say .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 5]: I told my friend .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 5]: It was her doing .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 22]: She made me come -- '' `` I am very much indebted to your friend , '' the doctor said genially .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 29]: `` She was quite right to insist that you should have advice , and now that I know the circumstances , I 'll try not to be unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 36]: I know how aggravating it must be to be ordered to do things which are clearly impossible ; but you are young , and you are threatened with a disease which may cripple your life .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 14]: I want to do all that is in my power to help you .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 15]: Let 's talk it over quietly , and see what can be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 23]: `` I 'm in school every day until half-past four , except on Saturdays , and I ca n't afford to wait .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 22]: I _ must _ get better , and I must be quick about it , or I shall lose my post .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 24]: If I leave this school through rheumatism , it will go down in my testimonial , and I should never get another opening .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 5]: I 'm the Gym .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 3]: mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 5]: `` Poor girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 5]: said the doctor kindly .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 32]: `` Well , '' he added , `` I can say one thing for your encouragement ; you could not help yourself more than by preserving your present attitude of mind .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 21]: To determine to get better , and to get better quickly , is a very valuable aid to material means .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 11]: And now I will tell you what I propose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 12]: He bent forward in his chair , talking earnestly and rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 41]: There was no time to be lost , since the disease was apt to take sudden leaps forward ; at this stage every day was of value ; the enemy must be attacked before he had made good his hold .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 17]: There was a new treatment which , within his own experience , had had excellent results .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 41]: It was not a certainty ; it was very far from a certainty , but it was a chance , and it had this merit , that a month or six weeks would prove its efficacy in any special case .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 20]: If this failed , something else must be tried , but most cures were very long , very costly .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 20]: He would propose in the first instance giving two injections a week ; later on three or even four .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 9]: There might be a certain amount of reaction .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by reaction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 3]: Sophie asked .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 5]: `` Fever , headache .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 13]: Possibly sickness , but not lasting for more than twenty-four hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 5]: Sophie set her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 10]: `` I have no time to be ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 9]: The doctor looked at her with deliberate sternness .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 19]: `` You will have all your life to be ill , if you do not take care now !
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 20]: I will do what I can to help you ; we will arrange the times most convenient to you .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 15]: You might come to me at first direct from school on Wednesdays and Saturdays .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 17]: Later on the system will accustom itself , and you will probably feel no bad effects .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 9]: I should like to undertake your case myself .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 14]: My charge to you will be a quarter of my ordinary fee . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 22]: `` Thank you very much , '' stammered Sophie , `` but -- '' Claire jumped up , and hastily interposed .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 7]: `` Thank you so very much !
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 25]: We are most grateful , but it 's -- it 's been rather a shock , and we have not had time to think .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 13]: Will you allow us to write and tell you our decision ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 6]: But be quick about it .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 18]: I am anxious to help , but every week 's delay will make the case more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 8]: Try to arrange for Wednesday next . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 11]: As he spoke he led the way towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 30]: He had been all that was kind and considerate , but there were other patients waiting ; all day long a procession of sufferers were filing into that room .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 11]: He had no more time to give to Sophie Blake .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 19]: The two girls went out into the street , got into a taxi and were driven swiftly away .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 3]: Neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 22]: They drew up before the door of Sophie 's lodgings , entered the cosy sitting-room and sat down by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 14]: Sophie 's face was flushed , her eyes were dry and feverishly bright .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 10]: `` I hope you are satisfied , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 19]: I 've been to a specialist to please you , and a most depressing entertainment it has been .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 2]: Arthritis !
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 19]: That 's the thing people have who go about in Bath chairs , and have horrible twisted fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 25]: It was supposed to be incurable , but now they have ` an occasional cure , ' so I must hope for the best !
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 9]: I do think doctors are the stupidest things !
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 5]: They have no tact .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 24]: He could tell me that in one breath , and in the other that it was most important that I should have hope .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 6]: I _ have _ hope .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 16]: I _ have _ faith , but it 's not because of his stupid injections .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 22]: I believe in God , and God knows that I need my health , and that other people need it too .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 4]: My little sister !
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 10]: What would happen to her if I crocked now ?
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 14]: I do n't believe He will _ let _ me grow worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 18]: `` That 's all right , Sophie dear , but ought n't you to use the means ?
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 21]: I do n't call it trusting in the right sense if you set yourself against the help that comes along .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 29]: God does n't work miracles as He did in the old way ; the world has progressed since those old times , and now He works through men .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 18]: It is a miracle just the same , though it shows itself in a more natural fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 39]: Do n't you call it a miracle that a busy doctor should offer to treat you himself , at the hours most convenient to you , and to do it at a quarter of his usual fees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 9]: `` His fee for to-day was two guineas .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 12]: They always charge that , I suppose -- these specialist people .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 12]: A quarter of that would mean half-a - guinea a visit .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 6]: Two half-guineas equal one guinea .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 16]: Later on , three or four half-guineas a week would equal one-and-a-half to two guineas .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 7]: Two guineas equal my whole income .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 10]: Very kind , no doubt -- very kind indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 15]: And just about as feasible as if he 'd said a thousand pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 12]: Claire was busy calculating , her fingers playing upon her knee .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 18]: Ten guineas ought to pay for the six weeks which would test the efficacy of the vaccine .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 12]: Surely there could not be any serious difficulty about ten guineas ?
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 7]: `` Would n't your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 5]: Sophie shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 7]: `` I would n't ask him .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 14]: He has four small children , and he does so much for Emily .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 6]: More than he can afford .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 8]: He works too hard , poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 30]: If it were a certainty , perhaps it might be managed somehow ; but it 's only a chance , and six weeks wo n't see the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 13]: `` But the end will be quicker if you begin at once .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 10]: The doctor said that every day was of importance .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 4]: Sophie , listen !
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: I 've got the money .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 9]: I 've got it lying in the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 7]: I 'll lend it to you .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 7]: I 'd love to lend it .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 40]: If you 'll let me , I 'll send you a cheque to-night ; that will pay for the first six weeks -- '' Sophie stretched out her hand , and gave a momentary clasp to Claire 's fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 9]: `` You _ are _ a good soul !
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 9]: Fancy offering that to a stranger like me !
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 9]: It 's noble of you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 3]: Perfectly sweet !
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 15]: I 'm awfully grateful , but it 's absolutely impossible that I could accept .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 7]: When could I pay you back ?
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 34]: I 've never been able to save , but I _ have _ kept out of debt , and it would worry me to death to have ten pounds hanging round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 9]: Besides , we should n't be any further .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 37]: At the end of the six weeks I should either be better , in which case he would certainly want me to go on ; or worse , when I should have to try something else !
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 24]: You do n't propose that I should go on borrowing from you at the rate of one or two guineas a week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 15]: `` I -- I 'm afraid I have n't got it to give . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 10]: `` Very well , then -- there you are !
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 10]: What 's the good of beginning at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 23]: Claire put her hands over her face and thought with that intense and selfless thought which is as a prayer for help .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 16]: The future seemed dark indeed , and the feeling of helplessness was hard to bear .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 18]: Two lonely girls , with no one to help , and so much help that was needed !
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 8]: Here was indeed the time for prayer .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 14]: `` Sophie , it 's horribly difficult ; we ca n't see ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 10]: We can only ` do the next thing . '
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 20]: It is your duty to take this cure _ now _ , and the way has opened for that .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 17]: When we 've come to the end of the six weeks , it may open again .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 8]: You said you have trust in God .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 19]: It 's no use talking generalities , if you are not prepared to put your faith into practice .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 19]: The question for to-day is , _ Can you trust Him for the beginning of May _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 3]: Sophie smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 5]: `` I like that !
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 9]: That 's a nice way of putting it .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 22]: Yes , I can ; but , Claire -LRB- I must call you Claire , you are such a dear ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 13]: , I wish it did n't mean borrowing other people 's money !
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 11]: It will be years before I can pay you back .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 11]: It may be that I can never do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 19]: `` I would have said ` give , ' but I was afraid it would hurt your pride .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 37]: My stepfather gave me some money to buy jewellery for a wedding present , and as a pure matter of selfishness I 'd get more pleasure out of helping you than out of a stupid brooch .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 7]: And listen , Sophie , listen !
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 6]: I 'm going to explain .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 52]: -- I chose to take up teaching because I wanted to be independent , and I knew my mother would be happier without me during the first years of her marriage ; but she is devoted to me , and I know in time she will crave to have me back .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 24]: She is n't strong , and she finds the Indian climate trying , so very likely she may _ need _ my help .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 41]: I shall never be sorry that I came to London , for work is a splendid experience , and I am glad to have it ; but I have never the feeling that it is going to _ last _ .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 42]: Mother comes first , and my stepfather is quite well-off , and can afford to keep me ; so if I were _ needed _ , I should not feel that I was sacrificing my independence in letting him do it .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 25]: So you see I am not quite in the same position as the other mistresses , and money is not of the same importance .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 20]: If you were in my place , Sophie , would you hesitate to lend me a ten-pound note ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 6]: `` Guineas , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 9]: cried Sophie , laughing to hide her tears .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 10]: `` All right , my dear , all right !
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 4]: I give in .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 4]: I lie down .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 5]: You 've beaten me .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 7]: I 've nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 31]: I 'll take the horrid old injections , and pay for them with your money , and -- and -- I think I 'll go to bed now , please !
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 16]: I 've had about as much as I can bear for one short day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 12]: `` And I 'll go home and have a rest myself .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 22]: I am to help at a bazaar this afternoon , and I do n't feel at all in my full beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 4]: Good-bye , Sophie .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 3]: Cheer up !
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 8]: There 's a good time coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 13]: `` There 's a good time coming for _ you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 4]: predicted Sophie confidently .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 7]: `` LEND ME FIVE POUNDS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 74]: The contrasts of life seemed painfully strong to Claire Gifford that Saturday afternoon as she seated herself in the luxurious car by Mrs Willoughby 's side , and thought of Sophie Blake obliged to borrow ten pounds to pay for a chance of health , and the contrast deepened during the next few hours , as she watched beautifully gowned women squandering money on useless trifles which decked the various `` stalls . ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 58]: Embroidered cushions , painted sachets , veil cases , shaving cases , night-dress cases , bridge bags , fan bags , handkerchief bags , work bags ; bags of every size , of every shape , of every conceivable material ; bead necklaces , mats -- a wilderness of mats -- a very pyramid of drawn-thread work .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 23]: Claire found a seat near the principal stall , where she caught the remarks of the buyers as they turned away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 6]: ... I detest painted satin !
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 10]: Ca n't think why I bought that ridiculous sachet .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 13]: It will have to go on to the next bazaar . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 7]: ... That makes my twenty-third bag !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 10]: Rather a sweet , though , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 9]: It will go with my grey dress . ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 5]: `` This is awful !
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 8]: I 'm not getting on at all .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 10]: I ca n't decently spend less than five pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 11]: For goodness ' sake tell me what to buy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 9]: `` Ca n't think why people give bazaars !
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 7]: Such an upset in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 11]: For some charity , I believe -- I forget what .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 76]: She asked me to come ... '' So on and so on ; scores of women surging to and fro , swinging bags of gold and silver chain , buying baubles for which they had no use ; occasionally -- very occasionally , for love of the cause ; often -- very often because Lady -- had sent a personal invitation , and Lady -- was a useful friend , and gave such charming balls !
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 18]: At the two concerts Claire had a pleasant success , which she enjoyed with all her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 31]: Her whistling performance seemed to act as a general introduction , for every listener seemed to be anxious to talk to her , and to ask an infinitude of questions .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 4]: Was it difficult ?
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 8]: How long did it take to learn ?
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 4]: Was she nervous ?
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 8]: Was n't it difficult not to laugh ?
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 10]: How did she manage not to look a fright ?
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 6]: Did she do it often ?
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 6]: Did she _ mind _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 39]: This last question usually led up to a tentative mention of some entertainment in which the speaker was interested , but after the first refusal Claire was on guard , and regretted that her time was filled up .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 21]: She was eager to help Mrs Willoughby , but had no desire to be turned into an unpaid public performer !
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 46]: Janet did not appear at the bazaar , so the drive home was once more a _ tete-a-tete _ , during which Mrs Willoughby questioned Claire as to the coming holidays , and expressed pleasure to hear that they were to be spent in Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 22]: She was so kind and motherly in her manner that Claire was emboldened to bespeak her interest on Sophie 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 52]: `` I suppose , '' she said tentatively , `` you do n't know of any family going abroad to a dry climate -- it must be a very dry climate -- who would like to take a girl with them to -- er -- to be a sort of help !
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 24]: She 's a pretty girl , and very gay and amusing , and she 's had the highest possible training in health exercises .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 28]: She would be splendid if there was a delicate child who needed physical development , and , of course , she is quite well educated all round .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 9]: She could teach up to a certain point .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 5]: She is the Gym .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 14]: mistress in my school , and is very popular with the girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 10]: `` And why does she want to leave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 6]: `` She 's not well .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 10]: It 's rheumatism -- a bad kind of rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 31]: It is just beginning , and the doctor says it ought to be tackled at once , and that to live on clay soil is the worst thing for her .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 16]: If she stays at Saint Cuthbert 's she 's practically bound to live on clay .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 16]: And he says she ought to get out of England for the next few winters .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 25]: She has not a penny beyond her salary , but if she could find a post -- '' `` Well , why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 11]: Mrs Willoughby 's voice was full of a cheerful optimism .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 19]: `` I do n't know of anything at present , but I 'll make inquiries among my friends .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 8]: There ought not to be any difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 17]: So many people winter abroad ; and there is quite a craze for these physical exercises .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 14]: Oh , yes , my dear , I am sure I can help .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 3]: Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 3]: poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 9]: it 's so important to keep her health .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 18]: I must find some one who will be considerate , and not work her too hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 22]: She spoke as if the post were a settled thing ; as if there were several posts from which to choose .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 4]: Probably there were .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 28]: Among her large circle of wealthy friends this popular and influential woman , given a little trouble , could almost certainly find a chance for Sophie Blake .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 7]: _ Given a little trouble _ !
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 5]: That was the rub !
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 31]: Five out of six of the women who had thronged Lady -- 's rooms that afternoon would have dismissed Sophie 's case with an easy sympathy , `` Poor creature !
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 26]: Quite too sad , but really , you know , my dear , it 's a shocking mistake to recommend any one to a friend .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 10]: If anything goes wrong , you get blamed yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 7]: Is n't there a Home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 20]: Mrs Willoughby was the exception to the rule ; she helped in deed , as well as in word .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 14]: Claire looked at the large plain face with a very passion of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 11]: `` Oh , I wish all women were like you !
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 8]: I 'm so glad you are rich .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 11]: I hope you will go on growing richer and richer .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 29]: You are the right person to have money , because you help , you _ want _ to help , you remember other women who are poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 17]: `` My dear , '' said Mrs Willoughby softly , `` I have been poor myself .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 15]: My father lost his money , and for years we had a hard struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 28]: Then I married -- for love , my dear , not money , but there was money , too , -- more money than I could spend .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 17]: It was an intoxicating experience , and I found it difficult not to be carried away .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 49]: My dear husband had settled a large income on me , for my own use , so I determined , as a safeguard , to divide it in two , and use half for myself and half for gentlewomen like your friend , who need a helping hand .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 37]: I have done that now for twenty-five years , but I give out of my abundance , my dear ; it is easy for me to give money ; I deserve no credit for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 13]: `` You give time , too , and sympathy , and kindness .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 8]: It 's no use , Mrs Willoughby .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 23]: I 've put you on the topmost pinnacle in my mind , and nothing that you can say can pull you down .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 11]: I think you are the best woman in London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 11]: `` Dear , dear , you will turn my head !
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 34]: I 'm not accustomed to such wholesale flattery , '' cried Mrs Willoughby , laughing ; then the car stopped , and Claire made her adieux , and sprang lightly to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 35]: The chauffeur had stopped before the wrong house , but he did not discover his mistake as Claire purposely stood still until he had turned the car and started to retrace his way westward .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 22]: The evening was fine though chill , and the air was refreshing after the crowded heat of Lady -- 's rooms .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 25]: Claire had only the length of a block to walk , and she went slowly , drawing deep breaths to fill her tired lungs .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 17]: The afternoon had passed pleasantly enough , but it had left her feeling flat and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 11]: She questioned herself as to the cause of her depression .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 15]: Was she jealous of those other girls who lived lives of luxury and idleness ?
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 5]: Honestly she was not .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 40]: She was not in the position of a girl who had known nothing but poverty , and who therefore felt a girl 's natural longing for pretty rooms , pretty clothes , and a taste of gaiety and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 47]: Claire had known all these things , and could know them again ; neither was she in the position of a working girl who has no one to help in the day of adversity , for a comfortable home was open to her at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 17]: she was not jealous : she probed still deeper , and acknowledged that she was disappointed !
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 18]: Last time that she had whistled in public -- Claire shook her head with an impatient toss .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 4]: This was feeble .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 4]: This was ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 8]: A man whom she had met twice !
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 9]: A man whose mother had refused an introduction .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 19]: A man whom Janet -- `` I must get to work , and prepare my lesson for Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 12]: Nothing like good work to drive away these sentimental follies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 36]: But Fate was not kind , for right before her eyes were a couple of lovers strolling onward , the man 's hand through the girl 's arm , his head bent low over hers .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 35]: Claire winced at the sight , but the next moment her interest quickened in a somewhat painful fashion , as the man straightened himself suddenly , and swung apart with a gesture of offence .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 5]: The lovers were quarrelling !
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 17]: Now the width of the pavement was between them ; they strode onward , ostentatiously detached .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 11]: Claire smiled to herself at the childishness of the display .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 23]: One moment embracing in the open street , the next flaunting their differences so boldly that every passer-by must realise the position !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 12]: Surely a grown man or woman ought to have more self-control .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 25]: Then suddenly the light of a lamp shone on the pair , and she recognised the familiar figures of Mary Rhodes and Major Carew .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 7]: He wore a long light overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 24]: Cecil had evidently slipped out of the house to meet him , for she was attired in her sports coat and knitted cap .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 3]: Poor Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 13]: The interview seemed to be ending in anything but a pleasant fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 27]: Claire lingered behind until the couple had passed her own doorway , let herself in with her latch-key , and hastened to settle down to work .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 13]: When Cecil came in , she would not wish to be observed .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 43]: Claire carried her books to the bureau , so as to have her back to the fire , but before she had been five minutes writing , she heard the click of the lock , and Cecil herself came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 3]: `` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 7]: I saw the light go up .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 8]: I thought it must be you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 23]: She was silent for a couple of minutes , then spoke again in a sharp , summoning voice : `` Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 24]: Claire turned round , to behold Cecil standing at the end of the dining - table , her bare hands clasping its rim .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 22]: She was so white that her lips looked of a startling redness ; her eyes met Claire with a defiant hardness .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 14]: `` I want you to lend me five pounds _ now _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 20]: Claire 's anxiety was swallowed in a rising of irritation which brought an edge of coldness into her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 4]: `` Five pounds !
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 3]: What for ?
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 26]: Cecil , I have never spoken of it , I have never worried you , but I 've already paid -- '' `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 6]: I 'll pay you back .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 15]: But I must have this to-night , and I 've nowhere else to go .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 4]: It 's important .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 17]: I would lend it to you , Claire , if it were in my power . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 18]: `` Cecil , I hate to refuse , but really -- I _ need _ my money !
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 7]: Just now I need it particularly .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 9]: I ca n't afford to go on lending .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 13]: I 'm dreadfully sorry , but -- '' `` Claire , please !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 9]: I implore you , just this one time !
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 19]: I 'll pay you back ... There 's my insurance policy -- I can raise something on that .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 13]: For pity 's sake , Claire , help me this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 7]: Claire rose silently and went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 20]: It was not in her to refuse such a request while a five-pound note lay in her desk upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 17]: She slipped the crackling paper into an envelope , and carried it down to the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 14]: Cecil took it without a word , and went back into the night .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 39]: When she had gone , Claire gathered her papers together in a neat little heap , ranged them in a corner of the bureau , and seated herself on a stiff-backed chair at the end of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 22]: She looked as if she were mounted on a seat of justice , and the position suited her frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 6]: She felt angry and ill-used .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 11]: Cecil had no right to borrow money from a fellow-worker !
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 20]: The money in the bank was dwindling rapidly ; the ten guineas for Sophie would make another big hole .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 32]: She did not grudge that -- she was eager and ready to give it for so good a cause ; but _ what _ was Cecil doing with these repeated loans ?
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 34]: To judge from appearances , she was rather poorer than richer during the last few months , while bills for her new clothes came in again and again , and received no settlement .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 9]: An obstinate look settled on Claire 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 8]: She determined to have this thing out .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 45]: In ten minutes ' time Cecil was back again , still white , still defiant , meeting Claire 's glance with a shrug , seating herself at the opposite end of the table with an air of callous indifference to what should come next .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 12]: `` You look as if you had something to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 4]: `` I have .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 12]: Cecil , what are you doing with all this money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 10]: `` That 's my business , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 13]: `` I do n't see it , when the money is mine !
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 10]: I think I have the right to ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 12]: `` I 've told you I 'll pay you back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 7]: `` That 's not the question .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 12]: I want to know what you are doing _ now _ !
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 8]: You are not paying your bills . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 20]: `` I 'll sell out some shares to-morrow , and -- '' `` You shall do no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 29]: I can wait , and I will wait , but I ca n't go on lending ; and if I did , it could do you no good .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 6]: Where does the money go ?
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 9]: It does _ you _ no good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 10]: `` I am the best judge of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 14]: `` Cecil , _ are you lending money to that man _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 23]: The words leapt out , as on occasion such words will leap , without thought or premeditation on the speaker 's part .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 61]: She did not intend to speak them ; if she had given herself one moment for reflection she dared not have spoken them ; when their sound struck across the quiet room she was almost as much startled as Cecil herself ; yet heart and brain approved their utterance ; heart and brain pronounced that she had discovered the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: Cecil 's face was a deep glowing red .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 10]: `` Really , Claire , you go too far !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 20]: Why in the world should you think -- '' `` I saw you with him now in the street .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 16]: I could see that you were quarrelling ; you took no pains to hide it .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 14]: You left him to come in to me , and went back again .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 6]: It seems pretty obvious . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 6]: and if I did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 9]: Cecil had plainly decided that denial was useless .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 8]: `` I am responsible for the loan .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 11]: What does it matter to you who uses it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 20]: But at that Claire 's anger vanished , and she shrank back with a cry of pain and shame .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 10]: `` And he _ took _ it from you ?
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 2]: Money !
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 16]: Took it from a girl he professes to love -- who is working for herself !
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 10]: Oh , Cecil , how _ could _ he ?
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 6]: How could you allow him ?
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 12]: How can you go on caring for such a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 10]: `` Do n't get hysterical , Claire , please .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 12]: There 's nothing so extraordinary in a man being hard up .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 12]: It 's happened before now in the history of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 40]: Frank has a position to keep up , and his father -- I 've told you before how mean and difficult his father is , and it 's so important that Frank should keep on good terms just now .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 9]: -- He dare not worry him for money .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 29]: When he is going to make me a rich woman some day , why should I refuse to lend him a few trifling pounds when he runs short ?
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 25]: He 's in an expensive regiment ; he belongs to an expensive Club ; he is obliged to keep up with the other men .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 14]: If I had twice as much I would lend it with pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 27]: Claire opened her lips to say that at least no more borrowed money should be supplied for Major Carew , but the words were never spoken .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 26]: Pity engulfed her , a passion of pity for the poor woman who a second time had fallen under the spell of an unscrupulous man .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 31]: Cecil 's explanation had fallen on deaf ears , for Claire could accept no excuses for a man who borrowed from a woman to ensure comfort and luxury for himself .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 8]: An officer in the King 's army !
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 23]: The thing seemed incredible ; so incredible that , for the first time , a rising of suspicion mingled with her dislike .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 23]: Mentally , she rehearsed the facts of Major Carew 's history as narrated by himself , and found herself doubting every one .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 12]: The beautiful house in the country -- did it really exist ?
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 28]: The eccentric old father who refused to part with his gold -- was he flesh and blood , or a fictitious figure invented as a convenient excuse ?
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 17]: The fortune which was to enrich the future -- _ was _ there such a fortune ?
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 15]: Or , if there were , was Major Carew in truth the eldest son ?
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 60]: Claire felt a devastating helplessness her life abroad had left her ignorant of many British institutions ; she knew nothing of the books in which she might have traced the Carew history ; she had nothing to guide her but her own feminine instinct , but if that instinct were right , what was to become of Mary Rhodes ?
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 16]: Her face looked so sad , so downcast , that Cecil 's conscience was pricked .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 6]: `` Poor old Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 15]: she said gently , `` how I do worry you , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 16]: Never mind , my dear , I 'll make it up to you one day .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 15]: You 've been a brick to me , and I sha n't forget it .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 26]: And I 'll go to my mother 's for the whole of the Easter holidays , and save up my pennies to pay you back .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 24]: The poor old soul felt defrauded because I stayed only a week at Christmas , so she 'll be thankful to have me .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 18]: You can go to Brussels with an easy mind , knowing that I 'm out of temptation .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 10]: That will be killing two birds with one stone .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 16]: What do you say to having cocoa now , instead of waiting till nine o'clock ?
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 11]: We 've tired ourselves out with all this fuss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 6]: THE MEETING IN HYDE PARK .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 7]: It was the end of May .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 34]: The weather was warm and sunny , the windows of the West End were gay with flowers ; in the Park the great beds of rhododendrons blazed forth in a glow of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 15]: It was the season , and a particularly gay and festive season at that .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 15]: `` Everybody '' was in town , including a few million `` nobodies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 88]: There were clerks toiling by their thousands in the City , chained all day long to their desks ; there were clerks ' wives at home in the suburbs , toiling all day too , and sometimes far into the night ; there were typists , and shop assistants , and prosperous heads of households , who worked steadily for five and a half days a week , in order that their families might enjoy comfort and ease , condensing their own relaxation into short Saturday afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 43]: And there were school-mistresses , too , who saw the sun through form-room windows , but felt its call all the same -- the call of the whole glad spring -- and grew restless , and nervous , and short in temper .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 99]: It was not the leaders of society whom they envied ; they read of Court balls , and garden parties , of preparations for Ascot and Henley with a serene detachment , just as they read with indifference in the fashion page of a daily newspaper that `` Square watches are the vogue this season , and our _ elegantes _ are ordering several specimens of this dainty bauble to match the prevailing colours of their costumes , '' the while they suffered real pangs at the sight of an `` alarming sacrifice '' at twenty-nine and six .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 20]: The one was almost within their grasp ; the other floated in the nebulous atmosphere of a different sphere .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 12]: In the staff-room at lunch-time the staff grew restless and critical .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 20]: The hot joints no longer appealed to their appetites , the watery vegetables and heavy puddings became things abhorred .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 22]: They thought of cool salads and _ compotes _ on ice , and hated the sight of the greasy brown gravy .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 23]: They blamed the cook , they blamed the Committee , they said repeatedly , `` Nobody thinks of _ us _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 14]: and exchanged anecdotes illustrative of the dulness , the stupidity of their pupils .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 5]: As for the Matric .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 9]: candidates , they would _ all _ fail !
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 10]: There was n't a chance for a single one .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 11]: The stupidest set of girls the school had ever possessed !
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 8]: Oh , certainly they would all fail !
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 19]: `` And then , '' said Mary Rhodes bitterly , '' _ we _ shall be blamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 33]: The Arts mistress said with a sigh -- `` Oh , would n't it be heavenly to run away from it all , and have a week - end in the country !
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 13]: The gorse will be out , and the hawthorn still in blossom .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 15]: What 's the very cheapest one could do it on for two days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 18]: Mademoiselle said -- `` Absolutely , _ ma chere _ , there is no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 9]: It is necessary that I have a distraction .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 8]: I must buy a new hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 10]: Sophie Blake said defiantly to herself -- `` Crippled ?
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 2]: Ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 8]: I _ refuse _ to be crippled .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 24]: I want to run , and run , and run , and run , and dance , and sing , and jump about !
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 4]: I feel pent !
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 4]: I feel caged !
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 39]: And all that precious money squandered on injections ... '' The six weeks ' course of treatment had been , from the doctor 's point of view , a complete success ; from Sophie 's a big disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 66]: She argued that she was still stiff , still in pain , that the improvement was but small ; he pointed out that without the injections she would of a certainty have been worse , and since in arthritis even to remain stationary was a success , to have improved in the smallest degree in six weeks ' time might be regarded as a triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 20]: He prescribed a restful holiday during the Easter vacation , and a second course of treatment on her return .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 38]: Sophie resigned herself to do without new clothes for the summer , and sold her most treasured possession , a diamond ring which had belonged to her mother , so that the second ten pounds was secure .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 11]: But how was she to pay back the original loan ?
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 47]: Meanwhile Mrs Willoughby was inquiring among her friends for a suitable post , and had played the good fairy by arranging to send Sophie for the Easter holidays to a country cottage on the Surrey heights , which she ran as a health resort for gentlewomen .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 34]: Here on a fine dry soil , the air scented with the fragrant breath of the pines , with nothing to do , and plenty of appetising food to eat , the Gym .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 21]: mistress 's general health improved so rapidly that she came back to school with her thin cheeks quite filled out .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 9]: `` Very satisfactory , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 14]: `` Now I shall be able to get on to stronger doses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 16]: `` What 's the good of getting better , only to be made worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 5]: cried Sophie in rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 6]: Cecil 's loan remained unpaid .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 22]: She had spent her holidays with her mother as arranged , but her finances did not appear to have profited thereby .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 20]: Dunning for bills became so incessant that the landlady spoke severely of the `` credit of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 39]: She went out constantly in the evening , and several times Claire heard Major Carew 's voice at the door , but he never came into the house , and there was no talk of an open engagement .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 28]: As for Claire herself , she had had a happy time in Brussels , staying with both English and Belgian friends and re-visiting all the old haunts .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 20]: She thoroughly enjoyed the change , but could not honestly say that she wished the old life to return .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 38]: If she came back with a heavy heart , it was neither poverty nor work which she feared , but rather the want of that atmosphere of love and kindliness which make the very essence of home .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 40]: At the best of times Mary Rhodes was a difficult companion and far from affectionate in manner , but since the giving of that last loan , there had arisen a mental barrier which it seemed impossible to surmount .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 27]: It had become difficult to keep up a conversation apart from school topics , and both girls found themselves dreading the evening 's _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 11]: Claire felt like a caged bird beating against the bars .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 37]: She wanted an outlet from the school life , and the call of the spring was insistent to one who until now had spent the summer in wandering about some of the loveliest scenes in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 77]: She wearied of the everlasting streets , and discovered that by hurrying home after afternoon school , making a quick change of clothing , and catching a motor - ` bus at the corner of the road , she could reach Hyde Park by half-past five , and spend a happy hour sitting on one of the green chairs , enjoying the beauty of the flowers , and watching the never-ending stream of pedestrians and vehicles .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 29]: Sometimes she recognised Mrs Willoughby and Janet bowling past in their luxurious motor , but they never saw her , and she was not anxious that they should .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 10]: What she wanted was to sit still and rest .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 41]: Sometimes a smartly-dressed woman , obviously American , would seat herself on the next chair , and inquire as to the best chance of seeing the Queen , and the question being amiably answered , would proceed to unasked confidences .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 7]: She thought England `` sweet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 9]: She had just come over to this side .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 7]: She was staying till the fall .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 10]: Who was the lady in the elegant blue auto ?
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 8]: The London fashions were just too cute !
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 18]: When they parted , the fair American invariably said , `` Pleased to have met you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 20]: and looked as though she meant it into the bargain , and Claire whole - heartedly echoed the sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 17]: She liked these women with their keen , child-like enthusiasm , their friendly , gracious ways .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 12]: In contrast to them the ordinary Englishwoman seemed cold and aloof .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 53]: One brilliant afternoon when the Park was unusually bright and gay , Claire was seated near the Achilles statue , carelessly scanning the passers-by , when , with a sudden leap of the heart , she saw Erskine Fanshawe some twenty yards ahead , strolling towards her , accompanied by two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 29]: He was talking to his companions with every appearance of enjoyment , and had no attention to spare for the rows of spectators on the massed green chairs .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 16]: Claire felt the blood rush to her face in the shock of surprise and agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 55]: She had never contemplated the possibility of such a meeting , for Captain Fanshawe had not appeared the type of man who would care to take part in a fashionable parade , and the sudden appearance of the familiar face among the crowd made her heart leap with a force that was physically painful .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 44]: Then , the excitement over , she realised with a second pang , almost as painful as the first , that in another minute he would have passed by , unseeing , unknowing , to disappear into space for probably months to come .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 9]: At the thought rebellion arose in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 38]: She felt a wild impulse to leave her seat and advance towards him ; she longed with a sudden desperation of longing to meet his eyes , to see his smile , but pride held her back .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 8]: She sat motionless watching with strained eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 27]: One of Captain Fanshawe 's companions was old , the other young -- a pretty , fashionably-dressed girl , who appeared abundantly content with her escort .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 36]: All three were watching with amusement the movements of a stout elderly dame , who sauntered immediately ahead , leading by a leash a French poodle , fantastically shaved , and decorated with ribbon bows .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 25]: The stout dame was evidently extravagantly devoted to her pet , and viewed with alarm the approach of a jaunty black and white terrier .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 33]: The terrier cocked his ears , and elevating his stump of a tail , yapped at the be-ribboned spaniel with all a terrier 's contempt , as he advanced to the attack .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 21]: The stout dame screamed , dropped the leash , and hit at the terrier with the handle of her parasol .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 30]: The poodle evidently considering flight the best policy , doubled and fled in the direction of the green chairs , to come violently to anchor against Claire 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 10]: The crowd stared , the stout dame hurried forward .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 40]: Claire , placing a soothing hand on the dog 's head , lifted a flushed , smiling face , and in so doing caught the lift of a hat , met for the moment the glance of startled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 9]: The stout lady was not at all grateful .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 22]: She spoke as sharply as though Claire , and Claire alone , had been the cause of her pet 's upset .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 18]: She strode majestically away , leaving Claire trembling , confused , living over again those short moments .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 10]: She had seen him ; he had seen her !
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 23]: He was alive and well , living within a few miles of herself , yet as far apart as in another continent .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 10]: It was six months since they had last met .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 10]: It might be six years before they met again .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 9]: But he had seemed pleased to see her .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 15]: Short as had been that passing glance , there was no mistaking its interest .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 10]: He was surprised , but pleasure had overridden surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 15]: If he had been alone , he would have hurried forward with outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 15]: In imagination she could see him coming , his grave face lightened with joy .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 13]: Oh , if _ only , only _ he had been alone !
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 28]: But he was with friends ; he had the air of being content and interested , and the girl was pretty , far prettier than Janet Willoughby .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 5]: `` Good afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 15]: She turned gasping ; he was standing before her , holding out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 12]: He had left his companions and come back to join her .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 15]: His face looked flushed , as though he had rushed back at express speed .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 21]: He had seemed interested and content , and the girl was pretty , yet he had come back to her !
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 18]: He seated himself on the chair by her side , and looked at her with eager eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 11]: `` I have n't seen you for six months ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 25]: `` I was just -- '' Claire began impulsively , drew herself up , and finished demurely -- `` I suppose it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 17]: `` You have n't been at either of Mrs Willoughby 's ` At Homes . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 16]: `` No ; but I 've seen a good deal of them all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 7]: They have been so kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 12]: `` Do n't you care for the ` At Homes ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 20]: I asked Mrs Willoughby about you , and she seemed to imply that you preferred not to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 5]: That was quite wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 8]: I _ did _ enjoy that evening .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 28]: It was a -- a misunderstanding , I think , '' said Claire , much exercised to find an explanation of what could really not be explained .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 27]: Of the third `` At Home '' she had heard nothing until this moment , and a pang of retrospective disappointment mingled with her present content .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 19]: `` I have been to the house several times when they were alone , '' she continued eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 10]: `` They even asked me on Christmas Day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 9]: `` I know , '' he said shortly .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 26]: `` I was in Saint Moritz , skating in the sunshine , when I heard how you were spending _ your _ Christmas holidays . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 8]: His face looked suddenly grim and set .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 12]: `` A man feels pretty helpless at a time like that .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 14]: I did n't exactly enjoy myself for the rest of that afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 21]: `` That was stupid of you , but -- but very nice all the same , '' Claire said softly .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 31]: `` It would n't have made things easier for me if other people had been dull , and , after all , I came off better than I expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 12]: `` You were all alone -- in your Grand Hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 7]: `` Only for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 6]: Claire resolutely ignored the hit .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 32]: `` Then my friend came back , and we made some little excursions together , and enjoyed being lazy , and getting up late , and reading lots of nice books .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 29]: I had made all sorts of good resolutions about the work I was going to get through in the holidays , but I never did one thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 10]: `` Do you often come to the Park ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 7]: Claire felt a pang of regret .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 14]: Was it possible that even this simple pleasure was to be denied her ?
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 31]: She knew too well that if she said `` yes , '' Captain Fanshawe would look out for her again , would come with the express intention of meeting her .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 14]: To say `` yes '' would be virtually to consent to such meetings .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 18]: It was a temptation which took all her strength to reject , but rejected it must be .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 11]: She would not stoop to the making of a rendez-vous .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 18]: `` I have been several times , but I sha n't be able to come any more .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 10]: We get busier towards the end of the term .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 41]: Examinations -- '' Captain Fanshawe straightened himself , and said in a very stiff voice -- `` I also , unfortunately , am extremely busy , so I shall not be able to see the rhododendrons in their full beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 10]: I had hoped you might be more fortunate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 46]: Claire stared at a passing motor , of which she saw nothing but a moving mass ; when she turned back it was to find her companion 's eyes fixed on her face , with an expression half guilty , half appealing , altogether ingratiating .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 20]: At the sight her lips twitched , and suddenly they were laughing together with a delicious consciousness of understanding .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 8]: he cried , `` it 's true !
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 4]: I mean it !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 36]: There 's no need to stay away because of me ; but as I _ am _ here to-day , and it 's my last chance , wo n't you let me give you tea ?
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 38]: If we walk along to Victoria Gate -- '' Claire thought with a spasm of longing of the little tables under the awning ; of the pretty animated scene ; but no , it might not be .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 20]: Her acquaintance with this man was too casual to allow her to accept his hospitality in a public place .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 11]: `` Thank you very much , but I think not .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 7]: I would rather stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 28]: `` Well , at any rate , '' he said defiantly , `` I 've paid for my chair , and you ca n't turn me out .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 9]: Of course , you can move yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 9]: `` But I do n't want to move .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 5]: I like being here .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 8]: I 'm very glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 11]: I should like very much to have tea , too .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 13]: Oh , if you do n't understand I ca n't explain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 19]: cried poor Claire helplessly ; and instantly the man 's expression altered to one of sympathy and contrition .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: `` I do understand !
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 7]: Do n't mind what I say .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 18]: Naturally it 's annoying , but you 're right , I suppose -- you 're perfectly right .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 21]: I am glad , at any rate , that you allow me to talk to you for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 7]: You are looking very well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 24]: His eyes took her in in one rapid comprehensive sweep , and Claire thanked Providence that she had put on her prettiest dress .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 10]: `` I am glad that you are keeping fit .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 9]: Did you enjoy your holiday in Belgium ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 11]: `` How did you know I was in Belgium ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 9]: He laughed easily , but ignored the question .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 13]: `` You have good news of your mother , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 4]: `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 30]: She loves the life , and is very happy and interested , and my stepfather writes that his friends refuse to believe in the existence of a grown-up daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 10]: He is so proud of her youthful looks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 13]: `` How much did you tell her about your Christmas holidays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 6]: `` All the nice bits !
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 10]: I do n't approve of burdening other people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 4]: `` Evidently not .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 6]: Then there have been burdens ?
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 5]: You 've implied that !
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 31]: Nothing by any chance , in which a man -- fairly intelligent , and , in this instance , keen after work -- could possibly be of some use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 19]: The two pairs of eyes met , gazed , held one another steadily for a long eloquent moment .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Claire .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 13]: Captain Fanshawe bent forward quickly , holding his stick between his knees .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 12]: The side of his neck had flushed a dull red colour .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 8]: For several moments he did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 13]: Claire had a curious feeling that he could not trust his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 6]: he said shortly at last .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 7]: `` Now may I hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 24]: `` I should like very much to ask you some questions about -- about a man whom I think you may know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 13]: The grey eyes came back to her face , keen and surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 5]: Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 5]: `` A Major Carew .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 6]: His Christian name is Frank .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 7]: He belongs to your Club . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 6]: `` I know the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 10]: What do you want to know about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 13]: `` Everything , I think ; everything you can tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 8]: `` You know him personally , then ?
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 7]: You 've met him somewhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' Claire answered to the last question , `` and I 'm anxious -- I 'm interested to know more .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 12]: Do you know his people , or anything about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 8]: `` I do n't know them personally .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 6]: I know Carew very slightly .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 6]: Good family , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 7]: Fine old place in Surrey . ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 9]: The Elizabethan manor house was true , then !
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 9]: Claire felt relieved , but not yet satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 12]: Her suspicion was so deep-rooted that it was not easily dispelled .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 12]: She sat silent for a moment , considering her next question .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 8]: `` Is he the eldest son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 6]: `` I believe he is .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 7]: I 've always understood so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 13]: The eldest son of a good family possessing a fine old place !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 47]: Claire summoned before her the picture of the coarse florid-faced man who had tried to flirt with her in the presence of the woman to whom he was engaged ; a man who stooped to borrow money from a girl who worked for her own living .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 12]: _ What _ excuse could there be for such a man ?
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 30]: She drew her brows together in puzzled fashion , and said slowly -- `` Then surely , if he is the heir , he ought to be rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 7]: `` It does n't necessarily follow .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 10]: I should say Carew was not at all flush .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 10]: Landed property is an expensive luxury in these days .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 16]: I 've heard , too , that the father is a bit of a miser .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 12]: He may not be generous in the matter of allowance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 48]: Claire sat staring ahead , buried in thought , and Captain Fanshawe stared at her in his turn , and wondered once more why this particular girl was different from every other girl , and why in her presence he felt a fullness of happiness and content .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 22]: She was very pretty ; but pretty girls were no novelty in his life ; he knew them by the score .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 34]: It was not her beauty which attracted him , but a mysterious affinity which made her seem nearer to him than he had hitherto believed it possible for any human creature to be .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 36]: He had recognised this mysterious quality at their first meeting ; he had felt it more strongly at Mrs Willoughby 's `` At Home '' ; six months ' absence had not diminished his interest .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 30]: Just now , when he had caught sight of her flushed upturned face , his heart had leapt with a violence which startled him out of his ordinary calm .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 6]: Something had happened to him .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 15]: When he had time he must think the thing out and discover its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 13]: But how did she come to be so uncommonly interested in Carew ?
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 25]: He met Claire 's eyes , and she asked falteringly -- `` I wish you would tell me what you think of him personally !
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 9]: Do you think he is -- nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 10]: `` Tell me first what you think yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 3]: `` Honestly ?
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 6]: You wo n't mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 7]: `` Not one single little bit !
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 10]: I told you he is a mere acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 36]: `` Then , '' said Claire deliberately , `` I think he is the most horrible , detestable , insufferable , altogether despicable creature I have ever met in the whole of my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 12]: I say , you _ are _ down on him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 18]: Captain Fanshawe stared , beamed with an obvious relief , then hastened to defend an absent man .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 13]: `` You 're wrong , you know ; really you 're wrong !
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 33]: I do n't call Carew the most attractive fellow you can meet ; rather rough manners , do n't you know , but he 's all right -- Carew 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 10]: You must n't judge by appearances , Miss Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 14]: Some of the most decent fellows in the Club are in his set .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 14]: Upon my word , I think he is quite a good sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 15]: Captain Fanshawe waxed the more eloquent as Claire preserved her expression of incredulous dislike .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 34]: He looked at her curiously , and said , `` I suppose I must n't ask -- I suppose you could n't tell me exactly why you are so interested in Carew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 6]: `` I 'm afraid not .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 14]: No ; I 'm afraid I ca n't , '' Claire said regretfully .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 28]: Then suddenly there flashed through her mind a remembrance of the many tangles and misunderstandings which take place in books for want of a little sensible out-speaking .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 31]: She looked into Captain Fanshawe 's face with her pretty dark-lashed eyes and said honestly , `` I wanted to know about him for the sake of -- another person ?
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 8]: _ Nothing _ to do with myself !
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 7]: I have only met him twice .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 10]: I hope I shall never meet him again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 27]: `` Thank you , '' said the man simply , and at the time neither of the two realised the full significance of those quiet words .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 18]: It was only on living over the interview on her return home that Claire remembered and understood !
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 22]: For the next quarter of an hour they abandoned the personal note , and discussed the various topics of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 47]: They did not always agree , and neither was of the type to be easily swayed from a preconceived opinion , but always they were interested , always they felt a sympathy for the other view , never once was there a fraction of a pause .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 14]: They had so much to say that they could have talked for hours .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 42]: Gradually the Park began to empty , the string of motors grew less , the crowd on the footpath no longer lounged , but walked quickly with a definite purpose ; the green chairs stood in rows without a single occupant .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 19]: Claire looked round , realised her isolation , drew an involuntary sigh , and rose in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 6]: `` It 's getting late .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 6]: I must be hurrying home .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 14]: I go to the Marble Arch and take a motor - ` bus .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 13]: Please do n't let me take you out of your way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 44]: He looked at her straightly but did not reply , and they paced together down the broad roadway , past the sunken beds of rhododendrons with the fountain playing in the centre , towards the archway which seemed to both so unnecessarily near !
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 30]: Claire thought of the six months which lay behind , saw before her a vision of months ahead unenlightened by another meeting , and felt suddenly tired and chill .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 10]: Captain Fanshawe frowned and bit at his lower lip .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 7]: `` I am going away to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 6]: We shall be in camp .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 35]: In August I am taking part of my leave to run up to Scotland , but I can always come to town if I 'm needed , or if there 's a special inducement .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 14]: I came up for both the Willoughbys ' ` At Homes . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 5]: `` Did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 8]: Claire said feebly , and fell a-thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 9]: The inference was too plain to be misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 16]: The `` special inducement '' in this instance had been the hope of meeting herself .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 23]: Actually it would appear that he had travelled some distance to ensure this chance , but the chance had been deliberately denied .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 20]: Kind Mrs Willoughby would have welcomed her with open arms ; it was Janet who had laid the ban .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 7]: Janet was friendly , almost affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 23]: As spring progressed she had repeatedly called at Saint Cuthbert 's after afternoon school and carried Claire off for refreshing country drives .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 23]: Quite evidently she enjoyed Claire 's society , quite evidently also she preferred to enjoy it when other visitors were not present .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 36]: Claire was not offended , for she knew that there was no taint of snobbishness in this decision ; she was just sorry , and , in a curious fashion , remorseful into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 25]: She did not argue out the point , but instinctively she felt that Janet , not herself , was the one to be pitied !
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 23]: They reached the end of the footpath : in another minute they would be in the noise and bustle of Oxford Street .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 19]: Erskine Fanshawe came to an abrupt halt , faced Claire and cried impulsively -- `` Miss Gifford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 4]: Claire shrank instinctively .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 19]: She knew that she was about to be asked a question which it would be difficult to answer .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 15]: Erskine planted his stick on the ground , and stared straight into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 17]: `` Why are you so determined to give me no chance of meeting you again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 10]: `` I -- I 'm _ not _ determined !
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 8]: I hope we _ shall _ meet .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 10]: Perhaps next winter -- at Mrs Willoughby 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 4]: He laughed grimly .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 21]: `` But if I were not content to wait for ` perhaps next winter -- at Mrs Willoughby 's . '
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 5]: ... What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: Claire looked at him gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 6]: `` What would you suggest ?
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 31]: I have no home in London , and no relations , and your mother , Captain Fanshawe , would not introduce me to you when she had the chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 7]: He made a gesture of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 17]: `` Oh , my mother is the most charming of women -- and the most indiscreet .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 10]: She acts always on the impulse of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 22]: She introduced you to Mrs Willoughby , or asked Mrs Willoughby to introduce herself , which comes to the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 32]: Surely that proves that she -- she -- '' He broke off , finding a difficulty in expressing what he wanted to say ; but Claire understood , and emphatically disagreed .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 24]: To enlist a friend 's sympathy was a very different thing from running the risk of entangling the affections of an only son !
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 38]: Obviously , however , she could not advance this argument , so they stood , the man and the girl , looking at one another , helpless , irresolute , while the clock opposite ticked remorselessly on .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 25]: Then , with an abruptness which lent added weight to his words , Erskine said boldly -- `` I want to meet you again !
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 10]: I am not content to wait upon chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 16]: Claire did not blush ; on the contrary , the colour faded from her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 17]: Most certainly she also was not content , but she did not waver in her resolution .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 11]: `` I 'm afraid there 's nothing else for it .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 21]: It 's one of the hardships of a working girl 's life that she ca n't entertain or make plans .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 19]: It seems more impossible to me , perhaps , from having lived abroad where conventions are so strict .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 7]: English girls have had more freedom .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 9]: I do n't see what I can do .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 5]: I 'm sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 9]: -- she held out her hand in farewell .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 14]: `` I hope some day I _ shall _ see you again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 10]: Quite suddenly Captain Fanshawe 's mood seemed to change .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 15]: The set look left his face ; he smiled -- a bright confident smile .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 9]: `` There 's not much fear about that !
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 11]: I shall take very good care that we do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 4]: GOD 'S OPPORTUNITY .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 19]: After the meeting with Captain Fanshawe in the Park , Claire 's relationship with Mary Rhodes sensibly improved .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 40]: In the first place , her own happiness made her softer and more lenient in her judgment , for she _ was _ deeply , intensely happy , with a happiness which all her reasonings were powerless to destroy .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 8]: `` My dear , what nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 9]: she preached to herself in elderly remonstrating fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 23]: `` You met the man , and he was pleased to see you -- he seemed quite anxious to meet you again .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 3]: Perfectly natural !
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 12]: Pray do n't imagine any special meaning in _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 23]: You looked quite an attractive little girl in your pretty blue dress , and men like to talk to attractive little girls .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 14]: I dare say he says just the same to dozens of girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 11]: So spake the inner voice , but spoke in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 9]: The best things of life are beyond reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 65]: As in religion reason leads us , as it were , to the very edge of the rock of proven fact , then faith takes wing , and soars above the things of earth into the great silence where the soul communes with God , so in love there comes to the heart a sweetness , a certainty , which no reasoning can shake .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 34]: As Erskine 's eyes had looked into hers in those moments of farewell , Claire had realised that between this man and herself there existed a bond which was stronger than spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 43]: So far as she could foresee , they were hopelessly divided by the circumstances of life , but in the first dawn of love no lover troubles himself about what the future may bring ; the sweetness of the present is all-sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 17]: Claire was happy , and longed for every one else to be as happy as herself .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 18]: Moreover , her suspicions concerning Major Carew had been lulled to rest by Erskine 's favourable pronouncement .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 38]: Personally she did not like him , but this was , after all , a matter of taste ; she could not approve his actions , but conceivably there might be explanations of which she was unaware .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 18]: Her manner to Cecil regained its old spontaneous friendliness , and Cecil responded with almost pathetic readiness .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 32]: In her ungracious way she had grown fond of her pretty , kindly companion , and had missed the atmosphere of home which her presence had given to the saffron parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 29]: As they sat over their simple supper , she would study Claire 's face with a questioning glance , and one night the question found vent in words .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 11]: `` You look mightily pleased with yourself , young woman !
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 17]: Your eyes are sparkling as if you were having a firework exhibition on your own account .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 16]: I never saw a school-mistress look so perky at the end of the summer term !
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 11]: Look as if you 'd come into a fortune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 6]: `` Wish I had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 14]: sighed Claire , thankful to switch the conversation on to a safe topic .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 11]: `` It would come in most usefully at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 13]: What are you going to do for the summer hols , Cecil ?
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 15]: Is there any possibility of -- '' `` No , '' Cecil said shortly .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 17]: `` And the regiment is going into camp , so he will be out of town .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 18]: I 'm not bothering my head about holidays -- quite enough to do with this wretched Matric .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 40]: The Head is keen to make a good show this year , for the Dulwich School beat us last year , and , as usual , all the responsibility and all the blame is put on the poor mistresses .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 48]: You ca n't make girls work if they do n't want , you ca n't cram their brains when they 've no brains to cram ; but those wretched examiners send a record of all the marks , so you can see exactly where they fall short .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 11]: Woe betide the mistress who is responsible for that branch !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 24]: I would n't mind prophesying that if the German does n't come out better than last year , Fraulein will be packed off .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 9]: I would n't be too sure of myself .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 22]: I 've done all right so far , but the Head is not as devoted to me as she might be .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 18]: I do n't think she 'd be sorry to have an excuse for getting rid of me .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 36]: That 's one of the delightful aspects of our position -- we are absolutely at the mercy of a woman who , from sheer force of circumstances , becomes more of an autocrat every year .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 24]: The Committee listen to her , and accept every word she says ; the staff know better than to dispute a single order .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 15]: We 'd stand on our head in rows if she made it a rule !
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 20]: The pupils scuttle like rabbits when they see her coming , and cheer themselves hoarse every time she speaks .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 17]: No human woman can live in that atmosphere for years and keep a cool head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 14]: `` She 's rather a dear , though , all the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 4]: Claire said loyally .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 34]: She had been hurt by the lack of personal interest which Miss Farnborough showed in the different members of her staff , but she was unwilling to brand her as a heartless tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 15]: `` Anyway , '' she added hastily , `` you are not satisfied here .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 18]: If you were going on teaching I should have thought you 'd be glad of a change .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 10]: It would be easy to get another school . ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 11]: Mary Rhodes looked at her ; a long eloquent glance .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 8]: `` With a good testimonial -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 7]: Without a good testimonial -- no !
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 35]: A testimonial for twelve years ' work depends on one woman , remember -- on her prejudice or good nature , on the mood in which she happens to be on one particular day .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 17]: It might read quite differently because she happened to have a chill on her liver . ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 4]: `` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 9]: there _ is _ a sense of justice !
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 9]: There is such a thing as honesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 7]: `` My dear , I agree .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 24]: Even so , would you dare to say that the wording of a testimonial would be unaffected by the writer 's mood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 16]: `` Surely twelve years in one school -- '' `` No , it would n't !
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 3]: Not necessarily .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 15]: ` Miss Rhodes has been English Mistress at Saint Cuthbert 's for twelve years .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 8]: Of late has been erratic in temper .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 3]: Health uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 6]: Examination records less satisfactory . '
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 15]: If you represented another school , would _ you _ engage Miss Rhodes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 4]: Claire was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 13]: For the first time she realised the danger of this single-handed power .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 9]: It meant -- what might it not mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 29]: It might mean that the mistress who was unfortunate enough to incur the dislike of her chief , might _ never _ be able to procure another post !
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 41]: She might be efficient , she might be hard-working ; given congenial surroundings she might develop into a treasure untold , yet just because of a depreciating phrase in the wording of a testimonial , no chance would be vouchsafed .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 58]: No doubt the vast majority of head mistresses were women of judgment , possessing a keen sense of justice and responsibility , yet the fact remained that a hasty impulse , a little access of temper in penning those all-important lines , might mean the end of a career , might mean poverty , might mean ruin !
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 31]: Claire shivered , looked across the table at the thin , fretted face and made a hesitating appeal -- `` Cecil dear , I know you are a good teacher .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 18]: I just love to hear you talking over your lessons , but you _ are _ irritable !
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 10]: One of my girls was crying the other day .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 25]: You had given so much homework , and she did n't understand what was to be done , and said she dare n't ask .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 8]: You had been ` so cross ! '
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 41]: I made a guess at what you wanted , and by good chance I was right ; but if I 'd been wrong , the poor thing would have been in disgrace , and honestly it was n't her fault !
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 6]: She was willing enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 8]: `` Oh , that imbecile Gladys Brown !
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 6]: I know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 8]: I 'd explained it a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 13]: If she 'd the brains of a cow she 'd have understood .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 6]: No wonder I was cross .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 23]: I should have been a saint if I was n't , and no one can be a saint in the summer term .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 11]: Did -- did any one else see her cry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 48]: No , I managed to comfort her ; but if Miss Farnborough had happened to come in just at that moment -- '' Cecil shrugged and turned the subject , but she took the hint , to the benefit of her pupils during the next few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 13]: July came in , and with it a spell of unbearable heat .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 43]: In country places and by the seashore there was space and air , and clean fragrant surroundings ; but over London hung a misty pall , and not a branch of the dusty trees quivered to the movement of a passing breeze .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 21]: It was a thunderous , unnatural heat which sapped every scrap of vitality , and made every movement a dread .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 14]: Claire was horrified at the effect of this heat wave on Sophie Blake .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 44]: In superficial fashion she had always believed that rheumatism must be better in hot weather ; but , according to the specialist , such heat as this was more trying than damp or cold , and Sophie 's stiffness increased with alarming suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 46]: There came a day when by no effort of will could she get through her classes , when sheer necessity drove her to do the thing she had dreaded most of all -- inform the Head that she could not go on with her work .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 23]: Miss Farnborough was seated in her private room , and listened with grave attention to what the Games mistress had to say .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 32]: Her forehead puckered in surprise as she noted Sophie 's halting gait , and the while she listened , her keen brain was diving back into the past , collecting impressions .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 35]: She had seen less than usual of Miss Blake during the term ; once or twice she had received the impression that Miss Blake avoided her approach ; Miss Blake had been looking pale .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 25]: She waited until Sophie had finished speaking , her hands folded on her knee , her penetrating eye fixed on the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 15]: Then she spoke -- `` I am sorry to hear this , Miss Blake .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 14]: Your work has been excellent hitherto , but rheumatism is a serious handicap .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 12]: You say that this heat is responsible for the present attack ?
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 20]: Am I to understand that it is a first attack -- that you have had no threatening before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 12]: `` I have been rheumatic all winter , more or less .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 9]: Before the Easter holidays it was pretty bad .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 7]: I began to feel stiff . ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 7]: Miss Farnborough repeated the word gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 3]: `` Stiff !
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 9]: That was bad ; that was very bad !
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 13]: How could you take your classes if you were feeling stiff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 6]: `` I managed somehow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 3]: Sophie said .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 36]: For a moment she had imagined that the Head Mistress 's concern had been on her account ; she believed it no longer when she saw the flash of indignation which lighted the grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 7]: `` Managed -- _ somehow _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 16]: And you went on in that fashion -- you were content to go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 5]: I was not content .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 7]: I was very far from content .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 5]: I suffered horrible pain .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 14]: I went to a specialist and paid him two guineas for his advice .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 11]: Since then I have paid twenty pounds for treatment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 13]: On Miss Farnborough 's face the disapproval grew more and more pronounced .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 17]: `` Miss Blake , I am afraid you have not been quite straightforward in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 33]: It appears that you have been ill for months , with an illness which must necessarily have interfered with your work , and this is the first time I hear about it .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 29]: I am Head Mistress of this school ; if anything is wrong with a member of the staff , it is her first duty to come to me .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 30]: You tell me now that you have been ill for three months , since before the last holidays , and acknowledge that you can go on no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 8]: `` In ten days we break up .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 10]: I ask you to allow me ten extra days .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 16]: The weather is so hot that the girls would be thankful to escape the exercises .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 14]: By the end of the holidays I hope to be quite better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 20]: `` The Easter holidays do not seem to have done you much good , '' Miss Farnborough said cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 20]: Then , seeing the girl flush , she added , `` Of course you shall have your ten days .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 23]: I can see that you are unfit for work , and we must manage without you till the end of the term .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 15]: I am very sorry for you , Miss Blake ; very sorry , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 14]: It is very trying and upsetting and -- and expensive into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 7]: Twenty pounds , did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 7]: That is surely a great deal !
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 12]: Have you tried the shilling bottles of gout and rheumatic pills ?
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 9]: I have been told they are quite excellent .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 16]: But I must repeat that you have been wrong in not coming to me sooner .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 26]: As a pure matter of honesty , do you think that you were justified in continuing to take classes for which you were unfit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 18]: The tears started to Sophie 's eyes ; she lowered her lids to hide them from sight .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 12]: `` The girls did not suffer , '' she said deeply .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 7]: `` I did the suffering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 5]: Miss Farnborough moved impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 18]: She was intensely practical and matter-of-fact , and with all her heart hated any approach to sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 26]: `` You suffered _ because _ you were unfit , '' she repeated coldly , `` and your obvious duty was to come to me .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 20]: You must have known that under the circumstances I should not have wished you to continue the classes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 80]: Sophie was silent for a moment , then she said very quietly , very deliberately -- `` Yes , I did know ; but I also knew that if I could nerve myself to bear the pain and the fatigue , I _ could _ train the girls as well as ever , and I knew , too , that if you sent me away in the middle of term you would be less likely to take me back .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 9]: It means everything to me , you see .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 19]: What would happen to me if I were permanently invalided -- without a pension -- at thirty-one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 28]: `` You have been paid a good salary , Miss Blake -- an exceptionally good salary -- because it is realised that your work is especially wearing .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 35]: You ought to have saved -- '' `` If I had had no home claims I might have been able to save one or two hundred pounds -- not a very big life provision !
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 32]: As it happens , however , I have given thirty pounds a year towards the education of a young sister , and it has been impossible to save at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 27]: `` But now , of course , your sister will help _ you _ , '' Miss Farnborough said , and turned briskly to another topic .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: `` You said that you have been to a specialist ?
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 7]: Will you give me his address ?
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 9]: I should like to communicate with him direct .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 25]: You understand , Miss Blake , that if this stiffness continues , it will be impossible for you to continue your duties here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 12]: `` Quite impossible , '' faltered Sophie , in low tones .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 13]: Miss Farnborough pushed back her chair , and rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 14]: `` But one hopes , of course , that all may go well .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 14]: I have never had any complaint to make with respect to your work .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 12]: You have been very successful , very popular with the girls .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 8]: I should be sorry to lose you .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 11]: Be sure to let me know how you go on .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 10]: Perhaps I had better be guided by Dr Blank .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 14]: I should try the pills , I think ; they are worth trying .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 12]: And avoid the sea ; sea air is bad for rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 6]: Try some high inland place .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 20]: We had better say good-bye , now , I suppose , as you will not come back after to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 5]: Good-bye , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 5]: Let me hear soon .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 8]: All good wishes for your recovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 14]: Sophie left the room , and made her way upstairs to the Staff-Room .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 30]: She moved very slowly , partly because every movement was an effort , partly because the familiar objects on which her eyes rested became suddenly instinct with new interest .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 40]: For ten long working years she had passed them daily with indifference , but this afternoon it was borne in upon her that she would never see them again , and the conviction brought with it a bitter pang .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 38]: After all , they had been happy years , spent in a bustle of youthful life and energy , in an atmosphere of affection , too , for the girls were warm-hearted , and the `` Gym .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 7]: mistress '' had been universally popular .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 31]: Even as the thought passed through Sophie 's mind , one of her special adorers appeared suddenly at the far end of the corridor and hurried forward to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 4]: `` Miss Blake !
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 2]: Darling !
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 5]: You look so white .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 4]: Are you faint ?
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 8]: Take my arm ; lean on me .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 8]: Were you going to lie down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 8]: `` I 'm going to the Staff-Room .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 27]: I can manage myself ; but , Gladys , find Miss Gifford , and ask her to come to me as soon as she is free .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 7]: Tell her I 'm not well .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 8]: You 're a dear girl , Gladys .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 13]: Thank you for being so kind to me all these years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 12]: Gladys rolled adoring blue eyes , and sped on her mission .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 31]: The next morning she realised that those thanks had been darling Miss Blake 's farewell , and shed bitter tears ; but for the moment she was filled with complaisance .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 21]: Claire appeared in due time , heard what had happened , and helped Sophie to collect her various small belongings .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 15]: The other teachers had already dispersed , so the ordeal of leave-taking was avoided .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 12]: `` You can explain when you meet them next term ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 3]: said Claire .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 11]: `` I can write my good-byes , '' corrected Sophie .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 22]: She blinked away a few tears and said piteously , `` Not much chance for me if she consults Dr Blank !
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 10]: He 's as much discouraged as I am myself .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 9]: What do you suppose he will advise now ?
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 11]: I suppose I 'll have to see him to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 13]: `` And lie awake all to-night , wondering what he will say !
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 14]: We 'll do better than that -- we 'll call this very afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 22]: If he is in , I 'm sure he will see us , and a day saved is a day gained .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 7]: I 'll get a taxi . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 4]: `` Another taxi !
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 7]: I 'm ruining you , Claire .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 10]: How I do hate sponging on other people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 15]: `` Would n't you do it for me , if things were reversed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 20]: `` Of course I should , but it 's so much more agreeable to help than to be helped .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 16]: It 's ignoble , I suppose , but I do hate to feel grateful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 15]: No one could by any possibility call you _ gracious _ , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 6]: Is that any consolation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 15]: cried Claire mischievously , and Sophie was surprised into the travesty of a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 19]: Dr Blank was at home , and listened to what Sophie had to tell him with grave attention .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 29]: He expressed satisfaction to hear that her holidays had begun , but when questioned as to his probable report to Miss Farnborough , had no consolation to offer .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 18]: `` I am afraid I must tell you honestly that you are not fit for the work .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 36]: Of course , it is quite possible that there may be a great improvement by September , but , even so , you would be retarding your recovery by going on with such exhausting work .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 9]: You must try to find something lighter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 12]: Sophie laughed , and her laugh was not good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 12]: Claire said firmly -- `` She _ shall _ find it !
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 7]: I will find it for her .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 9]: There 's no need to worry about September .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 15]: What we want to know is what she is to do _ now _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 13]: -- to - morrow -- for the rest of the holidays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 9]: `` I ca n't afford any more injections !
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 13]: They 've done me no good , and they cost too much .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 8]: I ca n't afford any more treatments .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 6]: I can only take medicines .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 27]: If you will give me some medicines -- '' Dr Blank sat silent ; tapping his desk with noiseless fingers ; staring thoughtfully across the room .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 19]: It was evident that he had a proposition to make ; evident also that he doubted its reception .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 33]: `` The best thing under the circumstances -- the wisest thing , '' he said slowly at last , `` would be for you to go into hospital as an ordinary patient .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 30]: I could get you a bed in one of my own wards , where I could look after you myself , in consultation with the first men in town .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 34]: You could have massage , electricity , radium , heat baths , every appliance that could possibly be of use , and you could stay on long enough to give them a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 28]: It would be an ordinary ward , remember , an ordinary bed in an ordinary ward , and your neighbours would not be up to Newnham standard !
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 18]: You would be awakened at five in the morning , and settled for the night at eight .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 16]: You would have to obey rules , which would seem to you unnecessary and tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 11]: You would be , I am afraid , profoundly bored .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 17]: On the other hand , you would have every attention that skill and science can devise .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 24]: You would not have to pay a penny , and you would have a better chance than a duchess in a ducal palace .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 9]: Think it over , and let me know !
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 12]: If you decide to go , I 'll manage the rest .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 10]: Take a day -- a couple of days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 11]: `` I wo n't take two minutes , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 5]: I 'll decide now .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 14]: I 'll go , of course , and thank you very much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 6]: Dr Blank beamed with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 4]: `` Sensible girl !
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 3]: Sensible girl !
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 4]: That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 4]: That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 5]: That 's very good !
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 34]: You are doing the right thing , and we 'll all do our best for you , and your friend here will come to see you and help to make the time pass .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 20]: Interesting study , you know ; valuable opportunity of studying character if you look at it in that light !
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 8]: Why not turn it into literary capital ?
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 23]: ` Sketches from a Hospital Bed , ' ` My Neighbours in B Ward , ' might make an uncommonly good series .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 3]: Who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 12]: We may have you turning out quite a literary star ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 21]: Sophie smiled faintly , being one of the people who would rather walk five miles than write the shortest letter .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 25]: Many unexpected things happen in this world , but it was certain that her own rise to literary eminence would never swell the number !
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 20]: But she knew that Dr Blank was trying to cheer her , so she kept that certainty to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 21]: The two girls made their way back to Sophie 's lodgings , and discussed the situation over the ever-comforting tea .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 28]: `` I shall have to give my landlady notice , '' Sophie said , looking wistfully round the little room which had been so truly a home .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 34]: `` If I 'm to be in hospital for many weeks , it 's folly to go on paying the rent ; and in any case I ca n't afford so much now .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 14]: One ca n't have doctor 's bills , and other luxuries as well .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 9]: What shall I have to take into hospital ?
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 10]: Will they allow me to wear my own things ?
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 15]: I do n't think I _ could _ get better in a calico night-dress !
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 20]: Pretty frills and a blue ribbon bow are as good as a tonic , but will the authorities permit ?
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 12]: Have you ever seen ribbon bows in a hospital bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 22]: `` I have n't had much experience , but I should think they would be encouraged , as a ward decoration !
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 22]: I hope so , I 'm sure , for I mean to present you with a duck of a dressing-jacket ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 15]: `` Oh , nothing more , Claire ; do n't give me anything more .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 36]: I shall never be able to pay you back , '' cried Sophie ; then , in a voice of poignant suffering , she cried sharply , `` Oh , Claire , my little sister !
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 11]: _ What _ is to become of my little sister ?
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 32]: If I am not able to help , if I need to be helped myself , her education will be interrupted , for it will be impossible to go on paying .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 10]: Oh , it 's too hard -- too dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 8]: Everything seems so hopeless and black ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 6]: `` Yes , it does .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 5]: The way seems blocked .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 8]: One ca n't see a step ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 9]: _ Man 's extremity _ , Sophie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 25]: cried Claire deeply -- '' _ Man 's extremity _ ; '' and at that a gleam of light came into Sophie 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 7]: That 's just what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 5]: Thanks for reminding me .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 7]: _ God 's opportunity _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 26]: Sophie leant back in her chair , staring dreamily into space , till presently something of the old bright look came back to her face .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 23]: `` And that , '' she said softly , `` that 's the kind of help it is sweet to accept ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 3]: AN INVITATION .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 49]: With Sophie in hospital , pathetically anxious for visits , with the rent of the Laburnum Road lodgings to pay whether one lived in them or not , Claire nerved herself to spend August in town , with the prospect of a September holiday to cheer her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 58]: Through one of the other mistresses she had heard of an ideal farmhouse near the sea where the kindly housewife `` mothered '' her guests with affectionate care , where food was abundant , and cream appeared upon the table at every meal -- thick , yellow , country cream in which a spoon would stand upright .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 33]: There was also a hammock swung between two apple-trees in the orchard , a balcony outside the bedroom window , and a shabby pony-cart , with a pony who could really go .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 7]: What could one wish for more ?
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 74]: Claire planned a lazy month , lying in that hammock , reading stories about other people , and dreaming still more thrilling romances about herself ; driving the pony along country lanes , going out on to the balcony in the early morning to breathe the scent of honeysuckle , and sweetbriar , and lemon thyme , and all the dear , old-world treasures to be found in the gardens of well-conducted farmhouses .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 34]: She had a craving for flowers in these hot summer days ; not the meagre sixpennyworth which adorned the saffron parlour , but a wealth of blossom , bought without consideration of cost .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 17]: And one day , with the unexpectedness of a fairy gift , her wish was fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 86]: It lay on the table when she returned from school -- a long cardboard box bearing the name of a celebrated West End florist , the word `` fragile '' marked on the lid , and inside were roses , magnificent , half-opened roses with the dew still on their leaves , the fat green stalks nearly a yard in length -- dozens of roses of every colour and shade , from the lustrous whiteness of Frau Carl to the purple blackness of Prince Camille .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 46]: Claire gathered them in her arms , unconscious of the charming picture which she made , in her simple blue lawn dress , with her glowing face rising over the riot of colour , gathered them in a great handful , and ran swiftly upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 38]: There was no card inside the box , no message of any kind , but her heart knew no doubt as to the sender , and she dare not face the fire of Mary Rhodes ' cross-examination .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 28]: In the days of daffodils she had treated herself to a high green column of a vase , which was an ideal receptacle for the present treasures .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 38]: When it was filled there were still nearly half the number waiting for a home , so these were plunged deep into the ewer until the morrow , when they would be taken to Sophie in hospital .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 22]: The little room was filled with beauty and fragrance , and Claire knew moments of unclouded happiness as she looked around .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 35]: Presently she extracted two roses from the rest , ran downstairs to collect box , paper and string , and handed rubbish and roses together to Lizzie at the top of the kitchen stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 44]: Lizzie received her share of the treasures with dignity , cut off the giant stems , which she considered straggly and out of place , and crammed the two heads into a brown cream-jug , the which she deposited on a sunny window-ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 44]: Claire saw them as she next left the house and shrugged resignedly , for she was beginning to learn the lesson which many of us take a lifetime to master , the wisdom of allowing people to enjoy themselves in their own fashion !
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 24]: The Willoughbys were leaving town in mid July , _ en route _ for Switzerland , and later on for a Scottish shooting-box .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 22]: Claire received an invitation to tea on their last Saturday afternoon , and arrived to find the drawing-room full of visitors .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 53]: Malcolm Heward was assisting Janet at the tea-table , but with this exception she recognised no one in the room , and was thankful for the attentions of Master Reginald , who hailed her as an old acquaintance , and reproached her loudly for not turning up at `` Lord 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 11]: `` I looked out for you , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 26]: he said impressively , and Claire was the more gratified by his remembrance because Malcolm Heward had required a second introduction to awaken his recollection .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 38]: It is no doubt gratifying to the object of his devotion when a man remains blind to every other member of her sex , but the other members may feel a natural objection to be so ignored !
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 49]: Claire was annoyed by the necessity of that second introduction , and as a consequence made herself so fascinating to the boy who _ had _ remembered , that he hugged the sweet delusion that she considered him a man , and was seriously smitten by his charms .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 43]: He waited upon her with assiduity , gave her exclusive tips as to her choice of cakes , and recited the latest funny stories which were already stale in his own circles , but which came to her ears with agreeable freshness .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 58]: It was while the two were laughing together over an unexpected _ denouement _ that the departure of two guests left a space across which Claire could see a far corner of the room , and perceived that a lady seated on a sofa had raised a tortoiseshell-bound _ lorgnon _ , to stare across at herself .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 16]: She was an elderly lady , and at first sight her appearance awoke no recollection .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 78]: She was just a grey-haired woman , attired in handsome black , in no way differentiated from one or two other visitors of the same age : even when the _ lorgnon _ dropped to her side , disclosing a pair of very bright , very quizzical grey eyes , it was a full moment before Claire realised that this was her acquaintance of that first eventful journey to London , none other than Mrs Fanshawe herself .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 44]: There she sat , smiling , complacent , _ grande dame _ as ever , nodding with an air of mingled friendliness and patronage , laying one hand on the vacant place by her side , with an action which was obviously significant .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 33]: Claire chose , however , to ignore the invitation , and after a grave bow of acknowledgment , turned back to Reginald , keeping her eyes resolutely averted from that far corner .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 18]: It was Mrs Fanshawe herself who was finally compelled to cross the room to make her greetings .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 4]: `` Miss Gifford !
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 6]: Surely it is Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 10]: Mrs Willoughby told me she expected you this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 14]: And how are you , my dear , after this long time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 10]: The tone was all that was cordial and friendly .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 15]: Claire stood up , tall and stately , and extended a perfectly gloved hand .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 14]: It was not in human nature to be perfectly natural at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 33]: Sub-consciously she was aware that , as the Americans would express it , she was `` putting on frills '' ; sub-consciously she was amused at the artificiality of her own voice .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 7]: `` Quite well , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 4]: Exceedingly flourishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 19]: `` You look it , '' Mrs Fanshawe said , and seated herself ruthlessly in Reginald 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 7]: `` Tell me all about it !
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 10]: You were going to work , were n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 7]: Some new-fangled idea of being independent .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 7]: So ridiculous for a pretty girl !
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 12]: And you 've had -- how long -- nearly a year ?
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 13]: Have n't got tired of it yet , by any chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 29]: `` Oh , yes ; quite often I feel very tired , but I should have felt the same about pleasuring , and work is more worth while .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 6]: It has been very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 8]: I have learnt a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: `` More than the pupils -- hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 5]: chuckled Mrs Fanshawe shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 13]: `` Do n't try to pretend that you are a model school-mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 4]: I know better !
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 30]: I knew you were not the type when I saw you on that journey , and after a year 's trial you are less the type than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 20]: She screwed up her eyes and looked Claire over with deliberate criticism up and down , down and up .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 6]: `` No , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 18]: Nature did _ not _ intend you to be shut up in a girls ' school ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 7]: Suddenly she swerved to another topic .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 7]: `` What a journey that was !
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 4]: I nearly expired .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 14]: If it had n't been for you , I should never have survived .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 10]: I told my son you had saved my life .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 12]: That was my son who met me on the platform ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 15]: Was it fancy that an expression of watchfulness had come into the gay eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 24]: Claire imagined that she recognised such an expression , but , being prepared for some such reference , had herself well in command .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 24]: Not a nicker of embarrassment passed over her face as she said quietly -- `` Yes , I knew it was your son .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 17]: I met Captain Fanshawe here one evening last winter , so I have been introduced . ''
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 27]: Mrs Fanshawe waved her _ lorgnon _ , and murmured some vague words which might , or might not , have been intended as an apology .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 3]: So nice !
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 8]: Naturally , that morning I was worn-out .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 9]: I did not know what I was doing .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 5]: I crawled into bed .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 13]: Erskine told me about meeting you , and of your pretty performance .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 7]: Quite a professional _ siffleuse _ !
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 10]: More amusing than school teaching , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 6]: _ And _ more profitable .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 10]: You ought to think of it as a profession .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 5]: Erskine was quite pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 7]: He comes here a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 18]: Of course -- '' Mrs Fanshawe 's smile deepened in meaning fashion , then suddenly she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 16]: `` Very delightful for them , of course ; but I see nothing of him .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 10]: We mothers of modern children have a lonely time .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 32]: I used to wish for a daughter , but perhaps , if I 'd had one , _ she _ would have developed a fancy to fly off to India ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 36]: That was a hit at Claire , but she received it in silence , being a little touched by the unaffected note of wistfulness in the other 's voice as she regretted her lonely estate .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 34]: It _ was _ hard to be a widow , and to see so little of an only child , especially if that only child happened to be so altogether charming and attractive !
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 23]: Mrs Fanshawe glanced across at the tea-table where Janet and her cavalier were still busy ministering to the needs of fresh arrivals .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 28]: `` I asked Janet Willoughby to take pity on me for a few weeks this summer , but she 's too full up with her own plans .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 21]: Says so , at least ; but I dare say it would have been different if -- Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 34]: I have been young myself , and I dare say I should n't have been too keen to accept an invitation to stay in the country with only an old woman as companion .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 10]: Enjoy yourself while you are young , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 13]: It gets more and more difficult with every year you live . ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 6]: Claire made a protesting grimace .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 4]: `` Does it ?
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 4]: That 's discouraging .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 11]: I 've always flattered myself that it would grow easier .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 23]: When one is young , everything is vague and unsettled , and naturally one feels anxious about what is to happen next .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 41]: It is almost impossible to be philosophical about the unknown , but when your life has shaped itself , it ought to be easy to settle down and make the best of it , and cultivate an easy mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 4]: Mrs Fanshawe laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 10]: `` Well reasoned , my dear , well reasoned !
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 5]: Most logical and sound .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 12]: And just as futile in practice as logical things usually are !
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 56]: You would n't believe me if I told you that it is the very uncertainty which makes the charm of youth , or that being certain is the bane of old age , but it 's the truth , all the same , and when you are sixty you will have discovered it for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 13]: so my letter to Mrs Willoughby was of some use after all ?
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 8]: She did send you a card ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 11]: Claire looked across the room to where Mrs Willoughby sat .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 32]: Hero - worship is an instinct in hearts which are still fired with youth 's enthusiasm , and this stout , middle-aged woman was Claire 's heroine _ par excellence _ .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 21]: She was _ kind _ , and to be kind is in good truth the fulfilment of Christ 's law .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 30]: Among Claire 's favourite books was Professor Drummond 's `` The Greatest Thing in the World , '' with its wonderful exposition of the thirteenth chapter of 1st Corinthians .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 41]: When she read its pages , her thoughts flew instinctively to this rich woman of society , who was not puffed up , thought no evil , was not easily provoked , suffered long , _ and was kind _ .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 35]: The girl 's eyes were eloquent with love and admiration as they rested on the plain , elderly face , and the woman who was watching felt a stab of envy at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 48]: The old crave for the love of the young , and cherish it , when found , as one of their dearest possessions , and despite the natural gaiety of her disposition there were moments when Mrs Fanshawe felt the burden of loneliness press heavily upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 13]: `` She has done much more than send me a card ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 4]: Claire said deeply .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 7]: `` She has been a friend .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 10]: She has taken away the terrible feeling of loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 22]: If I were in trouble , or needed any help , I _ know _ that she would give it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes , yes , naturally she would .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 13]: So would any one , my dear , who had the chance .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 14]: But she 's a good creature , of course ; a dear creature .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 10]: I 'm devoted to her , and to Janet .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 10]: Janet and I are the best of friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 36]: Again the meaning look , the meaning tone , and again in Claire 's heart the same sweet sense of certainty mingled with a tender compassion for Janet , who was less fortunate than herself .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 27]: It was a help to look across at the tea-table , and to realise that consolation was waiting for Janet if she chose to take it .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 11]: Suddenly Mrs Fanshawe switched off on to yet another topic .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 16]: `` And where are you going to spend your summer holidays , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 15]: `` In September I am probably going to a farmhouse near the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 6]: `` And in August ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 7]: `` In town , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 18]: I have an invalid friend -- '' Mrs Fanshawe swept aside the suggestion with an imperious hand .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 3]: Utter nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 13]: _ Nobody _ stays in town in August , my good child .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 5]: The thing 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 23]: I 've passed through once or twice , _ en route _ for country visits , and it 's an unknown place .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 8]: The wierdest people walking up and down !
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 17]: Where they come from I ca n't conceive ; but you never saw anything more impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 4]: And the shops !
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 29]: I knew a poor girl who became engaged at the end of July , and had to get her trousseau at once , as they sailed in September .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 5]: She was in despair .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 7]: _ Nothing _ to be had .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 7]: She was positively in tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 22]: `` I shall get engaged in June , '' Claire said firmly , `` and take advantage of the summer sales .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 17]: I call it most thoughtless of him to have waited till the end of July . ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 26]: But Mrs Fanshawe was not attending ; her eyes had brightened with a sudden thought ; she was saying to herself , `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 5]: I should be alone .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 35]: There would be no danger of complications , and the child would be a delightful companion , good to look at , plenty to say for herself , and a mind of her own .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 7]: Quite useful in entertaining , too .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 19]: I could play off some of my duty debts , and she could whistle to us after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 7]: Quite a novelty in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 11]: It would be quite a draw ... A capital idea !
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 38]: I 'll say a week , and if it works she can stay on -- '' `` No , my dear , you can not possibly endure town in August , at least not the entire month .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 8]: Run down to me for a break .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 20]: Quite a short journey ; an hour and a half from Waterloo , and the air is delightfully fresh .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 31]: I shall be alone , so I ca n't offer you any excitement , but if you are fond of motoring -- '' The blood rushed into Claire 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 21]: She was so intensely , overpoweringly surprised , that , for the moment , all other feelings were in abeyance .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 23]: The last thing in the world which she had expected was that Erskine 's mother should invite her to visit her home .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 11]: `` I do n't know if you care for gardening .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 7]: I 'm mad about it myself .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 8]: My garden is a child to me .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 5]: I stand no interference .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 14]: The gardeners are paid to obey me , and carry out my instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 9]: If they get upsetting , off they go .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 6]: You 'd like my garden .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 18]: It is not cut out to a regulation pattern ; it has a personality of its own .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 11]: I have all my meals on the verandah in summer .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 9]: We could get you some tennis , too .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 7]: You would n't be buried alive .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 2]: Well ?
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 5]: What do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 6]: Is it worth while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 6]: `` It 's exceedingly kind .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 7]: It 's awfully good of you .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 21]: I -- I am so completely taken by surprise that I hardly know -- I shall have to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 13]: `` Nonsense , my dear ; what is there to think about ?
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 12]: You have no other engagement , and you need a change .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 9]: Incidentally also _ I _ want a companion .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 13]: You would be doing me a good turn as well as yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 10]: I 'm sure your mother would wish it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 5]: No doubt about that !
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 37]: Claire smiled to herself as she realised how Mrs Judge would rejoice over the visit ; turning one swallow into a summer , and in imagination beholding her daughter plunged into a very vortex of gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 27]: She was still smiling , still considering , when Janet came strolling across the room , and laid her hand affectionately on Mrs Fanshawe 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 12]: `` I have n't had a word with you all afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 6]: Such a rush of people .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 16]: You had tea comfortably , I hope : and you , too -- Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 12]: There was just a suspicion of hesitation before the Christian name .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 19]: `` I have just been asking Miss Gifford to take pity on my loneliness for part of August .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 44]: She is not knee-deep in engagements , as you are , my dear , and that precious son of mine ; so we are going to amuse each other , and see how much entertainment we can squeeze out of the countryside ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 39]: `` But I have n't -- I did n't -- I 'm not sure , '' stammered Claire , acutely conscious of the hardening of Janet 's face , but once again Mrs Fanshawe waved aside her objections .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 8]: `` But _ I _ am sure !
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 13]: It 's all settled , my dear -- all but the day .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 23]: Put your address on this silly little tablet , and I 'll write as soon as I 've looked over my dates .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 11]: Now , Janet , I 'm ready for a chat .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 13]: Take me out to the balcony , away from this crowd . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 9]: `` And I must go , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 6]: I 'll say good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 12]: Claire held out her hand to the daughter of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 11]: `` I hope you may have a delightful summer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 7]: `` Oh , thanks so much .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 18]: Oh , yes , yes , I 'm quite sure I will , '' Janet answered mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 14]: She touched Claire 's hand with her fingers , and turned hastily aside .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 5]: ERSKINE FANSHAWE 'S HOME .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 22]: Claire dreaded Mary Rhodes ' curiosity on the subject of her proposed visit , but in effect there was none forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 17]: Cecil was too much engrossed in her own affairs to feel anything but a passing interest .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 10]: `` Some one you met at the Willoughbys ' ?
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 5]: Only the old lady ?
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 5]: Rather you than me !
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 16]: Nice house though , I suppose ; gardens , motors , that kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 5]: Dull , but luxurious .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 11]: Perhaps you 'll stay on permanently as her companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 13]: `` That , '' Claire said emphatically , `` will never happen !
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 40]: I was thinking of clothes ... I am quite well-off for evenings , and I can manage for afternoons , but I do think I ought to indulge in one or two ` drastic bargains ' for morning wear .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 11]: I saw some particularly drastic specimens in Knightsbridge this week .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 19]: Cecil ... could you -- I hate asking , but _ could _ you pay me back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 12]: Cecil 's stare of amazement was almost comical under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 7]: `` My -- good -- girl !
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 20]: I was really pondering whether I dare , I 'm horribly hard up , and that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 12]: I 've had calls ... '' `` Not Major Carew again ?
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 8]: I ca n't understand it , Cecil .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 26]: You know I inquired about him , you told me to ask if I had a chance , and his father _ is _ rich .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 22]: He might fly into a rage if he were asked for money , but he would give it in the end .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 18]: Major Carew might have a bad half-hour , but what is that compared with borrowing from you !
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 19]: And from a man 's point of view it 's so little , such very small sums ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 18]: She caught a change of expression on the other 's face , and leapt at its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 3]: `` Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 6]: You have been giving more !
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 4]: Your savings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 16]: `` And if I have , Claire Gifford , what business is it of yours ?
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 6]: What was I saving for ?
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 11]: To provide for my old age , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 19]: and now that the need has gone , why should n't I lend it , if I chose ?
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 19]: Frank happens to be hard up for a few months , and besides , there 's a reason !
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 66]: ... We are getting tired of waiting ... You must never , never breathe a word to a soul , but he wants me ... he thinks it might be better ... '' Claire stared with wide eyes , Cecil frowned , and finished the sentence in reckless tones -- `` We shall probably get married this autumn , and tell his father afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 7]: `` Oh , Cecil , no !
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 5]: Do n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 4]: It 's madness .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 4]: It 's folly .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 7]: He ought not to ask you .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 10]: It will make things fifty times more difficult . ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 10]: `` It would make things _ sure _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 4]: Mary Rhodes said .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 26]: The words were such an unconscious revelation of her inner attitude towards her lover , that Claire was smitten with a very passion of pity .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 10]: She stretched out her hand , and cried ardently .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 29]: `` Cecil , I am thinking of your happiness : I long for you to be sure , but a private marriage is an insult to a girl .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 18]: It puts her into a wrong position , and no man has the right to suggest it .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 6]: Where is your pride ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 19]: `` Oh , my dear , '' interrupted Cecil wearily , `` I 'm past worrying about pride .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 15]: I 'm thirty-three , and look older , and feel sixty at the least .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 9]: I 'm tired out in body and soul .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 8]: I 'm sick of this empty life .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 5]: I want a home .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 4]: I want rest .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 18]: I want some one to care for me , and take an interest in what I do .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 13]: Frank is n't perfect , I do n't pretend that he is .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 29]: I wish to goodness he _ would _ own up , and face the racket once for all , but it 's no use , he wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 27]: Between ourselves I believe he thinks the old man wo n't live much longer , and there will be no need to worry him at all .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 43]: Any way there it is , he wo n't tell at present , however much I may beg , but he will marry me ; he wants to be married in September , and that proves that he _ does _ care !
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 13]: He is looking out for a flat , and picking up furniture .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 14]: _ We _ are picking up furniture , '' Cecil corrected herself hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 22]: `` I go in and ask the prices , and he sends his servants the next week to do the bargaining .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 52]: And there will be my clothes , too ... I 'll pay you back in time , Claire , with ten per cent , interest into the bargain , and perhaps when I 'm a rich woman the time may come when you will be glad to borrow from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 21]: The prospect was not cheering , but the intention was good , and as such had to be suitably acknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 20]: Claire adjourned upstairs to consult her cheque-book , and decided bravely that the drastic bargains could not be afforded .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 47]: Then , being a very human , and feminine young woman she told herself that there could be no harm in going to look at the dresses once more , just to convince herself that they were not so very drastic after all , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 30]: close inspection proved them even more drastic than she had believed , and by the evening 's delivery a choice specimen was speeding by motor van to Laburnum Road .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 73]: On visiting days Claire went regularly to visit Sophie , who , by her own account , was being treated to seventeen different cures at the same time , and was too busy being rubbed , and boiled , and electrified , and dosed , and put to bed in the middle of the afternoon , and awakened in the middle of the night , to have any time to feel bored .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 29]: She took a keen interest also in her fellow patients , and was the confidante of many tragic stories which made her own lot seem light in comparison .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 32]: Altogether she was more cheerful and hopeful than for months back , but the nurses looked dubious , and could not be induced to speak of her recovery with any certitude .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 28]: On the tenth of August , Claire packed her boxes with the aid of a very mountain of tissue paper , and set forth on her journey .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 27]: The train deposited her at Hazlemere station , outside which Mrs Fanshawe was waiting in a big cream car , smiling her gay , quizzical smile .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 33]: She was one of the fortunate women who possess the happy knack of making a guest feel comfortable , and at home , and her welcome sent Claire 's spirits racing upwards .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 34]: Many times during the last fortnight had she debated the wisdom of visiting Erskine Fanshawe 's home , but the temptation was so strong that at every conflict prudence went to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 49]: It was not in girl nature to resist the longing to see his home and renew her acquaintance with his mother ; and as it had been repeatedly stated that he himself was to spend most of August in Scotland , she was absolved from any ulterior design .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 27]: Janet Willoughby had obviously looked upon the visit with disfavour , but Claire was too level-headed to be willing to victimise herself for such a prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 9]: Janet would have a fair field in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 11]: She could not hold the whole kingdom as a preserve !
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 14]: `` You are looking charming , my dear , '' Mrs Fanshawe said .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 22]: `` I always say it is one of the tests of a lady to know how to dress for a journey .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 13]: A little pale , perhaps , but we shall soon change that .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 9]: This high air is better than any tonic .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 84]: I laze about during the heat of the day , and have a two hours ' spin after tea ; I never appear until eleven , and I rest in my own room between lunch and tea , so you wo n't have too much of my society , but I 've a big box of new books from Mudie 's for you to read , and there 's a pony-cart at your disposal , so I dare say you can amuse yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 23]: I love companionship , but I could n't talk to the cleverest woman in Europe for twelve hours at a stretch . ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 5]: `` Nor I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 28]: agreed Claire , who to tell the truth was more elated at the prospect of so much time to herself than she felt it discreet to betray .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 31]: She was enchanted with her first view of the beautiful Surrey landscape , and each turn of the road as they sped uphill seemed to open out more lovely vistas .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 47]: They drove past spinneys of pine trees , past picturesque villages , consisting of an old inn , a few scattered cottages , a pond and a green , along high roads below which the great plain of thickly-treed country lay simmering in a misty haze .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 56]: Then presently the road took a sudden air of cultivation , and Claire staring curiously discovered that the broad margin of grass below the hedge on either side , was mown and rolled to a lawn-like smoothness , the edges also being clipped in as accurate a line as within the most carefully tended garden .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 32]: For several hundred yards the margin stretched ahead , smooth as the softest velvet , a sight so rare and refreshing to the eye that Claire could not restrain her delight .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 5]: `` But how charming !
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 3]: How unexpected !
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 10]: I never saw a lane so swept and garnished .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 13]: It has a wonderful effect , those two long lines of sward .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 6]: It _ is _ sward !
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 7]: grass is too common a word .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 7]: But what an amount of work !
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 11]: Twenty maids with twenty mops sweeping for half a year .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 18]: -- I think the whole neighbourhood ought to be grateful to the owner of this land . ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 6]: Mrs Fanshawe beamed , complacently .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad you think so .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 7]: _ I _ am the owner !
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 17]: This is my property , mine for my lifetime , and my son 's after me .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 12]: It 's one of my hobbies to keep the lane mown .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 12]: I like to be tidy , outside as well as in .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 35]: Erskine began by thinking it a ridiculous waste of work , but his friends are so enthusiastic about the result , that he is now complacently convinced that it was entirely his own idea .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 8]: That 's a man , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 29]: Illogical , self-satisfied , the best of 'em , and you 'll never change them till the end of time ... What 's your opinion of men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 8]: `` I rather -- like them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 29]: replied Claire with a _ naivete _ which kept her listener chuckling with amusement until the lodge gates were reached , and the car turned into the drive .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 28]: The house was less imposing than the grounds , just a large comfortable English country house , handsome and dignified , but not venerable in any way .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 27]: The hall was good , running the entire length of the house , and opening by tall double doors on to the grounds at the rear .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 27]: In summer these doors were kept open , and allowed a visitor a charming vista of rose pergolas and the blue-green foliage of an old cedar .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 37]: All the walls of the house from top to bottom were painted a creamy white , and there was noticeable a prevailing touch of red in Turkey carpets , cushion - covers , and rose-flecked chintzes .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 46]: Tea was served on a verandah , and after it was over Mrs Fanshawe escorted her visitor round the flower gardens , and finally upstairs to her own bedroom , where she was left with the announcement that dinner would be served at eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 21]: After dinner the ladies played patience , drank two glasses of hot-water , and retired to bed at ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 46]: It was not exciting , but on the other hand it was certainly not dull , for Mrs Fanshawe 's personality was so keen , so youthful in its appreciation , that it was impossible not to be infected , and share in her enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 8]: The next week passed quickly and pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 49]: The weather was good , allowing long drives over the lovely country , a tennis party at home , and another at a neighbouring house introduced a little variety into the programme , and best of all Mrs Fanshawe grew daily more friendly , even affectionate in manner .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 40]: She was a woman of little depth of character , whose main object in life was to amuse herself and avoid trouble , but she had humour and intelligence , and made an agreeable companion for a summer holiday .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 28]: As her intimacy with her guest increased she spoke continually of her son , referring to his marriage with Janet Willoughby with an air of complacent certitude .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 8]: `` Of course he will marry Janet .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 17]: They 've been attached for years , but the young men of to-day are so deliberate .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 12]: They are not in a hurry to give up their freedom .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 15]: Janet will be just the right wife for Erskine , good tempered and yielding .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 9]: He is a dear person , but obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 13]: When he once makes up his mind , nothing will move him .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 13]: It would never do for him to have a high-spirited wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 41]: `` I disapprove of pandering to men , '' snapped Claire in her most High School manner , whereupon the conversation branched off to a discussion on Women 's Rights , which was just what she had intended and desired .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 39]: On the seventh afternoon of her visit , Claire was in her room writing a letter to Sophie when she heard a sudden tumult below , and felt her heart bound at the sound of a familiar voice .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 18]: The pen dropped from her hand , and she sat transfixed , her cheeks burning with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 5]: It could not be !
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 6]: It was preposterous , impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 5]: He was in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 9]: Only that morning there had been a letter .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 41]: -- It was impossible , impossible , and then again came the sound of that voice , that laugh , and she was on her feet , running across the floor , opening the door , listening with straining ears .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 24]: A voice rose clear and distinct from the hall beneath , the deep , strong voice about which there could be no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 5]: `` A perfect flood !
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 8]: The last five days have been hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 36]: I was tired of being soaked to the skin , and having to change my clothes every two hours , so I cut it , picked up Humphreys in town , and came along home .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 10]: And how have you been getting on , mater ?
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 6]: You look uncommonly fit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 6]: `` I 'm quite well .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 5]: I am perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 20]: You need not have come home on my account , '' Mrs Fanshawe 's voice had a decided edge .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 10]: `` I suppose this is just a flying visit .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 10]: You will be going on to pay another visit .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 11]: I have a friend with me -- a Miss Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 9]: You met her at the Willoughbys ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 5]: `` So I did !
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 5]: That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 7]: I 'm glad you had company .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 14]: I suppose I _ shall _ be moving on one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 10]: I say , mother , what about tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 13]: Claire shut the door softly , and turned back into the room .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 81]: Erskine 's voice had sounded absolutely normal and unmoved : judging by it no one could have imagined that Miss Gifford 's presence or absence afforded him the slightest interest , and yet , and yet , the mysterious inner voice was speaking again , declaring that it was not the wet weather which had driven him back ... that he had hurried home because he knew , he knew -- In ten minutes ' time tea would be served .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 59]: Claire did not change her dress or make any alteration in her simple attire , her energies during those few minutes were chiefly devoted to cooling her flushed cheeks , and when the gong sounded she ran downstairs , letters in hand , and evinced a politely impersonal surprise at the sight of Captain Erskine and his friend .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 14]: Mrs Fanshawe 's eyes followed the girl 's movements with a keen scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 19]: It seemed to her that Claire 's indifference was a trifle overdone : Erskine also was unnaturally composed .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 16]: Under ordinary circumstances such a meeting would have called forth a frank , natural pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 13]: She set her lips , and determined to leave nothing to chance .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 4]: THE FLOWERY WAY .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 33]: Only a few hours before her son 's unexpected arrival , Mrs Fanshawe had warmly pressed Claire to extend her visit to a fortnight at least , and Claire had happily agreed .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 45]: Mrs Fanshawe recalled the incident as she poured out tea , and rated herself for her imprudence , but the deed was done ; there was the girl , looking pretty enough to turn any young man 's head , and there , alas !
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 28]: was Erskine , who should , by all the laws of what was right and proper , be even now making love to Janet Willoughby in Scotland !
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 41]: Janet was rich , Janet was well born , Janet was amiable and easily led , for years past Mrs Fanshawe had set her heart on Janet as a daughter-in-law , and she was not easily turned from her purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 39]: Throughout that first afternoon her thoughts were busily engaged planning ahead , striving to arrange the days to the hindrance of dangerous _ tete-a-tetes _ , Erskine appeared to have returned in ignorance of Miss Gifford 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 43]: Mrs Fanshawe had been careful to avoid all reference to the girl in her letters , and was unable to think how the information could have leaked out , nevertheless the choice of Major Humphreys as a companion filled her with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 47]: Never before had such an invitation been given on Erskine 's initiative ; on more than one occasion , indeed , he had confessed that he found the Major a bore , and had expressed surprise at his mother 's liking for so dull a man .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 29]: Mrs Fanshawe had never found the Major dull , since he shared with enthusiasm her own passion for gardening , and was a most valuable adviser and assistant .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 61]: Together they had planned the flagged path winding low between the high banks of the rock garden , together they had planted the feathery white arenaria calearica in the crevices of the steps leading upward to the pergola , together they had planned the effect of clusters of forget-me-not , and red tulips among the long grasses in the orchard .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 34]: There was never any dearth of conversation between Major Humphreys and Mrs Fanshawe , and a stroll round the rose garden might easily prolong itself into a discussion lasting a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 25]: Hence came the suspicion , or Erskine knew as much , and had deliberately invited this man before any one of his own friends .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 38]: Despite all appearance to the contrary , Mrs Fanshawe felt convinced that `` the bore '' had been brought down to engage her own attention , and so leave her son free to follow his own devices .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 12]: She set her lips , and determined on a counter move .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 17]: A _ partie carree _ was dangerous under the circumstances ; safety lay in a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 53]: That evening when Mrs Fanshawe retired to dress for dinner , the telephone in her boudoir was used to ring up all the big houses in the neighbourhood , invitations were given galore for tennis , for dinner , for lunch ; and return invitations were accepted without consultation with her son .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 26]: At the end of half an hour she hung up the receiver , satisfied that Erskine 's opportunities for _ tete-a-tetes _ would be few .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 20]: Perhaps also time would suggest some excuse for shortening the girl 's visit to the ten days originally planned .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 12]: She must think it out , put her wits to work .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 20]: Claire was a pretty creature and a delightful companion , but a nobody , and poor into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 11]: She could not be allowed to upset a cherished plan !
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 44]: During dinner Mrs Fanshawe alluded casually to the coming gaieties , and mentally paid a tribute of admiration to the _ aplomb _ with which Claire listened , and smiled , betraying not a flicker of surprise at the sudden change of programme .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 48]: The good lady was so pleased with the result of her own scheming , that when later on the Major proposed a game of patience , she accepted at once , and viewed with equanimity the sight of the two young people strolling down the garden path .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 14]: It would be the last night when such an escape would be possible !
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 22]: It was an exquisite moonlight night , clear enough to show the colour of the flowers in the beds and borders .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 36]: Claire 's white dress took on a ghostly hue against the deep background of the trees , her cheeks were pale , too , and the long line of eyelash showed dark against her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 19]: She felt very happy , very content , just the least little bit in the world , afraid !
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 17]: Captain Fanshawe was smoking a cigarette , and in the intervals drawing deep sighs of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 19]: `` There 's only one thing that worries me -- why did n't I come back last week ?
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 17]: To think of rain , and mist , and smoky fires , and then -- This !
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 13]: I feel like a man who has been transported into fairyland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 17]: Claire felt as if she also was in fairyland , but she did not say so .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 10]: There are things that a girl does not say .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 45]: They paced up and down the winding paths , and came to the flight of steps leading to the pergola , `` The Flowery Way '' as Mrs Fanshawe loved to call it , where the arenaria calearica shone starry white in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 20]: Erskine stopped short , and said urgently -- `` Would you mind walking on alone for a few yards ?
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 12]: I 'll stand here ... while you go up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 3]: Please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 17]: Claire stared in surprise , but there seemed no reason to deny so simple a request .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 13]: `` And what am I to do when I get there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 19]: `` Just stand still for a moment , and then walk on ... I 'll come after ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 35]: Claire laughed , shrugged , and went slowly forward along the flagged path , up the flower-sprinkled stair , to pause beneath an arch of pink roses and look back with an inquiring smile .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 51]: Erskine was standing where she had left him , but he did not smile in response , while one might have counted twenty , he remained motionless , his look grave and intent , then he came quickly forward , leapt up the shallow steps and stood by her side .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 9]: he said tersely , but that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 12]: Neither then or later came any explanation of the strange request .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 17]: For a few moments there was silence , then Erskine harked back to his former subject .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 18]: `` Scottish scenery is very fine , but for restful loveliness , Surrey is hard to beat .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 16]: You have n't told me yet how you like our little place , Miss Gifford !
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 15]: It 's on a very modest scale , but I 'm fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 34]: There 's a homey feeling about it that one misses in bigger places , and the mater is a genius at gardening , and gets the maximum of effect out of the space .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 8]: Are you fond of a garden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 8]: `` I 've never had one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 9]: Claire said , and sighed at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 18]: `` That 's one of the Joys that does _ not _ go with a roving life !
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 37]: I 've never been able to have as many flowers as I wanted , or to choose the right foliage to go with them , or to pick them with the dew on their leaves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 9]: She paused , smitten with a sudden recollection .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 27]: `` One day this year , a close , smouldering oven-ey day , I came in from school and found -- a box full of roses !
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 15]: There were _ dewdrops _ on the leaves , or what looked like dewdrops .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 14]: They were as fresh as if they had been gathered an hour before .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 9]: Dozens of roses , with great long stems .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 9]: They made my room into a bower . ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 3]: `` Really !
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 3]: Did they ?
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 10]: How very jolly , '' was Erskine 's comment .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 18]: His voice sounded cool and unperturbed , and Claire did not venture to look at his face .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 15]: She thought with a pang , that perhaps after all she had been mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 26]: Perhaps Mrs Willoughby had been the real donor ... perhaps he had never thought ... She hurried on terrified lest her thoughts might be suspected .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 23]: `` Mrs Fanshawe has been so kind , allowing me to send boxes of fruit and flowers to a friend in hospital .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 13]: One of our mistresses , who is being treated for rheumatism . ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 5]: `` Poor creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 7]: said the Captain with careless sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 10]: `` Dull work being in hospital in this weather .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 13]: How have you been getting on with my mother , Miss Gifford ?
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 20]: I 'm awfully glad to find you down here , though I should have enjoyed showing you round myself .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 10]: I 'm a bit jealous of the mater there !
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 10]: She 's a delightful companion , is n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 5]: So keen and alert .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 16]: I do n't know any woman of her age who is so young in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 32]: It 's a great gift , but -- '' he paused , drew another cigarette from his case , and stared at it reflectively , `` it has its drawbacks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 5]: I can understand that .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 31]: It must be hard to feel young , to _ be _ young in heart and mind , and to be handicapped by a body that persists in growing old .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 11]: I 've often thought how trying it must be . ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 13]: I 'm afraid I was n't thinking about it in that light .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 21]: I was not discussing the position from my mother 's point of view , but from -- her son 's !
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 32]: It would be easier sometimes to deal with a placid old lady who was content with her knitting , and cherished an old - fashioned belief in the superiority of man !
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 6]: let us say the equality .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 9]: But the mater wo n't even grant that .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 35]: By virtue of her superior years she is under the impression that she can still manage my affairs better than I can myself , which , of course , is a profound delusion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 27]: Looking at the firmly cut profile it seemed ridiculous to think of any one managing this man if it were not his will to be managed .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 11]: Mother and son were alike in possessing an obstinate self-will .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 10]: A conflict between them would be no light thing .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 12]: Woman-like , Claire 's sympathies leant to the woman 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 20]: `` It must be very difficult for a mother to realise that her son is really past her control .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 14]: And when she _ does _ , it must be a painful feeling .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 13]: It is n't painful for the son ; it 's only annoying .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 6]: The mother fares worst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 16]: Captain Fanshawe laughed , and looked down at the girl 's face with admiring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 12]: `` What a faculty you have of seeing the other side !
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 14]: Do you always take the part of the person who is n't here ?
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 30]: If so , all the better for me this last week , when the mater has been spinning stories of my obstinacy , and pig-headedness , and general contradictiveness .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 24]: I thought I had better hurry home at once , before you learnt to put me down as a hopeless bad lot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 9]: Claire stood still , staring with widened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 48]: `` Hurry home -- hurry home before -- '' She stopped short , furious with herself for having taken any notice of the slip , and Erskine gave a short embarrassed laugh , and cried hastily -- `` Oh , I knew ; of course I knew !
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 7]: The rain was only an excuse .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 23]: The real reason was that as soon as I knew you were staying here , I had n't patience to stay on .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 35]: I stood it for exactly three hours , thinking of you in this garden , imagining walking about as we are walking now , and then -- I bolted for the afternoon train ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 17]: Claire felt her cheeks flame , and affected dignity to hide her deep , uncontrollable joy .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 24]: `` If _ I _ had been your hostess -- '' `` But you were n't , you see ... You were n't !
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 13]: For goodness ' sake do n't put yourself in her place next .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 16]: Be Claire Gifford for once , and say you are glad to see me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 13]: His eyes met hers and twinkled with humour as he added solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 24]: `` There 's not a single solitary convention that could possibly be broken by being civil to a man in his own home !
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 14]: Even your ultra sensitive conscience -- '' `` Never mind my sensitive conscience .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 12]: What I want to know is , how did you know ?
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 9]: Who told you that I was here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 30]: It was significant that the possibility that Mrs Fanshawe had written of her guest never occurred to Claire 's mind ; that Erskine like herself discounted such a possibility .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 22]: He replied with a matter-of-fact simplicity which left Claire marvelling at the obtuseness of mankind -- `` Janet , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 3]: Janet Willoughby .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 8]: We were staying in the same house .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 13]: We were talking of you yesterday morning , and comparing notes generally .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 7]: She said you were -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 18]: quite a number of agreeable things -- and I agreed with her , with just one exception .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 7]: She considered that you were responsive .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 11]: I said I had never found any one less so .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 12]: She said you were always so ready to meet her halfway .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 11]: I complained that you refused to meet me at all .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 36]: I ... er ... told her how I felt about it , and she said my chance was waiting if I choose to take it -- that you were staying here keeping the mater company .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 7]: So -- '' Claire said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 5]: She was thinking deeply .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 15]: For how many days had Janet been staying in the same house with Erskine ?
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 22]: Perhaps a week , certainly several days , yet it had been only yesterday morning that she had given the news .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 11]: Yesterday morning ; and in three hours he had flown !
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 13]: How was Janet faring now , while Claire was walking in fairyland ?
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 6]: `` You are not angry ?
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 7]: Why do you look so serious ?
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 11]: Tell me you are not sorry that I came ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 35]: said a deep voice close to her ear , but before she had time to answer , footsteps approached , and Mrs Fanshawe 's voice was heard calling in raised accents -- `` Erskine !
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 4]: are you there ?
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 12]: Give me your arm , dear ; I am so tired .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 16]: It 's such a perfect night , that it seemed a shame to stay indoors .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 11]: The Major has been admiring ` The Flowery Way . '
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 10]: It certainly looks its best to - night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 12]: She turned towards Major Humphreys with her light , cynical laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 20]: `` My son declares that it is profanation to allow ordinary , commonplace mortals to walk up those steps !
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 10]: He always escorts my visitors round by another way .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 28]: He is ungallant enough to say that he has never yet seen a girl whom he would care to watch walk up those steps in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 16]: She would have to be quite ideal in every respect to fit into the picture .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 25]: We 'll go round by the lily garden , Erskine , and then I think Miss Gifford and I will be off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 8]: You men will enjoy a smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 24]: For the next ten minutes Mrs Fanshawe kept tight hold of her son 's arm , and Claire talked assiduously to Major Humphreys .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 18]: She knew now why Erskine had asked her to walk ahead up `` The Flowery Way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 6]: ALL IN A GARDEN FAIR .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 13]: The next afternoon a party of friends had been bidden for tennis .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 31]: For the morning no plans had been made , but throughout its length Mrs Fanshawe fought a gallant fight against overwhelming odds , and was hopelessly beaten for her pains .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 21]: It was her strong determination that her son should be prevented from holding another _ tete-a-tete _ with Claire Gifford .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 50]: Erskine actively , and Claire passively , desired and intended to bring about just that very consummation , while Major Humphreys , shrewdly aware of the purpose for which he had been invited , aided and abetted their efforts by the development of a veritable frenzy of gardening enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 42]: He questioned , he disputed , he meekly acknowledged his mistakes ; he propounded schemes for fresh developments , the scenes of which lay invariably at the opposite end of the grounds from that in which the young people were ensconced .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 38]: Mrs Fanshawe struggled valiantly , but the Triple Entente won the day , and for a good two hours before lunch , Erskine and Claire remained happily lost to sight in the farthest recesses of the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 42]: They had left behind the region of formal seats and benches , and sat on the grass at the foot of a great chestnut , whose dark green foliage made a haven of shade in the midst of the noonday glare .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 18]: Claire wore her bargain frock , and felt thankful for the extravagant impulse of that January morn .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 71]: Erskine was in flannels , cool and becoming as a man 's _ neglige _ invariably is ; both had discarded hats , and sat bareheaded in the blessed shade , and Erskine asked questions , dozens of questions , a very _ viva voce _ examination , the subject being the life , history , thoughts , hopes , ambitions , and dreams of the girl by his side .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 7]: `` You were an only child .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 11]: So was I. Were you a lonely little kiddie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 10]: `` No , I do n't think I was .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 8]: My mother was a child with me .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 33]: We were blissfully happy manufacturing a doll 's house out of a packing chest , and furnishing it with beds made out of cardboard boxes , and sofas made out of pin-cushions .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 15]: I used to feel other children a bore because they distracted her attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 11]: `` That would be when you were -- how old ?
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 4]: Six or seven ?
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 9]: And you are now -- what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 2]: Twenty-two ?
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 17]: I must have been a schoolboy of seventeen at that time , imagining myself a man .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 11]: Ten years makes a lot of difference at that age .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 9]: It does n't count so much later on .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 7]: At least I should think not .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 9]: Do I appear to you very old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 4]: `` Hoary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 10]: `` No , but I say ... Honestly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 6]: `` Do n't be conceited .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 14]: You know perfectly well -- '' `` But I wanted to make sure !
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 7]: And then you went to school .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 14]: Did you have a bad time at first among the other girls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 13]: I 'm afraid the other girls had a bad time with me .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 15]: I was very uppish and British , and insisted on getting my own way .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 10]: Did _ you _ have a bad time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 11]: `` Yes , I did , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 25]: `` Small boys have a pretty stiff time of it during their first term , and my time happened to be stiffer than most .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 7]: I may be as miserable again .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 7]: I hope I never may be !
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 43]: But I 'm pretty sure it 's impossible to be _ more _ miserable than I was at nine years old , bullied on every side , breaking my heart with home sickness , and too proud to show a sign . ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 6]: `` Poor little lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 21]: sighed Claire softly , and for a long minute the two pairs of eyes met , and exchanged a message .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 4]: `` But afterwards ?
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 7]: It grew better after that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 35]: I learnt to stand up for myself , and moved up in the school , and began to bully on my own ... Did you make many real friends in your school days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 6]: `` No real lasting friends .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 27]: They were French girls , you see , and there was the difference of race , and religion , to divide us as we grew up .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 16]: And we were birds of passage , mother and I ; always moving about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 9]: `` You felt the need of companionship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 12]: I had mother , and we were like girls together . ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 9]: The twin dimples showed in a mischievous smile .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 13]: `` You seem very anxious to hear that I was lonely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 16]: said Erskine , and hesitated as though he found it impossible to deny the accusation .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 12]: `` I wanted to feel that you could sympathise with me !
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 38]: I 've been more or less lonely all my life , but I have always felt that a time would come when it would be all right -- when I 'd meet some one who 'd understand .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 47]: I was great chums with my father , but he died when I was twelve , and my school chum went off to China , and comes home for a few months every three years , when it has usually happened that I 've been abroad .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 48]: There are nice enough fellows in the regiment , but I suppose I 'm not quick at making friends -- '' Strive as she would Claire could not resist a twinkle of amusement , their eyes met , and both went off into a peal of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 9]: `` Oh , well , there are exceptions !
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 4]: That 's different .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 14]: I felt that I knew you at once , without any preliminary stages .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 12]: It must always be like that when people really fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 24]: And then after a short pause he added in boyish , ingenuous tones , `` Did you feel that you knew me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 9]: `` I -- I think I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 3]: Claire acknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 14]: To both it seemed the most wonderful , the most absorbing of conversations .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 24]: They were blissfully unconscious that it was old as the hills themselves , and had been repeated with ceaseless reiteration from prehistoric periods .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 17]: Only once was there an interruption of the deep mutual happiness and that came without warning .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 21]: Claire was smiling in blissful contentment , unconscious of a care , when suddenly a knife-like pain stabbed her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 8]: Imagination had wafted her back to Staff-Room .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 60]: She saw the faces of the fifteen women seated around the table , women who were with but one exception past their youth , approaching nearer and nearer to dreaded age , and an inward voice whispered that to each in her turn had come this golden hour , the hour of dreams , of sweet , illuminative hope .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 21]: The hour had come , and the hour had passed , leaving behind nothing but a memory and a regret .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 10]: Why should she herself be more blessed than others ?
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 53]: She looked forward and saw a vision of herself ten years hence still hurrying along the well-known street looking up at the clock in the church tower to assure herself that she was in time , still mounting the same bare staircase , still hanging up her hat on the same peg .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 36]: The prose of it in contradistinction with the poetry of the present was terrifying to Claire 's youthful mind , and her look was so white , so strained , that Erskine took instant alarm .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 4]: Are you ill ?
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 8]: Have I said anything to upset you ?
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 11]: I say , what _ is _ the matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 2]: Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 6]: I had a -- thought !
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 11]: Talk hard , please , and make me forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 30]: The end of the two hours found the cross-questioning still in full force ; the man and the girl alike still feeling that the half was not yet told .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 16]: They resented the quick passage of time , resented the disturbance of the afternoon hours .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 13]: `` What on earth do we want with a tennis party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 4]: grumbled the Captain .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 10]: `` Wish to goodness we could be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 15]: I suppose the mater wanted them to amuse you before I came back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 4]: Claire murmured incoherently .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 13]: She knew better , but she was not going to say so !
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 7]: They turned unwillingly towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 7]: In the afternoon the guests arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 59]: They came early , for the Fanshawe tennis courts were in fine condition , and the prospect of meeting a new man and a new girl , plus the son of the house , was a treat in itself in the quiet countryside where the members of the same set met regularly at every function of the year .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 45]: One of the courts was reserved for men 's fours , for Mrs Fanshawe believed in giving her guests what they liked , and there is no doubt that men as a rule are ungallant enough to prefer their own sex in outdoor games .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 33]: In the second court the younger girls took part in mixed fours , while others sat about , or took part in lengthy croquet contests on the furthest of the three lawns .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 39]: Claire as a member of the house-party had a good deal of time on her hands , and helped Mrs Fanshawe with the entertainment of the older guests , who one and all eyed her with speculative interest .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 30]: One thin , faded woman had spent a few years in Bombay and was roused to interest by hearing that Claire 's mother was now settled in that city .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 7]: she had met a Mr Judge .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 7]: Robert Judge , was it not ?
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 7]: Her husband knew him quite well .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 7]: He had dined at their house .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 5]: Quite a dear man .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 57]: She had heard of his marriage , `` but '' -- here came a look of mystification -- `` to a _ young _ wife ; very pretty , very charming -- '' Claire laughed , and held out a little coloured photograph in a round glass frame which hung by a chain round her neck .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 6]: `` That is my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 8]: She is thirty-nine , and looks thirty .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 8]: And she is prettier than that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 8]: The faded lady looked , and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 7]: Mrs Fanshawe brightened into vivid interest .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 8]: `` You know Mr Judge , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 5]: You have met him ?
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 5]: That 's quite interesting .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 6]: That 's very interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 28]: Claire realised with some irritability that the fact that one of her own acquaintances knew and approved , instantaneously raised Mr Judge in her hostess 's estimation .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 30]: Hitherto he had been a name , a nobody ; now he became a real man , `` quite a dear man , '' a man one could know !
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 14]: The result was satisfactory enough , but Claire was irritated by the means .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 48]: She was irritated also by the subtle but very real change in her hostess 's manner to herself in the last twenty-four hours ; irritated because the precious hours were passing , and Erskine was surrounded by his guests , playing endless sets on the hot lawn .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 43]: He looked as though he were enjoying himself , too , and that added to her annoyance , for like many another girl she had not yet realised that a man can forget even his love in his whole-hearted enjoyment of sport !
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 28]: At tea-time , however , there was a lull when Erskine carried a chair to Claire 's side , and seated himself with an air of contentment .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 23]: Once and again as the meal progressed she saw his eyes rove around , and then come back to dwell upon herself .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 36]: She knew that he was comparing her with the other girls who were present , knew also by the deep glow of that returning glance , that in his eyes she was fairest and best .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 10]: The former irritation dropped from her like a cloak .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 11]: Tea was over , the guests rose from their seats .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 15]: Erskine stood by Claire 's side looking down at her with a quizzical smile .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 23]: `` Er -- did you notice that man who came in just before tea , with the girl in the pink frock ?
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 11]: He was sitting over there , on the right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 7]: `` Yes , I noticed him .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 7]: I could see him quite well .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 9]: `` What did you think of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 4]: `` Quite nice .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 5]: I liked his face .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 5]: Good-natured and interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 3]: Erskine laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 4]: `` Sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 4]: `` Quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 8]: `` Do n't recognise him at all ?
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 11]: Does n't remind you of any one you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 5]: Why should he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 4]: Erskine laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 9]: `` I 'm afraid your memory is defective .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 7]: I must introduce you again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 23]: He walked away , laid his hand on the arm of the new-comer , and led him back to Claire 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 19]: `` Miss Gifford , '' he said gravely , `` allow me to introduce -- Major Carew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 3]: FOUND OUT .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 42]: The man with the good-natured , interesting face bowed to Claire with the alacrity which the normal man shows at an introduction to a pretty girl ; Claire stared blankly , recovered herself , and returned his bow in formal manner .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 11]: Erskine looked from one to the other in undisguised surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 18]: `` I thought you had met ... You told me you had met Carew in town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 9]: `` Not _ this _ Major Carew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 9]: Claire could not suppress a tone of regret .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 17]: With all her heart she wished that the man before her had been Cecil 's fiance .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 16]: `` It was the same name , but -- '' `` Not the same man ?
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 25]: It 's not an unusual name , I expect there are several of us knocking about , '' the present Major Carew said smilingly .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 10]: `` Do you happen to know his regiment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 20]: Claire knew it well , but as she pronounced the name , the hearer 's face crinkled in confusion .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 8]: `` But that is my own regiment !
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 8]: There _ is _ no other Carew !
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 5]: There 's some mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 8]: You have mixed up the names . ''
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 4]: `` Oh no .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 8]: I 've heard it a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 7]: It is impossible to be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 8]: His Christian name is Frank . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 8]: _ My _ name is Frank ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 13]: the strange man said , and stared at Claire in increasing perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 13]: `` There is certainly not another Frank Carew in the M -- .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 7]: There is something wrong about this .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 6]: I do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 17]: `` He is a member of the -- Club , and his people live in Surrey .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 52]: He has an old father who is an invalid , and the name of the house is ` The Moat ' -- '' Major Carew 's face turned a deep , apoplectic red , his light eyes seemed to protrude from his head , so violent was his anger and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 9]: `` But -- that 's _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 11]: That 's my club , my father , my home !
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 19]: Somebody has been taking my name , and passing himself off under false colours for some mysterious reason .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 14]: I ca n't imagine what good it is going to do him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 30]: He broke off in alarm , and cast an appealing look at Erskine as Claire suddenly collapsed on the nearest chair , her face as white as her gown .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 15]: `` I say , this is a bad business I 'm most awfully sorry .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 20]: I 'm afraid Miss Gifford is distressed -- '' Erskine 's lips were set in a fury of anger .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 23]: He glanced at Claire and turned hurriedly away , as though he could not trust himself to look at her blanched face .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 32]: To see the glint of his eye , the set of the firm jaw , was to realise that it would fare badly with the masquerader should he come within reach .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 27]: There was a moment of tense , unhappy silence , then Erskine drew forward two more chairs , and motioned to the Major to be seated .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 11]: `` I think we shall have to thresh this out !
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 18]: It is naturally a shock , but Miss Gifford 's acquaintance with this person is very slight .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 24]: She took a violent dislike to him at first sight , so you need not fear that she will feel any personal distress .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 8]: That is so , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 7]: That 's the real position ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 6]: Claire nodded a quick assent .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 38]: I met him twice , and I hated him from the first ; but my friend believes ... '' Her voice broke , and she struggled for composure , her chin quivering with pitiful , child-like distress .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 14]: `` He is engaged to be _ married _ to my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 11]: A deep murmur of anger came simultaneously from both hearers .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 12]: The real Major Carew straightened himself with an air of determination .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 5]: `` Engaged to her ?
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 4]: Under my name ?
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 5]: This is too strong !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 10]: And in the name of wonder , what for ?
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 4]: I 'm nobody .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 4]: I 've nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 13]: I 'm the most insignificant of fellows , and chronically hard up .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 11]: What had he to gain by taking my name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 11]: `` You are a gentleman , and he is not .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 4]: Everything is comparative .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 27]: He wanted to impress my friend , and he knew you so well that it was easy to pretend , and make up a good tale .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 9]: He _ said _ he was hard up .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 8]: He -- he -- borrowed money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 6]: `` From the girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 8]: Again came that deep murmur of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 25]: `` What an unspeakable cur , and -- excuse me , what a poor-spirited girl to have anything to do with him after that !
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 15]: Could you do nothing to prevent her making such a fool of herself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 3]: I tried .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 18]: I tried hard , but -- '' Erskine looked at her with his keen , level glance .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 11]: `` And she borrowed from you to supply his needs ?
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 17]: No , never mind , I wo n't ask any more questions , but I know !
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 4]: I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 12]: His eyes hardened again as he turned towards the other man .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 8]: `` Carew , this is pure swindling !
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 9]: We shall have to worry this out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 9]: `` I believe you , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 5]: said the Major tersely .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 21]: He turned to Claire and added more gently , `` Tell us some more about this fellow , Miss Gifford !
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 3]: Describe him !
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 10]: Would you recognise him if you met again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 3]: At once .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 17]: He is tall and dark , good-looking , I suppose , though I detest his type .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 4]: Very dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 4]: Large features . ''
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 12]: The Major ruminated , finding apparently no clue in the description .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 3]: `` Tall .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 2]: Dark .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 3]: Large features !
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 13]: I know about a hundred men to whom that description might apply .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 9]: Could you think of anything more definite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 24]: Claire ruminated in her turn ; recalled the image of Cecil 's lover , and tried to remember the details of his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 15]: `` He has very thick hair , and brushes it straight across his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 6]: His eyebrows are very short .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 11]: He has a high colour , quite red cheeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 19]: Major Carew made a short , choking sound ; lay back in his chair , and stared aghast .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 33]: This time it was evident that the description awoke a definite remembrance , but he appeared to thrust it from him , to find it difficult to give credence to the idea .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 4]: `` Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 5]: he murmured to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 3]: `` Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 9]: High colour , you say ; short eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 14]: When you say ` short , ' what exactly do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 13]: `` They begin by being very thick , then they stop abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 14]: They do n't follow the line of the eye , like most eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 6]: They look -- unfinished ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 7]: Major Carew bounced upon his chair .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 8]: `` Erskine , I have an idea .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 17]: -- It seems almost incredible , but I 'm bound to find if it is correct !
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 11]: There is a man who is in our camp now .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 25]: I 'll make an excuse , and send him over to-night , if you can arrange that Miss Gifford sees him when he comes .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 11]: I 'll give him a message for you . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 5]: _ Send _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 20]: repeated Erskine sharply ; then he glanced at Claire , and sent a frowning message towards the other man .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 7]: `` That can easily be arranged .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 9]: We 'll leave it till evening , then .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 17]: We ca n't get any further now , and I must get back to my duties .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 7]: The mater is scowling at me .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 23]: Go and soothe her like a good fellow , but for your life -- not a word of this to her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 25]: Major Carew rose obediently , perfectly aware that his company was not wanted , and Erskine bent towards Claire with a few earnest words .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 5]: `` Do n't worry !
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 17]: If this man is an impostor , the sooner it is found out , the better .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 30]: He _ is _ an impostor , there 's no getting away from that , and he is making a dupe of that poor girl for his own ends .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 33]: If we had not made this discovery , he would have stuck to her until he had bled her of her last penny , and then would probably have disappeared into space .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 34]: She knows nothing of his real name or position , so it would have been difficult to trace him , and probably nothing to be gained , if he _ were _ found .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 24]: One reads of these scoundrels from time to time , but I 've never had the misfortune to meet one in the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 14]: I 'd like to horsewhip the fellow for upsetting you like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 11]: `` Oh , what does it matter about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 4]: Claire cried impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 15]: `` It 's Cecil I 'm thinking about -- my poor , poor friend !
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 25]: She 's not young , and she is tired out after twelve years of teaching , and it 's the _ second _ time !
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 21]: Years ago a man pretended to love her , it was only pretence , and it nearly broke her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 9]: She has never been the same since then .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 8]: It made her bitter and distrustful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 4]: `` Poor creature !
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 3]: No wonder .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 17]: But that was some time ago , and now she is engaged to this other fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 12]: Is she in love with him , do you suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 4]: Claire shrugged vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 8]: `` I -- do n't -- know !
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 12]: She is in love with the idea of a home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 4]: `` And he ?
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 6]: You have seen them together .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 25]: He is a cur , there 's no getting away from that , but he might be attached to the girl all the same .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 7]: Do you think he is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 9]: `` Oh , how can I tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 4]: Claire cried impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 16]: `` She thinks he is , but she thought the same about the other man .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 8]: It does n't seem possible to tell !
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 54]: Men amuse themselves and pretend , and act a part , and then laugh at a girl if she is so foolish as to believe -- '' Captain Fanshawe bent forward , his arm resting on his knees , his face upraised to hers ; a very grave face , fixed and determined .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 8]: `` Do you believe that , Claire ?
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 9]: Do you believe what you are saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 12]: The grey eyes looked deep into hers , compelling an answer .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 16]: `` I -- I think many of them -- '' `` Some of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 4]: the Captain corrected .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 14]: `` Just as some girls encourage a man to gratify their own vanity .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 19]: They are the exceptions in both cases ; but you speak in generalities , condemning the whole sex .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 13]: Is it what you really think -- that most men pretend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 19]: The grey eyes were on her face , keen , compelling eyes from which there was no escape .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 5]: Claire flushed and hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 6]: No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 3]: Not most .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 6]: But there are some ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 11]: `` We are not concerned with ` some ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 14]: he said quietly , and straightening himself , he cast a glance around .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 45]: The guests were standing about in little groups , aimless , irresolute , waiting to be broken up into twos and fours , and drafted off to the empty lawns ; across the deserted tea-tables his mother 's eyes met his , coldly reproachful .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 9]: Erskine sighed , and rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 5]: `` I must go .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 6]: These people need looking after .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 6]: Do n't look so sad .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 9]: It hurts me to see you sad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 30]: Just those few , hastily-spoken words and he was gone , and Claire strolled off in an opposite direction , anxious to screen herself from observation among the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 21]: She ached with pity for Cecil , but through all her distresses the old confidence lay warm at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 30]: There was one man in the world who towered high above the possibility of deceit ; and between that man and herself was a bond stronger than spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 17]: The future seemed full of difficulties , but Claire did not trouble herself about the future .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 13]: The present was all-absorbing , full of trouble ; full of joy !
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 35]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ It was seven o'clock before the last of the guests had departed , and Mrs Fanshawe saw to it that her son was fully engaged until it was time to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 18]: Her keen eyes had noticed signs of agitation as the two young people sat together at tea .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 15]: And what had Erskine been talking about with that tense expression on his face ?
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 23]: And what had happened to the girl that she looked at one moment so radiant , and at the next so cast-down ?
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 19]: Mrs Fanshawe 's affections , like those of most selfish people , were largely influenced by personal considerations .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 49]: A week before she had felt quite a warm affection for the agreeable companion who had rescued her from the boredom of lonely days , now hour by hour , she was conscious of a rising irritation against the girl who threatened to interfere with her own plans .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 30]: The verdict of others confirmed her own suspicions as to Erskine 's danger , for during the afternoon half a dozen intimate friends referred to Claire with significant intonation .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 6]: `` Such a graceful creature .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 9]: No wonder Erskine is _ epris _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 9]: ... `` Miss Gifford is quite charming . ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 12]: ... '' _ So _ interested to meet Miss Gifford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 26]: Eyes and voice alike testified to the conviction that if an engagement were not already arranged , it was a certainty in the near future .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 21]: Mrs Fanshawe set her lips , and determined by hook or crook to get Claire Gifford out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 53]: That evening at nine o'clock the parlour-maid announced that Major Carew 's soldier servant wished to see Captain Fanshawe on a message from his master , and Erskine gave instructions that he should be sent round to the verandah , and stepped out of the window , leaving Claire wondering and discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 4]: What had happened ?
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 8]: Was the impostor not to be found ?
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 17]: In her present tension of mind any delay , even of the shortest , seemed unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 29]: The murmur of voices sounded from without , then Erskine stepped back into the room , and addressed himself pointedly to Claire , but without using her name .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 10]: `` Would you come out just for two minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 10]: It 's some plan for to - morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 51]: Claire crossed the room , acutely conscious of Mrs Fanshawe 's displeasure , stepped into the cool light of the verandah and beheld standing before her , large and trim in his soldier 's uniform , Cecil 's lover , the man who had masqueraded under his master 's name .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 27]: For one breathless moment the two stood face to face , staring , aghast , too petrified by surprise to be able to move or speak .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 33]: Claire caught hold of the nearest chair , and clutched at its back ; the florid colour died out of the man 's cheeks , his eyes glazed with horror and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 18]: Then with a rapid right-about-face , he leapt from the steps , and sped down the drive .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 19]: Another moment and he had disappeared , and the two who were left , faced each other aghast .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 4]: `` His servant !
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 5]: His _ servant _ !
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 7]: Oh , my poor Cecil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 4]: `` The scoundrel !
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 6]: It was a clever ruse .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 15]: No need to invent details : he had them all ready to his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 7]: The question is , what next ?
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 10]: The game is up , and he knows it .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 8]: What will be his next move ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 5]: Claire shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 6]: She was white and shaken .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 26]: The reality was even worse than she had expected , and the thought of Cecil 's bitterness of disillusion weighed on her like a nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 24]: She tried to speak , but her lips trembled and Erskine drew near with a quick word of consolation -- `` Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 8]: `` What is this plan , Erskine ?
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 7]: Am I not to be consulted ?
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 13]: Remember that you are engaged to lunch with the Montgomerys to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 14]: Mrs Fanshawe stood in the doorway , erect , haughty , obviously annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 16]: Her keen eyes rested on Claire 's face , demanding a reason for her embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 13]: Erskine made a virtue of necessity , and offered a short explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 9]: `` A disagreeable thing has happened , mother .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 15]: Miss Gifford has discovered through Major Carew that a friend is in serious trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 8]: It has been rather a shock . ''
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 4]: `` Dear me .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 4]: It would be .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 13]: Perhaps you would like to go to your room , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 14]: I 'm tired myself , and shall be glad to get to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 10]: I am sure you must wish to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 5]: Shall we go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 13]: Claire said good night to the two men and went wearily upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 12]: At this moment even her own inward happiness failed to console .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 14]: When contrasted with her own fate , Cecil 's seemed so cruelly unfair !
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 4]: `` NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 9]: Sleep refused to come to Claire that night .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 19]: She lay tossing on her bed while the old clock in the corridor without struck hour after hour .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 30]: Two , three , four , and still she tossed , and turned , and again and again asked herself the world-old question , `` What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 6]: What shall I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 16]: and shuddered at the thought of the disillusionment which was coming to her poor friend .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 9]: What was her own duty in the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 17]: Obviously Cecil must be told the truth ; obviously she was the one to tell it .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 9]: Would it be possible to _ write _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 9]: Inclination clamoured in favour of such a course .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 17]: It would be so much easier : it would obviate the necessity for a lacerating interview .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 10]: Would it not be easier for Cecil , also ?
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 41]: Claire felt that if positions had been reversed , she would crave above all things to be alone , hidden from the eyes of even the most sympathising of friends ; but Cecil 's nature was of a different type .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 27]: Having heard the one abhorrent fact , she would wish to probe further , to be told details , to ask a score of trifling questions .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 16]: However full a letter might be , she would not be satisfied without an interview .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 13]: `` But I might write first , and see her afterwards ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 6]: poor Claire said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 18]: `` It would not be quite so bad , when she had got over the first shock .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 64]: I could _ not _ bear to see her face ... '' It was five o'clock before at last sleep came to drive away the haunting questions , and when she woke it was to find her early tea had grown cold on the table by her side , and to see on looking at her watch that it was nearly ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 22]: She dressed hurriedly and went downstairs to find Mrs Fanshawe alone in the dining-room , reading the _ Morning Post _ .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 15]: She waved aside Claire 's apologies for her late appearance with easy good nature .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 12]: No one was _ expected _ to be punctual at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 16]: It was sheer tyranny to decree that visitors should get up at a definite hour .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 23]: If Claire had slept badly , why did n't she order breakfast in her room , and spend the morning in bed ?
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 7]: `` You look a wreck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 14]: she said frankly , and threw down the paper with an impatient gesture .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 9]: `` Such a nuisance about this bad news .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 8]: Erskine seems disgusted with the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 23]: He has gone off with Major Carew to see what can be done , and is to go straight to the Willoughbys .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 16]: So tiresome , for I particularly wanted him to be in good form this afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 6]: What 's it all about ?
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 17]: As it has happened in my house , I think I am entitled to an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 9]: Something to do with Major Carew 's servant ?
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 10]: How can your friend be associated with a servant ?
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 8]: The man has bolted , it appears .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 17]: The Major came over half an hour ago to say that he never returned last night .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 28]: Thought flight the best policy , I suppose , but what I am waiting to be told , is -- what has he _ done _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 16]: Claire sat down on the nearest chair , feeling more of a wreck than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 3]: `` Deserted !
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 3]: A soldier !
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 6]: But if he is found ?
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 36]: The punishment ... '' `` He has already been found out , it appears , so that it was a choice between certain punishment if he stayed , or the chance of getting safely away .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 12]: I am waiting to hear what it 's all about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 11]: `` Oh , Mrs Fanshawe , it 's so difficult .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 7]: It 's not my secret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 5]: cried poor Claire desperately .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 15]: `` He , this man , has been masquerading under his master 's name .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 8]: My friend knew him as Major Carew .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 9]: She , they , became very intimate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 6]: `` Engaged , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 9]: It does n't say much for her discrimination .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 13]: Her ideas of what constitute a gentleman must be somewhat vague ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 5]: Mrs Fanshawe said disagreeably .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 20]: She felt disagreeable , and she never made any effort to conceal her feelings , kindly or the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 40]: It was annoying that one of her own guests should be mixed up in an unsavoury scandal with a common soldier : annoying to have people going about with long faces , when she had planned a festive week .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 13]: Really this Claire Gifford was becoming more and more of an incumbrance !
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 35]: Mrs Fanshawe paused with her hand on the coffee-pot , to ask a pointed question -- `` Have _ you _ also known this man under his false name , may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 4]: Claire flushed uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 6]: `` I met him twice .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 3]: Only twice .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 7]: For a very short time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 21]: Mrs Fanshawe did not speak , but she arched her eyebrows in a fashion which was more scorching than words .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 15]: `` So you , also , are ignorant of what constitutes a gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 4]: said those eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 15]: `` You also have been including my friend 's servant among your acquaintances ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 34]: Claire felt the hopelessness of trying to justify herself , and relapsed into silence also , the while she made a pretence of eating one of the most miserable meals of her life .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 16]: According to his mother , Erskine was `` quite disgusted '' with the whole affair !
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 26]: Claire 's heart sank at the thought , but she acknowledged that such an attitude would be no more than was natural under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 30]: A soldier himself , Captain Fanshawe would be a stern judge of a soldier 's fraud , while his _ amour propre _ could not fail to be touched .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 38]: Claire had too much faith to believe that his displeasure would be extended to herself , yet she was miserably aware that it was through her instrumentality that he had been brought in contact with the scandal .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 29]: In the midst of much confusion of mind only one thing seemed certain , and that was that it was impossible to face a tennis party that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 22]: Claire made her apologies to Mrs Fanshawe as she rose from the table , and they were accepted with disconcerting readiness .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 4]: `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 7]: I never imagined that you would .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 9]: Under the circumstances it would be most awkward .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 14]: I expect by afternoon the story will be the talk of the place .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 16]: Your friend , I understand , is still ignorant of the man 's real station ?
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 14]: What do you propose to do with regard to breaking the news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 3]: `` In .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 6]: I 'm going to write .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 13]: I thought I would sit in my room and compose a letter .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 7]: -- It will be difficult ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 4]: `` Difficult ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 9]: Mrs Fanshawe repeated the word with disagreeable emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 12]: `` Impossible , I should say , and , excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 5]: cruel into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 26]: To open a letter from a friend , expecting to find the ordinary chit-chat , and to receive a blow that shatters one 's life !
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 7]: My dear , it 's unthinkable !
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 8]: You can not seriously intend it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 16]: `` You think it would be better if I _ told _ , her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 4]: Claire asked anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 25]: `` I wondered myself , but naturally I dreaded it , and I thought she might prefer to get over the first shock alone .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 13]: I had decided to write first , and see her later on .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 19]: But you think ... '' `` I think decidedly that you ought to break the news in person .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 11]: You can lead up to it more naturally in words .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 28]: Even the most carefully written letters are apt to read coldly ; perhaps the more care we spend on them , the more coldly they read . ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 23]: `` Yes , that 's true , that 's quite true , but I thought it would be better not to wait .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 8]: She is staying at home just now .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 67]: I do n't think he will visit her there , for he seemed to shrink from meeting her mother , but he may write and try -- '' Claire drew herself up on the point of betraying that borrowing of money which was the most shameful feature of the fraud , but Mrs Fanshawe was too much absorbed in her own schemes to notice the omission .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 23]: She had seen a way of getting rid of an unwelcome guest , and was all keenness to turn it to account .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 16]: `` He is sure to try to see her again while he is at large .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 11]: He will probably urge her to marry him at once .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 16]: You should certainly not defer your visit if it is to be of any use .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 18]: How dreadful _ it _ would be if she were to marry him under an assumed name !
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 13]: You must n't let us interfere with your arrangement , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 54]: You only promised me ten days , so I ca n't grumble if you run away , and for the short time that Erskine is at home , there are so many friends to fit in ... You understand , I am sure , that I am thinking of your own convenience ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 9]: `` I understand perfectly , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 18]: Claire replied , her head in the air , the indignant colour dying her cheeks with red .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 23]: Mrs Fanshawe 's arguments in favour of haste might be wise enough , but her personal desire was all too plainly betrayed .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 36]: And she pointedly ignored the fact that the proposed interview need not have interrupted Claire 's visit , since it and the journey involved could easily have been accomplished in the course of a day .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 8]: `` I understand perfectly , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 8]: I will go upstairs and pack now .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 12]: Perhaps there is a train I could catch before lunch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 4]: `` The twelve-thirty .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 9]: That will give you the afternoon in town .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 9]: I 'll order a fly from the inn .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 11]: I 'm _ so _ sorry for you , dear !
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 21]: Most nerve - racking to have to break bad news , but you 'll feel happier when it 's done .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 16]: Perhaps you could take the poor thing with you to that sweet little farm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 17]: Not for the world would Claire have spent the next hour in Mrs Fanshawe 's company .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 39]: She hurried to her room , and placing her watch on the dressing-table , so timed her packing that it should not be completed a moment before the lumbering country `` fly '' drove up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 27]: Then , fully dressed , she descended the staircase , and held out a gloved hand to her hostess , apparently unconscious of an offered kiss .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 37]: It was some slight consolation to note the change of bearing which had come over Mrs Fanshawe during the last hour , and to realise that the success of her scheme had not brought much satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 14]: She was nervous , she was more than nervous , she was afraid !
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 30]: The while Claire had been packing upstairs , she had had time to realise Erskine 's return , and his reception of the news she would have to break .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 31]: As she drove away from the door , Claire realised that her hostess would have paid a large sum down to have been able to undo that morning 's work !
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 29]: For her own part , Claire cared nothing either way : literally and truthfully at that moment even the thought of leaving Erskine had no power to wound .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 17]: The quickly-following events of the last twenty-four hours had had a numbing effect on her brain .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 19]: She was miserable , sore , and wounded ; the whole fabric of life seemed tumbling to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 10]: Love , for the moment , was in abeyance .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 44]: As the fly passed the last yard of mown grass which marked the boundary of the Fanshawe property , she threw out her arms with one of the expressive gestures , which remained with her as a result of her foreign training . ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 5]: _ Fini _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 4]: she cried aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 21]: Mentally at that moment , she swept the Fanshawes , mother and son , from the stage of her life .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 6]: Where should she go next ?
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 9]: Back to solitude , and the saffron parlour ?
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 30]: London in August held no attraction , but the solitary prospect of being able to see Sophie , and at the moment Claire shrank from Sophie 's sharp eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 31]: Should she telegraph to the farm , and ask how soon she could be received ; and at the same time telegraph to Mary Rhodes asking for an immediate interview ?
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 31]: A few minutes ' reflection brought a decision in favour of this plan , and she drew a pocket-book from her dressing-bag , and busied herself in composing the messages .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 29]: One to the farm , a second to Laburnum Crescent announcing her immediate return , then came a pause , to consider the difficult wording of the third .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 29]: Would it be possible to drop a word of warning , intelligible to Cecil herself , but meaningless to anyone else who might by chance open the wire ?
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 5]: `` Back in town .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 4]: Have important news .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 9]: Imperative to see you to-day , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 3]: Appoint meeting .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 4]: Delay dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 44]: It was not perfect , but in Claire 's dazed condition it was the best she could concoct , and it left a tactful uncertainty as to whether the news affected herself or Cecil , which would make it the easier to explain .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 25]: Claire counted the words and folded the three messages in her hand-bag , ready to be sent off the moment she reached the station .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 59]: The fly lumbered on ; up a toilsome hill , down into the valley , up another hill on the farther side ; then came a scattering of houses , a church , a narrow street lined with shops , and finally the station itself , the clock over the entrance showing a bare four minutes to spare .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 13]: The porter labelled the luggage , and trundled it down the platform .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 25]: Claire hurried through her business in the telegraph office , and ran after him just as the train slowed down on the departure platform .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 31]: One carriage showed two empty corner places on the nearest side , Claire opened the door , seated herself facing the engine , and spread her impedimenta on the cushions .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 44]: But few passengers had been waiting , for this was one of the slowest trains in the day , but now at this last moment there came the sound of running footsteps , a man 's footsteps , echoing in strong heavy beats .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 35]: With a traveller 's instinctive curiosity Claire leant forward to watch the movements of this late comer , and putting her head out of the window came face to face with Erskine Fanshawe himself .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 46]: At sight of her he stopped short , at sight of him she stood up , blocking the window from sight of the other occupants of the carriage ; by a certain defiance of pose , appearing to defend it also against his own entrance .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 8]: But he did not attempt to enter .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 23]: Though he had been running , it was his pallor , not his heat , which struck Claire in that first moment .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 21]: He was white , with the pallor of intense anger ; the flash of his eyes was like cold steel .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 18]: He rested his hands on the sill of the window , and looked up into her face .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 9]: `` This is my mother 's doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 15]: It was a statement , not a question , and Claire made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 20]: She stood stiff and silent , while down the length of the platform sounded the quick banging of doors .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 14]: `` I got through sooner than I expected and went home to change .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 15]: I did not waste time in talking ... I could guess what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 11]: She made it impossible for you to stay on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 3]: Still silence .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 7]: The guard 's whistle sounded shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 6]: Erskine came a step nearer .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 9]: His white tense face almost touched her own .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 4]: `` Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 11]: he whispered breathlessly , `` will you marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 5]: `` Stand back there !
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 4]: Stand back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 5]: cried an authoritative voice .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 9]: The wheels of the carriage rolled slowly forward .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 17]: Claire bent forward , and gave her answer in one incisive word -- `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 20]: The wheels rolled faster and faster : left the station , whirled out into the green , smiling plain .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 3]: A RUPTURE .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 29]: In after days Claire often looked back upon that journey to London , and tried to recall her own feelings , but invariably the effort ended in failure .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 34]: She could remember nothing but a haze of general misery and confusion , which deepened with every fresh mile , and reached its acutest point at the moment of arriving `` home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 23]: The landlady was flustered at having to prepare for so hasty a return , and did not scruple to show her displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 22]: She took for granted that Claire had had lunch , and the poor girl had not the courage to undeceive her .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 17]: A telegram was lying on the dining-room table which announced Cecil 's arrival at four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 34]: Claire ordered tea to be ready at that hour , and stretched herself on her bed in the room upstairs which looked so bare and cold , denuded of the beautifying personal touches .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 44]: She felt incredibly tired , incredibly lonely ; she longed with a very passion of longing for some one of her own , for the dear , beautiful mother , who if she did not always understand , was always ready to love .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 15]: Oh , it was hard , unnatural work , this fighting the world alone !
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 33]: Did the girls who grew weary of the restraints of home , ever realise how their working sisters sickened with longing for some one who cared enough even to _ interfere _ !
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 11]: Three o'clock , half-past three , a quarter to four .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 37]: Claire was faint for want of food , and had enough sense to realise that this was a poor preparation for the ordeal ahead ; she went downstairs , and threw herself upon Lizzie 's mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 9]: `` Lizzie , I have had no lunch .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 4]: I 'm starving .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 22]: Could you bring up the tea _ now _ , and make some fresh for Miss Rhodes when she arrives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 10]: `` Why could n't you say so before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 21]: Lizzie asked with the freedom of the lodging-house slavey , but the question was spoken in sympathy rather than anger .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 15]: `` The kettle 's boiling , and I 've cut the bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 9]: You shall have it in two two 's .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 27]: I 'll cut you a sanguidge , '' she cried as a supreme proof of goodwill , and clattered down the kitchen stairs at express speed .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 8]: She was as good as her word .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 22]: In five minutes tea was ready , and Claire ate and drank , keeping her eyes turned resolutely from the clock .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 32]: Before it had struck the hour , there came from the hall the sound of a well-known double knock , and she knew that the hour of her ordeal had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 34]: She did not rise from the table ; the tea-things were clattering with the trembling of the hand that was resting upon the tray , she literally had not the strength to rise .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 14]: She lay back in her chair and stared helplessly at the opening door .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 4]: Cecil came in .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 22]: It came as a shock to see her looking so natural , so entirely the Cecil Claire was accustomed to see .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 12]: She looked tired , and a trifle cross , but alas !
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 16]: these had been prevailing expressions even in the days when things were going comparatively well .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 32]: Casual in her own manner , she saw nothing unusual in Claire 's lack of welcome , she nodded an off-hand greeting , and drew up a chair to the table .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 4]: I 've come .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 10]: Give me a cup of tea as a start .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 8]: I 've had a rush for it .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 23]: You said to-day , if possible , and I had nothing special on hand , so I thought I had better come .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 11]: What 's the news , and what 's the danger ?
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 13]: Which of us does it affect , -- me or you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 12]: `` Oh , it 's -- horrid , horrid , horrid !
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 6]: It 's a long story .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 11]: Finish your tea first , then I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 8]: I 'm _ so _ miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 6]: `` Poor old girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 12]: Cecil said kindly , and helped herself to bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 29]: Claire had a miserable conviction that her reply had had a deceptive effect , and that the shock when it came , would be all the more severe .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 29]: Nevertheless , she was thankful for the reprieve ; thankful to see Cecil eat sandwiches with honest enjoyment , until the last one had disappeared from the plate .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 14]: Cecil pushed aside her cup , and rested an arm on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 7]: `` Let 's get to business .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 12]: I promised mother I 'd catch the six o'clock train back .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 6]: What 's it all about ?
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 14]: Some young squire wanting to marry you , and you want my advice ?
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 6]: Take him , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 10]: You wo n't always be young and beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 5]: Claire shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 5]: `` Nothing about me .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 45]: I would n't have worried you in the holidays , if -- if it had n't been for your own sake ... '' The red flowed into Cecil 's cheeks , her face hardened , the tone of her voice was icy cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 5]: _ My _ sake ?
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 5]: I do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 14]: I am not aware that you have any responsibility about my affairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 6]: `` Cecil , I have !
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 4]: I must have .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 5]: We have lived together .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 16]: I have loved you -- '' Mary Rhodes waved aside the protestations with impatient scorn .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 8]: `` Do n't be sentimental , please !
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 8]: You are not one of the girls .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 22]: If it 's the money , and you are in a hurry to be repaid -- '' `` I 'm not .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 4]: I 'm not !
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 32]: I do n't care if you _ never _ pay ... '' Tears of distress rose in Claire 's eyes , she caught her breath and cried in a choking sob .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 9]: `` Cecil , it 's about -- him !
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 6]: I 've found out something .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 23]: I 've seen him ... Only last night ... '' `` I thought you might meet as his camp was so near .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 4]: Suppose you did !
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 9]: What was so terribly alarming in that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 6]: `` You have n't heard ?
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 17]: He has n't been to see you , or written , or wired , to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 5]: `` He has not .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 4]: Why should he ?
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 7]: Do n't be hysterical , Claire .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 15]: If you have anything to say , say it , and let me hear .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 12]: What have you ` found out ' about Major Carew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 11]: `` He 's -- _ not _ Major Carew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 4]: Claire cried desperately .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 24]: `` He has deceived you , Cecil , and pretended to be ... to be something quite different from what he really is .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 44]: There _ is _ a real Major Carew , and his name is Frank , and he has a home in Surrey , and an invalid father -- everything that he told you was true , only -- he is not the man !
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 10]: Oh , Cecil , how shall I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 8]: It 's so dreadfully , dreadfully hard .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 41]: He knew all about the real Major Carew , and could get hold of photographs to show you , because he -- he is his servant , Cecil -- his soldier servant ... He was with him in camp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 22]: Cecil rose from her chair , and went over to the empty fireplace , standing with her back to her companion .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 14]: She spoke no word , and Claire struggled on painfully with her explanations .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 20]: `` He -- the real Major Carew -- came over to a tennis party at Mrs Fanshawe 's yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 63]: I thought , of course , that it was another man of the same name , but he said -- he said there was no other in that regiment , and he asked me to tell him some more , and I did , and everything I said amazed him more and more , for it was true about _ himself _ !
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 30]: Then he asked me to describe -- the man , and he made an excuse to send his servant over in the evening so that I should see him .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 3]: He came .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 4]: Oh , Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 10]: He saw me , and he -- ran away !
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 7]: He had not returned this morning .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 7]: He has _ deserted _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 3]: Still silence .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 28]: It seemed to Claire of most pitiful import that Cecil made no disclaimer , that at the word of a stranger she accepted her lover 's guilt .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 19]: What a light on the past was cast by that stoney silence , unbroken by a solitary protest .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 34]: Poor Mary Rhodes had known no doubts as to the man 's identity , she had given him affection and help , but respect and trust could never have entered into the contract !
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 22]: Claire had said her say : she leant her elbows on the table , and buried her head in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 13]: The clock on the mantelpiece ticked steadily for an endless five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 25]: Then Cecil spoke : -- `` I suppose , '' she said harshly , `` you expect me to be grateful for this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 10]: The sound of her voice was like a blow .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 8]: Claire looked up , startled , protesting .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 12]: `` Oh , Cecil , surely you would rather know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 5]: `` Should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 4]: Cecil asked slowly .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 5]: `` Should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 45]: She turned back to the tireless grate , and her thoughts sped ... With her eyes opened she would not , of course , consent to marry this man who had so meanly abused her trust , but -- suppose she had not known !
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 9]: Suppose in ignorance the marriage had taken place ?
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 22]: If he had been loving , if he had been kind , would she in after days have regretted the step ?
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 19]: At the bottom of her weary woman 's heart , Cecil answered that she would _ not _ .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 22]: The fraud was unpardonable , yet she could have pardoned it , if it had been done for love of herself .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 36]: No stately Surrey mansion would have been her home , but a cottage of three or four rooms , but it would have been her _ own _ cottage , her _ own _ home .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 12]: She would have felt pride in keeping it clean and bright .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 24]: There would have been some one to work for : some one to care : some one to whom she _ mattered _ .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 45]: And suddenly there came the thought of another joy that might have been ; she held to her breast a child that was no paid charge , but her very own , bone of her bone , flesh of her flesh ... `` No !
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 10]: she cried harshly , `` I am not grateful .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 8]: _ Why _ did you tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 6]: Why did you spoil it ?
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 8]: What do I care who he was ?
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 9]: He was my man ; he wanted me .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 26]: He told lies _ because _ he wanted me ... I am getting old , and I 'm tired and cross , but he cared .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 29]: -- He _ did _ care , and he looked up to me , and wanted to appear my equal ... Oh , I 'm not excusing him .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 7]: I know all you would say .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 36]: He deceived me -- he borrowed money that he could never pay back , but he would have confessed some day , he would have had to confess , and I should have forgiven him .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 29]: I 'd have forgiven him anything , _ because _ he cared ... and after that -- he would have cared more -- I should have had him .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 20]: I should have had my home ... '' Claire hid her face , and groaned in misery of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 55]: From her own point of view it seemed impossible that any woman should regret a man who had proved so unworthy , but once again she reminded herself that her own working life counted only one year , as against Cecil 's twelve ; once again she felt she had no right to judge .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 24]: Presently she became aware that Cecil was moving about the room , opening the bureau , and taking papers out of a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 20]: At the end of ten minutes she came back to the table , and began drawing on her gloves .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 17]: Her face was set and tearless , but the lines had deepened into a new distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 19]: Claire had a pitiful realisation that this was how Cecil would look when she was _ old _ .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 13]: `` Well , '' she said curtly , `` that 's finished !
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 9]: I may as well go for my train .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 17]: I 'm sorry to appear ungracious , but you could hardly expect me to be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 15]: You meant well , of course , but it 's a pity to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 22]: There 's just one thing I 'd like to make clear -- you and I can hardly live together after this .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 17]: I never was a very agreeable companion , and I shall be worse in the future .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 34]: It would be better for your own sake to make a fresh start , and for myself -- I 'm sorry to appear brutal , but I could not stand another winter together .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 20]: It would remind me too much ... '' She broke off abruptly , and Claire burst into helpless tears .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 19]: `` Oh , Cecil , Cecil ... do n't hate me -- do n't blame me too much !
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 9]: It 's been hard on me , too .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 11]: Do you think I _ liked _ breaking such news ?
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 8]: Of course I will take fresh rooms .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 19]: I can understand that you 'd rather have some one else , but let us still be friends !
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 7]: Do n't turn against me altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 14]: I 'm lonely , too ... I 've got my own trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 6]: `` Poor little Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 19]: Cecil melted at once , with the quick response which always rewarded an appeal to her better feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 5]: `` Poor little Claire .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 12]: You 're a good child ; you 've done your best .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 9]: It is n't _ your _ fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 27]: She lifted her bag from the table , and took a step towards the door , then resolutely turned back , and held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 3]: `` Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 4]: Do n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 7]: What 's the good of crying ?
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 15]: Good luck to you , my dear , and -- take warning by me .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 21]: I do n't know what your trouble is , but as it is n't money , it 's probably love .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 11]: -- If it is , do n't play the fool .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 24]: If the chance of happiness comes along , do n't throw it away out of pride , or obstinacy , or foolish prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 7]: You wo n't always be young .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 31]: When you get past thirty , it 's ... it 's hard ... when there 's nothing -- '' She broke off again , and walked swiftly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 9]: The next moment the front door banged loudly .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 4]: Cecil had gone .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 4]: A SUDDEN RESOLVE .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 30]: The next morning brought a letter from the farm bidding Claire welcome as soon as she chose to arrive , but there was no second letter on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 37]: Claire had not realised how confidently she had expected its presence , until her heart sank with a sick , heavy faintness as she lifted the one envelope , and looked in vain for a second .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 5]: Erskine had not written .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 20]: Did that mean that he had taken her hasty answer as final , and would make no further appeal ?
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 53]: She had read of men who had boasted haughtily that no girl should have an opportunity of refusing them _ twice _ ; that the woman who did not know her own mind was no wife for them , but like every other lover she felt her own case to be unique .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 17]: Driven to answer in a moment of intolerable irritation , what else could she have said ?
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 6]: But he had not written !
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 5]: What did that mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 25]: At the moment of discovering her departure , Erskine had been consumed with anger , but afterwards , had his mother 's counsels prevailed ?
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 9]: Had he repented himself of his hasty impulse ?
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 24]: Would the days pass on , and the months , and the years , and leave her like Cecil , solitary , apart ?
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 42]: Claire made a pretence at eating her breakfast , and then , too restless to stay indoors , put on her hat , and went out to roam the streets until it should be time to visit Sophie in her hospital .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 22]: Two hours later she returned and packed up not only her entire wardrobe , but the whole of her personal possessions .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 27]: In the course of her walk there had come to her one of those curious contradictory impulses which are so characteristic of a woman 's nature .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 39]: Having poured out her heart in grief because Erskine had neither written nor followed her to town , she was now restlessly impatient to make communication impossible , and to bury herself where she could not be found .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 51]: Before leaving the house she made Lizzie happy by a present of money , accompanied by quite a goodly bundle of clothing , after which she interviewed the landlady , gave notice that she no longer needed the rooms , and wrote out a cheque in payment of all claims .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 24]: Then a taxi was summoned , the various boxes piled on top , and another chapter of life had come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 39]: Claire drove to the station , whence she proposed to take a late afternoon train to the farm , deposited her boxes in the left luggage office , and strolled listlessly towards the great bookstall under the clock .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 35]: Another hour remained to be whiled away before she could start for the hospital ; she would buy a book , sit in the waiting-room , and try to bury herself in its pages .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 42]: She strolled slowly down the length of the stall , her eyes passing listlessly from one pile of books to another , finding little interest in them , and even less in the men and women who stood by her side .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 27]: As Mrs Fanshawe would have said , `` No one was in town '' ; even school-mistresses had flown from the region of bricks and mortar .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 39]: If she had thought about it at all , Claire would have said that there was no one she _ could _ meet , but suddenly a hand grasped her arm , and brought her to a halt .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 17]: She started violently , and for an instant her heart leapt with a wild glad hope .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 49]: It was not Erskine Fanshawe who confronted her , however , but a girl clad in a tweed costume with a cloth cap to match , on the side of which a sprig of heather was fastened by a gold brooch fashioned in the shape of a thistle .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 33]: In bewildered surprise Claire recognised the brown eyes and round freckled face of Janet Willoughby , whom she had believed to be hundreds of miles away , in the highlands of Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 9]: `` Just come back , '' Janet explained .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 6]: `` The weather was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 6]: Nothing but sheets of rain .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 16]: I got tired , and came back to pay some visits in the south . ''
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 9]: She hesitated , then asked a sudden question .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 5]: `` Are you busy ?
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 5]: Going anywhere at once ?
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 7]: Could you spare half an hour ?
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 11]: We might have lunch together in the refreshment room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 5]: I 'd like to .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 7]: I 've had no lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 27]: Claire faltered nervously , whereupon Janet turned to her maid , who was standing near , dressing-bag in hand , and gave a few quick instructions .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 14]: `` Get a taxi , Ross , and take all the things home .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 7]: The car can wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 6]: I 'll follow later . ''
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 16]: The maid disappeared , and the two girls made their way across the open space .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 27]: Both looked nervous and ill at ease , both dreaded the coming _ tete-a-tete _ , yet felt that it was a thing to be faced .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 37]: Janet led the way to a table in the farthest corner of the room , and they talked trivialities until the ordered dishes were set on the table , and the waiter had taken his departure .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 21]: Claire had ordered coffee , and drank eagerly , hoping that the physical refreshment would help to steady her nerves .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 24]: Janet played with her knife and fork , and said , without looking up -- `` You have left the Fanshawes , then !
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 9]: I heard that you were staying on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 7]: Yesterday I -- came back . ''
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 10]: The very lameness of the answer made it significant .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 8]: Janet 's freckled face turned noticeably pale .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 11]: `` Erskine went straight home after he left Scotland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 14]: `` And before he arrived , you had promised to stay on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 26]: `` Mrs Fanshawe asked me , before he came , if I could stay for another week , and I was very glad to accept .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 7]: I had no other engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 5]: `` And then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 8]: `` Oh , then things were different .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 13]: She did n't need company , and -- and -- things happened .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 23]: My friend , Miss Rhodes -- '' Janet waved aside `` my friend , Miss Rhodes , '' with an impatient hand .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 4]: `` And Erskine ?
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 11]: What did _ he _ say to your leaving ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 63]: The colour flamed in Claire 's cheek ; she stammered in hopeless confusion , and , in the midst of her stammering , Janet laid both hands on the table , and , leaning forward so that the two faces were only a few inches apart , spoke a few startling words -- `` Has he -- _ proposed _ to you ?
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 4]: I must know !
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 6]: You must tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 21]: It was a command , rather than an appeal , and Claire automatically replied -- `` He -- he did !
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 10]: Yes , but -- '' `` And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 6]: `` I -- could n't .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 5]: I said no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 5]: `` You said no !
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 15]: Erskine asked you to be his wife , and you _ refused _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 6]: Janet stared in incredulous bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 10]: A spark of indignation shone in her brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 4]: `` But why ?
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 5]: You care for him .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 10]: Any girl might be proud to marry Erskine Fanshawe .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 5]: _ Why _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 7]: `` I ca n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 5]: It 's so difficult .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 9]: His mother -- she did n't want me .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 6]: She would have hated it .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 7]: She almost turned me out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 6]: `` His _ mother _ !
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 4]: Mrs Fanshawe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 10]: Janet 's voice was full of an ineffable surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 11]: `` You refused Erskine because of _ her _ prejudice ?
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 19]: But she is always changing ; she is the most undependable woman on the face of the earth !
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 24]: She is charming , and I 'm fond of her , but I should not take her advice about a pair of gloves .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 15]: Nothing that she could say would possibly have the slightest influence on my life .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 12]: She 's irresponsible ; she sees entirely from her own standpoint .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 9]: And Erskine -- Erskine is a rock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 24]: She paused , pressing her lips together to still their trembling , and Claire answered with a note of apology in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 8]: `` Janet , I _ know _ !
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 9]: Do n't think I do n't appreciate him .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 29]: Wait till you hear how it happened ... He followed me to the station ; it was the very last moment , just as the train was starting .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 17]: There was time for only one word , and -- I was sore and angry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 11]: Janet looked at her , a long , searching look .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 13]: `` It 's curious , but I always knew this would come .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 16]: When I saw you sitting together at supper that first night , I knew then .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 24]: All the time I knew it in my heart , but on the surface it seemed ridiculous , for you never met ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 15]: `` Never that you did not know , except one time in the park .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 14]: There was nothing to tell you , Janet ; nothing to hide . ''
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 4]: So he said .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 28]: We talked of you in Scotland , you know , and it was just as I thought -- a case of recognising each other at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 25]: He said the moment he saw you you seemed different from everyone else , and he hoped and believed that you felt the same .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 28]: That is how people ought to love ; the right way , when both are attached , both feel the same ... And it is so rare .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 7]: Yet you _ refused _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 12]: `` Would you marry a man if his family disapproved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 8]: I should not be marrying the family .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 30]: I 'd be sorry , of course , but I 'd make up my mind that in time I 'd make them fall in love with me , too .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 9]: What are you going to do now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 4]: `` Going away .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 4]: Into the country .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 10]: I want to be quiet , and think . ''
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 7]: Janet did not ask the address .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 25]: She sat silent , staring into space , then asked a sudden irrelevant question : `` Did he send you the cuckoo clock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 6]: `` I -- think so !
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 15]: It had no name , but it came from Switzerland while he was there .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 9]: He has never referred to it since . ''
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 7]: Janet began pulling on her gloves .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 7]: `` I knew that , too .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 10]: I _ felt _ that he had sent it .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 4]: I must go .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 16]: It will all come right , of course , and you will be very happy .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 17]: I 've known Erskine so long , and his wife is sure to be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 7]: Janet forced an artificial little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 21]: `` You will be engaged before me , after all , but I dare say I shall soon follow suit .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 7]: It 's nice to be loved .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 10]: As one grows older , one appreciates it more .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 9]: And Captain Humphreys is a good man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 5]: `` He is splendid !
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 5]: I loved his face .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 8]: And he is so devoted to you .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 23]: It was quite beautiful to watch him , '' cried Claire , thankful from her heart to be able to enthuse honestly .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 16]: A load was lifted from her heart by Janet 's prophecy of her own future .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 57]: For the moment it had no doubt been made more out of bravado than any real conviction , and inevitably there must be a period of suffering , but Janet was of a naturally buoyant nature , and her wounded spirit would gradually find consolation in the love which had waited so patiently for its reward .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 20]: It needed no great gift of prophecy to see her in the future , a happy , contented wife .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 4]: EASIER TO DIE .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 23]: When Janet had taken her departure Claire looked at the clock and found that it was time to start for the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 53]: She went out of the station , and , passing a shop for flowers and fruit went in , spent ten shillings in the filling of a reed basket , and , leaving the shop , seated herself in one of the taxis which were standing in readiness outside the great porch .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 21]: Such carelessness of money was a natural reversion to habit , which came as a consequence of her absorbed mind .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 26]: The great hospital looked bare and grim , the smell of iodoform was more repellent than ever , after the sweet scents of the country .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 22]: Claire knew her way by this time , and ascended by lift to the women 's ward , where Sophie lay .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 16]: Beside almost every bed one or two visitors were seated , but Sophie was alone .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 34]: Down the length of the ward Claire caught a glimpse of a recumbent form , and felt a pang at the thought of the many visiting days when her friend had remained alone .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 38]: With no relations in town , her brother 's family too pressed for means to afford expeditions from the country , Sophie had no hope of seeing a familiar face , and her very attitude bespoke dejection .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 37]: Claire walked softly to the further side of the bed , and dangled the basket before the half-covered face , whereupon Sophie pushed back the clothes and sat up , her eyes lighting with joy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 4]: _ Claire _ !
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 2]: You !
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 13]: Oh , you dearly beloved , I thought you were still away !
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 10]: Oh , I am glad -- I am glad !
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 7]: I was so dreadfully blue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 4]: She looked it .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 30]: Even in the eagerness of welcome her face looked white and drawn , and the pretty pink jacket , Claire 's own gift , seemed to accentuate her pallor .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 19]: The hands with which she fondled the flowers were surely thinner than they had been ten days before .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 7]: `` My dear , what munificence !
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 7]: Have you come into a fortune ?
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 4]: And fruit underneath !
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 10]: I shall be able to treat the whole ward !
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 6]: When did you come back ?
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 7]: Have you had a good time ?
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 8]: Are you going on to the farm ?
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 11]: It _ is _ good of you to come again .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 19]: It 's -- it 's hard being alone when you see the other patients with their own people .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 23]: The nurses are dears , but they are so rushed , poor things , they have n't time to stay and talk .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 8]: And oh , Claire , the days !
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 9]: They 're so wearily _ long _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 9]: Claire murmured tender exclamations of understanding and pity .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 26]: A pained conviction that Sophie was no better made her shrink from putting the obvious question ; but Sophie did not wait to be asked .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 32]: `` Oh , Claire , '' she cried desperately , `` it 's so hard to be patient and to keep on hoping , when there 's no encouragement to hope !
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 42]: I 'm not one scrap better after all that has been tried , and I 've discovered that they did not expect me to be better ; the best they seem to hope for is that I may not grow worse !
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 22]: It 's like running at the pitch of one 's speed , and succeeding only in keeping in the same place .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 10]: And there are other arthritics in this ward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 3]: She shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 13]: `` When I think that I may become like _ them _ !
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 9]: It would be much easier to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 34]: `` I think it would often seem easier , '' Claire agreed sadly , her thoughts turning to Cecil , whose trouble at the moment seemed as heavy as the one before her .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 10]: `` But we ca n't be deserters , Sophie .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 12]: We must stick to our posts , and play the game .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 14]: When these troubles come , we just _ have _ to bear them .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 9]: There 's no hiding , or running away .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 18]: There 's only one choice open to us -- whether we bear it badly or well . ''
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 21]: But Sophie 's endurance was broken by weeks of suffering , and her bright spirit was momentarily under an eclipse .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 9]: `` Everybody does n't have to bear them !
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 11]: Things are so horribly uneven , '' she cried grudgingly .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 46]: `` Look at your friend Miss Willoughby , with that angel of a mother , and heaps of money , and health , and strength , and a beautiful home , and able to have anything she wants , as soon as she wants it .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 10]: What does _ she _ know of trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 89]: Claire thought of Janet 's face , as it had faced her across the table in the refreshment room , but it was not for her to betray another 's secret , so she was silent , and Sophie lifted a spray of pink roses , and held them against her face , saying wistfully -- `` You 're a good little soul , Claire , and it 's because you are good that I want to know what your opinion is about all this trouble and misery .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 16]: What good can it possibly do me to have my life ruined by this illness ?
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 11]: Do n't tell me that it will not be ruined .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 63]: It must be , in a material sense , and I 'm not all spiritual yet ; there 's a lot of material in my nature , and I live in a material world , and I want to be able to enjoy all the dear , sweet , natural , human joys which come as a right to ordinary human beings .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 7]: I want to _ walk _ !
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 48]: Oh , my dear , I look out of these windows sometimes and see all the thousands and thousands of people passing by , and I wonder if a single one out of all the crowd ever thinks of being thankful that he can _ move _ !
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 49]: I did n't myself , but now -- when I hobble along -- '' She broke off , shaking back her head as though to defy the rising tears , then lay back against the pillows , looking at Claire , and saying urgently -- `` Go on !
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 7]: Tell me what you think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 17]: `` I think , '' Claire answered slowly , `` that we are bound to grow !
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 18]: The mere act of death is not going to lift us at once to our full height .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 61]: Our training must go on after we leave this sphere ; but , Sophie dear , some of us have an extra hard training here , and if we bear it in the right way , surely , surely when we move up , it must be into a higher class than if things had been all smooth and easy .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 15]: There must be less to learn , less to conquer , more to enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 16]: You and I are school-mistresses and ought to realise the difficulties of mastering difficult tasks .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 30]: Do n't look upon this illness as cheating you out of a pleasant holiday , dear -- look upon it as special training for an honours exam . ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 19]: Sophie smiled , her old twinkling smile , and stroked Claire 's hand with the spray of roses .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 9]: `` I knew you 'd say something nice !
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 13]: I knew you 'd put it in a quaint , refreshing way .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 19]: I shall remember that , when I am alone , and feel courage oozing out of every pore .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 17]: Two o'clock in the morning is a particularly cheery time when you are racked with pain !
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 38]: Claire , I asked the doctor to tell me honestly whether there was any chance of my ever taking up the old work again , and he said , honestly , he feared there was none . ''
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 13]: `` But Mrs Willoughby -- '' `` I asked that , too .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 29]: He says he quite hopes to get me well enough to go to Egypt in October or November , and that I should certainly be much better there .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 14]: It would be the best thing that could happen if it came off !
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 10]: But -- '' Claire held up a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 4]: `` No ifs !
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 3]: No buts !
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 19]: Do your part , and get better , and leave the rest to Providence and -- Mrs Willoughby !
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 26]: It 's her mission in life to help girls , and she 'll help _ you _ , too , or know the reason why .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 15]: The truly sensible thing would be for you to begin to prepare your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 9]: What about starting a fascinating blouse at once ?
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 24]: Your hands are quite able to sew , and if you once got to work with chiffon and lace the time would fly !
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 7]: You might write for patterns to-night .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 8]: You would enjoy looking at patterns . ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 30]: When Claire took her departure half an hour later , she left behind a very different Sophie from the wan dejected-looking creature whom she had found on her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 37]: Hers was a happy nature , easily cheered , responsive to comfort , and Claire had a happy conviction that whatever physical handicaps might be in store , her spirit would rise valiantly to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 61]: A winter in Egypt was practically assured , since Mrs Willoughby had privately informed Claire that if nothing better offered , she would send Sophie at her own expense to help in the household of her niece -- an officer 's wife , who would be thankful for assistance , though she could not afford to pay the passage out .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 22]: What was to happen in the future no one could tell , and there was no profit in asking the question .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 65]: The next step was clear , and the rest must be left to faith , but with a chilling of the blood Claire asked herself what became of the disabled working women who had no influential friends to help in such a crisis ; the women who fell out of the ranks to die by the roadside homeless , penniless , _ alone _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 2]: SURRENDER .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 74]: It was a very limp and exhausted Claire who arrived at the farm that evening , and if she had had her own way she would have hurried to bed without waiting for a meal , but the kind countrywoman displayed such disappointment at the idea that she allowed herself to be dissuaded , sat down to a table spread with home-made dainties and discovered that she was hungrier than she had believed .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 68]: The fried ham and eggs , the fresh butter , the thick yellow cream , the sweet coarse bread , were all the best of their kind , and Claire smiled at her own expense as she looked at the emptied dishes , and reflected that , for a person who had professed herself unable to eat a bite , she had made a pretty good sweep !
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 63]: The bed was somewhat bumpy , as farmhouse beds have a habit of being ; there was one big ball in especial which took many wrigglings to avoid ; but on the other hand the sheets smelt deliciously , not of lavender , but of lemon thyme , and the prevailing air of cleanliness was delicious after the smoke-laden atmosphere of town .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 11]: Claire told herself that she could not expect to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 39]: She resigned herself to hear the clock strike every hour -- and as a matter of fact after ten o'clock she was unconscious of the whole world , until her breakfast-tray was carried into the room next morning .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 37]: After breakfast she had another nap , and after lunch still another , and in the intervals wandered about the farm-yard , laboriously striving to take an interest in what really interested her not at all .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 54]: Hens seemed to her the dullest of created creatures , pigs repelled , cows were regarded with uneasy suspicion , and sheep , seen close at hand , lost all the picturesque quality of a distant flock , and became stupid long-faced creatures , by no means as clean as they might be .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 22]: Milking-time aroused no ambition to experiment on her own account , and a glass of foaming new milk proved unexpectedly nauseous .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 20]: Sad as it was to confess it , she infinitely preferred the chalked and watered edition of the city !
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 29]: Indoors things were no better , for the tiny sitting-room stood by itself at the end of a passage , cut off from the life of the house .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 22]: It was spotlessly clean and the pride of its owner 's heart , but contained nothing of interest to an outsider .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 34]: Pictures there were none , with the exception of portraits of the farmer and his wife , of the enlarged photograph type , and a selection of framed funeral cards in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 27]: Books there were none , with the exception of a catalogue of an Agricultural Show , and a school prize copy of _ Black Beauty _ .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 39]: Before the second night was over Claire had read _ Black Beauty _ from cover to cover ; the next morning she was dipping into the catalogue , and trying to concentrate her attention on `` stock . ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 13]: As her body grew rested , Claire 's mind became increasingly active .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 14]: It was inevitable , but the second stage was infinitely harder to bear .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 39]: For the first hours after her arrival her supreme longing had been to lie down and shut her eyes ; but now restlessness overtook her , and with every fresh hour drove her more helplessly to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 64]: She went out for long walks over the countryside , her thoughts so engrossingly turned inward that she saw nothing of the landscape on either hand ; she returned to the house and endeavoured to write , to read , to sew , only to give up the attempt at the end of half an hour , and once more wander helplessly forth .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 25]: The good countrywoman was quick to sense that some hidden trouble was preying on her guest , and showed her sympathy in practical fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 9]: `` A bit piney-like , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 38]: I seed from the first that you was piney-like , '' she said , standing tray in hand on the threshold of the little parlour , her fresh , highly-coloured face smiling kindly upon the pale girl .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 34]: `` I always do say that I pities ladies when they has anything on their minds ; sitting about , same as you do now , with nothing to take them off theirselves .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 75]: A body like me that has to keep a house clean , and cook and wash , and mind the children , to say naught of the sewing and the mending , and looking after the cows and the hens , and all the extra fusses and worries that come along , she has n't got no time to remember herself , and when she gets to bed she 's too tired to think .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 19]: Now if you was to have some work -- '' Claire 's face brightened with a sudden inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 8]: `` Will you give me some work ?
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 7]: Let me help _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 13]: Do , please , Mrs Corby ; I 'd be so grateful .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 11]: Let me come into the kitchen and do something now .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 13]: I feel so lonely shut off here , all by myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 9]: Mrs Corby laughed , her fat comfortable laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 13]: `` Bless your ` art , you can come along and welcome .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 8]: I 'll be proud to have you .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 22]: It ai n't much you know of housework , I expect , but it 'll do you no harm to learn .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 9]: I 'll find you some little jobs . ''
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 12]: `` Oh , I 'm not so useless as you think .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 22]: I can brush and dust , and polish , and wash up , and I know a good deal about cooking .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 17]: I 'll make a salad to eat with the cold meat -- a real French salad .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 49]: I 'm sure Mr Corby would enjoy a French salad , '' cried Claire , glancing out of the window at the well-stocked kitchen garden , and thinking of the wet lettuce and uncut onions , which were the good woman 's idea of the dish in question .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 8]: `` May I make one to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 8]: Mrs Corby smiled with a fine resignation .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 13]: Personally she wanted none of them nasty messy foods , but there !
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 20]: the poor thing meant well , and if it would make her happy , let her have her way .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 46]: So Claire collected her materials , and washed and mixed , and filled a great bowl , and decorated the top with slices of hardboiled eggs , and a few bright nasturtium blossoms , while three linty-locked children stood by , watching with fascinated attention .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 23]: At dinner Claire thoroughly enjoyed her share of her own salad , but the verdict of the country-people was far from enthusiastic .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 58]: `` I do n't go for to deny that it tasted well enough , '' Mrs Corby said with magnanimous candour , `` but what I argue is , what 's the sense of using up all them extras -- eggs , and oil , and what not -- when you can manage just as well without ?
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 26]: I 've never seen the day when I could n't relish a bit o ' plain lettuce and a plate of good spring onions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 16]: `` But the eggs and the dressing make it more nourishing , '' Claire maintained .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 26]: `` In France the peasants have very often nothing but salad for their dinner -- great dishes of salad , with plenty of eggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 6]: `` Eh , poor creatures !
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 10]: It makes your heart bleed to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 11]: We may be thankful we are not foreign born ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 34]: Mrs Corby pronounced with unction , and Claire retired from the struggle , and decided that for the future it would be more tactful to learn , rather than to endeavour to teach .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 54]: The next morning , therefore , she worked under Mrs Corby 's supervision , picking fruit , feeding chickens , searching for eggs , and other light tasks designed to keep her in the open air ; and in the afternoon accompanied the children on a message to a farm some distance away .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 46]: The path lay across the fields , away from the main road , and on returning an hour later , Mrs Corby 's figure was seen standing by her own gate , her hand raised to her eyes , as though watching for their approach .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 20]: The children broke into a run , and Claire hurried forward , her heart beating with deep excited throbs .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 6]: _ Who _ was it ?
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 36]: Nobody but Sophie and Cecil knew her address , but still , but still -- For a moment hope soared , then sank heavily down as Mrs Corby announced -- `` A lady , miss .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 11]: Come to see you almost as soon as you left .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 8]: She 's waiting in the parlour . ''
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 2]: Cecil !
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 10]: Claire hardly knew if she were sorry or relieved .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 35]: It would be a blessing to have some one to whom she could speak , but , on the other hand , what poor Cecil had to say would not fail to be depressing .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 23]: She went slowly down the passage , taking a grip over her own courage , opened the door , and stood transfixed .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 34]: In the middle of the hard horsehair sofa sat Mrs Fanshawe herself , her elaborately coiffured , elaborately attired figure looking extraordinarily out of place in the prim bareness of the little room .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 42]: Her gloved hands were crossed on her lap , she sat ostentatiously erect , her satin cloak falling around her in regal folds ; her face was a trifle paler than usual , but the mocking light shone in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 17]: At Claire 's entrance she stood up , and crossed the little room to her side .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 29]: `` My dear , '' she said calmly , `` I am an obstinate old woman , but I have the sense to know when I 'm beaten .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 9]: I have come to offer my apologies . ''
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 8]: A generous heart is quick to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 37]: At that moment Claire felt a pang indeed , but it came not from the remembrance of her own wrongs , but from the sight of this proud , domineering woman humbling herself to a girl .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 24]: Impulsively she threw out both hands , impulsively she stopped Mrs Fanshawe 's lips with the kiss which she had refused at parting .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 5]: `` Oh , stop !
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 4]: Please do n't !
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 6]: Do n't say any more .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 6]: I was wrong , too .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 6]: I took offence too quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 13]: You were thinking of me , as well as of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 16]: `` Oh , no , I was not , '' the elder woman corrected quietly .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 20]: `` Neither of you , nor your friend , my dear , though I took advantage of the excuse .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 19]: You came between me and my plans , and I wanted to get you out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 15]: You saw through me , and I suppose I deserved to be seen through .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 28]: It 's an unpleasant experience , but if it 's any satisfaction to you to know it , I 've been _ well _ punished for interfering .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 8]: Erskine has seen to my punishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 8]: The blood rushed to Claire 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 7]: How much did Mrs Fanshawe know ?
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 12]: Had Erskine told her of that hurried interview upon the station ?
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 13]: Had he by any possibility told what he had _ asked _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 21]: The blazing cheeks asked the question as plainly as any words , and Mrs Fanshawe replied to it without delay .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 14]: `` Oh , yes , my dear , I know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 25]: It was because I guessed that was coming that I wanted to clear the coast ; but it appears that I was too late .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 24]: Shall we sit down and talk this out , and for pity 's sake see that that woman does n't come blundering in .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 19]: It 's such an anti-climax to have to deal with a tea-tray in the midst of personal explanations .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 29]: I 'm not accustomed to eating humble pie , and if I am obliged to do it at all , I prefer to do it in private . ''
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 6]: `` She wo n't come .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 14]: I do n't have tea for another hour , '' Claire assured her .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 11]: `` And please do n't eat humble pie for me .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 17]: I was angry at the time , but you had been very kind to me before .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 11]: I -- I enjoyed that first week very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 7]: `` And so did I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 13]: Mrs Fanshawe gave one of her dry , humorous , little laughs .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 10]: `` You are a charming companion , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 14]: I was a little in love with you myself , but -- Well !
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 17]: to be honest , it did not please me that my son should follow my example .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 21]: He is my only child , and I am proud and ambitious for him , as any mother would be .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 25]: I did not wish him to marry a -- a -- '' `` A gentlewoman who was honourably working at an honourable profession ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 30]: concluded Claire for her , with a general stiffening of pose , voice and manner ; but Mrs Fanshawe only laughed once more , totally unaffected by the pose .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 10]: `` No , my dear , I did not !
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 26]: It 's very praiseworthy , no doubt , to train the next generation , but it does n't appeal to me in the present connection .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 29]: I was thinking of my son , and I wanted him to have a wife of position and fortune , who would be able to help his career .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 21]: If you had been a girl of fortune and position , I should have been quite ready to welcome you .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 45]: You are a pretty creature , and much more intelligent than most girls of your age , but , you see , you are not -- '' `` I have no money but what I earn , but I belong to a good family .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 27]: I object to your saying that I have no position , Mrs Fanshawe , simply because I live in lodgings and work for my living ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 9]: Mrs Fanshawe shrugged with a touch of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 12]: `` Oh , well , my dear , why bandy words ?
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 18]: I have told you that I am beaten , so it 's useless to argue the point .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 36]: Erskine has decided for himself , and , as I told you before , one might as well try to bend a granite wall as move him when he has once made up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 37]: I 've planned , and schemed , and hoped , and prayed for the last dozen years , and at the first sight of that pretty face of yours all my plans went to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 42]: If I 'd been a wise woman I would have recognised the inevitable , and given in with a good grace , but I never was wise , never shall be , so I ran my head up against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 34]: I 've been through a bad time since you left me , my dear , and I was forgiven only on the understanding that I came here and made my peace with you .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 5]: Have I made peace ?
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 7]: Do you understand what I mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 20]: That I withdraw my opposition , and if you accept my boy , you shall have nothing to fear .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 23]: I 'll make you welcome ; and I 'll be as good to you as it 's in my nature to be .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 8]: I 'll treat you with every courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 21]: Upon my word , my dear , as mothers-in-law go , I think you would come off pretty well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 55]: `` I -- I -- I 'm sure -- You 're very kind ... '' Claire stammered in helpless embarrassment ; and Mrs Fanshawe , watching her , first smiled , then sighed , and said in a quick low voice -- `` Ah , my dear , you can afford to be generous !
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 83]: If you live to be my age , and have a son of your own , whom you have loved , and cherished , and mothered for over thirty years , and at the end he speaks harshly to you for the sake of a girl whom he has known a few short months , puts her before you , finds it hard to forgive you because you have wounded her pride -- ah , well , it 's hard to bear !
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 22]: I do n't want to whine , but -- do n't make it more difficult for me than you can help !
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 4]: I have apologised .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 29]: Now it 's for you -- '' Claire put both arms round the erect figure , and rested her head on the folds of the black satin cloak .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 23]: Neither spoke , but Mrs Fanshawe lifted a little lace-edged handkerchief to her eyes , and her shoulders heaved once and again .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 10]: Then suddenly she arose and walked towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 6]: `` The car is waiting .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 9]: Do n't come with me , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 7]: I 'll see you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 16]: She waived Claire back in the old imperious way against which there was no appeal .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 36]: Evidently she wished to be alone , and Claire re-seated herself on the sofa , flushed , trembling , so shaken out of her bearings that it was difficult to keep hold of connected thought .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 5]: The impossible had happened .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 20]: In the course of a few short minutes difficulties which had seemed insurmountable had been swept from her path .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 21]: Within her grasp was happiness so great , so dazzling that the very thought of it took away her breath .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 10]: Her eyes fell on the watch at her wrist .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 5]: Ten minutes to four !
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 45]: Twenty minutes ago -- barely twenty minutes -- at the end of the field path she had looked at that little gold face with a dreamy indifference , wondering only how many minutes remained to be whiled away before it was time for tea .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 13]: Even a solitary tea-drinking had seemed an epoch in the uneventful day .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 2]: Uneventful !
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 20]: Claire mentally repeated the word , the while her eyes glowed , and her heart beat in joyful exultation .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 18]: Surely , surely in after-remembrance this day would stand out as one all-important , epoch - making .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 8]: And then suddenly came a breathless question .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 8]: How had Mrs Fanshawe discovered her retreat ?
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 18]: No address had been left at Laburnum Crescent ; no address had been given to Janet Willoughby .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 12]: Cecil was in her mother 's home ; Sophie in hospital .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 19]: In the name of all that was mysterious and inexplicable , _ how had she been tracked _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 24]: Claire sat bolt upright on her sofa , her grey eyes widened in amaze , her breath coming sharply through her parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 14]: She thrilled at the realisation that Erskine 's will had overcome all difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 12]: Had not Mrs Fanshawe declared that she came at his instigation ?
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 13]: And where the mother had come , would not the son follow ?
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 26]: At that moment a shadow fell across the floor ; against the open space of the window a tall figure stood , blocking the light .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 8]: Erskine 's eager eyes met her own .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 29]: Before the first gasp of surprise had left her lips , his strong hands had gripped the sill , he had vaulted over and stood by her side .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 14]: `` I sent on my advance guard , and waited till her return .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 14]: Did you think you had hidden yourself where I could not find you ?
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 19]: I should have found you wherever you had gone ; but as it happens it was easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 13]: You forgot that you had forwarded flowers to your friend in hospital !
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 10]: She was ready enough to give me your address .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 31]: And now -- _ Claire _ '' -- he held out his hands , gazing down into her face -- `` what have you to say to me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 26]: Instinctively Claire 's hands stretched out to meet his , but on the following impulse she drew back , clasping them nervously behind her back .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 10]: `` Oh , are you _ sure _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 4]: she cried breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 10]: `` Are you _ sure _ you are sure ?
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 5]: Think what it means !
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 8]: Think of the difference it might make !
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 25]: I have no money , no influence ; I 'd be an expense to you , and a drag when another girl might help .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 2]: Think !
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 2]: Think !
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 8]: Oh , do be quite sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 17]: Erskine 's stern eyes melted into a beautiful tenderness as he looked at her troubled face .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 20]: He waited no longer , but came a step nearer , and took forcible possession of the hidden hands .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 17]: `` It is not my feelings which are in question ; it is _ yours _ .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 12]: There has been no doubt in my mind for months past .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 9]: I think you know that , Claire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 7]: `` But -- your career ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 9]: `` I can look after my own career .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 25]: Do you think it is the straight thing to suggest to a soldier that he needs a woman to help him in his work ?
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 15]: It 's not as a soldier I need you , but as a man .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 7]: I need you there , Claire .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 5]: I need you badly !
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 11]: No one else could help me as you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 23]: Claire 's lips quivered , but still she hung back , standing away from him at the length of her stretched arms .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 6]: `` I 've no money .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 7]: I 'm a -- a school-mistress .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 18]: Your friends will think -- '' `` I am not considering what my friends will think . ''
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 17]: `` Your mother thought -- '' `` I am not asking you to marry my mother .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 37]: Mothers of only sons are hard to please , but you know as well as I can tell you that the mater is fond of you at heart , and that she will grow fonder still .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 20]: She had her own ideas , and she fought for them , but she wo n't fight any more .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 11]: You must n't be hard on the mater , Claire .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 12]: She has done her best for me to - day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 4]: `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 6]: I was sorry for her .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 7]: Sorrier than I was for myself .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 14]: It 's so hard that I should have come between you two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 11]: At that Erskine laughed , a short , impatient laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 30]: `` Oh , Claire , Claire , how long are you going to waste time in discussing other people 's feelings , before you tell me about your own ?
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 9]: Darling , I 'm in love with you !
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 13]: -- I 'm in love for the first time in my life .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 4]: I 'm impatient .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 4]: I 'm waiting .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 28]: There 's no one in the world for me at this moment but just yourself ; I 'm waiting for you to forget every one but me .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 8]: Do you love me , Claire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 6]: `` You know I do !
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 5]: You know I do !
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 29]: cried Claire , yielding to the strength of the strong arms , and resting her head on the broad shoulder with an unspeakable rush of joy and rest .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 11]: `` Oh , but you do n't know how much !
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 25]: I ca n't tell you -- I ca n't put it into words , but it 's my whole heart , my whole life !
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 19]: Oh , every _ thought _ has been with you for such a long , long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 4]: `` My darling !
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 8]: My own sweet , brave little girl !
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 6]: And my thoughts with you !
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 9]: Thank God , we shall be together now .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 10]: We have had enough of separation and chance meetings .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 8]: There must be an end of that .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 10]: You 'll have to marry me at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 8]: This was rushing ahead with a vengeance !
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 17]: Claire shook her head , with a little laugh sweet as a chime of joy bells .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 6]: `` You ridiculous -- boy !
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 4]: It 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 5]: You forget my work .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 6]: There 's all next term .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 10]: I could n't possibly leave without giving notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 5]: `` Could n't you !
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 6]: We 'll see to that .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 26]: Do you seriously believe that I 'm going to let you go back to that drudgery , and kick my heels waiting for four months ?
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 16]: You do n't understand the kind of man you are marrying , my lass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 29]: Claire loved the sound of that `` my lass , '' loved the close grip of the arms , the feel of the rough cheek against her own .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 18]: For a few minutes neither spoke , too utterly , completely absorbed in each other 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 39]: To Claire , as to Erskine , a four months ' delay seemed an aeon of time through which to wade before the consummation of a perfect happiness , but it seemed impossible that it could be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 9]: `` Miss Farnborough would never let me off .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 10]: She would be indignant with me for asking . ''
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 7]: `` I 'll tackle Miss Farnborough .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 7]: Leave Miss Farnborough to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 47]: returned Erskine with so confident an air that Claire shook with amusement , seeing before her a picture of her lover seated _ tete-a-tete _ with the formidable `` Head , '' breaking to her the news that one of her staff intended to play truant .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 9]: `` It 's very easy to say that .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 6]: You do n't know her .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 12]: She thinks everything in the world comes second to education . ''
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 6]: `` What if she does ?
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 6]: I 'll agree with her .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 36]: You 're the most precious darling in all the world , but you ca n't honestly believe that there are n't a thousand other mistresses who could teach those flappers as well , or better !
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 8]: Whereas for _ me _ -- well !
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 8]: it 's Claire , or no one .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 34]: I 'll throw myself on the good lady 's tender mercies , and ask for your release as a favour to myself , and I bet you anything you like that I succeed .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 11]: Miss Farnborough was a woman before she was a school-mistress .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 9]: She 'll set you free all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 11]: `` Perhaps -- perhaps possibly at the half term . ''
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 7]: `` Rubbish -- the half term !
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 23]: We 'll be married and settled down before we get near then ... Where will you go for our marriage , Claire ?
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 4]: To Mrs Willoughby ?
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 9]: I 'm sure she 'd be willing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 4]: -- no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 39]: Claire marvelled at the obtuseness of men ; at the utter unconsciousness of this particular man of the reason why Mrs Willoughby 's house should be the last one on earth from which his marriage should take place .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 33]: And then in the midst of these questionings , to her own surprise a sudden pricking of tears came to her eyes , and she cried sharply , `` I want mother !
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 5]: I must have mother .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 5]: She must come home .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 17]: She 'll come at once , when she hears -- '' `` We 'll cable to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 7]: That will be best of all .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 20]: I 'm longing to meet your mother , and you ought to have her with you , little lass !
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 7]: Poor , little , lonely lass !
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 12]: Please God , you shall never be lonely any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 14]: `` Ah , Erskine darling , but the _ other women _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 14]: Claire cried , and there was the sharpness of pain in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 81]: From within the shelter of her lover 's arms her heart went out in a wave of tenderness towards her sisters who stood apart from the royal feast ; towards Cecil with her blighted love , Sophie with her blighted health , with the thousand others for whom they stood as types ; the countless hordes of women workers for whom life was a monotonous round of grey - hued days , shadowed by the prospect of age and want .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 21]: From the shelter of her lover 's arms , Claire Gifford vowed herself to the service of her working sisters .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 23]: From the bottom of her heart she thanked God for the year of work which had taught her to _ understand _ .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 3]: THE END .
