Parsing [sent. 1 len. 27]: THE CAPTAIN OF THE KANSAS BY LOUIS TRACY AUTHOR OF `` THE WINGS OF THE MORNING , '' `` THE PILLAR OF LIGHT , '' ETC. .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 36]: The Captain of the Kansas CHAPTER I ITEMS NOT IN THE MANIFEST `` I think I shall enjoy this trip , '' purred Isobel Baring , nestling comfortably among the cushions of her deck chair .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 12]: A steward was arranging tea for two at a small table .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 19]: The _ Kansas _ , with placid hum of engines , was speeding evenly through an azure sea .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 37]: `` I agree with that opinion most heartily , though , to be sure , so much depends on the weather , '' replied her friend , Elsie Maxwell , rising to pour out the tea .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 21]: Already the brisk sea-breeze had kissed the Chilean pallor from Elsie 's face , which had regained its English peach-bloom .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 13]: Isobel Baring 's complexion was tinged with the warmth of a pomegranate .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 20]: At sea , even in the blue Pacific , she carried with her the suggestion of a tropical garden .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 24]: `` I never gave a thought to the weather , '' purred Isobel again , as she subsided more deeply into the cushions .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 14]: `` Let us hope such a blissful state of mind may be justified .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 20]: But you know , dear , we may run into a dreadful gale before we reach the Straits . ''
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 3]: Isobel laughed .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 6]: `` All the better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 11]: `` People tell me I am a most fascinating invalid .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 7]: I look like a creamy orchid .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 20]: And what luck to have a chum so disinterested as you where a lot of nice men are concerned !
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 8]: What have I done to deserve it ?
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 10]: Because you are really charming , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 18]: `` Does that mean that you have already discovered a lot of nice men on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 14]: Elsie handed her friend a cup of tea and a plate of toast .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 3]: `` Naturally .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 33]: While you were mooning over the lights and tints of the Andes , I kept an eye , both eyes in fact , on our compulsory acquaintances of the next three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 10]: To begin with , there 's the captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 7]: `` He is good-looking , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 7]: Somewhat reserved , I fancied . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 4]: `` Reserved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 10]: Isobel showed all her fine teeth in a smile .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 14]: Incidentally , she took a satisfactory bite out of a square of toast .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 11]: `` I 'll soon shake the reserve out of him .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 4]: He is mine .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 18]: You will see him play pet dog long before we meet that terrible gale of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 19]: `` Isobel , you promised your father -- '' `` To look after my health during the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 21]: Do you think that I intend only to sleep , eat , and read novels all the way to London ?
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 9]: Then , indeed , I should be ill .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 10]: But there is a French Comte on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 7]: He is mine , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 10]: `` You mean to find safety in numbers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 7]: `` Oh , there are others .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 11]: Of course , I am sure of my little Count .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 18]: He twisted his mustache with such an air when I skidded past him in the companionway . ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 12]: Elsie bent forward to give the chatterer another cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 14]: `` And you promised to read Molière at least two hours daily ! ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 4]: she sighed good-humoredly .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 25]: Even the most sensible people , and Elsie was very sensible , begin a long voyage with idiotic programs of work to be done .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 17]: `` I mean to substitute a live Frenchman for a dead one -- that is all .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 26]: And I am sure Monsieur le Comte Edouard de Poincilit will do our French far more good than ` Les Fourberies de Scapin . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 10]: `` Am I to be included in the lessons ?
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 11]: And you actually know the man 's name already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 10]: `` Read it on his luggage , dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 6]: He has such a lot .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 18]: See if he does n't wear three different colored shirts for breakfast , lunch , and tea .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 30]: And , if _ you _ refuse to help , who is to take care of le p ` tit Edouard while I give the captain a trot round .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 37]: Do n't look cross , there 's a darling , though you _ do _ remind me , when you open your eyes that way , of a delightful little American schoolma'am I met in Lima .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 19]: She had drifted that far on her holidays , and I believe she was horrified with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 17]: `` Perhaps she thought you were really the dreadful person you made yourself out to be .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 50]: Now , Isobel , that does not matter a bit in Valparaiso , where you are known , but in Paris and London -- '' `` Where I mean to be equally well known , it is a passport to smart society to be _ un peu risqué _ .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 2]: Steward !
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 27]: Give my compliments to Captain Courtenay , and say that Miss Maxwell and Miss Baring hope he will favor them with his company to tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 9]: Elsie 's bright , eager face flushed slightly .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 21]: She leaned forward , with a certain squaring of the shoulders , being a determined young person in some respects .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 18]: `` For once , I shall let you off , '' she said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 22]: `` So I give you fair warning , Isobel , I must not be included in impromptu invitations of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 11]: Next time I shall correct your statement most emphatically . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 7]: I only meant to be polite .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 4]: Tut , tut !
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 23]: as dad says when he ca n't swear before ladies , I sha n't make the running for you any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 9]: Elsie drummed an impatient foot on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 6]: There was a little pause .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 29]: Isobel closed her eyes lazily , but she opened them again when she heard her friend say : `` I am sorry if I seem crotchety , dear .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 10]: Indeed , it is no pretense on my part .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 11]: You can not imagine how that man Ventana persecuted me .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 25]: The mere suggestion of any one 's paying me compliments and trying to be fascinating is so repellent that I cringe at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 28]: And even our sailor-like captain will think it necessary to play the society clown , I suppose , seeing that we are young and passably good-looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 9]: Isobel Baring raised her head from the cushions .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 9]: `` Ventana was a determined wooer , then ?
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 6]: What did he do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 10]: `` He -- he pestered me with his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 14]: Oh , I should have liked to flog him with a whip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 19]: `` He was always that sort of person -- too serious , '' and the head dropped again .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 4]: The steward returned .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 12]: He was a half-caste ; his English was to the point .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 16]: `` De captin say he busy , he no come , '' was his message .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 11]: Elsie 's display of irritation vanished in a merry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 16]: Isobel bounced up from the depths of the chair ; her dark eyes blazed wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 8]: `` Tell him -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 71]: Then she mastered her annoyance sufficiently to ascertain what it was that Captain Courtenay had actually said , and she received a courteous explanation in Spanish that the commander could not leave the chart-house until the _ Kansas _ had rounded the low-lying , red-hued Cape Caraumilla , which still barred the ship 's path to the south -- the first stage of the long voyage from Valparaiso to London .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 61]: But pertinacity was a marked trait of the Baring family ; otherwise , Isobel 's father , a bluff , church-warden type of man , would not have won his way to the chief place in the firm of Baring , Thompson , Miguel & Co. , Mining and Export Agents , the leading house in Chile 's principal port .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 22]: Notwithstanding Elsie 's previous outburst , the steward was sent back to ask if the ladies might visit the bridge later .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 11]: Meanwhile , would Captain Courtenay like a cup of tea ?
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 28]: All things considered , there was only one possible answer ; Captain Courtenay would be charmed if they favored him with both the tea and their company .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 11]: `` I thought so , '' cried Isobel , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 6]: `` Come on , Elsie !
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 8]: Let us climb the ladder of conquest .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 7]: The steward will bring the tea-things .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 6]: The chart-house is just splendid .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 13]: It will provide a refuge when the Count becomes too pressing . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: There was a tightening of Elsie 's lips to which Isobel paid no heed .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 23]: The imminent protest was left unspoken , for Courtenay 's voice came to them : `` Please hold on by the rail .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 27]: If a foot were to slip on one of those brass treads the remainder of the day would be a compound of tears and sticking-plaster . ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 21]: `` I think you said ` reserved , ' '' whispered Isobel to her companion with a wicked little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 28]: To Courtenay , peering through a hatch in the hurricane deck , she cried : `` Is the brass rail more dependable than you , captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 20]: `` It will serve your present purpose , Miss Baring , '' said he , not taking the hint .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 16]: Gathering her skirts daintily in her left hand , Isobel tripped up the steep stairs .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 3]: Elsie followed .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 31]: Courtenay , who had the manner and semblance of the first lieutenant of a warship , stood outside a haven of plate glass , shining mahogany , and white paint .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 16]: The woodwork of the deck was scrubbed until it had the color of new bread .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 22]: An officer paced the bridge ; a sailor , within the chart-house , held the small wheel of the steam steering-gear .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 16]: Somewhat to Isobel 's surprise , neither man seemed to be aware of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 8]: `` So this is your den ? ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 27]: she said , throwing her bird-like glance over the bright interior , before she gave the commander a look which was designed to bewitch him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 11]: `` Surely you do n't sleep here , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 12]: This room is the brain of the ship , Miss Baring .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 6]: We are always wide-awake here .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 6]: My quarters are farther aft .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 22]: I think I can find a chair for you if you care to sit down while I have my tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 13]: The captain led the way to a spacious cabin behind the chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 24]: `` I hope you do n't mind the chairs being secured to the deck , '' he said , taking off his hat .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 23]: `` So far above sea line , you know , everything that is loose comes to grief when the ship rolls . ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 9]: `` Then what becomes of your photographs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 22]: demanded Isobel , promptly , her quick eyes having discovered the pictures of two ladies in silver frames on a writing-table .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 9]: `` I take care to put them away .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 7]: There is always plenty of warning .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 15]: No ordinary sea can trouble a big hulk like the _ Kansas _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 16]: `` Is that your mother , the dear old lady in the lace cap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 11]: `` Yes , and the other is my sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 5]: `` Oh , really !
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 5]: Is she married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 11]: Like me , she is wedded to her profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 14]: `` Will you think it rude if I ask what that is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 23]: `` She is a hospital nurse ; the matron , indeed , of a public institution in the suburbs of London . ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 4]: `` How wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 8]: I do admire hospital nurses so much .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 18]: They are so clever and self-sacrificing , and they always have a smile on their sweet faces .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 20]: Only dad would n't hear of such a thing , I should love to be a nurse myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 23]: And Isobel sighed , dropped her long eyelashes , and examined the toe of a smart brown shoe with a wistful resignation .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 19]: Courtenay was politely incredulous , but the arrival of the steward with the replenished tea-tray created a diversion .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 12]: `` Do let me pour your tea , '' cried Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 13]: `` I make lovely tea , do n't I , Elsie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 13]: Elsie laughed so cheerfully that Isobel flashed an interrogatory glance at her .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 14]: Certainly , the notion of Isobel Baring claiming the domestic virtues was amusing .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 21]: But Elsie answered at once : `` I know few things that you can not do admirably , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 38]: So Isobel filled a cup , asked if Captain Courtenay took milk and sugar , and said demurely , with a sip of a spoonful : `` Let me see if I can guess your tastes . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 9]: Elsie 's blue eyes assumed a deeper shade .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 24]: Men might like that kind of thing , but she felt that her face and neck would be poppy red in another moment .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 23]: Thus far she had not addressed a word to Courtenay , though by his manner he had included her in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 21]: She now resolved to break in on the attack which Isobel was beginning with the adroitness of a skilled campaigner .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 15]: And she , too , could use her eyes to advantage when she chose .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 37]: `` What a curious library you have , Captain Courtenay , '' she said , looking , not at him , but at a row of books fitting closely into a small case over the writing-table .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 6]: Instantly the sailor was interested .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 10]: `` Why ` curious , ' Miss Maxwell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 16]: `` First , in their assortment ; secondly , in the similarity of their binding .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 19]: I have never before seen the Bible , Walt Whitman , and Dumas in covers exactly alike . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 6]: `` That is easily explained .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 6]: They are bound to order .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 27]: My real trouble was to secure editions of equal size -- an essential , you see -- otherwise they would not pack into their shelf . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 6]: `` But what a gathering !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 51]: Shakespeare , the _ Pilgrim 's Progress _ , Montaigne 's Essays , Herbert Spencer , _ Goethe 's Life _ , by Lewes , Marcus Aurelius , Martial , Wordsworth , _ The Egoist _ , Thoreau , Hazlitt , and Mitford 's _ Tales of Old Japan _ !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 15]: Where have I heard or read of that particular galaxy of stars before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 4]: `` Go on .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 22]: You are on the right track , '' cried Courtenay , setting down the teacup and hastening to Elsie 's side .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 14]: She was leaning on the table , reading the titles of the books .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 16]: The motive of her exclamation was merged now in the fine ardor of the book-lover .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 22]: She had an unconscious trick of placing the forefinger of her right hand on her lips when deeply engaged in thought .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 28]: Elegant as Isobel Baring might be in her studied poses , Elsie need fear no comparison as she examined the contents of the bookcase with eager attention .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 19]: `` Why the _ Vicomte de Bragelonne _ only , and not the _ Three Musketeers _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 4]: she mused aloud .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 22]: `` And if the _ Life of Goethe _ , why not his poems , his essays , _ Werther _ ?
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 16]: -- Ah , I know -- ` the crowning offence of _ Werther _ . '
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 4]: A Stevenson library !
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 16]: Each volume he recommends in ` Books which have influenced men , ' I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: What a charming idea !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 15]: I shall never forgive myself for not having thought of it long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 8]: Courtenay laughed and blushed like any schoolgirl .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 18]: Elsie 's appreciation had a downright , honest ring in it that went far beyond the platitudes .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 11]: She accorded him the ready comradeship of a kin soul .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 23]: `` Many people have been surprised by my collection ; you are the first to discover its inspiration , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 6]: `` That is not strange .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 7]: There are so few who read .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 6]: Reading means discerning , interpreting .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 41]: I am a worshiper of R. L. S. , but I have been shocked to find that for a hundred who can talk glibly of his novels there is hardly one who has communed with him in his essays . ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 13]: `` We have actually hit upon a topic that should prove inexhaustible .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 12]: Believe me , Miss Maxwell , that is my pet subject .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 23]: More than once , needing a listener , I have even lectured my long-suffering terrier , Joey , on the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 4]: Isobel laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 41]: The two standing in front of the bookcase started apart , with a sudden consciousness that they were speaking unguardedly , for Isobel 's mirth had mockery in it -- `` there was a laughing devil in her sneer . ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 10]: `` By the way , where is Joey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 20]: The dog answered her question by appearing , with a stretch and a yawn , from beneath a bunk .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 10]: He had heard his name in Courtenay 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 8]: That sufficed for Joey at any time .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 7]: `` What a strange animal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 4]: went on Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 26]: `` I should have thought that he would bark , or peep out at us , at the least , when we came in . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 11]: `` Joey had a disturbed night , '' said Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 28]: `` We passed the evening in the Hotel Colon , and he regards South American hotels as the natural dwelling-place of cats , and other bad characters .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 16]: Here , he is at home , and he knew that I was present . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 12]: `` Otherwise , he would have classified us as suspicious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 7]: `` He is far too discriminating .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 8]: What do you say , pup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 7]: Joey looked up at his master .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 14]: Apparently , he found the conversation trivial ; he yawned again , capaciously .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 4]: `` You darling !
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 18]: You must have slept with one eye open , '' said Elsie , stooping to pat him .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 7]: `` Oh , take care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 3]: cried Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 7]: `` He may bite you . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 4]: `` Not he !
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 16]: When you see that wistful look in a dog 's eyes , have no fear .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 6]: He wants to speak then .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 12]: You wo n't bite me , will you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 22]: And Elsie sank on one knee , to stroke Joey 's white coat ; whereupon Joey tried to lick her face .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 28]: `` Between the Stevenson Library and the captain 's dog you are installed as a prime favorite on board the _ Kansas _ , '' commented Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 6]: The other girl rose hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 12]: She had caught the touch of malice in the smooth voice .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 19]: `` Captain Courtenay is too polite to remind us that we are intruders , '' she said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 8]: `` We forget that he is busy .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 14]: Joey , candidly canine , did not try to hide his feelings . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 10]: Isobel swung her chair round to face the door .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 15]: `` This is quite the best place in the ship , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 9]: `` I am very comfortable , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 10]: Please do n't send us away , captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 13]: Before Courtenay could answer , the officer of the watch looked in .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 22]: `` Cape Caraumilla bearing sou ` west of the Buei Rock , sir , '' he announced , and vanished again .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 14]: `` Do n't hurry , '' said Courtenay , taking up his cap .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 11]: `` I must leave you for a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 17]: He was gone , with Joey at his heels , and there was a brief silence .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 18]: `` Really , Isobel , we should go back on deck , '' urged Elsie , uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 18]: Already she half regretted the impulse which led her to intervene in her friend 's special hobby .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 5]: `` I like that .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 12]: I did n't credit you with such guile , Elsie Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 21]: You snap up my nice captain beneath my very nose , and coolly propose that I should vacate the battlefield .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 5]: Oh dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 27]: I ca n't talk literature , but I _ can _ flirt , and I have not finished with Arthur yet by a long chalk . ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 31]: `` Isobel , if you knew how you hurt me -- '' Miss Baring crossed her pretty feet , folded her arms , and gave her companion a smiling glance .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 6]: `` So artful , too .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: ` Love me , love my dog , ' eh ?
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 8]: You actually took my breath away . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 40]: `` It may amaze you to learn that I meant to achieve that much , at any rate , '' was Elsie 's quiet retort as she turned to select a volume from the queer miscellany in the bookcase .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 8]: `` Oh , do n't be cruel .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 5]: Leave me my Frenchman !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 15]: Say you wo n't wheedle Edouard by quoting the classics of his native tongue !
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 3]: Poor me !
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 12]: Here have I been warming a serpent in my bosom . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 15]: With a _ moue _ of make-believe anguish Isobel leaned back in her chair .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 9]: She was insolently conscious of her superior attractions .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 9]: Was she not the richest heiress in Valparaiso ?
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 8]: Had not her father chartered this ship ?
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 12]: And was not Elsie even now flying from an unwelcome suitor ?
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 23]: She knew full well that her friend would resent the slightest semblance of love-making on the part of any man on board .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 19]: Already her astonishment at Elsie 's unlooked-for vivacity was yielding to the humor of meeting such a rival .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 17]: The Count might serve as a foil , but the real quarry now was the captain .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 9]: That very night there would be a moon .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 10]: And the sea was calm as a sheltered lake .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 28]: Isobel 's lips parted in a delighted smile as she tried to imagine Courtenay deserting her to discuss those celebrities whom Elsie had made the most of .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 12]: And how she would play off the Count against the captain !
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 16]: They ought to be at daggers drawn long before the Straits of Magellan were reached .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 18]: Certainly she never expected such sport on board such a humdrum ship as the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 35]: Suddenly they both heard an excited bark from the dog , and the quick rush of feet along the deck ; Courtenay 's voice reached them with a new and startling note in it .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 5]: `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 7]: There was an instant 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 11]: Their alert ears caught the sounds of a distant scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 12]: Then a pistol shot jarred the peaceful drone of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 7]: `` Sheer off , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 4]: roared Courtenay again .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 9]: `` Next time I shoot to kill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 20]: -- With terror in their eyes , with blanched cheeks , they rushed to the door and peeped out .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 24]: Courtenay was not to be seen , but the officer of the watch was swinging himself over the canvas shield of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 3]: He disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 13]: Joey , barking furiously , trotted into view and ran back again .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 23]: Creeping forward , they saw the stolid sailor within the chart-house squint at the compass and give the wheel a slight turn .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 4]: That was reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 28]: Yet another timorous pace , and through the curving window they could discern Courtenay , holding a revolver in his right hand , but behind his back .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 14]: Even in their alarm they realized that nothing very terrible would happen now .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 20]: But why had the shot been fired , and what had given that tense ring to Courtenay 's threat ?
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 10]: Venturing a little further , they gained the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 24]: On the main deck , a long way beneath , near an open hatch , a half-caste Chilean was lying on his back .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 6]: He had evidently been wounded .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 13]: Blood was flowing from his leg ; it smeared the white deck .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 21]: The officer who had climbed down so speedily from the bridge was directing two other men how to lift him .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 22]: Close by , the chief officer , Mr. Boyle , was stanching a deep cut on his chin with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 23]: At the same time he curtly ordered off such deck hands and stewards as came running forward , attracted by the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 15]: The girls were gazing wide-eyed at this somewhat unnerving scene , when Courtenay approached .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 10]: `` Better go below , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 19]: `` I am sorry this trouble should have happened , at the beginning of the voyage , too .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 8]: I hope it will not upset you .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 20]: That rascally Chilean tried to knife Mr. Boyle , and those other blackguards were ready to side with him .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 17]: I had to shoot quick and straight to show them I meant what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 6]: `` Is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 19]: asked Isobel , with a contemptuous coolness as to the fate of the mutineer which Courtenay found admirable .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 7]: `` Not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 5]: Fired at his legs .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 9]: Only a flesh wound , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 5]: `` Poor wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 3]: murmured Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 8]: `` Was there no other way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 20]: `` There is only one way of dealing with that sort of skunk , '' was the gruff answer .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 12]: The pity in her voice implied a condemnation of his act .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 4]: He resented it .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 50]: He knew he had done rightly , and she knew that she had given offence by her involuntary sympathy with the suffering Chilean , who , with the passing of the paralyzing shock of the bullet , was howling dolefully now as the sailors carried him towards the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 7]: The man 's groans tortured her .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 6]: Her eyes filled with tears .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 28]: Joey , yelping with frenzy , leaped up to invite her to lift him above the canvas screen so that he might see what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 28]: But Elsie could only reach blindly for the rail of the companion-way , and Isobel , after a smiling word of farewell to Courtenay , followed her .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 29]: So it came to pass that neither Stevenson nor the moon had power to draw the captain of the _ Kansas _ to the promenade deck that night .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 20]: CHAPTER II WHEREIN THE CAPTAIN KEEPS TO HIS OWN QUARTERS Doctor Christobal brought some additional details to the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 8]: He was not the ship 's doctor .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 38]: The _ Kansas _ , built for freight rather than passengers , did not carry a surgeon on her roll ; Dr. Christobal 's presence was due to Mr. Baring 's solicitude in his daughter 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 31]: It chanced that the courtly and gray-haired Spanish physician had relinquished his practise in Chile , and was about to pay a long-promised visit to a married daughter in Barcelona .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 19]: Friendship , not unaided by a good fee , induced him to travel by the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 42]: He had been called on to attend Mr. Boyle and the wounded Chilean , and he reported now that the chief officer 's injury was trifling , but the Chilean 's wound might incapacitate him during the remainder of the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 20]: `` So far as I can gather , '' he said , `` Mr. Boyle had a narrow escape .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 28]: These half-breeds have a nice anatomical knowledge of the situation of the lung ; they also know the easiest way to reach it with a sharp instrument .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 22]: Captain Courtenay fired as the knife fell , otherwise our first mate would have attended his own funeral this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 10]: `` What was the cause of the affair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 3]: Isobel asked .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 15]: `` The man is not one of the ship 's crew , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 22]: His name is Frascuelo , and it appears that he was engaged to place some bunker coal aboard early this morning .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 47]: He says that he was drugged , and his clothes stolen ; that he came off to the ship at a late hour , and that some one flung him headlong into a hold which , luckily for him , was nearly full of cotton bales .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 56]: He was stunned by the fall , and were it not for Captain Courtenay 's custom of having all hatches taken off and a thorough examination of the cargo made before the holds are finally battened down for the voyage , Frascuelo might now be in a tight place in more than one sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 9]: Dr. Christobal was proud of his idiomatic English .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 12]: He spoke the language with the careless freedom of a Londoner .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 31]: `` Frascuelo seems to have passed an eventful day , '' said the little French Comte , who had been waiting anxiously for a chance to join in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 13]: `` But why should he want to kill poor Mr. Boyle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 11]: inquired Isobel , after giving the Frenchman an encouraging glance .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 7]: Incidentally , she smiled at Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 17]: `` Why puzzle one 's brains over foreign tongues when all the world speaks English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 3]: she telegraphed .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 14]: `` Mr. Boyle is a peculiar person , '' said the doctor dryly .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 11]: `` I happen to have known him during some years .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 26]: You and I might regard him as a man of few words , but he has acquired a wonderful vocabulary for the benefit of sailor-men .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 10]: I believe he can swear in every known lingo .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 28]: His accomplishment in that direction no doubt annoyed Frascuelo , who became frantic when he heard that the ship would not call at any South American port .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 25]: I imagine , too , that the unfortunate fellow is still suffering from the drug which , he says , was administered to him .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 10]: Anyhow , you know how the affair terminated . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 19]: `` I , for one , think some consideration might have been shown him , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 18]: `` There is no time for argument when a Chilean draws a knife , Miss Maxwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 25]: `` But , if his story is true -- '' `` There never yet was a stowaway who did not invent a plausible yarn .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 20]: Nevertheless , I believe , and Mr. Boyle agrees with me , that the man is not lying . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 29]: They felt the ship swing round on a new course , and the rays of the setting sun lit up the saloon table through the open starboard ports .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 8]: `` Due south now , ladies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 5]: cried Dr. Christobal cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: `` We have rounded Cape Cardones .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 12]: We practically follow the seventy-sixth degree until we approach Evangelistas Island .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 9]: Thus far we are in the open sea .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 38]: Then we pick our way through the Straits discovered by that daring Portuguese , Fernando de Magallanes , to whose memory I always drink heartily once we are clear of the Cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 34]: I never pass through that gloomy defile without marveling at his courage , and thinking that he deserved a better fate than murder at the hands of some painted savage in the Philippines .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 7]: Peace be to his ashes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 20]: And the doctor lifted his glass of red wine with a quasi-masonic ritual which lent solemnity to his discourse .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 15]: `` You are a long way ahead of your toast , '' said Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 15]: `` Just as Magellan was ahead of his times , '' was the rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 28]: `` Yet he was a man of leisurely habit , '' put in Elsie , who found Dr. Christobal 's old-world manners full of charm and repose .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 5]: `` How so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 15]: said he , puzzled , for the worthy Portuguese navigator was notoriously a swashbuckler .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 20]: `` Otherwise he never could have christened any unhappy promontory by such a long-winded name , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 17]: `` Perhaps he met a contrary wind in that region , '' said Christobal , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 22]: `` Monsieur de Poincilit here , were he in a very bad temper , might exclaim , ` Mille diables ! '
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 25]: Why should not our excellent Fernando rail against the almost inconceivable fickleness which could be displayed by eleven times as many young ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 27]: `` I came out last time on the _ Orellana _ , and I do n't even remember passing such a place , '' said Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 22]: She was a Chilean born and bred , but she always affected European vagueness as to the topography of South America .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 51]: Dr. Christobal knew this weakness of hers ; he also remembered her beautiful half-caste mother , from whom Isobel inherited her flashing eyes , her purple-red lips , and a skin in which the exquisite flush of terra-cotta on her checks merged into the delicate pallor of forehead and neck .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 41]: But , being a tactful man , he only answered : `` Your English sailors , my dear , who gruffly dubbed the adjacent point ` Cape Dungeness , ' have shortened Magellan 's mouthful into ` Cape Virgins . '
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 28]: -- Yet , Ursula was a British saint , and her memory ought to be revered , if only because it keeps alive a classic pun . ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 7]: A born raconteur , he paused .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 19]: `` Go right ahead , doctor , '' came a voice from the lower end of the table .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 27]: `` Well , the story runs that Princess Ursula fled from Britain to Rome to escape marriage with a pagan -- '' `` How odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 13]: interrupted Isobel , and Elsie alone understood the drift of her comment .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 18]: `` Not at all odd if she did n't happen to like him , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 13]: `` She reached Cologne , and was martyred there by the Huns .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 30]: Long afterwards a stone was found with the inscription _ Ursula et Undecimilla Virgines _ , which was incorrectly translated into ` Ursula and her Eleven Thousand Virgins . '
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 39]: Some later critic pointed out that a missing comma after Undecimilla , the name of a handmaid , made all the difference , assuming that two young ladies were a more reasonable and probable number than eleven thousand .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 15]: But what legend ever cared for a comma , or reached a full stop ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 47]: If you go to Cologne , the verger of the Church of St. Ursula will show you the bones of the whole party in glass cases , and , equally amazing , the town of Baoza in Spain claims to be the birthplace of the lot .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 14]: Clearly , Magellan had a man from Baoza on board his ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 24]: `` All mail steamers ought to provide a lecturer on things in general and interesting places passed in particular , '' said Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 4]: Dr. Christobal bowed .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 57]: `` I am sure that some of the officers of the _ Orellana _ could have told you the history of Cape Virgins , but they , not to mention the other young gentlemen in the passenger list , would certainly find you better sport than puzzling your pretty head about the ship 's landmarks . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 26]: `` I also came out on the _ Orellana _ , but there was no Miss Baring to be seen , '' murmured the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 12]: `` You had a dull trip , I take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: said the doctor , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 28]: `` I was very ill , '' was the response ; but , after a stare of surprise , he joined in the resultant laugh quite good-naturedly .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 41]: `` It is a standing joke that my countrymen are poor sailors , '' he protested , `` and that is strange , do n't you think , seeing that France has the second largest navy in the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 10]: `` Console yourself , monsieur , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 24]: `` Three great sea-captains , Nelson , Cook , and , it is said , Columbus himself , always paid tribute to Neptune .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 33]: And , if I am not mistaken , '' he added , glancing through the port windows , `` we shall all have our stamina tested before twenty-four hours have passed . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 15]: Heads were turned and necks craned to see what had induced this unexpected prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 39]: Behind the distant coast-line the inner giants of the Andes threw heavenward their rugged outlines , with many a peak and glacier glinting in vivid colors against a sky so clear and blue that they seemed strangely near .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 24]: `` Yes , this wonderful atmosphere of ours is enchanting , '' said the doctor , when assailed by a chorus of doubts .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 10]: `` But it carries its deceptive smiles too far .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 12]: The very beauty of the Cordillera is a sign of storm .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 17]: I am sorry to be a croaker ; yet we are running into a gale . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 13]: `` I shall ask the captain , '' pouted Isobel , rising .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 6]: The Count twisted his mustache .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 18]: He knew that both ladies were in the forbidden territory of the bridge when the fracas occurred .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 11]: `` You , perhaps , are a good sailor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 6]: said he , addressing Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 11]: `` I am afraid to boast , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 30]: `` I have been in what was called a Number Eight gale , whatever that may mean , and weathered it splendidly , but I am older now . ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 18]: `` It can not have been long ago , seeing that you recall it so exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 30]: `` It was six years ago , and I was seventeen then , '' said Elsie , her eyes wandering to the purple and gold of the far-off mountains .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 6]: `` But you are English .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 18]: You are therefore at home on the rolling deep , '' murmured Monsieur de Poincilit , confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 20]: She did not endeavor to interpret his expressive glance , though he seemed to convey more that he said .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 35]: `` Not so much at home at sea as you are in my language , '' she replied , and she turned to Dr. Christobal , whom she had already known slightly in Valparaiso .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 8]: `` Are you coming on deck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 29]: `` I am sure you are a mine of information on Chile , and I want to extract some of the ore while the land is still visible .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 11]: It is already assuming the semblance of a dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 15]: `` You are not saying a last farewell to Valparaiso , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 11]: said her elderly companion , as they quitted the salon .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 11]: I have no ties there , save those of sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 29]: I shall not return , unless , if a doubtful fortune permits , I am able some day to revisit two graves which are dear to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 25]: There was a little catch in her voice , and the doctor was far too sympathetic to endeavor forthwith to divert her sad thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 11]: `` I knew your father , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 32]: `` He was a most admirable man , but quite unsuited to the environment of a new country , where the dollar is god , and an unstable deity at that .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 14]: He was swindled outrageously by men who stand high in the community to-day .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 38]: But you , Miss Maxwell , with your knowledge of Spanish and your other acquirements , should do better here than in Europe , provided , that is , you mean to earn your own living . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 17]: `` I am proud to hear you speak well of my father , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 14]: `` And I am well aware that he was badly treated in business .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 19]: I fear , too , that his advocacy of the rights of the Indians brought him into disfavor .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 27]: Of all his possessions the only remnant left to me is a barren mountain , with a slice of fertile valley , in the Quillota district .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 14]: It yields me the magnificent revenue of two hundred dollars per annum . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 14]: `` How in the world did he come to own land there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 10]: `` It was a gift from the Naquilla tribe .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 14]: He defeated an attempt made to oust them by a big land company .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 49]: The company has since asked me to sell the property , and offered me a fair price , too , as the cultivable land is a very small strip , but it would be almost like betraying the cause for which he fought , would it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 21]: `` Yes , indeed , '' agreed the doctor , though his heart and not his head dictated the reply .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 15]: `` May I ask you to tell me your plans for the future ? ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 29]: `` Well , when Mr. Baring heard I was going to England , he was good enough to promise me employment in his London agency as Spanish correspondent .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 9]: That will fill in two days a week .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 8]: The rest I can devote to art .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 18]: I paint a little , and draw with sufficient promise to warrant study , I am told .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 16]: Anyhow , I am weary of teaching ; I prefer to be a pupil . ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 34]: `` I can not imagine what the young men of Valparaiso were thinking of to allow a girl like you to slip off in this fashion , '' said Christobal with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 22]: `` Most of them hold firmly to the belief that a wife 's wedding-dress should be made of gilt-edged scrip . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 15]: `` Poor material -- very poor material out of which to construct wedded happiness .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: And as to my young friend , Isobel ?
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 11]: She joins her aunt in London , I hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 7]: `` That is the present arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 12]: She means to have a good time , especially in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 9]: I should like to live in Paris myself .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 13]: Dear old smoke-laden London does not appeal so thoroughly to the artist .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 12]: Yet , I am content -- yes , quite content . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 23]: `` Then you have gained the best thing in the world , '' cried the doctor , throwing out his arms expansively .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 10]: The two became good friends as the voyage progressed .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 15]: Christobal was exceedingly well informed , and delighted in a thoughtful listener like Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 26]: Isobel , tiring at times of the Count , would join in their conversation , and display a spasmodic interest in the topics they discussed .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 60]: There were only six other passengers , a Baptist missionary and his wife , three mining engineers , and an English globe-trotter , a singular being who appeared to have roamed the entire earth , but whose experiences were summed up in two words -- every place he had seen was either `` Fair '' or `` Rotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 57]: Even Isobel failed to draw him further , and she said one day , in a temper , after a spirited attempt to extract some of his stored impressions : `` The man reminds me of one of those dummy books you see occasionally , bound in calf and labeled ` Gazetteer of the World . '
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 17]: When you try to open a volume you find that it is made of wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 19]: So they nicknamed him `` Mr. Wood , '' and Elsie once inadvertently addressed him by the name .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 13]: `` What do you think of the weather , Mr. Wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 6]: she asked him at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 11]: He chanced to notice that she was speaking to him .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 7]: `` Rotten , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 12]: Perhaps he wondered why Miss Maxwell flushed and the others laughed .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 21]: But , in actual fact , he was not far wrong in his curious choice of an adjective that morning .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 14]: Dr. Christobal 's dismal foreboding had been justified on the second day out .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 29]: Leaden clouds , a sullen sea , and occasional puffs of a stinging breeze from the southwest , offered a sorry exchange for the sunny skies of Chile .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 44]: Though the _ Kansas _ was not a fast ship , she could have made the entrance to the Straits on the evening of the fourth day were not Captain Courtenay wishful to navigate the most dangerous part of the narrows by daylight .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 36]: His intent , therefore , was to pick up the Evangelistas light about midnight , and then crack ahead at fourteen knots , so as to be off Felix Point on Desolation Island by dawn .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 20]: This was not only a prudent and seamanlike course but it would conduce to the comfort of the passengers .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: The ship was now running into a stiff gale .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 30]: Each hour the sea became heavier , and even the eight thousand tons of the _ Kansas _ felt the impact of the giant rollers on her starboard bow .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 53]: Dinner , therefore , promised to be a meal of much discomfort , cheered only by the knowledge that as soon as the vessel reached the lee of Desolation Island the giant waves of the Pacific would lose their power , and all on board would enjoy a quiet night 's rest .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 8]: There were no absentees at the table .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 18]: Dr. Christobal strove to enliven the others with the promise of peace ere many hours had passed .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 9]: `` Pay no heed to those fellows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 47]: he cried , as the ship quivered under the blow of a heavy sea , and they heard the thud of many tons of water breaking over the bows and fore hatch , while the defeated monster washed the tightly screwed ports with a venomous swish .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 8]: `` They can not harm us now .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 26]: Let us rather thank kindly Providence which provided Magellan 's water-way ; think what it would mean were we compelled to weather the Cape . ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 30]: `` I am beginning to catch on to the reasonableness of that toast of yours , doctor , '' said one of the mining engineers , a young American .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 42]: `` I happen to be a tee-totaler , but I do n't mind opening a bottle of the best for the general welfare when we shove our nose past the Cape of the large number of young and unprotected females . ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 5]: Christobal raised his hand .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 10]: `` All in good time , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 14]: `` Never halloo for the prairie until you are clear of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 13]: If the wind remains in its present quarter , we are fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 45]: Should it happen to veer round to the eastward , and you see the rocks of Tierra del Fuego lashed by the choppy sea that can run even through a land-locked channel , you will be ready to open two bottles as a thanks-offering .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 11]: Is this your first trip round by the south ? ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 10]: `` Yes , I crossed by way of Panama .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 17]: Guess a mule-track over the Sierras is a heap better than the Pacific in a gale .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 3]: Jee-whizz ! ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 17]: A spiteful sea sprang at the _ Kansas _ and shook her from stem to stern .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 38]: The ship groaned and creaked as though she were in pain ; she staggered an instant , and then swung irresistibly forward with a fierce plunge that made the plates dance and cutlery rattle in the fiddles .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 17]: `` I suppose we must endure five hours of this , '' said Elsie , bravely .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 7]: `` I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 16]: Why does not Captain Courtenay , or even Mr. Boyle , put in an appearance ?
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 15]: I have hardly seen either of them since the day I came aboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 10]: Isobel was petulant , and perhaps a little frightened .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 18]: She had not yet reached that stage of confidence familiar to all who cross the open seas .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 9]: The first period of a gale is terrifying .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 13]: Later there comes an indifference born of supreme trust in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 47]: The steady onward thrust of the engines -- the unwavering path across the raging vortex of tumbling gray waters -- the orderly way in which the members of the crew follow their duties -- these are quietly persistent factors in the gradual soothing of the nerves .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 28]: Many a timid passenger , after lying awake through a night of terror , has gone to sleep when the watch began to swab the deck overhead .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 16]: Not even a Spartan sailor would begin to wash woodwork if the ship were sinking .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 19]: `` All ladies like to see an officer in the saloon during a storm , '' commented Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 25]: `` I plead guilty to a weakness in that direction myself , though I know he is much better employed on the bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 15]: `` The captain can not be on the bridge always , '' said Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 19]: `` He is seldom far from it in bad weather , if he is faithful to his trust .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 40]: And I fancy we would all admit that Captain Courtenay -- '' A curious shock , sharper and altogether more penetrating than the Thor 's hammer blow of a huge wave , sounded loud and menacing in their ears .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 11]: The ship trembled violently , and then became strangely still .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 13]: The least experienced traveler on board knew that the engines had stopped .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 49]: They felt a long lurch to port when the next sea climbed over the bows ; at once the _ Kansas _ righted herself and rode on even keel , while the stress and turmoil of her fight against wind and wave passed away into a sustained silence .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 57]: The half-caste stewards glanced at each other and drew together in whispering groups , but the chief steward , an Englishman , who had turned to leave the saloon , changed his mind and uttered a low growl of command which sent his subordinates ' attention , if not their thoughts , back to their work .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 19]: In the strained hush , the running along the deck of men in heavy sea-boots was painfully audible .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 9]: Water could be heard pouring through the scuppers .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 9]: Steam was rushing forth somewhere with vehement bluster .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 15]: These sounds only accentuated the extraordinary truce in the fight of ship against sea .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 12]: The _ Kansas _ was stricken dumb , if not dead .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 14]: `` Something has gone wrong , '' said Elsie in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 5]: Doctor Christobal nodded carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 7]: `` A burst steam-pipe , probably .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 7]: Such things will happen at times .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 9]: We are hove to for the moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 9]: He traded on the ignorance of his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 12]: The chief steward heard his explanation and looked at him fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 5]: Christobal caught the glance .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 13]: `` I suppose we shall lose an hour or so now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 14]: It will be all right by the time you have finished dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 11]: The meal drew to its close without much further talk .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 24]: The American engineer was the first to rise , but the chief steward whispered in his ear ; he returned to the table .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 15]: `` Say , '' he said calmly , `` we ca n't quit yet .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 5]: The companion-hatch is closed .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 8]: We must remain here a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 11]: `` Do you mean that we are battened down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 18]: demanded Isobel , shrilly , and her face lost some of its beauty in an ashen pallor .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 9]: `` Something of the sort , Miss Baring .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 10]: Anyway , we ca n't go on deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 14]: `` But -- I insist on being told what is the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 47]: The American knew little of ships , but he knew a great deal about mines , and , in a mine , if an accident happens , the man in charge can not desert his post to give information to those who are anxious for it .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 23]: So he replied laconically : `` Guess the captain will tell us all about it after a while , Miss Baring . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 4]: `` Que diable !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 22]: I feel like the rat in the trap , '' said Count Edouard , suppressed excitement rendering his English less fluent .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 17]: At another time the phrase would have sent a ripple of amusement through that cheery company .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 6]: Now , no one smiled .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 18]: They knew too well what he meant to pay heed to the mere form of his words .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 22]: No matter how large or sumptuously equipped the trap , the point of view of the rat was new to them .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 24]: CHAPTER III WHEREIN THE CAPTAIN REAPPEARS The fierce hissing of the continuous escape of steam excited alarm in those not accustomed to machinery .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 18]: Men and women share the unreasoning panic of animals when an unknown force reveals its pent-up fury .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 34]: They forget that safety-valves are provided , that diminished pressure means less risk ; the knowledge that restraint , not freedom , is dangerous comes ever in the guise of a new discovery .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 13]: The mining engineers , of course , did not share this delusion .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 29]: `` There must be something serious the matter , or they would not be wasting power like that , '' murmured the American to one of his fellow-professionals .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 7]: `` A smash-up in the engine-room .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 13]: Nada es mas seguro , '' -LSB- 1 -RSB- was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 9]: `` Wonder if any one is hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 7]: The Spaniard bent a little nearer .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: `` What can you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 4]: he whispered sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 36]: In the unnatural peacefulness of the ship 's progress , disturbed only by the roar of the superheated vapor , they all heard the opening of a door at the head of the saloon stairway .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 12]: The third officer appeared -- his wet oilskins gleaming and dripping .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 16]: `` Dr. Christobal , the captain wishes to speak to you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 7]: Christobal rose and crossed the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 28]: `` As you are here , wo n't you tell the ladies there is nothing to be afraid of in the mere stopping of the engines ? ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 3]: he suggested .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 15]: `` Oh , the ship is right enough , '' was the hasty response .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 10]: `` There has been an accident in the stokehold .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 5]: That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 6]: `` Want any help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 4]: demanded the American .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 10]: `` Well -- I 'll ask the captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 13]: Evidently anxious to avoid further questioning , he ran up the companion .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 11]: Christobal followed , the door was closed and bolted again .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 9]: `` I hate the word ` accident . '
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 11]: It covers so many horrid possibilities , '' said Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 26]: `` I am afraid some poor fellows have been injured , and that is why Captain Courtenay sent for Dr. Christobal , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 10]: `` Oh , of course , I meant that .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 21]: I was not thinking of the mere delay , though it is annoying that a breakdown should occur here . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 19]: `` It would be equally bad anywhere else , '' put in the missionary 's wife , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 11]: `` By no means , '' was the sharp response .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 29]: `` If we were in the Straits , for instance , we could signal to San Isidro or Sandy Point ; and there would be other vessels passing .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 11]: Here , we are in the worst possible place . ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 17]: Miss Baring 's acquaintance with the chief features of the South American coast-line had seemingly improved .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 27]: To all appearance , she alone among the passengers , now that Christobal was gone , realized vaguely the perilous plight of the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 20]: The fact was that even a girl of her apparently frivolous disposition could not avoid the influences of environment .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 27]: In a maritime community like that of Valparaiso there was every reason to know and dread the rock-bound coast which fringed the southern path towards civilization .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 31]: Strange , half-forgotten stories of the terrors which await a disabled ship caught in a southwesterly gale on the Pacific side of Tierra del Fuego rose dimly in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 10]: And the advancing darkness did not tend towards cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 25]: In her new track , the _ Kansas _ had turned her back on the murky light which penetrated the storm-clouds towards the west .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 33]: Unhinged by the external gloom and the prevalent uncertainty , and finding that no one cared to dispute with her , Isobel felt that a scream or two would be a relief .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 13]: For once , pride was helpful -- it saved her from hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 35]: The curious sense of waiting , they knew not for what , which dulled the thoughts and stilled the tongues of the small company at the table , soon communicated itself to the stewards .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 42]: The men stood in little knots , exchanging few words , and those mostly meaningless ; but the chief steward , whose trained ear caught the regular beat of the donkey-engine , woke them up with a series of sharp orders .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 11]: `` Switch on the lights , '' he said loudly .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 11]: `` Clear the table and hurry up with the coffee .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 9]: Get a move on those fellows , Gomez .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 14]: Have you never before been in a ship when the screw stopped ? ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 24]: The Gomez thus appealed to was the Englishman 's second-in-command ; he acted as interpreter when anything out of the common was required .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 26]: He muttered a few words in the Hispano-Indian patois which his hearers best understood , and the scene in the saloon changed with wondrous suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 11]: The glow of the electric lamps banished the gathering shadows .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 13]: The luxurious comfort of the apartment soon dispelled the notion of danger .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 4]: Coffee was brought .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 30]: The smoking saloon was inaccessible , owing to the closing of the gangway , but the chief steward suggested that the gentlemen might smoke if the ladies were agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 22]: Under such circumstances the ladies always are agreeable , and the instant result was a distinct rise in the social barometer .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 13]: The noise of the steam exhaust ceased as abruptly as it began .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 12]: The ship was riding easily in spite of the heavy sea .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 14]: Drifting with wind and wave is a simple thing for a big vessel .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 12]: There is no struggle , no tearing asunder of resisting forces .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 22]: Thus might a boat caught in the pitiless current of Niagara glide towards the brink of the cataract with cunning smoothness .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 32]: And then , while the occupants of the saloon were endeavoring to persuade each other that all was well , the loud wail of the siren thrilled them with increased foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 49]: It was not the warning note of a fog , nor the sharp course-signal for the guidance of a passing ship , but a sustained trumpeting , which announced to any steamer hidden in the darkening waste of waters that the _ Kansas _ was not under control .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 49]: It was a wild , sinister appeal for help , the voice of the disabled vessel proclaiming her need ; and the answer seemed to come in a fiercer shriek of the gale , while the added fury of the blast brought a curling sea over the poop .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 10]: The _ Kansas _ staggered and shook herself clear .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 25]: The wave smashed its way onward ; several iron stanchions snapped with reports like pistol-shots , and there was an intolerable rending of woodwork .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 18]: But , whatever the damage , the powerful hull rose triumphantly from the clutch of its assailant .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 13]: Shattered streams of water poured off the decks like so many cascades .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 16]: Loud above the splash of these miniature cataracts vibrated the tense boom of the fog-horn .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 6]: It was a nerve-racking moment .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 25]: It demanded the leadership of a strong man , and there are few gatherings in Anglo-Saxondom which can not produce a Caesar when required .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 22]: `` Say , '' shouted the American , his clear voice dominating the turmoil , `` that gave us a shower-bath .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 19]: If we could just stand outside and see ourselves , we should look like an illuminated fountain . ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 19]: That was the right note -- belief in the ship , contempt of the darkness and the gale .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 4]: The crisis passed .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 17]: `` There really can not be a heavy sea , '' said Elsie , cheerfully inaccurate .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 25]: `` Otherwise we should be pitching or rolling , perhaps both , whereas we are actually far more steady than when dinner commenced . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 15]: `` I find these lulls in the storm most trying , '' complained Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 23]: `` They remind me of some wild animal hunting its prey , creeping up with silent stealth , and then springing . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 23]: `` I have never before heard a fog-horn sounded so continuously , '' said the missionary 's wife , a Mrs. Somerville .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 12]: `` Do n't you think they are whistling for assistance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 3]: `` Assistance !
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 10]: What sort of assistance can anybody give us here ?
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 16]: Unless the ship rights herself very soon we do n't know what may happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 25]: Isobel seemed to have a premonition of evil , and she paid no heed to the effect her words might have on the others .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 21]: Although the saloon was warm -- almost uncomfortably hot owing to the closing of the main air-passages -- she shivered .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 9]: Mr. Somerville drew a book from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 25]: `` If that be so , '' he said gently , `` may I suggest that we seek aid from One who is all-powerful ?
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 23]: We are few , and of different religions , but in this hour we can surely worship at a common altar . ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 4]: `` Right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 11]: said the taciturn Englishman , varying his adjective for once .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 37]: The missionary offered up a short but heartfelt prayer , and , finding that he carried his congregation with him , read the opening verse of Hymn No. 370 , `` For those at Sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 37]: The stewards , most of whom understood a few words of English , readily grasped the fact that the _ padri _ was asking for help in a situation which they well knew to be desperate .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 29]: They drew near reverently , and even joined in the simple lines : O hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 32]: During the brief silence which followed the singing of the hymn it did , indeed , seem to their strained senses that the fierce violence of the gale had somewhat abated .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 8]: It was not so , in reality .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 13]: A steady fall in the barometer foretold even worse weather to come .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 31]: Courtenay , assured now that the main engines were absolutely useless , thought it advisable to get steering way on the ship by rigging the foresail , double-reefed and trapped .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 6]: The result was quickly perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 20]: The _ Kansas _ might not be pooped again , but she would travel more rapidly into the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 20]: Yet this only afforded another instance of the way men reason when they seek to explain cause from effect .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 66]: The hoisting of that strip of stout canvas was one of the time-factors in the story of an eventful night , for it was with gray-faced despair that the captain gave the requisite order when the second engineer reported that his senior was dead , the crown of two furnaces destroyed , and the engines clogged , if not irretrievably damaged , by fallen debris .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 23]: None realized better than the young commander what a disastrous fate awaited his ship in the gloom of the flying scud ahead .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 16]: There was a faint chance of encountering another steamship which would respond to his signals .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 22]: Then he would risk all by laying the _ Kansas _ broadside on in the effort to take a tow-rope aboard .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 28]: Meanwhile , it was best to bring her under some sort of control , the steam steering-gear , driven by the uninjured donkey-engine , being yet available .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 29]: In the saloon , Elsie had shielded her face in her hands , to hide the tears which the entreaty of the hymn had brought to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 17]: Some one whispered to her : `` Wo n't you sing something , Miss Maxwell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 5]: It was the American .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 21]: He judged that the sweet voice which unconsciously led the singing of the hymn must be skilled in other music .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 10]: She looked up at him , her eyes shining .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 3]: `` Sing !
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 7]: Do you think it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 17]: You can do a brave thing , I guess , and that would be brave . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 33]: `` I will try , '' she said , and she walked to the piano which was screwed athwart the deck in front of the polished mahogany sheath of the steel mainmast .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 60]: It was in her mind to play some lively excerpts from the light operas then in vogue , but the secret influences of the hour were stronger than her studied intent , and , when her fingers touched the keys , they wandered , almost without volition , into the subtle harmonies of Gounod 's `` Ave Maria . ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 26]: She played the air first ; then , gaining confidence , she sang the words , using a Spanish version which had caught her fancy .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 27]: It was good to see the flashing eyes and impassioned gestures of the Chilean stewards when they found that she was singing in their own language .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 37]: These men , owing to their acquaintance with the sea and knowledge of the coast , were now in a state of panic ; they would have burst the bonds of discipline on the least pretext .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 40]: So , as it chanced , the voice of the English señorita reached them as the message of an angel , and the spell she cast over them did not lose its potency during some hours of dangerous toil .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 54]: Here , again , was found one of the comparatively trivial incidents which contributed materially to the working out of a strange drama , because anything in the nature of a mutinous orgy breaking out in the first part of that soul-destroying night must have instantly converted the ship into a blood-bespattered Inferno .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 6]: Excited applause rewarded the song .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 25]: Fired by example , the dapper French Count approached the piano and asked Elsie if she could play Beranger 's `` Roi d'Yvetot . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 68]: She repressed a smile at his choice , but the chance that presented itself of initiating a concert on the spur of the moment was too good to be lost , so M. de Poincilit , in a nice light tenor , told how Il était un roi d'Yvetot Pen connu dans l'histoire , Se levant tard , se couchant tôt , Dormant fort bien sans gloire .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 20]: The Frenchman took the merry monarch seriously , but the lilting melody pleased everybody except `` Mr. Wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 23]: The `` Oh , Oh 's '' and `` Ah , Ah 's '' of the chorus apparently stirred him to speech .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 34]: He strolled from a corner of the saloon to the side of Gray , the American engineer , and said , with a contemptuous nod towards the singer : `` What rot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 7]: `` Not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 5]: He 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 12]: Wo n't _ you _ give us a song next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: If Gray showed the face of a sphinx , so did `` Mr. Wood , '' whose real name was Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 6]: He bent a little nearer .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 6]: `` Seen the rockets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 5]: Are we signaling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 4]: `` Every minute .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 5]: Have counted fifteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 6]: `` You do n't say .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 11]: Things are in a pretty bad shape , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 4]: `` Rotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 16]: `` Well , like Brer Rabbit , we must lie low and say nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 5]: This opinion was incontrovertible .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 15]: Moreover , Tollemache was not one who needed urging to keep his mouth shut .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 25]: Indeed , this was by far the longest conversation he had indulged in since he came aboard ; nor was he finished with it .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 10]: `` Ship will strike soon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 6]: Gray turned on him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 6]: `` Oh , nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 12]: `` What has put that absurd notion into your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 6]: `` Know this coast . ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 10]: `` But we are far out at sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 11]: `` Fifty miles from danger line , two hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 4]: Thirty now . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: `` Certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 23]: `` Do you mean to tell me that in three hours , or less , the ship may be a wreck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 8]: `` Will be , '' said Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 16]: `` Have a cigar , '' and he passed a well-filled case to his companion .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 12]: The American was beginning to take the silent one 's measure .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 12]: He bit off the end of a cigar and lit it .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 11]: `` What 's at the back of your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 4]: he asked coolly .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 7]: The other looked towards the Chileans .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 10]: `` Those chaps are rotters , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 9]: `` You think they will cut up rough ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 5]: What can they do ?
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 9]: We must all sink or swim together . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 12]: `` Yes ; but there are the women , you know .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 6]: They must be looked after .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 6]: You can count on me .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 10]: Tell the chief steward -- and the padri . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 38]: Gray felt that here was a man after his own heart , the native-born American having a rough-and-ready way of classifying nationalities when the last test of manhood is applied by a shipwreck , or a fire .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 6]: `` Got a gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: `` Cabin .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 8]: Goin ' for it first opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 4]: `` Same here .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 12]: But the captain will give us some sort of warning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 4]: `` Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 7]: Die quick , die happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 40]: Then Gray smiled , and he could not help saying : `` Tell you what , cousin , if you shoot as straight as you talk , these stewards will come to heel , no matter what happens . ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 38]: `` Fair shot , '' admitted Tollemache , and he stalked off to his stateroom , while the Count was vociferating , for the last time : Quel bon p ` tit roi c ' était la !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 4]: La , la !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 13]: Between Elsie and de Poincilit the chorus made quite a respectable din .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 30]: Few noticed that the saloon main companion had been opened again , until the sharp bark of a dog joining in the hand-clapping turned every eye towards the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 5]: Captain Courtenay was descending .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 20]: In front ran Joey , who , of course , imagined that the plaudits of the audience demanded recognition .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 10]: Courtenay had removed his oilskins before leaving the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 33]: His dark blue uniform was flecked with white foam , and a sou ` wester was tied under his chin , otherwise his appearance gave little sign of the wild tumult without .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 19]: Joey , on the other hand , was a very wet dog , and inclined to be snappy .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 28]: When , in obedience to a stern command , he ceased barking , he shook himself violently , and sent a shower of spray over the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 17]: Then he cocked an eye at the chief steward , who represented bones and such-like dainties .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 16]: Courtenay , removing his glistening head-gear , advanced a couple of paces into the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: He seemed to avoid looking at any individual , but took in all present in a comprehensive glance .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 39]: Elsie , who had exchanged very few words with him since the first afternoon she came on board , thought he looked worn and haggard , but his speech soon revealed good cause for any lack of sprightliness .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 51]: `` I regret to have to inform you , '' he said , with the measured deliberation of a man who has made up his mind exactly what to say , `` that the ship has been disabled by some accident , the cause of which is unknown at present .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 15]: The unfortunate result is that she is in a position of some peril . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 26]: There was a sudden stir among the Chilean stewards , whose wits were sharpened sufficiently to render the captain 's statement quite clear to them .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 22]: Isobel uttered a little sob of terror , and Mrs. Somerville gasped audibly , `` Oh , my poor children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 12]: Elsie , her lips parted , sat forward on the piano-stool .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 11]: Her senses seemed to have become intensified all at once .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 8]: She could see everything , hear everything .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 12]: Some of the Chileans and Spaniards crossed themselves ; others swore .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 11]: Count Edouard breathed hard and muttered `` Grand Dieu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 38]: She wondered why the captain and Mr. Tollemache , who had returned from his stateroom , and was standing in the half light of a doorway , should simultaneously drop their right hands into a coat pocket .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 28]: Mr. Tollemache , too , gave a queer little nod to the American , who had moved near to Isobel and placed a hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 21]: Elsie was quite sure that Gray whispered : `` For goodness ' sake , do n't cause a scene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 20]: And , indeed , he did ask Isobel and Mrs. Somerville , with some curtness , to restrain themselves .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 19]: Courtenay , with one cold glance , chilled into silence the muttered prayers and curses of the Chileans .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 20]: `` It may be necessary , about daybreak , to endeavor to beach the ship , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 23]: `` I wish you all , therefore , to guard against possible exposure by wearing warm clothes , especially furs and overcoats .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 35]: Money and jewelry should be secured , but no baggage of any sort , not even the smallest handbag , can be carried , as all other personal belongings must be left on board .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 18]: Passengers will gather here , and remain here until I send one of the officers for them .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 16]: The companion doors will not be closed again , but the decks are quite impassable .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 14]: You hear for yourselves that they are momentarily swept by heavy seas . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 7]: He turned to the chief steward .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 28]: `` Your men , Mr. Malcolm , '' he said , `` will begin at once , under your directions , to draw stores for each boat .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 8]: There need be no hurry or excitement .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 15]: We are , as yet , many miles distant from the nearest known land .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 23]: If the wind changes , or one of several possible things happens , the _ Kansas _ will suffer no damage whatever .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 64]: I wish all hands to be prepared , however , for the chance , the remote chance , I trust , of the ship 's being driven ashore , and I beg each one of you to remember that discipline and strict obedience to orders are not only more necessary now than ever , but also that they will be strictly enforced . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 10]: The concluding sentence was uttered very slowly and clearly .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: It was evident he meant the ship 's company to understand him .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 25]: Before any of his hearers attempted to question him , he jammed the sou ` wester on his head and ran up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 23]: The dog followed , somewhat ruefully , the cozy saloon being far more to his liking than the wind-swept , spray-lashed chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 32]: Mr. Malcolm promptly stirred his myrmidons with a command to fall in by boats ' crews , and Gomez won his chief 's approval by quietly translating the captain 's orders .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 31]: Beyond Mrs. Somerville 's subdued sobbing there was little outward manifestation that another crisis in the history of the _ Kansas _ and her human freight had come and gone .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 21]: `` The skipper did turn up , you see , '' said the American , when Tollemache came to him .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 17]: The silent man screwed his lips together as if he would put a padlock on them .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 21]: `` From your knowledge of the coast , do you think he will be able to beach the ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 28]: went on Gray , some humorous imp prompting him , even in that tense moment , to draw the expected answer from his new friend and ally .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 19]: `` Yes , in pieces , '' said Tollemache , and the reply was neither humorous nor expected .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: -LSB- 1 -RSB- Nothing is more certain .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 30]: CHAPTER IV ELSIE GOES ON DECK As a little yeast leavens much flour so does the presence of a few stout-hearted men give strength and courage to a multitude .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 43]: Although the rumor soon went the rounds that the giant wave which pooped the ship had carried away two of her six boats , there were no visible signs of flurry in the measures taken to equip the remaining boats for use .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 15]: The men had confidence in their officers ; every one worked smoothly and well .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 17]: All told , there were eighty persons on board when the _ Kansas _ left Valparaiso .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 16]: Of these , seventeen , including the officers , were of European birth or lineage .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 16]: The remaining sixty-three were men of mixed nationalities , ranging from Spanish-speaking Chileans to negroes .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 18]: There were eight under-stewards , a cook and his assistants , and nearly fifty sailors and firemen .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 27]: Unfortunately , the explosion in the stokehold had killed the chief engineer and one of his juniors , while six stokers were dead and several injured .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 28]: It was discovered that , before he died , the chief had shut off steam , and thus prevented the accident from assuming far more serious proportions .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 34]: The second engineer , a Newcastle man named Walker , who rushed to the engine-room at the first indication of a mishap , found his chief lying in collapse on the lever platform .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 26]: Walker promptly opened certain levers which allowed the steam to escape freely ; then he carried his comrade out of the spume to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 5]: It was too late .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 27]: Partial suffocation had placed too great a strain on a diseased heart ; by the time Dr. Christobal was summoned , a brave man was dead .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 23]: Courtenay , who had left instructions that he was to be called when the Evangelistas light was sighted , was sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 24]: In the elevated quarters assigned to the captain , the noise of the explosion differed little from the thunderous blows of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 10]: But the stopping of the engines awoke him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 23]: He felt the ship lurch away from her course , and saw the quick swerve of the compass indicator over his head .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 30]: As he ran down the gangway leading from the bridge he heard the officer of the watch say : `` Something given way in the engine-room , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 22]: Several minutes elapsed before he , or Walker , aided by willing volunteers , could penetrate the depths of the stoke-hold .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 41]: The place was a charnel-house , a stifling pit , filled with the charred contents of the furnaces , which gave off the most noisome fumes owing to the rapid condensation of steam and water escaping from the damaged pipes .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 19]: But the gale raging without served one good purpose in driving plenty of air down the ventilating cowls .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 7]: Gradually , the choking atmosphere cleared .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 30]: Courtenay was the first to reach the lowermost rung of the iron ladder , whence he looked with the eyes of despair on a scene of death and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 6]: The electric light was uninjured .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 19]: It revealed the bodies of several men , either dead or insensible , lying amidst the scattered coal .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 17]: Shovels , stoking-rods , and pieces of iron plate had been hurled about in wild confusion .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 52]: The door of one furnace was blown clean out of its bolts ; furnace bars and fire-bricks strewed the iron deck , while , each time the ship rolled , the heavy clank of loose metal somewhere in the engine-room proved that the damage was not confined solely to the stoke-hold .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 30]: If Courtenay could have dropped quietly into the sea through the stout hull of the _ Kansas _ he would have welcomed the certain result in that bitter moment .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 15]: But he was the captain , and men would look to him for salvation .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 21]: Well , he would do all that was possible , and , at any rate , die at his post .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 14]: So , choking back his misery , he organized the work of rescue .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 28]: Slings were formed of ropes , and those men in whom any signs of life were visible were the first to be lifted to the upper deck .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 23]: The stoke-hold was quickly emptied of its inanimate occupants ; living and dead alike were carried to the untenanted second-class saloon forward .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 46]: Then Courtenay left Walker to solve the puzzle of the accident and report on its extent , while he climbed back to the bridge , there to tackle the far more pressing problem of the measures to be adopted if he would save his ship .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 24]: It was typical of the man that his first act was to wipe the grime of the stoke-hold off his face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 18]: Then he drew a chart from the locker in which he had placed it two hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 19]: Mr. Boyle , who had been attending to the signals both by siren and rocket , joined him .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 9]: Courtenay pointed to a pin-mark in the sheet .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 32]: `` We were there at six o'clock , '' he said , and his voice was so steady that he seemed now to be free from the least touch of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 34]: `` The course was South-40-East , and , against this wind and sea , together with a strong current to the nor ` east , we would make eight knots under easy steam .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 17]: Therefore , by eight o'clock , when the furnaces blew out , we were here . ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 12]: He jabbed in a pin a little further down the chart .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 21]: Mr. Boyle , whose peculiar gifts in the way of speech were accurately described by Dr. Christobal , grunted agreement .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 7]: `` Huh , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 6]: Courtenay glanced at a chronometer .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 39]: `` It is now a quarter to nine , '' he went on , `` and I reckon that since the ship swung round we have been carried at least six knots to the nor ` east . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 18]: `` Huh , '' growled Mr. Boyle again , but he bent a trifle nearer the chart .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 11]: To his sailor 's eyes the situation was quite simple .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 20]: Unless , by God 's providence , some miracle happened , the _ Kansas _ was a doomed ship .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 19]: The pin stuck where the Admiralty chart recorded soundings of one hundred fathoms with a fine sand bed .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 12]: The longitude was 75-50 west of Greenwich and latitude 51-35 south .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 64]: Staring at them from the otherwise blank space which showed the wide expanse of the Pacific was an ominous note by the compilers of the chart : `` Seamen are cautioned not to make free with these shores , as they are very imperfectly known , and , from their wild , desolate character , they can not be approached with safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 29]: Right in the track of the drifting ship lay a vaguely outlined trio of dread import : `` Breakers ; Islet -LRB- conical -RRB- ; Duncan Rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 42]: Behind this sinister barrier stood the more definite White Horse Island , while , running due north and south a few miles away to the eastward , was a wavering dotted line which professed to mark the coast of Hanover Island .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 35]: Lending a fearful significance to the unknown character of the region , a printed comment followed the dotted line : `` This coast is laid down from distant observations on board the Beagle . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 19]: So the sea face of Hanover Island had not been visited by civilized man for nearly sixty years !
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 71]: There , not three hours ' steaming distance from the regular track of Chilean commerce , was a place so guarded by reefs on one hand , and impenetrable , ice-capped mountains on the other , that a proper survey was deemed impracticable even by officers of the British Navy , a service which has charted nearly every rock and shoal and tiny islet on the face of the waters .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 12]: Neither man spoke while their practised scrutiny took in these details .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 12]: The roaring chaos of the gale told what fate awaited them .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 18]: The elemental forces had donned the black cap of the judge and sentenced them to speedy destruction .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 12]: Mr. Boyle pursed his lips ; he looked sideways at Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 7]: `` Huh , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 8]: `` What 's to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 43]: `` I propose , '' answered the captain , coolly , `` to endeavor -- '' It was then that the giant wave leaped madly over the poop , as though the sea were resolved to swallow its prey without further warning .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 19]: The second officer , outside on the bridge , had to cling to a stanchion for his life .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 23]: Courtenay and Boyle saw two boats wrenched from their davits and carried overboard , while a bulkhead forward was smashed into matchwood .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 11]: The half-caste quarter-master at the wheel muttered `` Madonna ! ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 7]: and tried to remember a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 29]: `` I propose , '' continued Courtenay , raising his voice so that the other might hear , `` to give the ship steering-way by hoisting the foresail .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 6]: Will you see to it ?
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 20]: Then I intend to warn the passengers , and make such preparations as are possible before we strike . ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 8]: `` Huh , '' agreed Mr. Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 9]: He took the short cut over the rails .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 27]: In a few seconds the captain heard a flow of ornate Spanish , and he knew that Mr. Boyle was getting the scared Chileans to work .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 23]: Then Courtenay went to his own cabin , in which , in the haste of his exit , he had imprisoned Joey .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 27]: The dog received him with delight , for Joey knew a real gale from a sham one , as well as any man before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 22]: Courtenay patted his head , opened a drawer in the writing-table , and drew forth two photographs , which he kissed .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 19]: He replaced them , locked the drawer , and went out , letting the dog come with him .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 28]: That was his farewell to his mother and sister ; it was the first and last sign of sentiment he exhibited during that night of great endurance .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 16]: When he returned from the saloon , he found the chief officer examining the chart .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 14]: `` Do you think we have any chance of making Concepcion Strait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 18]: he asked , pointing to the doubtfully marked channel which separates Hanover and Duke of York Islands .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 16]: `` If we set the mains ` le we might bear up a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 5]: `` Try it . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 17]: `` Huh , '' said Mr. Boyle , and he was off again into the spindrift .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 47]: Be it understood that the sails carried by a big vessel like the _ Kansas _ are of little practical value save under certain conditions of wind and sea , when they are rigged to steady her , and thus give help to helm and propeller .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 29]: Still , they might serve now to carry the ship a point or two towards the north , and this was the sole avenue of escape which remained .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 20]: Here , again , was one of those trivial circumstances which are so potent in the shaping of events .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 67]: Had either of the sails blown out , or had the mainsail been set at the same time as the foresail , the course followed during the next few hours must have been deviated from to some extent , and the alteration of a cable 's length in direction could not fail to exercise the most momentous result on the fortunes of the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 16]: But ships are singularly akin to men in respect to the apparent vagaries of fate .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 27]: A moment 's hesitation , a mere pace to right or left , may mean all the difference between success and failure , safety and danger .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 27]: Leaving the chart on the table , where it was secured by drawing-pins , Courtenay went back to his cabin to obtain a pair of sea-boots .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 45]: Seeing Joey sitting on his tail and shivering , unable to indulge in a comfortable lick because the taste of salt water was hateful , he hunted for a padded mackintosh coat which he had procured for the dog 's protection in cold latitudes .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 9]: He ransacked two lockers before he found it .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 25]: Several articles were tumbled in a heap on the floor in his haste , and he did not trouble to pack them away again .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 21]: He buckled Joey into the garment , fastened his own oilskins , and rejoined the second officer on the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 16]: A glance showed him the dark wall of the mainsail rising abaft the after funnel .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 28]: The quarter-master at the wheel , having recovered his wits , was keeping the ship 's nose up to the wind by a steady pressure to port .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 8]: The gale was as fierce as ever .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 24]: The second officer shouted in Courtenay 's ear : `` I am afraid , sir , the wind has shifted a point . ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 6]: Courtenay looked at the compass .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 7]: The ship was bearing exactly northeast .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 28]: He had hoped that the sails would enable her to shape due north , at least ; unquestionably some spiteful fiend was urging her headlong to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 29]: Had the wind but veered as much to the south , he might have chanced the run through Concepcion Strait , or even weathered Duke of York Island .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 48]: He nodded to his junior , whose presence on the bridge was a mere matter of form , owing to the powerless condition of the ship and the impenetrable wrack of foam and mist that barred vision ahead , and strode off on a tour of inspection .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 27]: As wind and sea were now beating more directly on the port side , there was some degree of shelter along the covered-in deck to starboard .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 27]: He found that two boats had been cleared of their hamper and lowered on the davits until they could be swung in on the promenade deck .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 20]: The men were thus able to provision them more easily than in their exposed berths on the spar deck .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 37]: He watched the workers for a few minutes , showed them how to stow and lash some biscuit tins more securely , and continued his survey , meaning to look in on Walker and the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 13]: He had to pass the cabins set apart for the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 19]: The ports were lighted , and through one window he could see some one peering out at him .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 47]: Owing to the thickness of the glass and its blurred condition , he could not tell whether the occupant was Elsie or Isobel , or Isobel 's maid , but , whoever it was , a hand seemed to signal to him to open the door .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 13]: He unfastened the bolts , and held a half door slightly ajar .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 27]: Joey , ever eager to be out of the pelting storm , hopped inside , and Courtenay heard Elsie exclaim : `` Good gracious , Joey !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 6]: Where is your life-belt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 7]: `` Do you want anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 7]: asked Courtenay , through the chink .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 5]: Elsie smiled at him .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 25]: She was wrapped in a heavy ulster , and had a Tam o ' Shanter tied firmly on her head by a stout veil .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 13]: `` Mr. Malcolm thought we had better bring life-belts from our cabins .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 13]: I came for mine , and I looked out and saw you .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 12]: I wanted to ask you what had become of Dr. Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 8]: I hope you do n't mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: I am just going to him .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 7]: Would you care to come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 10]: `` Oh , I shall be most pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 11]: `` He is attending the injured men , you know .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 14]: And there are -- others there , who are beyond his help . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 10]: `` Perhaps I may be of some assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 5]: `` Come , then .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 16]: When I open the door , step out quickly and hold tight to that rail .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 10]: And do n't move until I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 13]: His manner was curt enough to please the superioress of a nunnery .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 51]: Elsie was awed instantly by the glimpse she obtained of the flying scud within the narrow area of the saloon lights , but she obeyed directions , and presently found herself clinging desperately to the brass hand-rail which ran , breast high , along the outer wall of her cabin .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 24]: She saw Courtenay kneel to fasten a bolt , and she wondered how a man encumbered with heavy boots could be so active .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 44]: Then she felt an arm grip her tightly round the waist , and she heard a voice , which sounded as if it had traveled down a long corridor , shouting in her ear : `` Lean well back and trust to me .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 4]: Let go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 22]: She had no idea that wind could blow like that , especially when the ship was going in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 22]: It shrieked and whistled and tore at the canvas side-awnings with a vehemence that threatened to rip them from their stays .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 19]: Courtenay held her glued to his left side , and there was something reassuring in his vice-like grasp .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 35]: She had a dim notion that he need not squeeze her quite so earnestly , until she passed a gangway which led to the port side , between the deck cabins and the music-room .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 25]: Then she changed her opinion ; were it not for the strong arm which held her she would have been blown into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 17]: To reach the forward saloon they had to pass the boats near which Courtenay had halted .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 5]: The sailors saw them .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 26]: During the first lull one of the men said : `` The señor captain is escorting one of the English señoritas from the saloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 9]: `` Where is he taking her to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: asked another .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 5]: `` Who knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 11]: `` It will be all the same wherever she is .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 9]: If the ship goes , we go . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 5]: `` Who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 5]: These English are stupid .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: They always try to save women first .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 28]: Once , when I was on the -- '' A few words in Spanish reached them from Mr. Boyle , and they went on with their work .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 13]: But such muttered confidences are eloquent of mischief when the pinch comes .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 37]: At the forward end of the promenade deck , just beneath the bridge , Elsie received another reminder of the force of the wind , which was rendered almost intolerable by the lashing of the spray .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 13]: `` I -- ca n't -- go on , '' she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 14]: Courtenay felt , rather than heard , that she was speaking to him .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 30]: Without further ado , he picked her up in his arms , and deposited her , all flushed and breathless , in the shelter of the fore saloon hatch .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 21]: If she were so anxious to see her friend the doctor , he was determined she should not be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 24]: `` No time for explanations , '' he said , while she tremblingly clutched at a rail which gave support down the companion-way .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 6]: `` Dr. Christobal is below .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: But -- I fear you will find a shocking scene .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 11]: Perhaps you had better let me take you back . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 10]: `` No , no , not on my account .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 9]: I think I am past feeling any sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 16]: I would far rather do something , be of some use , however slight . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 12]: A pungent smell of iodoform came to them up the hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 25]: Joey , who had followed bravely in their wake , and was now a few steps down the stairs , crept back , awed .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 14]: `` At least , let me ask Dr. Christobal if you may come .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 12]: You will be quite safe here if you grip the rail .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 14]: Even if a sea breaks over the hatch it can not touch you .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 5]: May I leave you ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 8]: And do you mind holding Joey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 18]: Elsie detected a return to his earlier manner , and she was grateful to him for it .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 14]: She did not like him so well when he was stern and curt .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 37]: `` That is only reasonable ; but please tell him I shall not be in the way , I know that there are wounded men to be attended , and dead men down there , too .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 11]: I shall not scream or faint , believe me . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 7]: `` I am sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 24]: Not one woman in a thousand could have played and sung to cheer others , as you did after the accident happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 25]: It might have been the reaction from her exciting passage along the deck , but Elsie experienced a sudden warm glow in her face .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 21]: Somehow , it was delightful to hear those words from such a man in the hour of his supremest trial .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 25]: For she realized what it meant to him , even though his life were saved , if the _ Kansas _ became a wreck .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 11]: She stooped , ostensibly to grasp the dog 's collar .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 23]: `` Before you leave me , '' she said , `` let me tell you how sorry I am for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 21]: He ran down the stairs , and entered the small saloon , which had been hastily converted into a hospital .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 18]: Perhaps it would be better described as a mortuary , for it held more dead than living .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 17]: Christobal , aided by two sailors , was wrapping lint round a fireman 's seared arm .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 19]: Happily , there was an abundance of cotton sheets available , and the men tore them into strips .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 29]: But the comparatively small supply of cotton wool carried in the ship 's stores , and in the doctor 's private medicine chest had long since given out .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 6]: `` Miss Maxwell is here .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 24]: She asked me to bring her to you in case she might be able to render you some assistance , '' explained Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 17]: Christobal drew himself upright , with the slowness of an elderly man whose joints are stiffening .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 6]: `` Miss Maxwell here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 10]: he repeated , obviously surprised , if not displeased .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: He waved a hand towards the men laid on mattresses on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: Most were quite motionless ; others writhed in agony .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 11]: `` She can not come -- it is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 7]: `` It is her wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 4]: `` Quite impossible .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 5]: Where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 7]: `` Standing in the companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 27]: Courtenay saw that the girl could do no good now in that chamber of death ; the mere memory of it would be an abiding horror .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 22]: He wanted Christobal himself to send her away , but the doctor had taken off his coat and bared his arms .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 6]: His appearance was grimly business-like .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 17]: `` Will you tell her how much I am obliged to her for her kind thought .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 10]: But you see -- it can not be permitted .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 18]: Please say that I hope to join her in the saloon in a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 6]: My work is nearly ended .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 19]: I am sure you will make her understand that this is not a place for a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 13]: Again he swept the row of silent bodies with a comprehensive hand .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 38]: Yet the trivial thought intruded itself on the sailor that this elegant old Spaniard delegated the task of explanation to him solely because he did not wish to appear before Miss Maxwell in a somewhat disheveled state .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 7]: He dismissed the notion at once .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 5]: `` How many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 13]: he asked , glancing at the quiet forms which bore no bandages .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 5]: `` Eleven , now .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 8]: By the way , just one word .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 6]: What chance have we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 8]: Christobal put the concluding sentence in French .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 13]: Courtenay answered in the same language : `` A very poor one .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 11]: But I shall come to the saloon and warn you .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 12]: That will be only fair , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 4]: `` Most certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 10]: Well -- I may as well finish here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 17]: And the doctor signed to his helpers to lift the next sufferer on to the table .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 6]: Courtenay returned to the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 12]: At the top stood Elsie , looking eagerly for his reappearance .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 28]: A sense of unutterable anguish shook him for a second as he saw the sweet face , instinct with life and beauty , gazing down at him .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 20]: How monstrous it was to think of such a fair woman being battered out of recognition against the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 22]: He bit his lip savagely , and it is to be feared the words he swallowed were not those of supplication .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 33]: But his eyes were calm and his voice well under control when he said : `` Dr. Christobal is captain below there , Miss Maxwell , and he absolutely vetoes your presence .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 14]: He was exceedingly distressed at being compelled to send you such a message .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 22]: However , he will soon explain matters to you in person , as he is coming aft almost at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 4]: Elsie was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 14]: She dreaded the return to the saloon , with its queerly assorted company .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 14]: When she quitted them , they were in a state of indescribable distress .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 67]: Gray and the Englishman were helping the chief steward to adjust life-belts ; but Isobel was in a frenzy of despair , her maid had fainted , de Poincilit and the Spaniards were muttering alternate appeals to the saints and oaths of utter abandonment , and Mrs. Somerville was almost unconscious , while her husband knelt by her side and wrung his hands in abject misery .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 27]: Anything was better than to go back to that woful assembly , yet she choked down a protest and said quietly : `` I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 15]: I am afraid I have been a bother to you , Captain Courtenay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 11]: `` Say , rather , you have given me hope .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 13]: I think Heaven has work for you to do in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 6]: Let me go out first .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 4]: Never mind Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 6]: He can struggle along behind .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 3]: Steady now .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 10]: Head down and lean well against the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 26]: Elsie found , to her amazement , that there was less sense of danger in facing the wind than in being driven along before it .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 18]: Moreover , she had greater confidence during this second transit over the exposed portion of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 16]: She felt Courtenay dragging her on irresistibly until they gained the lee of the smoking-room .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 14]: He let her rest there , beneath the ladder leading to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 10]: Then a strange revulsion of feeling came to him .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 55]: He experienced an overwhelming desire not to be parted from her ; he had a sickening fear that he might never see her again ; so he shouted , very close to her cheek : `` Would you like to sit in my cabin a little while , if I bring Miss Baring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 7]: She thought that would be splendid .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 12]: Courtenay , if any one , would succeed in calming Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 23]: In order to make herself heard she , in turn , had to put her lips quite near to Courtenay 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' she cried , `` I shall be only too pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 12]: But be patient with her ; she is very frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 13]: There is no accounting for the workings of a man 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 21]: Courtenay , at no time a lady 's man , most certainly had other matters to attend to just then .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 12]: Yet here he was thinking only of a woman 's comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 26]: His dismal forebodings were banished by a rush of absurd delight at the thought that he would have an opportunity of speaking to her occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 7]: What a brave girl she was !
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 7]: What a wife for a sailor !
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 26]: In truth , these were mad notions that jostled in his brain when his life and her 's were not worth an hour 's purchase .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 10]: He drew her to the foot of the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 7]: `` Run ahead , Joey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 21]: The dog , a weird little figure leaning forward at a ridiculous angle against the tearing wind , obeyed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 23]: `` Now , you , '' he said to Elsie , `` but wait until I pass you at the top . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 11]: Though her skirts were troublesome , she managed the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 27]: Then she was taken off her feet again , and hardly knew where she was until she found herself in the haven of Courtenay 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 9]: Joey was glad to be there , too .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 9]: He shook himself noisily in his heavy coat .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 14]: `` You wo n't mind if I fasten the door on you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 12]: and the captain so far forgot his anxiety as to smile .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 12]: `` No , indeed , '' and she smiled in response .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 10]: I shall bring Miss Baring in about five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 9]: You wo n't stir till we come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 7]: Face that gale without you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 7]: She almost laughed at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 16]: He bolted the door , and he ran into the chart-house to tap the barometer .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 4]: It moved appreciably .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 4]: It was rising !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 17]: Ah , if only the wind moderated , he could save the _ Kansas _ yet !
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 6]: He glanced at the compass .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 5]: Still the same course .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 11]: Not a fraction of a point gained to the north .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 4]: That was bad .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 9]: The ship was already within the danger zone .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 15]: Pray Heaven for a falling wind , or even a change to the southward !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 24]: Still , it was in an altogether more cheerful mood that he regained the promenade deck and made his way towards the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 23]: He was in the very act of entering the doorway when a shudder ran through the ship , and she lifted slightly .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: Clinging to a rail , he waited , rigid as a statue .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 14]: A second time the great steel hull shook , but much more violently .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 30]: Then the _ Kansas _ ran her nose into a shoal , swung round broadside to the sea , lifted again , struck heavily , and listed to port .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 7]: Courtenay was on the starboard side .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 14]: He heard a yell of dismay from the men attending to the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 6]: Screams came from the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 16]: The sea leaped triumphantly over the rails and nearly smothered him with its dense spray .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 6]: So this was the end ?
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 7]: It had come all too soon .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 12]: And what a place for the ship to be cast away !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 19]: Twenty miles from the nearest land , in the midst of a sea where no boat could live .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 5]: God help them all !
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 31]: CHAPTER V THE KANSAS SUSTAINS A CHECK -- Once , in early days , when Courtenay was a middy on a destroyer , his ship ran ashore on the Manacles .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 40]: After a bump or two , and a noise like the snapping of trees during a hurricane , the little vessel broke her back , and the after part , with the engines , fell away into deep water .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 26]: Courtenay happened to be on the bridge ; the forward half held intact , so he and the other survivors clambered ashore at low water .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 31]: He waited now for the rending of plates , the tearing asunder of stanch steel ribs and cross-beams , which should sound the knell of the ship 's last moments .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 16]: But the _ Kansas _ seemed to be in no hurry to fall in pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 41]: She strained and groaned , and shook violently when a wave pounded her ; otherwise , she lay there like a beaten thing , oddly resembling the living but almost unconscious men stretched on the mattresses in the forward saloon .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: Courtenay did not experience the least fear of death .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 10]: Emotion of any sort was already dead in him .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 47]: He found himself wondering if an unexpectedly strong current , setting to the southeast , had not upset his reckoning -- if there were any broken limbs among the occupants of the saloon -- if Elsie had been injured by being thrown down into his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 11]: He looked at his watch ; it was past eleven .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 8]: In four hours there would be dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 2]: Dawn !
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 15]: In as many minutes he might see the day that is everlasting ... Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 6]: Perhaps not even four minutes !
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 28]: The _ Kansas _ , with a shiver , lifted to the embrace of a heavy sea , lurched to port , and settled herself more comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 7]: The deck assumed an easier angle .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: Now it was possible to walk .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 10]: There were no rocks here , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 39]: Courtenay at once jumped to the conclusion that the powerful current whose existence he suspected had cut out for itself a deep-water channel towards the land , and the ship had struck on the silt of its back-wash .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: Anyhow , the _ Kansas _ was still living .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 7]: The lights were all burning steadily .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 10]: He could detect the rhythmic throb of the donkey-engine .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 11]: He felt it like the faint beat of a pulse .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 19]: In her new position the ship presented less of a solid wall to the onslaught of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 12]: The tumultuous waves began to race past without breaking so fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 6]: Had she started her plates ?
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 9]: Were the holds and engine-room full of water ?
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 14]: If so , Walker and his helpers were already drowning beneath his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 16]: And , when next she moved , the vessel might slip away into the depths !
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 21]: These and kindred thoughts , thoughts without sequence and almost without number , flew through his mind with incredible speed .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 52]: They were lucid and reasoned , their pros and cons equally dealt with -- he could have answered any question on each point were it propounded by a board of examiners -- and all this took place within a few seconds , between the impact of one big wave and another .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 11]: A man rushed by , or tried to do so .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 23]: Courtenay recognized him as a leading stoker who had temporary charge of the donkey-boiler and seized him wrathfully , his eyes ablaze .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 5]: `` Go back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 3]: `` Señor !
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: The ship is lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 10]: `` Go back , and await my orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 11]: He could have strangled the fugitive in his sudden rage .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: The fireman endeavored to gasp his readiness to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 31]: Courtenay relaxed his grip , and , for a time , at least one member of the crew stuck to his post , fearing the mad captain more than death .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 16]: A mob of stewards and kitchen hands came in a torrent up the saloon stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 16]: Courtenay met them , a terrifying figure , and thrust a revolver in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 4]: `` Back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 13]: he shouted , `` or some of you will die here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 8]: Even in their frenzy they believed him .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 19]: The foremost slunk away , and fought in a new terror with those who would urge them on .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 23]: Gray , bleeding from a cut across the forehead , knocked down a man who brutally tore Isobel out of his path .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 24]: Tollemache , a revolver in each hand , set his back against the corner of the saloon at the foot of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 12]: `` I 'm with you , captain , '' he yelled .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 12]: Courtenay saw that he had conquered them -- for the instant .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 5]: He raised his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 9]: `` Behave like men , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 11]: `` You can do no good by crowding the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 17]: I am going to the bridge to see if it is possible to lower the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 15]: Each boat 's crew will be mustered in turn , passengers and men alike .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 19]: If you are cowards now you will throw away what chance there is of saving your lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 8]: His voice rang out like a trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 8]: His attitude cowed while it reassured them .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 15]: Men turned from one to another to ask what the señor captain was saying .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 14]: They understood much , but they wanted to make sure of each word .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 5]: Was there any hope ?
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 27]: Now that the gates of death were opening , he was a god in their eyes -- a god who promised life in return for obedience .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 8]: A revolver barked twice somewhere on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 18]: A bullet smashed one of the windows of the music-room and lodged in a panel behind Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 16]: They all heard the reports , but the captain promptly turned the incident to advantage .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 13]: `` You see we mean to maintain order , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 14]: `` Mr. Malcolm , take care that every one has a lifebelt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 9]: A sort of cheer came from the men .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 13]: Who could fail to believe in a leader so cool and resourceful ?
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 14]: He ran out into the darkness to discover the cause of the shooting .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 13]: A number of sailors and firemen were striving to launch a boat .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 7]: There was a struggle going on .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 19]: He could not distinguish friend from foe in the mêlée , but he threw himself into it fearlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 5]: `` You fools ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 11]: `` You may die soon enough without killing each other .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 4]: Make way there !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 4]: would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 24]: He caught the gleam of an uplifted knife , and struck savagely at the face of the man who would have used it .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 12]: The butt of the revolver caught the sailor on the temple .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 7]: He went down like a stone .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 7]: Courtenay stumbled over another prostrate body .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 9]: It was Mr. Boyle , striving to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 7]: Their eyes met in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 44]: Courtenay stooped and swung the other clear of the fight , for the second and third officers were using their fists , and Walker , even in the hurry of his ascent from the stoke-hold , had not let go of a spanner .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 34]: The yells and curses , the trampling of dim forms swaying in the fight , the roaring of the gale , and the incessant crash of heavy spray made up a ghastly pandemonium .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 55]: It was an orgy of terror , of wild abandon , of hopeless striving on the edge of the pit -- a stupid madness at the best , as the ship 's life-boats on the port side were on the spar deck ; in their panic the men were endeavoring to lower a dingy .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 10]: Yet Courtenay saw that discipline was regaining its influence .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 14]: He thought to inspire confidence and stop useless savagery by a sharp command .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 9]: `` All hands follow me to starboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 5]: The struggle ceased instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 11]: The captain 's order seemed to imply some new scheme .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 31]: Men who , a moment ago , would have killed any one who sought to restrain them from clearing the boat 's falls , now raced pell-mell after their officers .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 16]: No heed was paid to those who lay on the deck , wounded or insensible .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 25]: Herein alone did these Chilean sailors differ from wolves , and wolves have the excuse of fierce hunger when they devour their disabled fellows .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 20]: Still carrying Boyle , Courtenay led the confused horde through a gangway to the higher side of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 11]: `` Swing those boats back to the spar deck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 12]: `` Get falls and tackle ready to lift them to port .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 8]: Do n't lose your heads , men .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 20]: You will all be clear of the ship in ten minutes if you do as you are told . ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 8]: Two officers and a quarter-master sprang forward .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 25]: In an incredibly short space of time the crew were working with redoubled frenzy , but under control , and with a common object .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 14]: For an instant , Courtenay was free to attend to his chief officer .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 9]: He bore him to the lighted saloon companion .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 11]: Boyle was deathly pale under the tan of his skin .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 23]: The captain saw that his own left hand , where it clasped the other round the waist , was covered with blood .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 5]: `` Below there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 10]: `` Bring two men here , Mr. Malcolm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 22]: When the chief steward came he gave directions that Mr. Boyle should be taken to the saloon and Dr. Christobal summoned .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 14]: `` Send some one you can trust to return , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 11]: `` Go then to the lee of the promenade deck .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 7]: You will find others there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 21]: He did not stop to ask himself if solicitude for the unfortunates wounded in the fight were of any avail .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 13]: His mind was clear , the habit of command strong in him .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 12]: Not until the sea claimed him would he cease to rule .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 24]: The clank of pulleys , the cries of the sailors heaving at the ropes , told him that the crew were at work .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 11]: At last he was free to go to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 12]: He found the quarter-master in the chart-house , on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 17]: When the ship struck , the officer of the watch had been thrown headlong to port .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 30]: Recovering his feet before a tumbling sea could fling him overboard , he hauled himself out of danger just in time to take part in the fray on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 11]: He came back now , hurrying to join the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 19]: Courtenay , standing in the shelter of the chart-house , was peering through the flying scud to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 12]: The sea was darker there than it had been for hours .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 30]: Around the ship the surface was milk-like with foam , but beyond the area of the shoal there seemed to be a remote chance for a boat to live .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 17]: `` We 're on a sort of breakwater , sir , '' said the second officer .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 5]: `` Seems like it .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 8]: Is the ship hard and fast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 7]: `` I am afraid so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 8]: `` I think the weather is moderating .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 9]: Go and see how the barometer stands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 11]: `` Steady improvement , sir , '' came the report .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 7]: `` Any water coming in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 9]: `` Mr. Walker said he thought not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 7]: `` Perhaps it does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 8]: Try to get the first life-boat lowered .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: Let her carry as many extra hands as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 6]: We have lost two boats .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 9]: But do not send any women in her .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 13]: If all is well , let them go in the next one .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 7]: Take charge of that yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 14]: `` Would you mind tying this handkerchief tightly just here , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 9]: The second officer held out his left forearm .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 8]: `` Were you knifed , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 3]: asked Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 17]: `` It is not much , but I am losing a good deal of blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 9]: `` The brutes -- the unreasoning brutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 4]: muttered the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 29]: As he knotted the linen into a rough tourniquet the other asked : `` Shall I report to you when the first boat gets away , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 4]: `` No need .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 6]: I shall see what happens .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 13]: When she is clear I shall bring the ladies to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 21]: Pride of race helped these men to talk as collectedly as if the ship were laid alongside a Thames wharf .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 31]: They knew not the instant the _ Kansas _ might lift again and turn turtle , yet they did not dream of deviating a hair 's breadth from their duties .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 13]: The second officer went aft to carry out the captain 's instructions .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 20]: Courtenay followed a little way , passing to leeward of the chart-house , until he reached his own quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 26]: There was no door on that side , but light streamed through a couple of large port-holes across which the curtains had not been drawn .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 4]: He looked in .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 14]: Elsie was leaning against the table to balance herself on the sloping deck .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 7]: She held Joey in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 23]: She seemed to be talking to the dog , who answered in his own way , by trying to lick her face .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 15]: The glass was so blurred that Courtenay could not see that she was crying .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 15]: `` Better wait , '' he muttered , and turned his gaze seaward again .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 27]: Yes , there could be no doubt that the almost unbroken swell within half a cable 's length of the ship promised a possibility of escape .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 9]: There was no telling what dangers lay beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 39]: To his reckoning , the nearest land was twenty miles distant , but the shoal water might extend all the way , and , with a falling wind , waves once disintegrated would not regain any considerable size .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 16]: It was a throw of the dice for life , but it must be taken .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 12]: He indulged in a momentary thought as to his own course .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 10]: Would he leave the ship in the last boat ?
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 42]: Yes , if every wounded man on board were taken off first ; and how could he entertain even a shred of hope that his cowardly crew would preserve such discipline to the end as to permit of that being done ?
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 12]: The answer to his mute question came sooner than he expected .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 65]: He had been standing there alone about five minutes , intently watching the set of the sea , so as to determine the best time for lowering a boat , when , amid the sustained shriek of the wind and the lashing of the spray , he heard sounds which told him that the forward port life-boat was being swung outward on the davits .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 10]: The hurricane deck was a mass of confused figures .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 29]: The two boats to starboard , a life-boat and the jolly-boat , had been carried across the deck in readiness to take the places of the port life-boats .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 15]: A landsman might think that medley reigned supreme ; but it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 16]: Sailor-like work was proceeding with the utmost speed and system , when an accident happened .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 42]: For some reason never ascertained , though it was believed that the men in the leading boat were too anxious to clear the falls and failed to take the proper precautions , the heavy craft pitched stern foremost into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 56]: She sank like a stone , and with her went a number of Chileans ; their despairing yells , coming up from the churning froth , seemed to be a signal for the demoniac passions latent in the crew to burst forth again , this time in a consuming blaze that would not be stayed .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 13]: Each man fought blindly for himself , heedless now of all restrictions .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: The knowledge of this latest disaster spread with amazing rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 12]: Up from the saloon came a rush of stewards and others .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 53]: Overborne in the panic-stricken flight , Gray , Tollemache , Christobal , the French Count and the head steward , not knowing what new catastrophe threatened , brought Mr. Somerville and the almost inanimate women with them , leaving to their fate those who , like Boyle , were unable to move .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 38]: Some of the mob rushed up the bridge companion ; others made for the after ladders used only by sailors ; others , again , swung themselves to the spar deck by the rails and awning standards .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 21]: Even before Courtenay could reach the scene , both the second and third officers were stabbed , this time mortally .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 24]: He saw one of the infuriated mutineers heave the third officer 's body overboard -- a final quittance for some injury previously received .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 39]: He emptied his revolver into the tumbling mass of men , but he was swept aside by the fresh gang from the saloon , and perhaps owed his escape from instant death by falling on the slippery deck .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 39]: He was up again , shouting , entreating , striking right and left , but he felt bitterly that his efforts now were of no avail , and he bethought him that there was only one resource left .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 37]: These frenzied wretches would destroy themselves and all others -- so , if he would save even a few of the lives entrusted to his care , at least one of the boats must be protected .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 12]: The struggle was fiercest for the possession of the two life-boats .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 10]: By a determined effort the jolly-boat might be secured .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 41]: So he ran to obtain help from the few he could trust , from the tiny company of white men he had left in the saloon ; he met them , a forlorn procession , coming up to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 52]: The all-powerful instinct of self-preservation , aided , no doubt , by the stinging , drenching showers of spray , had gone far towards reanimating Isobel and her maid , while Mrs. Somerville , a woman advanced in years , was able to walk , though benumbed with the sudden cold .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 8]: Courtenay unlocked the door of his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 32]: Elsie , her face pale and tear-stained , but outwardly composed , was yet standing near the table , and the dog sprang from her arms the moment his master appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 21]: she said , all of a flutter now that the solitary waiting for a death which came not was ended .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 10]: `` I feared I should never see you again .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 6]: Is the ship lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 11]: The wild soughing of the wind rendered her words indistinct .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 9]: And the captain had no time for explanations .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 5]: `` In here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 23]: he shouted to Gray , who had helped Isobel to enter the chart-room , the first refuge available on this exposed deck .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 6]: `` Sharp with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 13]: he thundered , when Isobel was unwilling to face the storm again .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 10]: The men took their cue from his imperative tone .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 14]: Gray clasped Isobel in his arms and lifted her bodily through the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 6]: The others followed his example .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 11]: Soon the three women were with Elsie in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 24]: Isobel , by sheer reaction from her previous hysteria , was sullen now , and heedless of all considerations save her own misery .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 15]: When she set eyes on Elsie she snapped out : `` You here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 16]: Captain Courtenay brought me to his cabin after our return from the fore saloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 6]: `` Oh , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 10]: And he left me with those devils beneath ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 20]: They both heard Courtenay 's hurried order : `` Leave the ladies here until we can come for them .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 6]: Follow me at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 7]: The door slammed behind the men .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 12]: Even the missionary was fired to action by Courtenay 's manner .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 8]: Elsie helped Mrs. Somerville to a chair .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 39]: Then she turned to Isobel , and said gently : `` It is a slight thing to discuss when any moment may be our last , but the captain placed me here while he went to bring you .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 13]: He had gone only a few seconds when the ship struck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 24]: The crest of a wave combed over the upper works and pounded the solid beams and planks of the cabin until they creaked .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 10]: The ship lifted somewhat as the sea enveloped her .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 8]: `` Oh , this is awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 3]: shrieked Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 11]: `` If I must die , let me die quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 6]: I shall go mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 6]: `` Calm yourself , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 10]: There must be an end of our sufferings soon .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 8]: Perhaps we may escape even yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 6]: `` Yes , I know .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 10]: If any one is saved it will be you .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 13]: You left me down there to take my chance among those fiends .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 14]: You have been here hours , with your precious captain , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 22]: Were he looking after his ship this might not have happened ... Why did I ever come on this wretched vessel ?
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 10]: And with you , who ran away from Ventana !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 8]: I should have been warned by it .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 24]: When he could work me no other evil he sent you ... Oh , you have taken a fine vengeance , Pedro Ventana !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 12]: May you be denied mercy as I am denied it now !
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 4]: ... Go away !
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 9]: If you touch me I shall strike you .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 4]: I hate you !
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 9]: I tell you I am losing my senses .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 13]: Do you wish me to tear your face with my nails ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 27]: Elsie , who would have soothed her distraught friend with a loving hand , drew back in real fear that she was confronted by a maniac .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 13]: The utter outrageousness of this new infliction brought tears to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 13]: Yet she choked back her grief for the sake of the others .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 15]: `` Isobel , darling , please try to control yourself , '' she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 10]: `` Do n't say such cruel things to me .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 6]: You can not mean them .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: I would do anything to serve you .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 10]: I am more sorry for you than for myself .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 15]: I have little to bind me to this life , whereas you have everything .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 15]: Indeed , indeed , I have not been away from you many minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 7]: Another heavy sea pitched on board .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 9]: The _ Kansas _ trembled and listed suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 13]: Isobel screamed shrilly , and burst into a storm of dry-eyed sobs .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 10]: Her mood changed instantly into one of abject submission .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 8]: She sprang towards Elsie with hands outstretched .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 10]: `` Oh , save me , save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 11]: `` God knows I am not fit to die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 18]: There are some noble natures which find strength in the need to comfort the weakness of others .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 17]: Elsie drew the distracted girl close to her , and placed an arm round her neck .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 17]: `` It is not for us to say when we shall die , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 8]: `` Let us try to be resigned .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 11]: We must bear our misfortunes with Christian faith and hope .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 18]: Somehow , I feel that I have endured so much to-night that death looks less terrible now .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 9]: Perhaps that is because it is so near .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 11]: To me , the specter seems to be receding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 16]: `` Did the captain tell you we had any chance of escape , señorita ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 5]: asked the Spanish maid .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 10]: `` What hope did Captain Courtenay hold out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 15]: demanded Mrs. Somerville , who had listened to Isobel 's raving with small comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 9]: Elsie left unuttered the protest on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 14]: They all thought she possessed Courtenay 's confidence in the same extraordinary degree .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 12]: Well , she would try to impart consolation in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 9]: It was ridiculous , but it would serve .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 45]: `` Of course we are in a desperate situation , '' she said , `` but while the ship holds together there is always a chance of rescue , and you can see quite clearly that she is far from breaking up yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 3]: `` Rescue !
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 7]: Did he speak of rescue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 3]: cried Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 12]: `` That is impossible , unless we take to the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 20]: And the cry in the saloon was that two boats were lost long ago and a third just now .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 9]: That is why we were brought on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 7]: Were they launching a boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 12]: `` I was here quite alone , except for Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 8]: `` Ah , it was true then .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 19]: He was acting secretly , and the men broke loose as soon as they heard of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 20]: Elsie found this recurring suspicion of Courtenay 's motives harder to bear than the preceding paroxysm of unreasoning rage .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 50]: She had heard the shooting , bellowing , and tramping on deck , and she knew that some terrible scene was being enacted there , while the mere fact that the captain himself placed the female passengers in his cabin proved that he was doing his best for all .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 42]: `` I do not believe for one instant that Captain Courtenay was acting otherwise than as a brave and honorable gentleman , '' she said ; and then the fantastic folly of such a dispute at such a moment overcame her .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 18]: She drew apart from Isobel , leaned against the wall of the cabin , and wept unrestrainedly .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 22]: Her companions in misfortune did not realize how greatly her calm self-reliance had comforted them until they witnessed this unlooked-for collapse .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 53]: The Spanish maid slipped to her knees , Mrs. Somerville began to rock in her chair in a new agony , and Isobel , to whom a turbulent spirit denied the relief of tears when they were most needed , buried her face in a curtain which draped one of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 26]: It was thus that Courtenay found them , when he appeared at the door after a lapse of time which none of them could measure .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 26]: `` Now , Miss Maxwell , you first , '' he said with an air of authority which betokened some new move of utmost importance .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 7]: `` First -- for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 5]: she managed to ask .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 9]: `` You are going off in a boat .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 6]: It is your best chance .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 5]: Please be quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 9]: `` No , Miss Baring goes before me .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 10]: Then the others , I shall come last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 7]: `` Have it as you will .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 10]: I addressed you because you were nearest the door .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 7]: Come along , Miss Baring . ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 7]: He waited for no further words .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 13]: He grasped Isobel 's arm and led her out into the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 12]: It seemed to be a very long time before he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 24]: `` Now , Mrs. Somerville , '' he said , but that unhappy lady was so unnerved that he had to carry her .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 10]: `` Can you manage to bring the maid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 8]: he asked over his shoulder to Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 17]: This trust in her drove away the weakness which had conquered her under Isobel 's taunts .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 34]: She stooped over the maid , but the girl wrestled and fought with her in frantic dread of the passage along the deck and of facing that howling sea in a small boat .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 11]: Elsie herself was almost worn out when Courtenay came back .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 9]: He took in the situation at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 11]: He picked up the shrieking maid in his strong arms .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 15]: `` You wo n't mind waiting for me , '' he said to Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 8]: `` Do n't attempt to come alone .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 6]: You are too exhausted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 23]: It was a fine thing to do , but she smiled at him to show that she could still repay his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 10]: `` I shall wait , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 19]: So she was left there , all alone again , without even the dog to bear her company .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 27]: CHAPTER VI -- BUT GOES ON AGAIN INTO THE UNKNOWN This final waiting for the chance of succor seemed to be the hardest trial of all .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 24]: The door had been hooked back to keep it wide open , so wind and sea invaded the trim privacy of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 28]: Spray leaped over the ship in such dense sheets that a considerable quantity of water quickly lodged on the port side where Courtenay 's bunk was fixed .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 47]: There was no means of escape for it in that quarter , and the angle at which the _ Kansas _ lay would permit a depth of at least two feet to accumulate ere the water began to flow out through the door to the starboard .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 17]: At the great crises of existence the stream of thought is apt to form strange eddies .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 46]: Courtenay , when the ship struck , and it was possible that each second might register his last conscious impression , found himself coolly reviewing various explanations of the existence of an uncharted shoal in a locality situate many miles from the known danger zone .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 93]: Elsie , strung half-consciously to the highest tension by the affrighting probability of being set adrift in a small boat at the mercy of the sea roaring without -- a sea which pounded the steel hull of the _ Kansas _ with such force that the great ship seemed to flinch from each blow like a creature in pain -- Elsie , then , faced by such an intolerable prospect , was a prey to real anxiety because the wearing apparel scattered by Courtenay on the floor was becoming soaked in brine .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 15]: She actually stooped to rescue a coat which was not yet saturated beyond redemption .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 21]: As she lifted the garment , a packet of letters , tied with a tape , fell from its folds .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 18]: She placed the coat on the writing-table , and endeavored to stuff the letters into a pigeon-hole .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 13]: They were too bulky , so she laid them on the coat .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 32]: In doing this she could not avoid seeing the words , `` Your loving sister , Madge , '' written on the outer fold of the last letter in the bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 56]: And that brought a memory of her previous visit to the captain 's stateroom ; the contrast between the careless chatter of that glorious summer afternoon and the appalling midnight of this fourth day of the voyage was something quite immeasurable ; it was marked by a void as that which separates life and death .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: She was incapable of reasoned reflection .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 40]: A series of mental pictures , a startling jumble of ideas -- trivial as the wish to save the clothes from a wetting , tremendous as the near prospect of eternity -- danced through her brain with bewildering clearness .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 30]: She felt that if she were fated to live to a ripe old age she would never forget a single detail of the furniture and decorations of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 53]: She would hear forever the dolorous howling of the gale , the thumping of the waves against the quivering plates , the rapid , methodic thud of the donkey-engine , which , long since deserted by its cowardly attendant , was faithfully doing its work and flooding the ship with electric light .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 36]: She could scarcely believe that it was she , Elsie Maxwell , who stood there on the tremulous island of the ship amidst a stormy ocean the like of which she had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 52]: She seemed to possess an entity apart from herself , to be a passive witness of events as in a dream ; presently , she would awake and find that she was back in her pleasant room at the Morrisons ' hacienda , or tucked up in her own comfortable cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 14]: Yet here was proof positive that the terror which environed her was real .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 44]: Bound up with the thunder of the gale were the words , `` Your loving sister , Madge '' -- evidently the sister Captain Courtenay had spoken of -- `` matron of a hospital in the suburbs of London , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 7]: Would he ever see her again ?
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 4]: Or his mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 13]: Had he thought of them at all during this night of woe ?
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 32]: Beneath his iron mask did tears lurk , and dull agony , and palsied fear -- surely a man could suffer like a woman , even though he endured most nobly ?
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 20]: And then , not thinking in the least what she was doing , she scrutinized the closely tied packet .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 10]: She wondered idly why he treasured so many missives .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 18]: Each and every one , oddly enough , was written on differently sized and variously colored note-paper .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 17]: And it could be seen at a glance that they were from as many different people .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 9]: The outside letter was the most clearly visible .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 9]: Miss Courtenay wrote a well-formed , flowing hand .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 18]: If handwriting were a clue to character , she was a candid , generous , open-minded woman .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 5]: But what was this ?
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: Elsie suddenly threw down the letters .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 19]: She had read a sentence at the top of the page twice before she actually grasped its purport .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 11]: When its significance dawned on her , she flushed violently .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 37]: For this was what she read : `` I am glad of it , too , because under no other circumstances would I wish to greet and embrace the woman destined to be your wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 27]: The knowledge that she had involuntarily intruded on Captain Courtenay 's private affairs brought her back with a certain slight shock to a sense of actualities .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 14]: The storm , the horrible danger she was in , emerged from shadow-land .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 8]: Why had he not come for her ?
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 9]: Surely there must have been some further mishap !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 2]: Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 17]: Was she alone on the ship , alone with the dead men and the dying vessel ?
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 17]: Her head swam with a strange faintness , and she placed a hand to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 22]: She felt that she must leave the cabin at once , and strive to make her way unaided along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 10]: Yes , whatever happened , she would go now .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 16]: It was too dreadful to wait there any longer in ignorance as to her fate .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 37]: Then Joey sprang in through the doorway , and , with that splendid disregard for sentiment displayed by a fox-terrier who has just come out of a first-rate fight , shook his harness until it rattled .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 38]: But he eyed the inrush of the sea with much disfavor , so he leaped up on the table beside Elsie , and looked at her as though he would ask why she had permitted this sacrilege .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 20]: Though the dog was apparently unscathed and in the best of condition , his head and forepaws were blood-stained .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 14]: His advent dispelled the mist which was gathering in the girl 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 32]: She feared a tragedy , yet Joey assuredly would not be so cheerful , so daintily desirous to avoid the splashing water in the cabin , if his master were injured .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 12]: She was doubtful now whether to go on deck or not .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 17]: The mere presence of the dog was a guarantee that Courtenay had not quitted the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 18]: Indeed , Elsie colored again , and more deeply , at the disloyalty of her ungoverned fear .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 19]: Joey 's master would be the last man to desert a woman , no matter what the excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 36]: She strove to listen for any significant noises without , but wind and sea rendered the effort useless to untrained ears , and there was no shooting or frenzied yells to rise above the storm .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 17]: `` Oh , Joey , '' she said , `` I wish you could speak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 9]: The sound of her own voice startled her .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 12]: In a fashion , it gave her a measure of time .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 12]: It seemed so long since she had heard a spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 15]: The captain could certainly have gone round the whole ship since he left her .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 6]: What could have detained him ?
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 48]: She was yielding to nervousness again , and was on the point of venturing out , at least as far as the deck-house ran , to see if she could distinguish what was taking place on the after part of the vessel , when Dr. Christobal entered .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 31]: `` I suppose you thought you were forgotten , '' he cried with a pleasant smile , for Christobal would have a smile for a woman even on his death-bed .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 5]: `` There , now !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 8]: Do n't try to explain your feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 20]: You have had a very trying time , and I want you to oblige me by drinking this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 31]: `` This '' was a glass of champagne , which he hurriedly poured out of a small bottle he was carrying into a glass which he produced from a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 22]: The trivial action , no less than Dr. Christobal 's manner , suggested that they were engaged in some fantastic picnic .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 10]: The outer horrors were not for them , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 27]: They were as secure as sight-seers in the Cave of the Winds , awe-smitten tourists who cling to a rail while mighty Niagara thunders harmlessly overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 21]: The mere sight of the wine caused Elsie to realize that her lips and palate were on fire with salt .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 27]: At one moment she had not the slightest cognizance of her suffering ; at the next , she felt that speech was impossible until she drank .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 9]: Never before had she known what thirst was .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 21]: A somewhat inferior vintage suddenly assumed a bouquet which surpassed the finest cru ever dreamt of by Marne valley vigneron .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 12]: `` Ah , that is better , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 17]: `` Now , if you do n't mind , we shall have the door closed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 25]: With peace suddenly restored to the room , and her faculties helped more than she suspected , Elsie began to wonder what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 7]: `` Where are the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 13]: she asked ; `` and why are you taking things so coolly ?
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 14]: Captain Courtenay said -- '' `` Captain Courtenay said exactly what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 8]: But circumstances proved too strong for him .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 13]: We shall not be able to leave the ship just yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 11]: `` Ca n't they lower any of the boats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 4]: `` Most decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 8]: Two boats have been gone some time .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 6]: I imagined you knew that .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 8]: Did not the captain tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 20]: At another time Elsie would have laughed at the prevalent delusion that she enjoyed Courtenay 's confidence so thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 12]: But she felt that her companion 's glib tone was artificial .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: Something had occurred which he was keeping from her .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 28]: She believed that he had gone to the saloon to procure the wine so that she might have what men called Dutch courage when bad news came .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 25]: `` I have not exchanged a dozen words with the captain since you refused my help in the fore cabin , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 17]: `` He had other matters to attend to than explaining the progress of events to me .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 7]: Why can not you trust me ?
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 26]: I shall not scream , nor faint , nor hinder you in your work ; I ask you again -- Where are the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 10]: `` You mean Miss Baring and Mrs. Somerville ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 15]: `` If they are living , they are far enough away by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 16]: When their boat was lowered it was cast off prematurely -- '' `` Purposely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 5]: `` Well -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 20]: Courtenay had just placed Miss Baring 's maid on board when some of the crew let go the ropes .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 5]: What could we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 9]: We were forced to depend on them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 8]: `` Is there no other boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 10]: Christobal threw out his hands in his characteristic gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: He was so emphatic that he spilled some of the wine .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 10]: `` You take it bravely , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 11]: `` I may as well give you the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 18]: The first boat lowered was lost , through the men 's own bungling , the captain says .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 12]: Then there was a desperate fight for the three remaining craft .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 7]: Most of the officers were killed .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 31]: Courtenay got a few of us together when Isobel and Mrs. Somerville joined you here , and we held off such of the madmen as tried to seize the jolly-boat .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 24]: They managed to lower two life-boats , but , between murder and panic , not half of the crew escaped in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 30]: Four men , who were left behind , promised obedience , and Malcolm , the steward , was placed in charge , with Mr. Gray as second in command .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 29]: One of the engineers , acting on the captain 's orders , brought a can of oil from the engine-room and threw it over the side in handfuls .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 5]: The result was magical .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 49]: We lowered the boat easily , placed Monsieur de Poincilit on board , because he was worse than the women , and then Courtenay , as you know , brought Isobel , the minister 's wife -- who refused to go without her husband -- and the maid .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 24]: There was room for you and another , so , at the captain 's request , Tollemache and I tossed for the vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 33]: Meanwhile , Courtenay had turned to go for you , when we heard a shout from Gray ; two of the Chileans had cast off the ropes which kept the boat alongside .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 28]: Gray , who was fending her from the ship with the boat-hook , jabbed one fellow in the face with it ; but he was too late .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 8]: The boat raced off into the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 6]: And here we are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 11]: That Christobal left several things unsaid Elsie knew quite well .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 27]: He plumed himself on the reserve he had acquired from his English mother , though in all matters pertaining to nationality he was a true hidalgo .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 27]: Indeed , there was a touch of vanity in the way he examined the sparkle of the champagne he now poured into Elsie 's empty glass .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 11]: He scrutinized the wine with the air of a connoisseur .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 15]: He was looking for the gas to rise in three or four well-defined spirals .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 25]: And he nodded doubtfully , before drinking it , as one might say : `` The right brand , but of what year ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 23]: Then it dawned on the girl that both her elderly friend and she herself were accepting an extraordinary situation with remarkable nonchalance .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 11]: `` How many of us remain on the ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: `` Very few -- on the effective list .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 23]: The captain , an engineer whose name I do not know , Mr. Tollemache , and ourselves make up the total . ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 7]: `` Where is Mr. Boyle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 6]: `` Ah , poor Boyle !
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 7]: I fear he is done for .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: He is very badly wounded .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 18]: I bandaged him as well as I could , but the call on deck was imperative . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 7]: `` Is he in the saloon ?
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 8]: Should we not go to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 8]: `` I have only just left him .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 12]: The hemorrhage has stopped , and I gave him some brandy .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 11]: Believe me , we can do nothing more for him .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 15]: I told Courtenay it was quite useless to place him on board the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 10]: You may be sure he was not forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 49]: `` I did not imagine that any one would be forgotten , '' said Elsie , and , for some reason , the light in her eyes caused Christobal to go on rapidly : `` We have a whole crowd of injured men on board , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 9]: At present we can render them no aid .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 8]: I thought it wisest to obey orders .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 15]: The captain told me to bring you some wine and remain with you here .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 8]: It will not be for long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 8]: `` Why do you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 16]: `` The ship appears to be lodged hard and fast on a reef or sandspit .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 8]: I am told the tide is rising .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 20]: If that is so , our only hope is in the raft which our three allies are now constructing .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 13]: With a falling tide we might have a breathing-space at low water .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 26]: As it is , well -- '' Christobal , with a bottle in one hand and a glass in the other , nevertheless waved them .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 42]: Elsie , whose nervous system at this juncture was proof against any but the last pang of imminent death , could almost have laughed at the queer figure he cut , brandishing his arms and standing awkwardly on the inclined deck .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 46]: She bent her head to hide the smile on her lips ; she noticed that Joey was panting , the use of his teeth on various wet legs during the tussle for the jolly-boat having caused him to swallow more salt-water than he cared for .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 6]: Elsie 's sympathies were aroused .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 11]: While assuaging her own thirst she had neglected the dog .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 24]: She took a carafe of water from its wooden stand near the table , and poured some of the contents into a tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: Joey 's thanks were ecstatic .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 12]: He yelped with delight at the mere thought of a drink .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 20]: While the dog was lapping a second supply , the _ Kansas _ shifted again with a disconcerting suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 19]: The water in the cabin swirled across the floor as the ship was restored to an even keel .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 8]: The movement dislodged the packet of letters .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 11]: It fell , and Elsie rescued it a second time .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 7]: Christobal watched her with undisguised admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 14]: `` Really , '' he said , `` I find you wonderful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 15]: Certainly she might be pardoned for seeking an explanation of any compliment just then .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 3]: Por Dios !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 9]: Excuse me , but that slipped out sideways .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 34]: Just imagine any woman being able to attend to a dog and pick up a bundle of letters at the very instant the ship appeared to be slipping off into deep water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 12]: `` Is not that the best thing that can happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 12]: `` My dear young lady , we should sink instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 23]: `` Well -- er -- I do n't exactly know , but I assume that the hull was broken long since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 13]: `` I do n't see why you should take that for granted .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 10]: These very movements seem to me to argue buoyancy .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 31]: Somehow , I feel far safer here than if I were -- '' She was interrupted by the opening of the door , and the consequent roar of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 27]: It was Walker , the engineer , a lank , swarthy man , with long black mustaches which drooped forlornly down the sides of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 19]: He shouted , with the inimitable accent of Tyneside : `` Yo ' wanted , Docto ' Chwistobal .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 9]: The captain thinks Mr. Boyle is bettaw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 8]: `` May I come , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 3]: asked Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 5]: `` No , missie .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 5]: You bide he-aw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 16]: `` Please tell me before you go -- is the ship full of water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 12]: `` She 's dwy as a bone , '' said Walker .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 13]: A sea splashed over him and sent a shower into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 44]: `` A vewy wet bone , '' he added , with a broad grin , for the Northumbrian had a ready wit though he had such a solemn jowl , and he could not pronounce an `` r '' to save his life .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 22]: `` Between you and the captain , I am beginning to be infected by belief , '' said Christobal to Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 13]: `` Let me recommend you to close the door behind us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 12]: And she was left with the dog for company once more .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 10]: A chronometer showed that the hour was past midnight .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 32]: She knew sufficient of the sea to understand that the clock was probably accurate , as the course had practically followed the same meridian since the _ Kansas _ quitted Valparaiso .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 14]: So the ship and those left on board had entered on another day !
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 25]: How little she had thought that to be possible when the awful knowledge first came to her that the _ Kansas _ was ashore !
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 6]: How long ago was that ?
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 29]: Then she remembered that when Courtenay placed her in his cabin with the promise to bring Isobel to her , she had noticed the time -- eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 34]: Was it conceivable that only one hour had elapsed since she and her four-footed friend were flung all of a heap into a corner by the impact of the vessel against the sand-bank ?
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 3]: One hour !
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 33]: Surely there was some mistake ; she puzzled over the problem , recounting each event since the conclusion of dinner , and finally convinced herself that her recollection was not at fault .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 9]: An hour -- one of eternity 's hours !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 37]: A verse of the 90th Psalm came to her mind : `` For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 11]: The words had a new and solemn meaning to her .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 25]: Yesterday was her thousand years -- this was her watch in the night -- and it would pass as a tale that is told .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 31]: Involuntarily she turned to the bookcase behind her , and took the Bible from the little library of books which she had laughingly described as `` a curious assortment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 40]: It was her intent to find the psalm containing that awe-inspiring verse , and read the whole of it , but , in turning over the leaves , she came upon a scrap of paper with notes on it .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 7]: The handwriting was scholarly and legible .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 13]: She thought that Captain Courtenay would probably write just such a hand .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 36]: Though her cheeks tingled a little at the memory of the words in his sister 's letter , there was no harm in reading a memorandum evidently intended to mark a passage in the book .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 30]: The items were sufficiently striking : -- `` Meribah -- a place of strife ; Selah -- a repetition , or sort of musical _ da capo _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 8]: This stirred her to seek an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 57]: She searched the two pages which opened at the marker , and , in the seventh verse of the 81st Psalm , she found the key : `` Thou calledst in trouble , and I delivered thee ; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder ; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 3]: Selah . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 10]: The phrases were strangely appropriate to her present environment .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 30]: They were almost prophetic , and there was even a sinister sound in the concluding instruction to the `` chief musician upon Gittith '' in this psalm of Asaph .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 9]: That was the terrible feature of her vigil .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 11]: There was no knowing when or how it would end .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 27]: She closed the book in a state more closely approximating to hysterical fright than she had been at any previous time during that most trying night .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 34]: The truth was , though she could not realize it , that her senses were far too alert , her brain too preoccupied , to permit of such an ordered task as reading .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 24]: In her mind 's eye , she saw the boats , with their cowering occupants , plunging and tossing in that frenzied sea .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 12]: By contrast , she was far better off on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 23]: Yet , were it not for the action of some cowardly Chilean , she must have gone with Isobel and the others .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 23]: It was torturing to think that her fancied security was really more perilous than the more apparent plight of the storm-tossed boats .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: No wonder she could not read , though the words were inspired !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 6]: And Joey was becoming restless .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 18]: He danced backwards and forwards on the table where he had taken refuge from the invading flood .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 19]: Indeed , the dog knew , long before Elsie , that the _ Kansas _ was afloat again .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 33]: At last she noticed that the water in the cabin was gurgling to and fro , and , in the same instant , she felt the regular swing of the moving ship .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 24]: She was speculating on the outcome of this new condition of affairs when the door opened and Walker thrust his lantern-jawed face within .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 4]: He grinned cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 18]: `` I 've come to fetch you to yo ' cabin , miss , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 29]: `` The ship 's under weigh , an ' , as yo ' pwobably winging wet , the captain says you ought to change yo ' clo'es . ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 10]: Joey followed her out , but deserted her instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 15]: She saw the reason , when Walker helped her to reach the bridge companion .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 10]: Courtenay was in the chart-house , at the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 10]: He gave her a friendly nod as she passed .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 17]: Somehow , Elsie felt safe now that the ship was in the captain 's hands again .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 52]: CHAPTER VII UNTIL THE DAWN Walker was about to take her to the saloon , whence an inner staircase communicated with the principal staterooms , but she knew that the door leading to the promenade deck had been left unlocked , so she signaled him to lead her the speediest way .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 5]: Speak she could not .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 27]: Although there was a perceptible improvement in the weather , Elsie found the wind even harder to combat than when she traversed the deck with Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 35]: This apparent contradiction arose from the fact that during their early dealing with the boats the sailors had cut away the greater part of the canvas shield rigged to protect passengers from adventurous seas .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 27]: Nevertheless , all flustered and breathless as she was , she held Walker back when he would have left her in the shelter of her cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 11]: `` Do spare me one moment , '' she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 15]: `` When I have put on dry clothing , what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 6]: Where am I to go ?
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 10]: I will do anything rather than remain alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 17]: Walker jammed himself in the doorway to break the violence of the unceasing deluge of spray .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 33]: `` Well , missie , '' he said , `` I 'm examining the engines , Mistaw Tollemache is fi-wing up the donkey-boiler , an ' Doctaw Chwistobal is with Mistaw Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 19]: You know whe-aw the captain is , so I weckon yo ' best place is the saloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 11]: `` Dr. Christobal said you were making a raft ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 5]: `` That 's wight .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 12]: But when the ship got off , we tackled othaw jobs .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 7]: She is ow-ah best waft . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 13]: `` And -- do you think -- we have any chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 9]: `` Nevah say ` die , ' missie .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 7]: Owt can happen at sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 12]: She made a guess at the meaning of `` owt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 13]: `` May I not look after some of the injured men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 13]: `` That you ca n't , '' was Walker 's prompt assurance .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 9]: `` You 'd bettaw stick to the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 10]: I 'll tell the captain yo ' the-aw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 4]: `` Tell him ?
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 8]: Are you returning to the bridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 4]: `` Telephone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 16]: shouted Walker , as an unusually heavy sea caused him to slam the door unceremoniously .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 6]: He bolted it , too .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 17]: Not if he could help it would his charge come out on that storm-swept deck unattended .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 20]: The electric light glowed brightly in Elsie 's cabin , exactly as she had left it an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 11]: This was one of the anomalous conditions of the disaster .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 14]: It lent a queer sense of Midsummer madness to the night 's doings .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 30]: In a few days it would be Christmas , the Christmas of sunshine and flowers known only to that lesser portion of the habitable earth south of the line .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 21]: In Valparaiso the weather was stifling , yet here , not so very far away , it was bitterly cold .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 41]: And the ship was driving headlong to destruction , though electric bells and switches were at command in a luxuriously furnished apartment , while the engineer had just spoken of the telephone as a means of conversing with the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 18]: Away down in her feminine heart the girl wondered why Courtenay himself had not come to her .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 10]: Why had he sent Christobal first and Walker subsequently ?
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 34]: Oh , of course he had more urgent matters to attend to , though , in the helpless condition of the ship , it was difficult to appreciate their precise degrees of importance .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 25]: Anyhow , he had sent word that she was to change her clothes , and he must be obeyed , as Dr. Christobal said .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 47]: Then she discovered , as a quite new and physically disagreeable fact , that her skirts were soaked up to her knees , while her blouse was almost in the same condition owing to the quantity of spray which had run down inside her thick ulster .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 36]: It was an absurd thing to be afraid of after all she had endured , but Elsie cried a little when she realized that she had been literally wet to the skin without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 45]: In truth , she had a momentary dread of a fainting fit , and it was not until she untied the veil which held her Tam o ' Shanter in its place that she learnt how the knot had come near to suffocating her .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 13]: The prompt relief thus afforded brought an equally absurd desire to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 16]: She yielded to that somewhat , but busied herself in procuring fresh clothing and boots .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 24]: The outcome of the pleasant feeling of warmth and comfort was such as the girl herself would not have guessed in a week .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 13]: The mere grateful touch of the dry garments induced an extraordinary drowsiness .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 13]: She felt that she must lie down -- just for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 17]: She stretched herself on the bed , closed her eyes , and was straightway sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 19]: At the captain 's suggestion , Christobal had given her a strong dose of bromide in the wine !
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 5]: It was better so .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 31]: If the ship were dashed to pieces against the rocks which unquestionably lay ahead , Elsie would be whirled to the life eternal before she quite knew what was happening .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 61]: If , on the other hand , some miracle of the sea enabled the men to construct a seaworthy raft in time , or the rising tide permitted the _ Kansas _ to escape , in so far as to run ashore again in a comparatively sheltered position , she would be none the worse for an hour 's sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 20]: And now that the ship was afloat , there were things to be done which only men could do .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 15]: The saloon , the decks , the forecabin , were places of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 41]: Fearing lest Elsie might pass , Christobal , before attending to Boyle , had thrown table-cloths over the bodies of men slain in the saloon , for Gray and Tollemache had sternly but vainly striven to repress the second revolt .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 23]: Tollemache and Walker had dragged out of the smothering spray near the port davits three men who seemed to be merely stunned .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 30]: These , with the chief officer , and perhaps four survivers of the explosion , made up the list of living but non-effective members of the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 53]: There was one other , Gulielmo Frascuelo , who was bawling for dear life in his bunk in the forecastle , but in that dark hour no one chanced to remember him , and it needed more than a human voice to pit itself against the hurricane which roared over the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 31]: The unhappy wretch knew that something out of the ordinary had taken place , and he was scared half out of his wits by the continued absence of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 24]: Luckily for himself , he did not appreciate the real predicament of the ship , or he would have raved himself into madness .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 13]: Walker , in his brief catalogue of occupations , had suppressed one .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 20]: To make sure , Christobal closed a water-tight bulkhead door which cut off the principal staterooms from the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 14]: Then he and his two helpers carried out a painful but necessary task .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 13]: It was his duty to certify whether or not life was extinct .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 6]: There were very few exceptions .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 11]: The three men lifted the bodies and threw them overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 63]: When they reached the corpses of the second officer and a Spanish engineer who had been knifed in the defense of the jolly-boat -- his comrade had scrambled into one of the life-boats -- Tollemache took possession of such money , documents , and valuables as were in their pockets , intending to draw up an inventory when an opportunity presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 26]: Though they knew not the moment when a sickening crash would herald the final dissolution of the ship , they proceeded with their work methodically .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 10]: In half an hour they had reached the end .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 23]: All the injured men -- seven nondescript sailors and firemen -- were carried to the saloon and placed under Christobal 's care .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 54]: Walker dived below to the engine-room , where he had already disconnected the rods broken or bent by the fracture of a guard ring , which , in its turn , was injured by the blowing out of a junk-ring , a stout ring of forged steel secured to one of the pistons .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 8]: He could do nothing more on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 32]: Whether he was destined to live fifty seconds or as many years he was ill content to hear his beloved engines knocking themselves to pieces with each roll of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 64]: Tollemache , who undertook the firing of the donkey-boiler , which was situated on the main deck aft of the saloon -- for the _ Kansas _ was built chiefly to accommodate cargo -- during his wanderings round the world had picked up sufficient knowledge of steam-power to shovel fuel into the furnace and regulate the water-level by the feed valve and pump .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 20]: The small engine , more reliable and quite as powerful as a hundred men , was in perfect order .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 43]: It abounded in valves and taps , but Walker 's parting instructions were explicit : `` Keep yo ' eye on the glass , an ' pitch in a shovel of coal evewy ten minutes : she 'll do the west . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 36]: So the new hand , satisfied that the gage was correct and the furnace lively , lit his pipe , sat down , and began to jot in a note-book the contents of his coat-pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 35]: The Spaniard 's letters he could not read , though he gathered that one of them was from a wife in Vallodolid , who would travel overland early in January to meet her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 9]: But the Englishman 's correspondence was terribly explicit .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 27]: A `` heart-broken mother '' wrote from Liverpool that `` Jack '' had been shot during one of the many cold-weather campaigns on the Indian frontier .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 14]: `` I have no news , simply a telegram from the War Office .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 11]: But of what avail to know how my darling died .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 6]: My tears are blinding me .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 15]: You and I alone are left , and you are thousands of miles away .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 20]: May the Lord be merciful to me , a widow , and bring you home to comfort me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 14]: Yet the knife which killed him must have gone very near that letter .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 10]: Tollemache tried to grip his pipe in his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 3]: He failed .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 7]: It fell on the iron floor .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 8]: `` Oh , this is rotten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 9]: `` Why could n't he have been spared ?
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 7]: No one would have missed me .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 10]: I do n't suppose Jennie would care tuppence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 7]: The _ Kansas _ rolled heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 19]: He waited a few seconds for the expected shock , but she swung back to an even keel .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 15]: Then he stooped to pick up his pipe , and his mouth hardened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 4]: ` Spared ! '
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 4]: by gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 5]: `` What rot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 15]: That roll of the ship was caused by an experimental twist of the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 21]: Courtenay , peering into the darkness through the open window of the chart-house , saw that the weather was clearing .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 24]: He had evolved a theory , and , for want of a better , he was determined to pursue it to a finish .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 17]: The _ Kansas _ was being swiftly carried along in a strong and deep tidal current .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 24]: Happily , the wind followed the set of the sea , else there would be no chance of success for his daring plan .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 49]: His expedient was the desperate one of keeping the vessel in the line of the current , and , if day broke before he reached the coast , he would steer for any opening which presented itself in the fringe of reefs which must assuredly guard the mainland .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 54]: With his hands grasping the taut and , in one sense , irresponsive mechanism of a steering-wheel governed by steam , a sailor can `` feel '' the movement of his ship , a seaworthy vessel being a living thing , obedient as a docile horse to the least touch of the rein .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 48]: But , in the unlikely event of fortune favoring Courtenay to the extent of giving him an opportunity to see the coming danger , it was essential that the ship should have a certain radius of action apart from the direction and force of the ocean stream .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 23]: The two sails were helpful , and it was to assure himself of their efficiency that he put the helm to starboard .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 30]: The _ Kansas _ obeyed with an answering roll to port , showing clearly that she was traveling a little faster than the inrushing tide would take her unaided .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 22]: He brought her head back to nor ` east again , and glanced over his shoulder at the ship 's chronometer .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 7]: It was a quarter to one .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 15]: Two hours must pass before he would discern the first faint streaks of light .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 41]: At any rate , if he were spared to greet the dawn , it would be right ahead , and , as a few seconds might then be of utmost value , that was a small point in his favor .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 5]: Yet , two hours !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 11]: Could he dare to hope for so long a respite ?
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 23]: How could the ship escape the unnumbered fangs which a storm-torn land thrust far out into the Pacific for its own protection ?
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 27]: He was quite sheltered from the wind and spray in the chart-house , and , all at once , he became aware of a burning thirst .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 18]: There was water in a decanter close at hand , so he indulged in a long drink .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 5]: That was wonderfully vivifying .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 8]: Then his mind turned longingly to tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 30]: For the first time in his life he broke the strict rule of the service in which he had been trained -- and smoked a cigar while on duty .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 10]: Now and again he spoke cheerily to the dog .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 21]: It would be : `` Well , Joey , here we are ; still got a bark in us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 32]: ... Or , `` You and I must have our names on the Admiralty chart , Joey : -- ` Channel surveyed by Captain Courtenay and pup ; details uncertain . '
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 9]: How does that sound , old chap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 18]: And again , `` I suppose your friend , Miss Maxwell , is asleep by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 16]: If she calls you ` Joey , ' do you call her ` Elsie ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 8]: I rather fancy Elsie as a name .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 6]: What do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 23]: To all of which the dog , who had found a dry corner , would respond with a smile and a tail-wag .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 5]: Joey could n't smile !
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 32]: Make a friend of a fox-terrier and learn what a genuine , whole-hearted , delighted-to-see-you grin he will favor you with : he can smile as unmistakably as he can yawn .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 15]: If deeper emotions peeped up in Courtenay 's soul , he crushed them resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 9]: Men of the sea do not cultivate heroics .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 22]: They leave sentiment to those imaginative people who evolve eery visions of a storm in the smug comfort of suburban villas .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 36]: When the _ Kansas _ lay on the shoal Courtenay was certain that the ship was lost , or he would never have dispatched some of his passengers and crew in the only boat available .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 34]: He acted to the best of his judgment then ; he was acting similarly now in abandoning the last resource of a raft in order to keep the vessel on her present course .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 40]: But , then or now , he paid no heed whatever to the obvious fact that he and the second engineer , and at least one of the male passengers , must be the last to quit the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 31]: That was the code of all true sailor-men -- the women first , then the male passengers and crew followed by the officers , beginning at the junior in rank .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 36]: There could be room for no hesitancy or dispute -- it was just a sailor-like way of doing one 's duty , in the simple faith that the recording angel would enter up the log .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 32]: The long wait in the darkness would have broken many a man 's nerve , but Courtenay was not cast in a mold to be either bent or broken by fear .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 57]: When his cigar was not in his mouth he whistled , he hummed snatches of songs , and delivered short lectures to Joey on the absurdity of things in general , and the special ridiculousness of such a mighty combination of circumstances centering on one poor ship as had fore-gathered to crush the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 26]: Ever since he was aroused from sleep by the stopping of the screw , his mind had dwelt on the unprecedented nature of the break-down .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 32]: Even before he discovered its cause he was wondering what evil chance bad contrived to cripple the engine at such a moment -- in the worst possible place on the map .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 4]: `` Joey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 38]: he said suddenly , his thoughts reverting to a chance remark made to him in Valparaiso by Isobel 's father , `` what did Mr. Baring mean by saying there was a difficulty about the insurance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 16]: Joey gave it up , but he cocked his ears and looked towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 3]: Christobal entered .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 19]: `` Boyle will recover , '' he said , when he had wiped the spray off his face .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 15]: `` He had a narrow escape ; the knife just grazed the spinal cord .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 16]: The shock to the dorsal nerves induced temporary paralysis , and that rather misled me .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 6]: He is much better now .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 15]: Under ordinary conditions he would be able to get about in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 16]: As it is , he will probably live as long as any of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 9]: Christobal waved a hand towards the external void .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 13]: He was not sailor enough to realize the change in the weather .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 10]: `` That is good news , '' said Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 9]: `` I thought you would like to know .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 7]: How are things up here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 3]: `` Better .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 12]: The barometer has risen an inch in less than two hours .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 18]: Possibly , nearness to the land has some effect , but wind and sea are subsiding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 10]: `` You surprise me ; yet that is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 7]: I have had several surprises to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 5]: What is the position ?
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 22]: Of course , we must hit the South American continent sooner or later ; can you fix an approximate time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 11]: `` We are making about six knots , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 21]: If we are lucky , and avoid any stray rocks , we should see daylight before we reach the coast .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 6]: That is our sole hope .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 17]: The ship is in a powerful tidal current , and it is high-water at 5.30 A.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 12]: At a rough estimate , Hanover Island is twenty knots distant .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 5]: Now you know all .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 7]: The outcome is mere guesswork . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 9]: `` Why did the furnaces blow up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 13]: `` I was cross-examining Joey on that point when you came in .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 5]: He reserved his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 22]: My own view is that , by accident or design , some explosive substance found its way into the coal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 7]: `` Shem , Ham and Japheth !
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 3]: Explosive substance !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 15]: Do you mean dynamite , or gunpowder , or that sort of thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: `` Something of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 17]: That is only a supposition , but when I whispered it to Walker he agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 3]: `` Walker !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 10]: Is he the man who speaks so queerly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 15]: `` If ever you go to Newcastle , do n't put it that way .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 11]: I told him to take Miss Maxwell to her cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 6]: Did he do so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 21]: I have not seen her since , so I assume that the bromide , plus the wine , was effective .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 9]: Well , I must return to my patients .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 6]: Can I get you anything ?
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 8]: I am store-keeper , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 6]: `` No , thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 9]: `` Nothing to eat , or drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 20]: I shall be ready for a square meal when I am able to come below -- not before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 3]: Christobal smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 17]: Though he was a brave man , he thought such persistent optimism was out of place .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 9]: Nevertheless , he could emulate Courtenay 's coolness .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 9]: `` Let me know when you are ready .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 10]: I am an excellent cook , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 29]: Then the captain of the _ Kansas _ resumed his smoking and humming , with occasional glances at the clock , and the compass , and the barometer .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 13]: At two o'clock he felt the ship slipping from under the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 13]: The compass showed that she was heading a couple of points eastward .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 22]: He helped her , and telephoned instantly to Walker : `` Go forward and try if you can make out anything .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 6]: Report to me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 17]: `` Ay , ay , sir , '' came the reply , and anon Walker appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 24]: `` It 's main thick ahead , sir , but I think we-aw passin ' an island to port , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 8]: You had better remain here , Walker .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 20]: We have not long to wait now for the dawn , and four eyes are better than two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 11]: Walker imagined that the skipper was ready for a chat .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 11]: `` Things are in a dweadful mess below , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 12]: I ca n't make head or tail of the smash . ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 7]: `` Well , that must wait .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 4]: Do n't talk .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 6]: Keep a sharp lookout . ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 21]: The engineer could not guess that the captain 's pulse was beating a trifle more rapidly with a certain elation .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 8]: They were undoubtedly passing White Horse Island .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 21]: It revealed its presence by deflecting the tremendous sea-river which ferried the _ Kansas _ onward at such a rate .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 37]: In fifteen or twenty minutes Courtenay expected to find indications of a more northerly set of the tide , and he watched the compass intently for the first sign of this return to the former course .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 29]: If the ship crossed the current one way or the other she would certainly be driven ashore on some outlying spur of the island or detached sunken reef .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 59]: Hence , he must actually guess his way , with something of the acquired sense of the blind , because the slight chance of ultimate escape for the ship and her occupants rested wholly on the assumption that some ocean by-way was leading her to a deep-water inlet , where it might be possible to drop the anchor .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 12]: In eighteen minutes , or thereabouts , the needle moved slightly .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 10]: Courtenay once more assisted the ship with the helm .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 12]: She steadied herself , and the compass pointed due northeast again .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 31]: Walker , though an engineer , knew enough of navigation to recognize the apparent impossibility of the captain 's being able to steer with any real knowledge of his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 21]: The wheel-twisting , therefore , savored of magic ; but his orders were to look ahead , and he obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 25]: Soon he thought he could discern an irregular pink crescent , with the concave side downwards , somewhere in the blackness beyond the bows .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 24]: He rubbed his eyes , and said nothing , believing that the unaccustomed strain of gazing into the dark had affected his sight .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 23]: But the pink crescent brightened and deepened , and speedily it was joined by two others , equally irregular and somewhat lower .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 9]: Then he could bear the suspense no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 8]: `` Captain , d'ye see yon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 10]: he asked , in a voice tremulous with awe .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: That is the sun just catching the summits of snow-topped hills .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 15]: It not only foretells the dawn , but is a sign of fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 17]: There are no clouds over the land , or we should not see the peaks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 46]: Walker began to have a respect for the captain which he had hitherto extended only to the superintending engineer , an eminent personage who never goes to sea , but inspects the ship when in port , and draws a fat salary and various commissions .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 12]: Ere long a silver gray light began to dispel the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 22]: The two silent watchers first saw it overhead , and the vast dome of day swiftly widened over the vexed sea .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 16]: The aftermath of the storm spread a low , dense cloak of vapor all round .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 16]: The wind had fallen so greatly that they could hear the song of the rigging .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 38]: Soon they could distinguish the outlines of the heavy rollers near at hand , and Courtenay believed that the ship , in her passage , encountered in the water several narrow bands of a bright red color .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 62]: If this were so , he knew that the phenomenon was caused by the prawn-like Crustacea which sailors call `` Whale-food , '' a sure sign of deep water close to land , and , further , an indication that the current was still flowing strongly , while the force of the sea must have been broken many miles to westward .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 6]: Suddenly he turned to Walker .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 13]: `` Do you think you could shin up to the masthead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 14]: `` I used to be able to climb a bit , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 7]: `` Well , try the foremast .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 15]: Up there I am fairly certain you can see over this bank of mist .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 6]: Do n't get into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 11]: Come back if you feel you ca n't manage it .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 13]: If you succeed , take the best observations possible and report . ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 6]: Courtenay was becoming anxious now .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 15]: If he dared let go the wheel he would have climbed the mast himself .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 10]: Walker set about his mission in a business-like manner .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 13]: He threw off his thick coat and boots , and went forward .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 19]: Half-way up the mast there was a rope ladder for the use of the sailors when adjusting pulleys .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 24]: The rest of the journey was not difficult for an athletic man , and Walker was quickly an indistinct figure in the fog .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 12]: He gained the truck all right , and instantly yelled something .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 9]: Courtenay fancied he said : `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 6]: We-ah on the wocks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 25]: Whatever it was , Walker did not wait , but slid downward with such speed that it was fortunate the rigging barred his progress .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 26]: And then , even while Courtenay was shouting for some explanation , a great black wall rose out of the deep on the port bow .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 44]: It was a pinnacle rock , high as the ship 's masts , but only a few feet wide at sea level , and the _ Kansas _ sped past this ugly monitor as though it were a buoy in a well-marked channel .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 8]: Courtenay heard the sea breaking against it .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 36]: The ship could not have been more than sixty feet distant , a little more than her own beam , and he fully expected that she would grind against some outlier in the next instant .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 10]: But the _ Kansas _ had a charmed life .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 17]: She ran on unscathed , and seemed to be traveling in smoother water after this escape .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 15]: Walker 's dark skin was the color of parchment when he reached the chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 27]: `` Captain , '' he said , weakly , `` I 'll do owt wi ' engines , but I 'm no good at this game .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 6]: That thing fairly banged me .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 6]: Did ye see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 9]: `` Did _ you _ see land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 5]: demanded Courtenay , imperatively .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 9]: His spirits rose with each of these thrills .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 12]: He felt that it was ordained that his ship should live .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 25]: The-aw 's hills , and big ones , a long way ahead , but I 'm no ' goin ' up that mast again .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 5]: It would be suicide .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 4]: I 'm done .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 19]: I 'll nev-ah fo-get yon stone ghost , no , not if I live to be ninety . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 35]: Then Joey , sniffing the morning , uncurled himself , stretched , yawned loudly , and thought of breakfast , for he had passed a rather disturbed night , the second in one week .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 11]: To cope with such excitement , a dog needed sustenance .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 17]: CHAPTER VIII IN A WILD HAVEN Fortune has her cycles , whether for good or ill .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 25]: The _ Kansas _ , having run the gauntlet of many dangers , seemed to have earned an approving smile from the fickle goddess .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 28]: A slight but perceptible veering of the wind , combined with the increasing power of the sun 's rays , swept the ocean clear of its storm-wraiths .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 24]: Soon after passing the pillar rock , Courtenay thought he could make out the unwavering outline of mountainous land amid the gray mists .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 24]: A few minutes later the waves racing alongside changed their leaden hue to a steely glitter which told him the fog was dispersing .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 19]: The nearer blue of the ocean carpet spread an ever-widening circle until it merged into a vivid green .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 20]: Then , with startling suddenness , the curtain was drawn aside on a panorama at once magnificent and amazing .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 18]: Almost without warning , the ship was found to be entering the estuary of a narrow fiord .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 26]: Gaunt headlands , carved on Titanic scale out of the solid rock , guarded the entrance , and already shut out the more distant coast-line .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 53]: Behind these first massive walls , everywhere unscalable , and rising in separate promontories to altitudes of , perhaps , four hundred feet , an inner fortification of precipitous mountains flung their glacier-clad peaks heavenward to immense heights , -- heights which , in that region , soared far above the snow-line .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 23]: The sun was reflected with dazzling brilliancy from their icy summits , and wonderful lights sparkled in rainbow tints on their slopes .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 35]: Delicate pink deepened to rose crimson ; pale greens softened into the beryl blue of stupendous glaciers , vast frozen cataracts which flowed down deep and broad clefts almost to the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 32]: Above these color-bands , the dead-white mantle of everlasting snow spread its folds , with here and there a black ridge of granite thrusting wind-cleared fangs high above the far-flung shroud .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 24]: But , if the crests of peak upon peak were thus clothed in white , their bases wore a garment of different texture .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 40]: Save on the seaward terraces of stark rock , with their tide-marked base of weed-covered boulders , the densest vegetation known to mankind imposed everywhere a first barrier to human progress far more unconquerable than the awesome regions beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 24]: Pine forests of extraordinary density crammed each available yard of space , until the tree-growth yielded perforce to hardier Alpine moss and lichens .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 53]: This lower belt of deepest green ranged from five hundred to one thousand feet in height , as conditions were adverse or favorable ; waterfalls abounded ; each tiny glen held its foaming rivulet , rushing madly down the steep , or leaping in fine cascades from one rocky escarpment to another .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 27]: Courtenay , after an astounded glance at the magnitude and solemn grandeur of the spectacle , had eyes for naught save the conformation of the channel .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 55]: The change in the wind was caused , he found , by the northerly headland thrusting its giant mass a mile , or more , westward of its twin ; but he quickly discovered , from the conformation of the land , that the latter was really the protecting cape of the inner water-way .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 34]: He reasoned , therefore , that the deep-water channel flowed close to the northern shore until it was flung off by the relentless rocks to seek the easier inlet behind the opposite point .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 22]: He did not know yet whether the ship was entering some unknown straits or the mouth of a narrow land-locked bay .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 36]: If the latter , the presence of the distant glaciers and the nearer torrents warned him of a possible bar , on which the _ Kansas _ might be lost within sight of safe anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 41]: Not inspired guesswork now , but the skill of the pilot , was needed ; this crossing the bar in broad daylight was as great a trial of nerve in its way as the earlier onward rush in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 33]: Wind and sea had abated so sensibly that the Pacific rollers raced on unbroken , and it was no longer a super-human task to make one 's voice heard along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 24]: So the captain aroused Walker with a sharp order : `` Go and see if the donkey-boiler has a good head of steam .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 16]: We may have to drop the stream anchor quick , and both bowers as well .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 20]: If Tollemache is doing his work properly , go forward , and keep a sharp lookout for broken water .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 18]: Clear off the tarpaulins , and be ready to lower away the instant I sing out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 22]: Walker , who had been gazing spellbound at the majestic haven opening up before the ship , hurried on his errand .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 22]: He found Tollemache seated on an upturned bucket , in which the taciturn one had just washed his face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 7]: `` Have you seen it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 28]: demanded Walker , gleefully , while his practised eyes took in the state of the gages and he overran a number of oil taps with nimble fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 5]: `` Seen what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 8]: asked Tollemache , without removing his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 8]: `` The land , my bonnie lad .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 8]: We-ah wunnin ' wight in now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 10]: `` We 've been doing that for hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 10]: `` Yes , but this is diff ` went .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 7]: The'aw 's a fine wiv-ah ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 7]: Have ye ev-ah seen the Tyne ?
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 22]: Well , just shove Sooth Sheels an ' Tynemouth a few hundwed feet high-ah , an ' you 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 17]: Now , do n't twy to talk , or you might cwack yo ' face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 37]: With this Parthian shaft of humor he vanished towards the forecastle , whence the ubiquitous donkey-boiler , through one of its long arms , would shoot forth the stockless anchors at the touch of a lever .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 27]: Tollemache , who had already glimpsed the coast , strolled out on deck and bent well over the side in order to look more directly ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 14]: He could see one half only of the view , but that sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 5]: `` A respite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 5]: he growled to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 9]: `` Penal servitude instead of sudden death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 38]: And , indeed , this was the true aspect of things , as Courtenay discovered when he had successfully brought the ship past three ugly reefs and dropped anchor in the backwater of a small sheltered bay .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 24]: He speedily abandoned the half-formed hope that the _ Kansas _ might have run into an ocean water-way which communicated with Smyth Channel .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 30]: The rampart of snow-clad hills had no break , while a hasty scrutiny of the chart showed him that the eastern coast of Hanover Island had been thoroughly surveyed .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 45]: Yet it was not in human nature that he should not experience a rush of joy at the thought that , by his own efforts , he had saved his ship and some , at least , of the lives entrusted to his care .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 17]: He was alone when the music of the chains in the hawse-pipes sounded in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 20]: The _ Kansas _ had plenty of room to swing , but he thought it best to moor her .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 41]: Believing implicitly now that he would yet bring his vessel into the Thames , he allowed her to be carried round by the fast-flowing tide until her nose pointed seaward , and she lay in the comparatively still water inshore .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 13]: Then he dropped the second anchor and stepped forth from the chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 6]: His long vigil was ended .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 18]: Some of the cloud of care lifted from his face , and he called cheerily to Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 10]: `` Come along , pup , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 9]: `` Let us sample Dr. Christobal 's cookery .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 13]: You have shared my watch ; now you shall share my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: We have both earned it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 60]: It was in his mind to knock loudly on Elsie 's door and awaken her ; therefore he was dimly conscious of a feeling of disappointment when he saw her , in company with Christobal , leaning over the rail of the promenade deck , and evidently discussing the weird beauty of the scene spread before her wondering eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 31]: The ship was now so sheltered by the shoulder of the southern cape that the keen breeze yet rushing in from the sea passed hundreds of feet above her masts .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 26]: There was nothing more than a tidal swell on the surface of the water , in which the heavy-laden vessel rested as in a dock .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 37]: In the new and extraordinary quietude the light thud of the donkey-engine sounded with a strange distinctness , and Elsie and her companion heard Courtenay 's approaching footsteps almost as soon as he gained the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 10]: Instantly she ran towards him , with hands out-stretched .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 29]: `` Let me be the first to congratulate you , '' she cried , her cheeks mantling with a rush of color and her lips quivering with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 17]: `` How wonderful of you to bring the ship through all those awful reefs and things !
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 12]: No ; you must not say you have done nothing marvelous .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 7]: Dr. Christobal has told me everything .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 15]: Next to Providence , Captain Courtenay , we owe our lives to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 14]: Courtenay felt it would hurt her were he to smile at her earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 38]: But he did say : `` Surely it is not so very remarkable that I should do my best to safeguard the ship and such of her passengers and crew as survive last night 's ordeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 7]: `` I know that quite well .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 14]: Even I would have striven to help when my life was at stake .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 54]: But the really wonderful thing is that you should have guessed an unknown track in the dark ; that you should actually be able to guide a helpless ship through waters so full of dangers that it would be folly to venture in their midst in broad daylight and with full steam-power . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 12]: Then Courtenay took off his sou ` wester , and bowed .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 13]: `` I had no idea I had such expert critics on board .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 17]: Is it you , Christobal , who has followed the ship 's course so closely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 8]: `` Not I , my dear fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 19]: Miss Maxwell is only saying what I feel , indeed , but could not have expressed as admirably .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 12]: Our silent friend , Tollemache , is the man who observes .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 31]: I was so amazed when I came on deck half an hour ago that I sought him out , and he told me something of the night 's later happenings .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 39]: So I took the liberty of arousing Miss Maxwell from a very sound sleep , but we thought it best not to disturb you by appearing on the bridge until you had done everything you had planned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 16]: `` I shall never understand how I came to fall asleep , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 19]: `` I remember feeling very tired ; I sat down for a moment , and that ended it .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 31]: The next thing I heard was a rapping on my door , and Dr. Christobal 's voice bidding me hurry if I would see the entrance to the harbor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 6]: The two men exchanged glances .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 12]: Courtenay laughed , so pleasantly that it was good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 30]: `` Yet there was I up aloft , maneuvering the ship in the firm faith that Dr. Christobal was busy in the cook 's galley , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 13]: `` Ah , we have news for you , '' cried Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 25]: `` One of the poor fellows who was knocked on the head during that terrible fight for the boats was the master cook himself .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 14]: He is better now , and breakfast can be ready in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 8]: I 'll go and tell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 21]: She ran off , and Joey scampered by her side , for he knew quite well where the kitchen lay .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 18]: `` Bromide is useful at times , '' murmured Christobal , watching Elsie until she had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 6]: Then he turned to Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 12]: `` I suppose you have seen nothing of the boats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 5]: `` No sign whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 12]: And I could hardly have missed them if they were here .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 10]: They may have escaped , but I doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 37]: The sea ran very high for a time , and the _ Kansas _ scraped past so many reefs that it was almost impossible for each of the three boats to have done the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 26]: `` Even if one or more of them reached land , there is small likelihood that they would turn up in this particular bay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 12]: `` That is true , especially if they used their sails .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 39]: The Chileans who got away in the life-boats would know sufficient of the coast to endeavor to make a northerly course , while my parting instructions to Malcolm were to keep to the north all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 21]: `` I wish now that poor Isobel Baring and the others had not left us , '' said Christobal sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 11]: Courtenay was about to say something , but checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 16]: He was not blind to the aspect of affairs which Tollemache had summarized so pithily .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 13]: It might yet be that those who remained had more to endure .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 24]: Then Elsie summoned them to breakfast , which was served on deck , as the saloon had been temporarily converted into a hospital .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 13]: Before sitting down , Courtenay paid a brief visit to Mr. Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 23]: Christobal told him not to allow the wounded man to talk too much , complete rest for a few hours being essential .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 28]: But Boyle 's pallid face lit up so brightly when the captain stood by his side that it was hard not to indulge him to some extent .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 14]: `` Huh , '' he said , his gruff voice strong as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 15]: `` Christobal was not humbugging me when he assured me you were all right .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 5]: Where are we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 12]: `` In a small bay on the east of Hanover Island .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 17]: I have not taken any observations yet , and there is no hurry , old chap .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 13]: You 'll be out and about long before we move again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 3]: `` Huh .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 4]: D'ye think so ?
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 8]: I know the beggar who knifed me .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 13]: I 'll take it out of him when I see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 10]: `` You are better off than he , Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 23]: Unless he is here with you , I guess he is rolling on the floor of the Pacific by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 19]: Boyle tried to turn and survey his fellow-sufferers ; there was the fire of battle in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 7]: Courtenay restrained him with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 23]: `` A nice thing I am doing , '' he cried , `` permitting you to talk , and getting you excited .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 16]: I believe you would punch the scoundrel now if he were in the next berth .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 35]: You must lie quiet , old man ; doctor 's orders ; he says you 're on the royal road if you keep on the easy list for a day or so . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 8]: Boyle smiled , and closed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 16]: `` I heard the anchors go , and then I knew that all was well .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 7]: You 're the luckiest skipper afloat .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 17]: Huh , the bloomin ' _ Kansas _ was lost not once but twenty times . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 9]: `` Are you in pain , Boyle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 13]: asked Courtenay , placing a gentle hand on his friend 's forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 4]: `` Not much .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 5]: More stiff than sore .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 9]: It was a knock-out blow of its kind .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 30]: I can just recall you hauling me out of the scrimmage , and -- '' `` It will be your turn to do as much for me next time .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 15]: Try to go to sleep ; we 'll have you on deck tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 21]: Courtenay noticed that there were only four other sufferers in the saloon : Three were firemen injured by the explosion .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 10]: He had a pleasant word for each of them .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 35]: The fourth was a sailor , either asleep or unconscious , and Courtenay thought he recognized a severe bruise on the man 's left temple where the butt of his revolver had struck hard .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 26]: When he returned on deck he learned that two other members of the crew , in addition to the cook , were able to work .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 21]: Walker had set one to clear up the stokehold ; his companion , a fireman , had relieved Mr. Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 33]: Indeed , the latter had gone to his cabin , and was the last to arrive at the feast , finally putting in an appearance in a new suit and spotless linen .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 4]: Christobal protested loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 16]: `` I thought this was to be a workers ' meal , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 9]: `` Tollemache has stolen a march on us .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 10]: He is quite a Bond-street lounger in appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 10]: `` Dirty job , stoking , '' said Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 20]: `` I seem to have been the only lazy person on board during the night , '' cried Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 10]: `` Do you know what time it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 3]: asked Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 11]: `` No ; about ten o'clock , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 9]: `` It is not yet half-past four . ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 6]: The blue eyes opened wide .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 7]: `` Are you in earnest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 6]: He showed her his watch .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 22]: Then she perceived that the sun had not yet risen high enough to illumine the wooded crest of the opposite cliff .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 26]: The snow-clad hills , the blue glaciers , the wonderful clearness of atmosphere , led her to believe that the day was much more advanced .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 10]: Land and sea shone in a strange crystal light .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 7]: None could tell whence it came .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 18]: It seemed to her , in that solemn hour , to be the reflection of heaven itself .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 13]: By quick transition , her thoughts flew back to the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 40]: Scarce four hours had elapsed since she had waited in the captain 's cabin , amidst the drenching spray and tearing wind , while he took Isobel , and Mrs. Somerville , and the shrieking maid to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 13]: The corners of her mouth drooped and tears trembled on her eyelashes .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 7]: She sought furtively for a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 11]: Knowing exactly what troubled her , Courtenay turned to Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 12]: `` This island ought to be inhabited , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 16]: `` Can you tell me what sort of Indians one finds in this locality ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 4]: Christobal frowned perplexedly .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 75]: During many previous voyages to Europe he had invariably traveled on the mail steamers of smaller draft which use the sheltered sea canal formed by the Smyth , Sarmiento , and Messier channels , the protected water-way running for hundreds of miles to the north from the western end of the Straits of Tierra del Fuego , and , in some of its aspects , reminding sailors of the Clyde and the Caledonian Canal .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 15]: `` I fear I do not know much about them , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 31]: `` Behind those hills there one sees a few Canoe Indians ; I have heard that they are somewhat lower in the social scale than the aborigines of Australia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 5]: `` Are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 3]: said Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 17]: He looked Christobal straight in the eyes , and the doctor returned his gaze as steadily .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 6]: `` That is their repute .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 6]: They live mostly on shellfish .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 7]: They do not congregate in communities .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 14]: A few families keep together , and move constantly from place to place .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 32]: They have a quaint belief that if they remain on a camping-ground more than a night or two the devil will stick his head out of the ground and bite them .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 20]: Obviously , the real devil that plagues them is the continuous wandering demanded by their search for food . ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 25]: Christobal would have aired such a scrap of interesting knowledge at the foot of the scaffold , and expected the executioner to listen attentively .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 7]: `` They are called the Alaculof .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 20]: They use bows and arrows , with heads chipped out of stone or bottle-glass , '' put in Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 12]: `` Oh , you have been in these parts before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 18]: cried Courtenay , regarding his compatriot with some interest , while the Spaniard surveyed his rival doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 16]: `` Yes -- was on the _ Emu _ -- wrecked in Cockburn Channel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 42]: Now , the story of the _ Emu _ is one of those fierce tragedies which the sea first puts on the stage of life with dire skill , and then proceeds to destroy the slightest vestige of their brief existence .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 42]: But such things leave abiding memories in men 's souls , and Courtenay had heard how twenty-seven survivors , out of a muster-roll of thirty who escaped from the wreck , had been shot down by Indians ambushed in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 55]: Elsie , whose tears were dispelled by the doctor 's amusing summary of the Canoe Indians ' theological views , was listening to the conversation , so the captain did not carry it further , contenting himself with the remark : `` That will be useful , if we are compelled to go ashore .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 13]: You will have some acquaintance with the ways of our hosts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 17]: Tollemache , having nothing to say , was not given to the use of unnecessary words .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 11]: Elsie was conscious of a certain constraint in their talk .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 12]: `` Please do n't mind me , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 13]: `` I know all about the loss of the _ Emu _ .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 21]: If we fall into the hands of the Alaculof tribe , we shall be not only killed but eaten . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 18]: She was pouring out a second cup of tea for Walker when she made this remarkable statement .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 27]: Her eyes were intent on exact quantities of tea , milk , and sugar , and she passed the cup to the engineer with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 40]: Each of the men admired her coolness , but Tollemache , who had been quietly scrutinizing the nearer hills , gave painful emphasis to this gruesome topic by exclaiming : `` There they are now : smoke signals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 16]: Sure enough , thin columns of smoke were rising from several points on the land .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: It could not be doubted that these were caused by human agency .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 12]: They were not visible when the party sat down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 48]: The appearance of the ship was their obvious explanation , but not a canoe or a solitary figure could be seen , though Courtenay and others , at various times during the day , searched every part of the neighboring shore with field glasses and powerful telescopes .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 18]: After an all too brief burst of sunshine , the Land of Storms again justified its name .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 8]: Giant clouds came rolling in from seaward .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 31]: The mountains were lost in mist ; the glaciers became sullen , rock-strewn masses of white-brown ice ; the fresh greenery of the forests faded into somber belts of blackness .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 21]: Though it was high summer in this desolate region , heavy showers of hail and sleet alternated with drenching rain .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 37]: At low-water , though the _ Kansas _ floated securely in a depth of twenty fathoms , a yellow current sweeping past her starboard quarter showed how accurately Courtenay had read the tokens of the inlet .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 28]: Many a swollen torrent , and , perhaps , one or two fair-sized streams at the head of the bay , contributed this flood of fresh water .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 22]: And , with the evening tide , there were not wanting indications that the gale without had developed a new fury .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 19]: A solitary albatross , driven landward by stress of weather , rode in vast circles above the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 13]: There was no wealth of bird life in that place of gloom .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 34]: Though fitted to rear untold millions of gulls and other sea birds , this secluded nook was almost deserted ; generations of men had devoured all the eggs they could lay hands on .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 19]: To Elsie and the doctor were entrusted the daylight watch on deck and the care of the sick .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 11]: For the latter there was not much to be done .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 35]: The cook undertook to feed them , and Frascuelo , the wounded stevedore who had been discovered in a state of collapse , soon revived , and was practically able to look after himself .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 28]: The others , under Walker 's directions , were hard at work in the engine-room and stoke-hold , for there alone lay the chance of ultimate escape .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 7]: The two sentinels conversed but little .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 27]: The outer war of the elements was disturbing , and Christobal , though unfailingly optimistic in his speech , was nevertheless a prey to dark forebodings .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 40]: Once , they were startled by the fall of an avalanche , which thundered down a mountain side on the farther shore , and tore a great gap in the belt of trees until it crashed into the water .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 34]: It sent a four-foot wave across the bay , and the _ Kansas _ rocked so violently that the men toiling below raced up on deck to ascertain the cause of the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 15]: This was the only exciting incident of a day that seemed to be unending .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 39]: Elsie , worn out by the strain of the preceding twenty-four hours , and , notwithstanding her brief sleep in the morning , thoroughly exhausted for want of rest , was persuaded to retire early to her cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 7]: She lay down almost fully dressed .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 16]: Somehow , it was impossible to think of a state of unpreparedness for any emergency .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 6]: She was soon sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 12]: She awoke with a start , with all her nerves a-quiver .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 10]: Joey was tearing along the deck , barking furiously .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 12]: She heard two men run past her door with ominous haste .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 12]: Then , after a heart-breaking pause , there was some shooting .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 27]: Some one , she thought it was Courtenay , roared down the saloon companion : `` On deck , all hands , to repel boarders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 13]: With a confused rush , men mounted the stairs and raced forward .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 27]: She knew that nearly all of those not on watch were sleeping with the injured men in the saloon , and now she understood the reason .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 13]: The ship was being attacked by Indians , and not altogether unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 14]: The savages had stolen alongside in their canoes under the cloak of night .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 10]: Perhaps they were already on board in overwhelming numbers .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 17]: Poor girl , she murmured a prayer while she hurriedly drew on her boots and ulster .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 31]: There seemed to be no end to the evils which assailed the _ Kansas _ , and she dreaded this new terror more than the mad fury of the seas .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 20]: But , if the men were fighting for their lives and her 's , she must help , too .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 4]: That was clear .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 26]: She had a weapon , a loaded revolver , which she had picked up from beneath a boat 's tarpaulin lying on the spar deck .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 8]: She opened her door and peered out .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 20]: She could not see any one , and the rattle of a hail-storm overhead effectually dulled any other noise .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 22]: But several shots fired again in the fore part of the ship were audible above the din of the pelting hail .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 31]: So she ran that way , with the fine courage of one who fears yet goes on , and her eyes pierced the shadows with a tense despair in them .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 22]: For what could so few men do against the unseen watchers who sent up the thirty-four smoke columns she had counted ?
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 11]: Ah , trust a woman to read the unspoken thought !
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 17]: Courtenay and Christobal and Tollemache need not have striven to couch their warnings in ambiguous words .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 13]: Elsie could have told them all that was left unsaid at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 28]: The ship had fought her own enemies ; now the human beings she had saved must defend themselves from a foe against whom the ship was helpless .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 24]: CHAPTER IX A PROFESSOR OF WITCHCRAFT Quickly as Elsie had reached the deck , the warlike sounds which disturbed her rest had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 23]: Save for the footsteps of men whom she could not see , the prevalent noises were caused only by wind and sleet .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 25]: While she was hurrying forward as rapidly as the darkness permitted , the lights were switched on with a suddenness that made her gasp .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 28]: The dog began to bark again , but it was easy to distinguish his sharp yelps of excitement and defiance from the earlier notes of alarmed suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 17]: In fact , Joey himself was the first to discover the stealthy approach of the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 48]: Courtenay and Tollemache , who took the middle watch , from midnight to 4 A.M. , had failed to note the presence of several canoes on the ink-black surface of the bay until the dog warned them by growling , and ruffling the bristles on his back .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 45]: The night was pitch dark ; the rising moon was not only hidden by the hills of the island , but frequent storms of rain and hail rendered it impossible while they raged to see or hear beyond the distance of a few feet .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 17]: In all probability , as the canoes bore down from windward , Joey had scented them .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 18]: He also gave the highly important information as to the quarter from which attack might be expected .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 32]: Three men , at least , had gained the deck , but the prompt use of a revolver had caused them to retreat as silently and speedily as they had appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 6]: There was no actual fight .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 9]: The phantoms vanished as silently as they came .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 40]: The only external lights on the ship were the masthead and sidelights , hoisted by Courtenay to reveal the steamer 's whereabouts in case one of the boats chanced to be driven into the bay during the dark hours .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 54]: There was an electric lamp turned on in the donkey-engine room , and another in the main saloon , but means were taken to exclude them from showing without ; if the Indians meant to be actively hostile , lights on board would be more helpful to the assailants than to the assailed .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 36]: When the captain and Tollemache followed Joey 's lead , they discerned three demoniac figures , vaguely outlined by the ruddy glare of the port light , in the very act of climbing the rails .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 30]: They fired instantly , and the naked forms vanished ; both men thought they heard the splashing caused by the leaping or falling of the Indians into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 24]: By the same subdued radiance Courtenay made out the top of a pole or mast sticking up close to the ship 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 37]: He leaned over , fired a couple of shots downwards at random , seized the pole , and lashed it to a stanchion with a loose rope end , a remnant of one of the awnings .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 24]: A small craft , even an Indian canoe , would be most useful , and its capture might tend to scare the attackers .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 17]: Telling Tollemache to mount guard , he raced back to the saloon hatch and summoned assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 35]: The others searched the ship in small detachments , but the Indians were gone ; it was manifest that none beyond those driven off at the first onset had secured a footing on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 29]: Then , taking the risk of being shot at , Courtenay ordered the lights to be turned on , and the first person he saw clearly was Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 8]: He was almost genuinely angry with her .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 8]: `` What are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 10]: She was learning not to fear his brusque ways .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 23]: He was no carpet knight , and men who carry their lives in their hands do not pick and choose their words .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 19]: `` I thought you were in danger , so I came to help , '' she said calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 12]: `` You must go back to your cabin at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 15]: Of what avail is the safety of my cabin if you are killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 35]: A woman 's logic is apt to be irritating when one expects a flight of arrows , or , it may be , a gunshot , out of the blackness a few feet away .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 33]: `` For goodness ' sake , stand here , then , '' he cried , seizing her arm , and compelling her to shelter behind the heavy molding which carried the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 8]: She did not object to his roughness .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 31]: In the midst of actual peril , impressions are apt to be cameo-cut in their preciseness , and she liked him all the more because he treated her quite roughly .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 17]: Of course , the mere presence of a woman at such a time was a hindrance .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 33]: But she was determined not to return to her stateroom , and , indeed , her obstinacy was reasonable enough , seeing the condition of affairs on board the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 22]: The captain quitted her for a moment in order to dispatch a Chilean sailor for a lantern and a long cord .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 8]: He wished to investigate the captured canoe .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 15]: Christobal , who had made the round of the promenade deck , came up .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: `` Oh , were you here , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 8]: he asked , on seeing the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 18]: `` I _ am _ here , if that is what you mean , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 12]: `` I heard Joey barking , and the shots that followed .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 12]: Naturally , I wished to find out what had happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 3]: `` Sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 17]: I imagined you were sleepless , like myself , and had joined Courtenay during his watch .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 6]: That explanation must have sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 15]: In any case , we have other things to trouble us at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 11]: Elsie had never before heard the Spaniard speaking so offhandedly .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 57]: She gave small heed to his petulance ; aroused from sound slumber by the alarm of an Indian attack -- thrilled by the horror of the thought that she might fall into the clutches of the callous man-apes which infest the islands of southwest America -- she was in no mood to disentangle subtleties of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 10]: `` Do you think they have left us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 18]: she murmured , shrinking nearer to the iron shield which Courtenay seemed to think would protect her .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 20]: `` Personally , I have seen no reason whatever for such a hubbub , '' was the flippant answer .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 9]: It was evident that Dr. Christobal was annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 18]: Notwithstanding his conventional polish , he was not a man to conceal his feelings when deeply stirred .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 19]: Yet Elsie failed to catch his intent , other than that he was adopting his usual nonchalant tone .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 18]: `` But something must have caused Captain Courtenay and Mr. Tollemache to fire their revolvers so frequently .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 16]: And , if they were mistaken , the dog would not have shared their error .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 11]: Besides , one of the canoes did not get away .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 2]: See !
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 7]: Its mast is fastened there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 5]: I had forgotten Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 14]: He was selected to join the captain 's watch , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 12]: `` Yes , I was present when the watches were formed .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 6]: Have you seen Mr. Tollemache ?
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 5]: Is he safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 12]: `` He is among those making the round of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 8]: I hope you will forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 4]: `` Forgive you !
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 10]: What have you done that calls for forgiveness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 16]: `` There are errors of speech which equal those of conduct , Miss Maxwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 20]: `` Oh , what nonsense -- at one in the morning -- when we are threatened by savages ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 13]: Christobal was relieved that she took this view of his abrupt utterances .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 7]: He thought the incident was ended .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 13]: He was mistaken ; Elsie was able to recall each word subsequently .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 26]: At the moment she was recording impressions with uncomprehending accuracy , but her mind was quite incapable of analyzing them ; that would come later .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 5]: The lantern was brought .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 20]: Courtenay stood on the lowermost rail , and carefully paid out a rope to which the light was slung .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 12]: He was far too brave a man to take undue risks .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 36]: He was ready to shoot instantly if need be , and , by his instructions , Tollemache and Walker kept watch as best they could in case other canoes were lying close to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 12]: Any doubt in this regard was dispelled in a singular manner .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 43]: The flickering rays of the lantern had barely revealed the primitive craft lying alongside when a voice came from the depths , crying in broken Spanish : `` Do n't shoot , señors -- spare me , for the love of heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 9]: I am a white man from Argentina . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 12]: Christobal and Elsie alone understood the exact significance of the words .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 24]: Courtenay , of course , knew what language was being spoken , and it was easy to guess the nature of the appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 10]: But the lantern showed that the canoe was empty .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 16]: In the center lay the Fuegian fire , its embers covered with a small hide .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 33]: The pole , fastened to a cross-piece in the thwarts , was not a mast , but had evidently been shipped in order to give speedy access to the deck by climbing .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 15]: Then Courtenay caught sight of two hands clinging to the stern of the canoe .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 21]: He swung the lantern in that direction , and an extraordinary , and even an affrighting , object became visible .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 16]: A caricature of a human head was raised slightly above the level of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 26]: It was crowned by a shock of coarse , black , knotted hair , tied back from the brows by a fillet of white feathers .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 39]: An intensely black face , crossed by two bars of red and white pigment , reaching from ear to ear , and covering eyelids , nose , and lips , was upturned to the watchers from the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 66]: The colors were vivid enough , notwithstanding the sheets of rain which blew in gusts against the ship 's side , dimming the dull light of a storm-proof lamp , to convey a most uncanny effect ; nor did Courtenay remove either his eyes or the revolver while he said to Christobal : `` Ask him who he is , and what he wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: The answer was intelligible enough .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 8]: `` I am a miner from Argentina .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 9]: I have been among these Indians five years .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 14]: When their attack failed , I thought there was a chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 20]: For pity 's sake , señor , help me instantly , or I shall die from the cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 7]: `` Have the Indians gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 3]: asked Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: They thought to surprise you .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 18]: When they come again it will be by daylight , as they are afraid of the dark .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 8]: But be quick , I implore you .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 6]: My hands are numb . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 9]: There was no resisting the man 's appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 32]: A rope ladder was lowered , and a Chilean sailor went down in obedience to the captain 's order , though he disliked the job , and crossed himself before descending .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 22]: He passed a rope under the fugitive 's armpits , and , with aid from the deck , hoisted him aboard .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 26]: The unfortunate miner gave proof of his wretched state by promptly collapsing in a faint , with a sigh of `` Madre de Dios ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 16]: His only garments were a species of waistcoat and rough trousers of untanned guanaco hide .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 34]: The white skin of his breast and legs , though darkened by exposure , showed that he had told the truth as to his descent , notwithstanding the amazing daubs on his face .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 33]: His hair , stiffened with black grease , stood out all around his head , and the same oily composition had been used to blacken his forehead , neck , and hands .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 18]: Some brandy and hot water , combined with the warmth of the saloon , soon revived him .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 41]: He ate a quantity of bread with the eagerness of a man suffering from starvation ; but he could not endure the heated atmosphere , although the temperature was barely sufficient to guard the injured occupants from the outer cold .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 22]: When offered an overcoat , he refused it at first , saying : `` I do not need so much clothing .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 6]: It will make me ill .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 15]: I only felt cold in the water because it is mostly melted ice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 25]: He was so grateful to his rescuers , however , that he took the garment to oblige them when he saw they were incredulous .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 20]: Christobal brought him to the chart-house , where most of the others were assembled , and there questioned him .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 21]: It was a most astonishing story which Francisco Suarez , gold-miner and prospector , laid before an exceedingly attentive audience .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 17]: As the man spoke , so did he recover the freer usage of a civilized tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 54]: At first his words had a hoarse , guttural sound , but Dr. Christobal 's questions seemed to awaken dormant memories , and every one noticed , not least those who had small knowledge of Spanish , that he had practically recovered command of the language at the end of half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 8]: And this was what he told them .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 29]: He , with three partners and a few Indians from the Pampas , had set out on a gold-prospecting expedition on the head waters of the Gallegos River .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 27]: They were disappointed in their search until they crossed the Cordillera , and sighted the gloomy shores of Last Hope Inlet , leading into Smyth Channel .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 14]: They there found alluvial sand and gold-bearing quartz , yielding but poor results .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 16]: Unfortunately , some natives assured them that the metal they sought abounded in Hanover Island .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 28]: They obtained canoes , voyaged down the long inlet , crossed the straits , and struck inland towards the unknown mountains beyond the swamps of Ellen Bay .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 43]: After enduring all the hardships entailed by life in such a wild country , they blundered into a gully where a brief analysis of the detritus gave a result per ton which was not to be measured by ounces but by pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 3]: `` Virgin !
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 7]: What a place that was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 15]: exclaimed Suarez , his dark eyes sparkling even yet with the recollection of it .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 13]: `` In one day we secured more gold than we could carry .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 21]: We threw away food to make room for it , and then threw away gold to secure the food again .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 7]: We called it the Golden Valley .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 30]: When weary of digging , we would spin coins to see who drew corner lots in the town we had mapped out on a level piece of land . ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 9]: White men and Indians alike caught the fever .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 41]: They accumulated a useless hoard , having no means of transport other than their own backs , and then , all precautions being relaxed , the nomad Indians , whom they despised , rushed the camp when they were sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 11]: They were nearly all killed by stones shot from slings .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 21]: Suarez was only stunned , and he and a Spaniard , with two Indians , were reserved for future slaughter .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 20]: `` The others were eaten , '' he said , `` and their bones were used for making fires .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 18]: I saw my friend , Giacomo , felled like a bullock , and the Indians as well .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 8]: By chance , I was the last .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 7]: I had no hope of escape .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 39]: I was too downcast even to make a fight of it , when , at the eleventh hour , the mad idea seized me that I might please and astonish my captors by performing a few sleight-of-hand tricks .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 41]: I began by throwing stones in the air , pretending to swallow them and causing them to disappear otherwise , but finding them again in the heel of my boot or hidden beneath any object which happened to be near .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 15]: When the Indians saw what I was doing , they gathered in a circle .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 17]: I ate some fire , and took a small toad out of a woman 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 2]: Dios !
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: How they gaped .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 7]: They had never seen the like .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 10]: All the tribe was summoned to watch me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 8]: Then the poor fellow began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 4]: `` Holy Mother !
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 10]: Think of me playing the fool before those brutes !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 6]: I became their medicine man .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 46]: I fought and killed my only rival , and , since then , I have doctored a few of the chief men among them , so they took me into the tribe , and always managed to procure me such food as I could eat .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 32]: They gave me roots and dried meat when they themselves were living on putrid blubber , or worse , because they kill all the old women as soon as famine threatens .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 19]: The women are devoured long before the dogs ; dogs catch otters , but old women can not .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 28]: In winter , when a long storm renders it impossible to obtain shell-fish , any woman who is feeble will steal off and hide in the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 10]: But the men track her and bring her back .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 14]: They hold her over the smoke of a fire until she is choked .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 4]: God in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 11]: I have seen such sights during those five years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 10]: Elsie , of course , understood all of this .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 13]: When Christobal put it into literal English , Courtenay looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 7]: She smiled at his unspoken thought .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 18]: `` I am already aware of most of what he is telling us , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 26]: `` It is very dreadful that such people should exist , but one does not fall in a faint merely because they cumber the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 19]: Perhaps you will not send me away next time , if they try to board the ship again .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 17]: I can use a revolver quite well enough to count as one for the defense . ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 18]: `` You are henceforth enrolled as maid-at-arms , Miss Maxwell , '' said the captain , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 19]: He was by no means surprised at the coolness she displayed in the face of the new terror .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 30]: She had given so many proofs of her natural courage that it must be equal to even so affrighting a test as the near presence of the Alaculof Indians .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 16]: But he broke in on the Spaniard 's recital with a question of direct interest .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 18]: `` Ask him , Christobal , why he said those devils would come again by daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 20]: `` Because they have guns , and can use them , '' was the appalling answer given by Suarez .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 34]: `` They secured the rifles belonging to my party , and one of them , who had often seen ship 's officers shooting wild geese , understood the method of loading and aiming .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 28]: They will not waste the cartridges on game , but keep them for tribal warfare , and they think a gun can not shoot in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: To-night they only attempted a surprise , and made off the moment they were discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 27]: To-morrow , or next day , they will swarm round the ship in hundreds , and fire at us with rifles , bows , and slings .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 44]: They do most harm with the slings and arrows , as they hold the gun away from the shoulder , but they can cast a heavy pebble from a sling quite as far and almost as straight as a revolver can shoot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 14]: `` How do they know the ship will not sail at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 3]: demanded Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 21]: Suarez laughed hysterically , with the mirth which is akin to tears , when the query was explained to him .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 30]: He looked bizarre enough under ordinary conditions , but laughter converted him into a fair semblance of one of those blood-curdling demons which a Japanese artist loves to depict .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 14]: Evidently , he depended on make-up to supplement his powers as a conjurer .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 39]: `` It is as much as a canoe can manage in fine weather to reach the island out there , which they call Seal Island , '' he cried , pointing towards the locality of White Horse Island .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 16]: `` Even the Indians were astonished to see so big a ship anchored here safely .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 14]: They have watched plenty of wrecks outside , and hardly anything comes ashore .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 15]: At any rate , they are quite sure you can not go back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 53]: It would be idle to deny that the Spaniard 's words sent a chill of apprehension down the spine of some of those present ; but the captain said quietly : `` Where a ship is concerned , if she can enter on the flood she can go out on the ebb .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 8]: How came you to escape to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 32]: Tears stood again in Suarez 's eyes as he replied : `` When I heard their plan , I imagined they would be driven off , provided a watch were kept .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 18]: I resolved to risk all in the attempt to reach the company of civilized men once more .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 10]: I do not care what the outcome may be .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 25]: If I can help you to overcome them I am ready to do so ; if not , I will die by your side .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 8]: To-night I followed in a canoe unseen .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 15]: When I heard the shooting , I leaped overboard and swam to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 15]: It was lucky for me some one seized the canoe which I found there .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 53]: The men in her had to swim to other canoes , and two were wounded , I heard them say ; this caused some confusion , and I had something to grasp when I reached the ship ; otherwise I must have been drowned , as the water was very cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 15]: `` Yet you refused an overcoat a little while ago , '' interjected Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 5]: `` Ah , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 11]: For many years I have lived altogether in Indian fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 5]: My skin is hard .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 8]: Wind or rain can not harm me .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 16]: But melted ice mixed with salt water drives even the seals out to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 9]: `` Can you speak the Alaculof language ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 8]: `` Is that what you call them ?
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 33]: Their own name for the tribe is ` The Feathered People , ' because all their chief men and heads of families wear these things , '' and he touched his head-dress .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 10]: `` Yes , I know nearly all their words .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 8]: They do n't use a great many .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 16]: One word may have several meanings , according to the pitch of the voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 13]: `` They captured you on the Smyth Channel side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 5]: Have they deserted it ?
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 9]: Why are they on this side now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 3]: asked Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 34]: `` I believe they brought me here at first because they wished to keep me on account of my magic , and they knew I would endeavor to escape to a passing ship .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: We came over the mountains by a terrible road .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 15]: I have been told that landslips and avalanches have closed the pass ever since .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 32]: I do not know whether that is true or not , but if I had tried to get away in that direction they would have caught me in a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 6]: No man can elude them .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 17]: They can see twice as far as any European , and they are wonderful trackers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 6]: Suddenly his voice failed him .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 19]: Though the words came fluently , his long-disused vocal chords were unequal to the strain of measured speech .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 8]: He asked hoarsely for some hot water .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 37]: When Courtenay next came across him in the saloon he was asleep , and changed so greatly by the removal of pigments from his face that it was difficult to regard him as the same being .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 6]: His story was unquestionably true .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 54]: Tollemache , who had fought an offshoot tribe of these same Indians , Christobal , who vouched for the Argentine accent , and Elsie , who seemed to have read such rare books of travel as dealt with that little known part of the world , bore out the reasonableness of his statements .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 24]: The only individual on board who regarded him with suspicion was Joey , and even Joey was satisfied when Suarez had washed himself .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 28]: It was daylight again , a dawn of dense mist , without wind or hail , ere any member of the ship 's company thought of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 38]: Then Elsie went to her cabin and dreamed of a river of molten gold , down which she was compelled to sail in a cockle-shell boat , while fantastic monsters swam round , and eyed her suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 51]: When , at last , she awoke after a few hours of less exciting slumber , she came out on deck to find the sun shining on a fairy-land of green and blue and diamond white , with gaunt gray rocks and groves of copper beeches to frame the picture .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 89]: There was no pillar of smoke on the lower hills to bear silent testimony to the presence of the Indians ; but the canoe lying alongside told her that the previous night 's events were no part of her dreams , and a man whom she did not recognize -- a man with closely cropped gray hair and a deeply lined , weather-tanned face , from which a pair of sunken , flashing eyes looked kindly at her -- said in Spanish : `` Good morning , señorita .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 12]: I hope I did not startle you when I came aboard .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 16]: And I said things I should not have said in the presence of a lady .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 13]: But believe me , señorita , I was drunk with delight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 27]: CHAPTER X `` MISSING AT LLOYD 'S '' Elsie had slept long and soundly : she found herself in a new world of sunshine and calm .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 24]: When she looked over the side to examine the crudely fashioned canoe , she was astonished by the limpid purity of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 12]: She could see white pebbles and vegetation at a vast depth .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 51]: It seemed to be impossible that a few hours should have worked such a change , but Suarez assured her that the streams which tumbled down the precipitous gorges of the hills ran clear quickly after rain , owing to the sifting of the surface drainage by the phenomenal tree-growth .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 26]: `` Wherever timber can lodge on the hillsides , '' he told her , `` fallen trunks lie in layers of fifteen or twenty feet .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 73]: They rot there , and young saplings push their way through to the light and air , while creepers bind them in an impenetrable mass ; in many places small trees and shrubs of dense foliage take root amidst the decaying stumps beneath , so that even the Indians can not pass from one point to another , but are compelled to climb the rocky watercourses or follow the slopes of glaciers .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 51]: When you see what appears to be a smooth green space above the lower brown-colored belt of copper beech , that is not a moss-covered stretch of open land , but the closely packed tops of young trees , where a new tract has been bared by an avalanche . ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 15]: She was in no mood this morning to assimilate the marvels of Hanover Island .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 15]: Her brain had been cleared , restored to the normal , by refreshing sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 22]: With a more active perception of the curious difficulties which beset the _ Kansas _ came a feeling akin to despair .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 14]: The brightness of nature served rather to convert the ship into a prison .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 37]: Storm and stress , whether of the elements or of the less candid foes who lurked unseen on the neighboring shores , made the _ Kansas _ a veritable fortress , a steel refuge seemingly impregnable .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 34]: But the knowledge of the vessel 's helplessness , and of the equally desperate hazard which beset her inmates , was rendered only more poignant by the smiling aspect of land and sea .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 6]: Elsie was not a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 45]: She was just a healthy , clean-minded Englishwoman , imbued with a love of art for art 's sake , a girl whose wholesome , courageous temperament probably unfitted her to achieve distinction in the artistic career which she had mapped out for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 57]: So the super-Alpine glories surrounding that inland sea , and the prismatic hues flashing from many a glacier and rainbow of cataract mist , left her unmoved , solely because the rough-hewn Indian craft bobbing by the side of the great ship called to mind the extraordinary conditions under which she and all on board existed .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 12]: But she was hungry , and that was a saving sign .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 18]: She guessed that many of the men , after mounting watch until broad daylight , were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 25]: Others were at work below , as was testified by a subdued sound of hammering , with the sharp clink of metal against metal .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 7]: Walker was tinkering at the engines .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 13]: With him , in all likelihood , were the captain and Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 43]: She and Suarez were the drones of the ship , and Suarez , poor fellow , had earned an idle hour if only on account of the scrubbing he had given himself to wash away the tokens of five years of slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 17]: Before going in search of the cook , she walked a few steps towards the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 38]: At the top of the companion she saw Joey , sitting disconsolately on his tail , a sure indication that Courtenay was occupied in depths approachable only by steep iron ladders whither the dog could not follow .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 38]: She whistled softly to her little friend , knowing that Christobal , and perhaps Mr. Boyle , would be on the bridge , keeping the lookout , and she was not inclined for talk at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 34]: The doctor would have understood at once that the girl was below par , owing to the strain of the preceding days , and the lethargic rest which exhaustion had imposed on her .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 63]: Yet , there are times when science does not satisfy ... But Joey , who recked naught of philosophy , and to whom the alarms and excursions of fights on deck came as a touch of mother earth to the sole of Antaeos -- Joey , then , sprang down the stairs , barking joyously , and leaped into her outstretched arms .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 45]: He honored no other person on board , except his master , with such extravagant friendship , and , as the girl carried him aft to the cook 's galley , she asked herself why the dog had taken such a liking to her .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 25]: She blushed a little as she thought : `` It may be that I resemble the lady whom Captain Courtenay is going to marry .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 30]: I wonder why he did not show us her photograph that day when Isobel and I visited his cabin and looked at the pictures of his mother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 14]: I should like to see her , but how can I manage it ?
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 19]: I simply dare not tell him I read that scrap of a letter , even by chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 17]: The dog , apparently , found her an excellent substitute ; he licked her ear contentedly .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 8]: That tickled her , and she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 16]: `` I fear you are a fickle lover , Joey , '' she said aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 34]: `` But you will simply be compelled to remain constant to me while we are in this horrid place , and that may be for the remainder of our lives , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 14]: Joey tried to lick her again to show that he did n't care .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 23]: What could any reasonable dog want more than fine weather , enough to eat , and the prospect of an occasional scrimmage ?
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 16]: When Elsie did ultimately climb to the chart-house , the fit of despondency had fled .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 17]: Boyle was there , having been carried up in a deck chair early in the day .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 4]: He was alone .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 4]: `` Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: he growled pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 15]: `` You 're lookin ' as bright as a new pin , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 19]: Now , if I had been among the pirates , I 'd have taken you with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 15]: `` Do you mean to say that you are actually paying me compliments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 4]: `` Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 7]: Huh ; did n't mean to .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 7]: I 'm an old married man .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 22]: But pirates , especially Spanish ones , are supposed to be very handy with knives and other fellows ' girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 12]: `` You see they did not consider me a prize . ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 4]: `` The rascals !
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 7]: Good job you missed that boat .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 10]: Christobal has been tellin ' me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 6]: They 've gone under . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 8]: `` Do you really think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 13]: `` Ca n't see any chance for them , Miss Maxwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 11]: `` But we are almost as badly situated here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 9]: `` Huh , not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 5]: Lucky chap , Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 10]: He could n't lose a ship if he tried .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 11]: She 'd follow him ` cross country like that pup .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 14]: Look at me : lost three , all brand new from the builders .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 14]: One foundered , one burnt , an ' one stuck on the Goodwins .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 33]: I 'm careful , steady as any man can be , but no owner would trust me with a ship now , unless she was a back number , an ' over-insured .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 8]: Even then my luck would follow me .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 14]: I 'd bring that sort of crazy old tub through the Northwest passage .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 20]: So I 'm first mate , an ' first mate I 'll remain till my ticket gives out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 10]: A good deal of this was Greek to Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 23]: But she knew that Boyle was a man of curt speech , unless deck hands required the stimulus of a tongue lashing .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: Such a string of connected sentences was a rare occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 15]: It argued that the `` chief '' was not unwilling to indulge in reminiscence .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 11]: `` Why do you consider Captain Courtenay so fortunate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 14]: she asked , flushing somewhat at the guile which lay behind the question .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 24]: `` Huh , '' snorted Boyle , amazed that even a slip of a girl should need informing on so obvious a fact .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 23]: `` Do n't you call it luck to be given command of a ship like the _ Kansas _ at his age ?
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 30]: An ' to get five hundred pounds an ' a gold chronometer because the skipper of the _ Florida _ was too full to hold on to the bridge ?
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 5]: You mark my words .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 21]: He 'll be made commodore of the fleet after he pulls the _ Kansas _ out of this mess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 10]: `` What happened to the _ Florida _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: `` Have n't you heard that yarn ?
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 10]: Bless my soul , she was our crack ship .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 45]: She broke her shaft in a gale , an ' the skipper was washed overboard -- you always tell lies about deaders , you know -- so A. C. just waded in an ' saved the whole outfit , passengers an ' all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 9]: `` But he has had reverses , too .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 28]: He was in the Royal Navy , I have been told , and he had to give it up because his people -- '' `` More luck .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 4]: The Royal Navy !
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 13]: Huh , all gold braid , an ' buy your own vittals .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 9]: There 's no money in that game . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 9]: `` Money is not everything in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 18]: A man 's career may be more to him than the mere monetary aspect of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 21]: `` If ever you meet my missus , you 'll hear the other side of the question , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 19]: S'posin ' Courtenay was in the Navy , an ' had a wife an ' family to keep .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 8]: Could he do it on his pay ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 3]: Not he .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 23]: As it is , he 's sure to marry a girl with a pile , and wind up a managing owner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 13]: `` Perhaps he is engaged to some such young lady already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 6]: `` Have n't heard so .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 13]: You may be sure there 's one waitin ' for him somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 5]: _ I _ know .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 11]: There 's no dodgin ' luck , good or bad .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 23]: I thought it was goin ' to be that friend of yours , but she 's off the register , poor lass .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 6]: I did n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 8]: I 'm an idiot , for sure .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 37]: You see , I do n't talk much as a rule , Miss Maxwell , or I should know better than to chin-wag like a blazin ' -- huh , like a babblin ' fool . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 10]: Elsie turned her face aside when he mentioned Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 41]: It seemed to her sensitive soul an almost unfair thing that she should be gossiping about trivialities when the girl who had commenced this unlucky voyage in such high spirits was lying beneath that grim sea behind the smiling headland .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 12]: Yet she knew that Boyle meant no harm by his chatter .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 29]: He was weak from his wound , and perhaps a trifle light-headed as the result of being brought from the stuffy saloon to the airy and sunlit chart-room .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 20]: So she crushed a sorrow that was unavailing , and strove to put the sailor at his ease again .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 16]: `` I do not find any harm in your remark , '' she said resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 26]: `` Were it possible , I should have been very pleased to see Miss Baring married to a man of strong character like Captain Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 12]: By the way , who is keeping watch on deck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 13]: `` The doctor was here with me until a few minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 6]: Then the skipper telephoned him .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 19]: I guess there is some one on the lookout , but you might just cast an eye shorewards .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 9]: I 'm not supposed to move yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 32]: He wriggled uneasily in his chair , for the spirit was willing ; but Elsie made him lie quiet ; she rearranged his pillow , and stepped on to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 33]: By walking from port to starboard , and traversing the short length of the spar deck , she could command a view of the bay and of most parts of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 29]: She heard the dog scuttling down the companion ; on reaching the after-rail , she saw the captain engaged in earnest , low-toned conversation with Tollemache and Walker .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 34]: They were standing on the main deck near the engine-room door , and examining something which resembled a lump of coal ; she saw the engineer take three similar lumps from a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 24]: Christobal appeared , carrying a bucket of water , into which the lumps were placed by Walker , who handled them very gingerly .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 37]: After a slight delay , he began to crumble one in his fingers , still keeping it in the water , until finally he drew forth what Elsie recognized at once as a stick of dynamite .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 18]: Though it was blackened by contact with the coal , she was certain of its real nature .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 34]: She had visited a great many mines , and the officials always scared the ladies of the party by telling them what would happen if the explosives ' shed were to blow up .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 46]: She had even seen dynamite placed in the sun to dry , as it is very susceptible to moisture , and she wondered , naturally enough , why such a dangerous agent should be hidden in , or disguised as , a piece of coal .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 31]: She thought that the men should be made aware of her presence , so she leaned over and said : `` May I ask what you four are plotting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 7]: They looked at her in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 15]: They were so engrossed in their discovery that they had eyes for nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 12]: Walker straightway plunged the sausage-shaped gray stick into the water again .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 10]: `` What are you doing with that dynamite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 13]: `` Do you intend to visit the Valley of the Golden Sands ?
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 7]: If so , please take me .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 6]: I am very poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 6]: It was Courtenay who answered .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 6]: `` Are you alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 9]: `` Mr. Boyle is in the chart-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 13]: `` I know ; but is any one else up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 10]: `` Then we shall join you at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 17]: Notwithstanding the serious demeanor of the men , Elsie was far from guessing what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 6]: But she was soon enlightened .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 15]: `` In which bunker was the coal placed which we shipped at Valparaiso ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 4]: Courtenay asked Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 13]: `` In the forrard cross bunker , '' was the instant answer .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 13]: `` And that was the first coal used in the furnaces ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 23]: The captain 's tone was official , exceedingly so , and the chief officer took the cue from his superior in rank .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 10]: `` Did we get up steam with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 36]: `` There might have been a hundred-weight or two lying loose in the stoke-hold , but , for all practical purposes , we have used nothing but the Valparaiso bunker since we left port . ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 12]: `` The rest of our coal was shipped at Coronel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 4]: `` You hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 18]: It is exactly as I have told you , '' said Courtenay , glancing at the others .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 35]: `` I must explain to you , Mr. Boyle , that I wished you to state the facts in front of witnesses before I gave you my reasons for cross-examining you on the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 19]: Mr. Walker and I have been certain , all along , that the furnaces were blown up wilfully .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 6]: Now our suspicions are proved .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 26]: This morning , after a careful scrutiny , we came across a number of lumps of coal cleverly constructed out of small pieces glued together .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 18]: In the center of each lump was a stick of dynamite , protected by an asbestos wrapper .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 21]: It was undoubtedly the intent of some miscreant that a number of these lumps should be fed into the furnaces .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 38]: This actually occurred , as we know , but , by the mercy of Providence , the ship did not experience the full power of the explosion , or she must have sunk like a stone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 7]: `` Huh , '' grunted Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 7]: `` Who holds the insurance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 18]: `` The shippers of the cargo , of course -- Messrs. Baring , Thompson & Miguel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 14]: `` Worth a quarter of a million sterling , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 11]: `` Huh , it 's a lot of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 6]: There was a momentary silence .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 12]: Elsie 's eyes grew larger , and she became rather pale .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 15]: As was her habit when puzzled , she placed a finger on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 5]: Christobal noted her action .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 12]: Indeed , he missed few of her characteristic habits or expressions .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 4]: He laughed quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 15]: `` I think you are quite right , Miss Maxwell , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 15]: `` This is one of the many instances in which silence is golden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 11]: Taken by surprise , she blushed and dropped her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 17]: But Courtenay said promptly : `` There are some instances in which silence may be misinterpreted .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 30]: Let me state at once that the shippers of the valuable cargo on board the _ Kansas _ will suffer a serious financial reverse if the ship is lost .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 54]: Two thousand tons of copper may be worth a considerable fixed sum , but the lack of the metal on the London market at the end of January will have far-reaching consequences in a fight against the bull clique in Paris , and that is why Mr. Baring made this heavy shipment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 16]: `` Those consequences could be foreseen and discounted , '' put in Tollemache , dryly .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 4]: But by whom ?
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 16]: By the man who sent his only daughter as a passenger on this vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 6]: Every one scouted that notion .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 22]: But Tollemache , though disavowing any thought of Mr. Baring as a party to the scheme , stuck to his guns .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 19]: `` Somebody will make a pile when the _ Kansas _ is reported missing , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 17]: `` The insurance money would not be paid for a long time , '' Courtenay explained .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 12]: `` No , but the copper market will respond instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 8]: `` Then the process has commenced already .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 13]: The _ Kansas _ should have been reported yesterday from Sandy Point .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 15]: The news that she has not arrived will soon reach the nearest cable station .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 14]: There will be terrific excitement at Lloyd 's when that becomes known . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 26]: `` It is distinctly odd that Suarez should turn up last night , and tell us how gold slipped through his fingers five years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 32]: Let us hope the parallel will hold good for the gentleman who so amiably endeavored to send the _ Kansas _ to the bottom of the Pacific , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 44]: `` It is rather a rotten trick , '' broke in Tollemache , `` just a bit of Spanish roguery -- Well , I 'm sorry , Christobal , but I ca n't regard you as quite a Spaniard , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 14]: `` Nevertheless , I am one , '' and the doctor stiffened visibly .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 26]: `` What Tollemache means is that he would expect you to take the English and straightforward view of a piece of rascality , doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 7]: Then Courtenay paused in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 33]: `` By the way , '' he continued , with the frowning dubiety of one whose thoughts outstrip his words , `` does any one here know a man named Ventana ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 14]: `` It is a name common enough in Chile , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 28]: `` If you mean Señor Pedro Ventana , who is associated with Mr. Baring in mining matters , I am acquainted with him , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 9]: The men seemed to have forgotten her presence .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 31]: They were wrapped up in the remarkable discovery which Courtenay himself had made by diligent search among the coal ready for use in the furnaces when the explosion took place .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 20]: For no reason in particular , save the unexpectedness of it , Elsie 's statement was received with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 23]: They all looked at her , and some of them wondered , perhaps , why her smiling eyes had lost their mirth .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 34]: Yet there was nothing unreasonable in the mere fact that a certain Chilean named Ventana , who had business relations with Mr. Baring , should make the acquaintance of Isobel Baring 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 13]: As quickly as it had arisen , the feeling of strangeness passed .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 4]: Courtenay even laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 12]: Elsie as the Jonah of the ship was a quaint conceit .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 24]: `` I mentioned Ventana because I was told he took some part of the insurance on his own account , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 27]: `` But he was a member of Baring 's copper syndicate , and , indeed , was spoken of as a mining engineer of high repute .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 14]: Believe me , I was not jumping to conclusions on that account . ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 17]: `` I know him to be a very bad man , '' said Elsie , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 9]: Her face was white and her eyes downcast .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 40]: It was evident that the sudden introduction of Ventana 's personality was distressing to her , but Courtenay , preoccupied with the dastardly attempt made to sink his ship , did not observe this feature of a peculiar discussion .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 3]: `` Bad !
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 8]: In what sense , Miss Maxwell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 4]: he asked unguardedly .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 7]: `` In the most loathsome sense .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: He is evil-minded , vicious , altogether detestable .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 22]: If Mr. Baring knew his character as I know it , Ventana would not be allowed to enter his office . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 5]: `` Pedro Ventana ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 3]: interrupted Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 35]: `` Is he a half-caste , a tall , brown-skinned man , who affects an American drawl when he speaks English -- a man prominent in Santiago society and in mining circles generally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 8]: `` That is odd , exceedingly so .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 18]: I once heard a rumor -- but perhaps it is unfair to mention it in this connection .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 25]: Yet it can not hurt any one if I state that Isobel Baring and he were -- well -- how shall I put it ?
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 17]: -- at any rate , there was a lively summer-hotel sort of attachment between them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 23]: `` Isobel has never told me that , '' said Elsie , nerving herself for a personal disclosure which was obviously disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 34]: `` I own a small ranch near Quillota , and , as there was a chance of copper being located there , Mr. Baring advised me to employ Ventana as an expert prospector .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 16]: Indeed , Mr. Baring himself sent Ventana to examine the property and report on it .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 6]: He came to see me .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 23]: He told me there were no minerals of value on my land , but I could never free myself from him afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 11]: Indeed , I am running away from him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 17]: She uttered the concluding words with a genuine indignation which forthwith evaporated in its unconscious humor .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 25]: Everybody laughed , even the girl herself , and Boyle grunted : `` Huh , shows the beggar 's good taste , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 29]: Courtenay , perhaps , thought that if he encountered Ventana again he would take the opportunity to reason with him in the approved manner of the high seas .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 50]: And , as there was no need to prolong a topic which caused Elsie any sort of embarrassment , he hastened to say : `` I have brought names into the discussion largely to show what a doubtful field is opened once we begin to suspect without real cause .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 36]: The only witness of any value we have on board is Frascuelo , and his evidence merely goes to prove a secret design to interfere with , or control , the trimming of the bunker .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 20]: That particular hatch must be sealed , and the specimens we have secured put away under lock and key .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 13]: I feel assured that the remainder of our coal is above suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 12]: We can carry the inquiry no further while we remain here .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 20]: Now , Mr. Walker , you have something of a more cheering nature to communicate , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 5]: The engineer grinned genially .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 56]: `` I do n't wish to bind myself to a day or so , Miss Maxwell and gentlemen , '' he said , `` but I 've had a good look at the damage , an ' I feel pwitty shu-aw I 'll get up steam in one boil-aw within ten days or a fawt-night .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 59]: It 'll be a makeshift job at the best , because I have so few spa-aw fittin 's , an ' no chance of makin ' a castin ' , but I 'll bet a ye'aw 's scwew the _ Kansas _ gets a move on her undaw her own steam soon aftaw New Ye-aw 's Day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 5]: New Year 's Day !
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 10]: What a lump in the throat the words brought .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 15]: In three days it would be Christmas , in seven more the New Year !
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 45]: Though , from the beginning of the voyage , they were prepared to pass both festivals at sea , there was all the difference in the world between a steady progress towards home and friends and the present plight of the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 11]: Death , too , had thrown its shadow over them .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 18]: Some there were to whom the passing of the years would mean no more in this world .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 44]: Others , the great majority of the ship 's company , were probably hidden by the same eternal silence ; the last sight they had of them was a dim vision of boats rushing into a chaos of angry seas and sheeted spray .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 10]: But Courtenay would have none of these mournful memories .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 60]: He had solved the mystery of the ship 's breakdown , and an expert mechanical engineer had just pledged his reputation to restore wings to the _ Kansas _ -- somewhat clipped wings , it is true , but sufficient , given fair weather and reasonable good fortune , to bring her to a civilized settlement in the Straits .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 10]: Why , then , should they yield to gloom ?
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 8]: `` Is n't that glorious news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 18]: `` Now , Christobal , that motor trip in June through the Pyrenees looks feasible once more .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 25]: And you , Miss Maxwell , though you have never quailed for an instant , can hope to be in England in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 23]: As for you , Tollemache , surely you will say that our prospects are ` fair , ' at the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 20]: `` I would say more than that if it were not for these poisonous Indians , '' replied Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 13]: `` Here they come now , a whole canoe load of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: I have never seen such rotters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 39]: And , indeed , Francisco Suarez , detailed to keep watch and ward over the ship until noon , ran up the companion and cried excitedly : `` Four head men have just put off from Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 8]: They have missed me , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 8]: They will want me to go back .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 27]: I beseech you , señor captain , not to give me up to them , but rather to send a bullet through my miserable heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 23]: `` Tell him to calm himself , '' said Courtenay , coolly , when Christobal had translated this flow of guttural Spanish .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 21]: `` He has no cause to fear them now ; let him nerve himself , and show a bold front .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 10]: A palaver is the best thing that can happen .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 9]: We must display all the arms we possess .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 14]: Bid any of your invalids who can stand upright show themselves , Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 8]: We must lift you outside , Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 7]: Bring your camera , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 19]: If we could give these fellows a good picture of themselves it would scare them to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 15]: The captain of the _ Kansas _ was not to be repressed that day .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 11]: He refused to look at the dark side of things .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 36]: He even found cause for congratulation in the threatened visit of cannibals whom Suarez feared so greatly that he preferred death to the chance of returning to them , although they had spared his life .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 10]: And Courtenay infected them all with his splendid optimism .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 22]: It was with curiosity rather than dread that they watched the rapid approach of the canoe and its almost naked occupants .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 15]: CHAPTER XI CONFIDENCES Courtenay was mistaken in thinking that the savages sought a parley .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 36]: The canoe was paddled by two women ; they changed its course with a dexterous twist of the blades when within a cable 's length of the ship , and then circled slowly round her .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 9]: The four men jabbered in astonishingly loud voices .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 21]: Suarez , who gathered the purport of their talk , explained that they were discussing the best method of attack .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 18]: `` The three younger men belong to the tribe which I lived with , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 12]: `` The old man sitting between the women is a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 25]: I think he must have come from the north of the island with some of his friends , attracted by the smoke signals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 5]: `` From the north ?
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 6]: Is there a road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 11]: asked Courtenay , when he learnt what Suarez was saying .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 13]: `` He would arrive in a canoe , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 12]: `` The Indians venture out to sea in very bad weather .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 44]: He probably passed the ship late last night , and , now I come to think of it , the canoe which you captured is not familiar to me , whereas I know by sight every craft owned by the Feathered People . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 8]: `` How many do they possess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 4]: `` Twenty-three . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 5]: These statements were disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 39]: Not only was it possible for the natives to surround the _ Kansas _ with a whole swarm of men , but the mere number of their boats would render it exceedingly difficult to repel a combined assault .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 14]: And nothing could be more truculent than the demeanor of the semi-nude warriors .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 24]: They pointed at each person they saw on the decks , and made a tremendous row when they passed the canoe fastened alongside .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 69]: Despite their keen sight , they evidently did not recognize Suarez , who now wore a cap and a suit of clothes taken from the locker of one of the missing stewards , while his appearance was so altered otherwise that even the people on board found it difficult to regard him as the monstrous-looking wizard whom they had dragged out of the water some twelve hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 8]: The impudence of the Indians exasperated Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 16]: The sheer size of the _ Kansas _ should have awed them , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 14]: `` I wish they had left their women behind , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 23]: `` If the men were alone , an ounce or two of buck-shot would soon teach them to keep their distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 29]: `` Perhaps they are aware of the danger of boarding a ship which stands so high above the sea as the _ Kansas _ , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 15]: `` Why not fire a couple of rounds of blank cartridge at them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 11]: `` Worst thing you can do , '' said Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 14]: `` They would be sure , then , you could not hurt them .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 15]: If you shoot , shoot straight , with the heaviest shot you possess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 15]: At that moment the rowers permitted the canoe to swing round with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 35]: One of the men stood up , and Elsie , who seized the chance of snap-shotting the party , ran to the upper deck , so she did not overhear Courtenay 's smothered ejaculation .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 31]: He was scrutinizing the savages through his glasses , and he had distinctly seen the ship 's name painted on a small water-cask on which the Indian had been sitting .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 7]: Tollemache made the same dramatic discovery .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 14]: `` Out of one of the ship 's life-boats , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 10]: he said in a low tone to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 7]: Did you see the number ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 8]: `` Number 3 , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 6]: `` I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 10]: That was the first life-boat which got away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 35]: Christobal , startled out of his wonted sang-froid , whispered in his turn : `` Do you mean to say that one of the boats has fallen into the hands of these fiends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 10]: `` I am afraid so , '' replied Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 12]: `` Of course , that particular keg may have drifted ashore .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 15]: In any case , it tells the fate of one section of the mutineers .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 23]: Either the boat is swamped , or the crew are now on the island , and we know what that signifies . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 23]: `` Is there no chance of bribing these people into friendliness , or , at least , into a temporary truce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 7]: `` It is hard to decide .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 11]: Tollemache and Suarez are best able to form an opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 8]: What do you say , Tollemache ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 11]: `` Not a bit of use ; they are insatiable .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 9]: The more you give the more they want .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 21]: The only way to deal with those rotters is to stir them up with a Gatling or a twelve-pounder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 10]: Suarez , when appealed to , shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 54]: `` Last winter , '' he said , `` the man sitting aft , he with the single albatross feather sticking in his hair , seized his own son , aged six , and dashed his brains out on the rocks because the little fellow dropped a basket of sea-eggs he was carrying .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 15]: The woman nearest to him is his wife , and she raised no protest .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 11]: You might as well try to fondle a hungry puma .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 26]: I am the only man they have ever spared , and they spared me solely because they thought I gave them power over their enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 12]: If you had a cannon , you might drive them off .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 24]: As it is , we shall be compelled to fight for our lives ; they are brave enough in their own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 13]: The experience of the miner from Argentina was not to be gainsaid .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 48]: The predicament of the giant _ Kansas _ -- inert , immovable , lying in that peaceful bay at the mercy of a horde of painted savages -- was one of the strange facts almost beyond credence which men encounter at times in the byways of life .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 25]: It reminded Courtenay of a visit he paid to the crocodile tank at Karachi when he was a midshipman on the _ Boadicea _ .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 43]: He noticed that some of the huge saurians , eighteen feet in length and covered with scale armor off which a bullet would glance , were squirming uneasily , and the Hindu attendant told him that they had been bitten by mosquitoes !
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 33]: He laughed quietly , but his mirth had a curious ring in it which boded ill for certain unknown members of the Alaculof tribe when the threatened tussle came to close quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 4]: Elsie heard him .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 22]: Leaning over the rails of the spar deck , she asked cheerfully : `` What is the joke , Captain Courtenay ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 9]: And why do n't the Indians come nearer ?
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 4]: Are they timid ?
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 7]: They do n't look it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 6]: He glanced up at her .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 29]: If aught were needed to complete the contrast between civilization and savagery it was given by the comparison which the girl offered to the women in the canoe .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 17]: The hot sun and the absence of wind had changed the temperature from winter to summer .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 16]: After breakfast , Elsie had donned a muslin dress , and a broad-brimmed straw hat .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 13]: Exposure to the weather had bronzed her skin to a delightful tint .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 28]: Her nut-brown hair framed a sweetly pretty face , and her clear blue eyes and red lips , slightly parted , smiled bewitchingly at the men beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 32]: The camera in her hands added a holiday aspect to her appearance , an aspect which was unutterably disquieting in its relation to the muttered forebodings she had broken in on .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 42]: But Courtenay 's voice gave no hint of the tumult in his breast , though some malign spirit seemed to whisper the agonizing question : `` Will you permit her to fall into the hands of the ghouls waiting without ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 27]: `` I find the get-up of our visitors distinctly humorous , '' he said , `` and I hope they are a bit scared of us .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 10]: We would prefer their room to their company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 17]: `` I thought that Señor Suarez would hail them , as he can speak their language .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 14]: Perhaps he does not wish them to know he is on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 28]: Now , Elsie had heard the man 's impassioned appeal when the Indians were first sighted , so Courtenay felt that she , too , was acting .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 24]: `` You look nice and cool up there , '' he answered , `` and your words do not belie your looks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 10]: `` Please , what does that mean exactly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: `` Need I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 7]: You treat our troubles airily . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: `` Shall one ` wear a rough garment to deceive ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 6]: she quoted with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 9]: `` Do n't you remember the next verse ?
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 17]: You ought to retort : ' I am no prophet , I am an husbandman ! '
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 15]: But that would not be quite right , for you are a sailor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 12]: She blushed a little at the chance turn of the phrase .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 50]: Neither the girl nor her hearers recalled the succeeding verses , wherein the destruction of Jerusalem is foretold : `` And I will bring the third part through the fire , and will refine them as silver is refined , and will try them as gold is tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 21]: Indeed , a new direction was given to Elsie 's thoughts by the somewhat scowling aspect of Christobal 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 14]: He was looking at Courtenay in a manner which betokened a certain displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 13]: The Spaniard 's cultivated cynicism was subjugated by a more powerful sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 43]: It seemed to Elsie that he envied Courtenay his youth and high spirits , for , in very truth , the mere exchange of those harmless pleasantries had tuned the younger man 's soul to the transcendental pitch of the knight errant .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 47]: In his heart he was vowing to rescue this fair lady from the dangers which beset her , though he said jokingly with his lips : `` If a husbandman has to do with a tiller I may claim some expert knowledge , Miss Maxwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 20]: Elsie dared not meet his eyes ; a flood of understanding had suddenly poured its miraculous waters over her .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 25]: Incidents unimportant in themselves , utterances which seemed to have no veiled intent at the time , rushed in upon her with overwhelming conviction .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 28]: Christobal suspected her of flirting with Courtenay , and disapproved of it as strongly as she herself had condemned Isobel 's admitted efforts in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 18]: Though not a little dismayed , she resolved to carry the war into the enemy 's territory .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 12]: `` Why are you looking so glum , Dr. Christobal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 23]: `` Has the captain 's quip given you a shock , or is it that you are surprised at my levity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 11]: `` I am neither shocked nor surprised , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 19]: I have not lived fifty years in this Vale of Tears without being prepared for the unexpected . ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 10]: `` Does that imply that you are disillusioned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 5]: `` By no means .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 6]: My heart is amazingly young .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 15]: ` There is no fool like an old fool , ' you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 13]: `` Oh , please do n't speak of age in that way .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 8]: You are far from being an antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 31]: Why , within the past twenty-four hours I have come to look on you as a sort of elder brother , who can be indulgent even while he chides . ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 12]: Courtenay found himself wondering what had caused this flash of rapiers .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 25]: But , so far as he was concerned , the proceedings of the Indians put a stop to any further share in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 9]: The canoe had drifted closer to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 31]: It was about eighty yards distant when the Indian who was on his feet suddenly whirled a sling , and sent a stone crashing through the window of the music-room .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 48]: The heavy missile , which , when picked up , was found to weigh nearly half a pound , just missed Tollemache , who was the first to take note of the sharp warning given by Suarez , but failed , nevertheless , to dodge quickly enough .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 21]: The captain raised a double-barreled fowling-piece , the only gun on board , and fired point blank at the savages .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 54]: But the women were paddling away vigorously , and the shot splashed in the water on all sides of the canoe , though a howl and a series of violent contortions showed that one , at least , of the pellets had stung the wizened Indian whom Suarez believed to be a newcomer .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 31]: There was no second shot -- cartridges were too precious to be wasted at an impossible range -- but the undeniable fact remained that the Indians meant to be aggressive .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 8]: For a little time no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 32]: They heard the echoes of the gunshot faintly thrown back by the nearest wall of rock ; the regular plash of the paddles as the canoe sped shorewards was distinctly audible .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 17]: They watched the tiny craft until it vanished round the wooded point which concealed Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 43]: Then , to add to the sense of loneliness and peace conveyed by the placid bay and the green slopes beyond , a big whale rolled into view in the middle distance , and blew a column of water high in air .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 19]: The muffled clang of a hammer broke the silence which had fallen on the watchers from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 9]: Walker had slipped back to his beloved engines .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 23]: Had he not vowed that the massive pistons should again thrust forth their willing arms on or about New Year 's day ?
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 19]: He had forgotten the cannibals and their threats ere he was at the foot of the engine-room ladder .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 41]: Courtenay and Tollemache joined him ; Christobal went to the saloon to visit his patients ; Elsie was left with Mr. Boyle , who forthwith fell into a doze , being worn out by the fresh air and the excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 24]: Joey , having followed Courtenay to the one doorway in the ship which he could not enter , trotted back to find Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 6]: She greeted him with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 9]: `` Hail , friend , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 23]: `` You , at least , are not jealous if I speak to your master , wherein you show your exceeding wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 26]: Now , since you and I are persons of leisure , tell me , Joey , what we shall do to make ourselves useful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 9]: The dog was accustomed to being spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 4]: He awaited developments .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 27]: `` It seems to me , Joey , '' she continued , `` that Gulielmo Frascuelo is the one person on board who claims our attention .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 8]: There is a mystery to be solved .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 19]: Bound up in it are my poor Isobel , that beast , Ventana , and a drunken coal-trimmer .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 13]: An odd assortment to rub shoulders , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: Joey still reserved his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 41]: When the girl went to the forecastle by climbing down the sailors ' ladder to the lower deck , he thought she was making a mistake ; but she held her arms for his spring , and all was well .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 13]: She had not previously visited the quarters set apart for the crew .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 30]: Puzzled by the large number of small cabins with names of subordinate officers painted on them , she paused and cried loudly : `` Are you there , Frascuelo ?
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 7]: May I speak to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 19]: An exclamation of surprise , a somewhat forcible exclamation , too , answered her from an inner berth .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 29]: Frascuelo had heard from the Chilean who brought his meals that there was an Englishwoman on board , but he did not know that she spoke Spanish fluently .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 22]: He answered her question politely enough in the next breath , and the dog indicated the right door by hopping inside .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 8]: Frascuelo was reclining on a lower bunk .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 35]: His injured leg was well on the way towards recovery , but the wound and its resultant confinement had chastened him ; he had lost the brigandish swagger which was his most cherished asset .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 26]: After acknowledging inquiries as to his progress , he showed such eagerness for news that Elsie told him briefly what had caused the latest uproar .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 27]: She cheered him , too , with the announcement made by the engineer , and then led him to the topic on which she sought information .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 16]: `` In some ways , I regard you as most unfortunate , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 22]: `` I have been told you are here by accident -- that you never meant to take the voyage at all .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 5]: Is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 16]: Frascuelo , delighted to have secured a sympathetic listener , poured forth his sorrows volubly .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 10]: He bore no ill-will against the captain he said .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 40]: He knew it was wrong to draw a knife on the chief officer , as his tale was an unlikely one , and he ought to have trusted to a more orderly recital of the facts to obtain credence .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 24]: `` But I was that mad , señorita , I just saw red , and the drink was yet surging up in me .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 12]: I felt I must fight somebody , whatever the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 26]: `` Can you tell me why any one had such a grievance against you that you should be thrown into the hold and nearly killed ?
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 20]: That was a strange thing to do , especially as you came aboard too late for your work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 10]: `` Ah , that is the point , señorita .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 27]: You see , we trimmers work in gangs , and the man who flung me through the hatch was the man who had taken my place .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 26]: I see no reason to doubt that it was he who made me drunk the previous evening , and I know who did that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 7]: `` What was his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 16]: `` José Anacleto -- ` José the Wine-bag ' we call him on the Plaza .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 10]: I ought to have smelt mischief when José paid .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 11]: Never before had I seen him do such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 7]: And a good liquor , too .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 10]: Dios , it must have cost him dollars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 14]: `` What object had he in coming on board instead of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 10]: `` Ah , there you beat me , señorita .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 11]: I have twisted my poor brain with thinking of that .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 40]: We only earned a dollar a head , and bunkering a ship from a flat is hard work while it lasts , whereas one would expect José to ride twenty miles the other way to escape such a task .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 41]: But he was in the plot , and he shall tell me why , or -- '' By force of habit , Frascuelo put his right hand to his belt , but his sheath knife had been taken from him .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 10]: He smiled sheepishly ; yet his black eyes twinkled .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 3]: `` Plot !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 9]: Why do you speak of a plot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 20]: asked the girl , hoping that the word betokened some more promising clue than she could discern thus far .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 8]: `` Why did the furnaces blow up ?
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 10]: Tell me that , and I can answer you .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 10]: Good , honest coal is n't made of gunpowder .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 34]: José , or some one behind him , meant to sink the ship , and , as I might have proved awkward , they were willing that I should go down with her .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 22]: Maybe I shall meet José if we get out of this rat-trap ; then we shall have a little talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 26]: Again his hand wandered towards his waist , but he bethought himself , and bent in pretense that the bandage on his leg needed readjusting .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 44]: Despite the man 's shrewd guess as to the cause of the accident in the stoke-hold , Elsie was at a loss to connect the freak of some Valparaiso loafer with the deep-laid scheme which contemplated the destruction of the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 15]: She had followed the discussion in the chart-room with full appreciation of its significance .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 28]: Valuable as the ship and cargo were , there was far more at stake in the effect of the loss on the copper markets of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 35]: The most important copper-exporting firm in Chile would practically be ruined , while the Paris `` ring , '' of which she had read in the newspapers , would have matters its own way .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 22]: Financial interests of such magnitude would hardly be bound up with the carousals and quarrels of Frascuelo and José the Wine-bag .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 14]: Yet -- `` Have you ever heard of a Señor Pedro Ventana ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 4]: she asked suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 9]: `` Has he to do with mines ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 6]: inquired the Chilean , tentatively .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 10]: `` I know him by sight , señorita . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 16]: `` Would he be acquainted with this man , Anacleto , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 5]: `` Ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 14]: José would know anybody whom he could touch for a few pesetas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 13]: She left him , promising to visit him daily in the future .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 14]: As she walked back towards the bridge companion , she met Dr. Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 33]: His fit of ill-humor had gone : he was all smiles ; but Elsie , having extracted such information as Frascuelo possessed , was bent on adding to her store of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 11]: Incidentally , she meant to widen the doctor 's views .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 10]: `` Why have you taken to lecturing me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 16]: she asked , with a simple directness which Christobal was not slow to profit by .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 35]: `` Because , though old enough to be your father , or your elder brother , as you were kind enough to put it , I have not yet reached years of discretion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 10]: If candor were needed , he would be candid .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 13]: Sophistry was worse than useless with a woman of Elsie 's type .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 12]: The only way to win her was to be transparently honest .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 19]: To Christobal , after an experience of a generation of Chileans , this came as a refreshing novelty .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 24]: `` You mean , I suppose , that if every one attended to their own affairs it would be a less spiteful world ?
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 8]: I am inclined to agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 12]: Unhappily , life is largely made up of these minor evils .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 23]: Yet I should have thought that the desperate conditions under which we exist at this hour might protect me from uncharitableness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 9]: `` You are pleased to be severe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 15]: `` No ; it is the last privilege of danger that shams should vanish .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 41]: Yet we plumb the depths of absurdity when we contest the right of any woman , even a young and unmarried one , to appreciate all that a brave man has done and is doing to save her life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 5]: Here was candor undiluted .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 6]: Elsie was speaking without heat .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 11]: She might have been reasoning some disputed point in ethics .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 9]: The Spaniard was obviously thrown off his guard .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 15]: `` You seem to demand an explanation , '' he said with some warmth .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 8]: `` Well , you shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 11]: I am not a man to flinch from the disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 29]: I admit a sort of impression , I might almost describe it as a conviction , that Captain Courtenay 's manner towards you betokens a growing admiration . ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 13]: `` This is the wildest folly , '' cried Elsie in bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 17]: `` I -- I can not imagine what put such a notion into your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 17]: `` Let me at least lay claim to a species of altruism , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 28]: `` I can see fifty excellent reasons why our young and good-looking commander should be drawn to you , nor can I urge one against it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 23]: `` But he is already engaged to another woman , so my one reason is worth more than all your fifty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 10]: `` Ah , can that really be so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 28]: The tense eagerness in his voice might have warned her , were it not that she was shocked by the bitterness which welled up in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 27]: She was amazed by this introspective glimpse ; it alarmed her ; she must convince herself , at all costs , that she had spoken truly .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 18]: Although the evidence she tendered was of dubious value , she strove to advance her argument further .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 40]: `` I have prized our friendship greatly , Dr. Christobal , '' she said , speaking with a calm deliberateness that rang hollow in her own ears , `` so greatly that I am compelled to utter this protest .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 19]: Now , to end a distasteful controversy , let me tell you what I know to be true .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 42]: When the ship was stranded , and we all thought our only chance of safety was to take to the boats , by a fluke , the accident of the moment , I was left alone in the captain 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 43]: The sea was breaking in through the doorway , and it brought an odd relief to my over-burthened mind when I endeavored to rescue the contents of a locker which , for some reason , had been scattered on the floor previously .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: Among them I found some letters .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 21]: I think you will believe me when I say that I would not consciously read another person 's private correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 39]: Just then , I was hardly responsible for my actions , and I did happen to see and grasp the meaning of a passage in a letter from Captain Courtenay 's sister which alluded to his affianced wife .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 11]: It is not such a tragic admission , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 22]: I would scarce have given it another thought were it not for your manner this morning and your words last night .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 40]: I paid no heed at the time to the innuendo that I had come on deck to find him -- to waylay him , as I have heard men say when speaking of a type of woman I despise .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 11]: So I resolved to straighten out a stupid little tangle .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 24]: It would be ridiculous , in our present state of suspended animation , to let such a slight thing mar our friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 12]: Elsie , was indulging in that most delusive thing , self-persuasion .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 20]: It was not surprising , therefore , that she failed to note the unmixed satisfaction with which Christobal listened .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 8]: `` Am I forgiven , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 11]: he asked , with a new tenderness in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes , let us laugh at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 14]: `` But -- '' `` Please let us talk of something more useful .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 18]: I have a little plan , and you might ask the captain if he approves of it .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 33]: We have plenty of strong canvas ; what do you say if I set to work and cover in the promenade deck , fore and aft as well as on both sides ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 26]: Then , if the Indians try to seize the ship , they would not be able to gain a lodgment at so many points simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 11]: It would simplify the defense , so to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 3]: `` Admirable !
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 7]: I am sure Courtenay will agree .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 17]: Indeed , I am ashamed that we superior males failed to hit on the idea earlier .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 15]: Before I go , let me be certain that my forgiveness is complete ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 10]: `` Shall we quarrel about a degree of blessedness ?
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 10]: I assure you I like you more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 33]: When all is said and done , you thought I was flinging myself at our excellent captain 's head , so you tried to spare me the pangs of unrequited love . ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: The words hurt , but she did not flinch .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 10]: Christobal , anxious to deceive himself , was radiant .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 11]: `` Your charity goes too far , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 8]: `` That was not the exact reason .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 15]: No , my dear Miss Maxwell , I begin to exercise a new-born discretion .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 14]: I shall not elucidate that cryptic remark until after New Year 's Day .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 16]: But I do n't mind telling you why I have hit on a definite date .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 42]: If all goes well with us -- and we have had so many escapes that Providence may well send us a few more -- the _ Kansas _ should steam out of our little bay of Good Hope about that period .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 15]: Then I shall remind you of our discussion , and keep my promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: With that he left her .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 38]: After a gasp or two of surprise , for Elsie could read only one meaning into his words , she hurried up the bridge companion to arouse Mr. Boyle and ask what he would like for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 36]: `` Thank goodness , Joey , '' she murmured to the dog , whom she picked up in her arms , `` thank goodness , Mr. Boyle is neither an engaged man nor a widower .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 17]: I do believe our excellent doctor is more concerned on his own account than on mine .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 15]: And he said that your master 's manner ` betokened a growing admiration . '
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 39]: I wish -- no , Joey , I mean nothing of the sort , and if you dare to hint at such a thing I shall be very angry with you -- very -- angry -- indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 27]: `` Huh , '' muttered Boyle , wide awake and watching her through the open door , `` some one has been worryin ' that girl .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 20]: It 's a sure sign of trouble when a woman whispers in the ear of a dog or cat .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 7]: Now , who can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 4]: That doctor chap ?
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 15]: He cocked his eye at her this mornin ' when she spoke about Ventana .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 21]: He 's a pretty tough old bird to think about settin ' up house with a nice young jenny wren .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 4]: Damn his eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 42]: he may be as rich as a Jew , but if she does n't want him , an ' is too skeered to say so , I 'll tell him , in the right sort of Spanish , an ' all .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 24]: Now , had it been the skipper -- '' Boyle hardly knew what to think -- `` had it been the skipper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 45]: CHAPTER XII ENLIGHTENMENT The captain was enthusiastic when he heard of Elsie 's idea for the protection of the main deck -- `` an excellent notion , '' he termed it , but he scouted the suggestion that she should undertake the work herself .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 20]: `` You little know what hauling taut heavy canvas means , '' he said when they met at lunch .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 10]: `` It would tear the skin off your hands .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 15]: No , Miss Maxwell , we can put our Chileans on to that job .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 9]: I have something better for you to do .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 5]: Can you map ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 16]: `` I have copied heaps of plans for my father , '' she told him .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 3]: `` Excellent !
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 20]: At noon to-day I took an observation , so I intend to devote an hour to revising the chart .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 4]: Will you help ?
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 7]: Joey is in the scheme already .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 30]: Then the Admiralty will gracefully acknowledge the survey supplied by Miss Elsie Maxwell , Captain Arthur Courtenay , and Joey , otherwise known as ` the pup . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 30]: His allusion to the dog by name recalled `` José the Wine-bag , '' but Elsie thought she would retain that tiny scrap of detective information for the present .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 21]: So she simply said : `` You will explain to me my part of the undertaking , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 8]: You must first correct the Index Error .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 26]: Then you subtract the Dip and the Refraction in Altitude , take the sun 's semi-diameter from the Nautical Almanac , and add the Parallax .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 6]: Do you follow me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 9]: `` Perfectly ; it sounds the easiest thing .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 19]: But I do n't wish to hear the remarks of the Admiralty when they see the result . ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 23]: `` I am interested in navigation , to the slight extent possible to a mere yachtsman : may I join you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 3]: interposed Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes , '' said the captain off-handedly .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 8]: Elsie repressed the smile on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 15]: Did the worthy doctor fear developments if this harmless map-making progressed in his absence ?
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 26]: She imagined , too , that Courtenay 's acquiesence in Christobal 's desire to be present was not wholly in accordance with his innermost wish .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 7]: She promptly crushed that dangerous fancy .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 22]: The captain was only seeking for some excuse to take her away from the rough work of rigging the extra awnings .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 12]: How odd that the other thought should have cropped up first !
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 16]: `` You still think the _ Kansas _ will win clear of her difficulties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 5]: she said rather hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 30]: `` I am sorry to bring King Charles 's head into the conversation , but , after all , the ship 's safety is essential to your survey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 13]: `` Every hour strengthens my opinion , '' was the confident reply .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 23]: `` Suarez says that there is a reasonable chance of occasional brief spells of fine weather at this period of the year .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 27]: At any rate , the gale may not be absolutely continuous , and Walker is assured that he can patch up the engines for half speed .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 24]: Given a calm day , a day like this , for instance , we can reach the Straits in a few hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 6]: `` And the Indians ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 9]: `` I leave them out of my reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 7]: What else can I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 8]: `` Kill 'em , '' said Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: Courtenay glanced sharply at his fellow-countryman .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 13]: He disliked these references to the Alaculof bogy in Elsie 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 12]: It was enough that it should exist without being constantly paraded .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 16]: Though the girl herself was the culprit , Tollemache should have left the topic alone .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 9]: But Tollemache was a man of fixed ideas .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 28]: The device of canvas shields to repel boarders had set him thinking how much more effective it would be if the savages were kept at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 31]: He well knew that they would not be deterred by a shotgun and a few revolvers , once they had made up their minds to carry the ship by assault .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 23]: To explain himself , he was compelled to speak at some length , and his swarthy face flushed under the unusual strain .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 10]: `` We have dynamite aboard , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 33]: `` Why not construct a couple of infernal machines which could be fired by pulling a string , and let them drift towards the canoes when the Indians are near enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 27]: `` It is worth trying , '' was Courtenay 's brief comment , though he saw later that Tollemache 's suggestion was a very useful one .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 57]: Elsie 's first task was to prepare a large-scale drawing of the southern part of Hanover Island , as set forth in Admiralty Chart No. 1837 -LRB- Sheet 2 , Patagonia -RRB- , which is the only trustworthy record available for shipmasters using the outer passage between the Gulf of Penas and the Straits of Magellan .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 13]: It was a simple matter to fill in the few contours given .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 47]: The neighboring small islands were shown in reasonable detail , but the whole western coast of Hanover Island itself consisted of a dotted line and a solitary peak , Stokes Mountain , the height of which could be estimated and its position triangulated from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 22]: Even Concepcion Straits on the north and the San Blas Channel on the south were marked in those significant dotted lines .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 9]: The coast was practically unknown to civilized man .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 26]: One of the last fortresses of the world , grim , inhospitable , it guarded its secret recesses with crag and glacier and reef-strewn sea .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 33]: It was borne in on the girl , while she worked , that the chiefest marvel in her present condition was the triumph of science over nature in its most hostile mood .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 15]: The _ Kansas _ boasted all the comforts and luxuries of a well-equipped hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 34]: Seated at the same table as herself was a skilful sailor , using logarithms , secants and cosecants , polar distances and hour angles , as if he were in some university class-room .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 51]: Near the door , enjoying the warm sun , Boyle was stretched on a deck-chair , while Christobal was offering a half-hearted protest against his patient 's manifest enjoyment of the first cigar he had been able to smoke since a Chilean knife disturbed certain sensory nerves between his shoulder-blades .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 31]: The every sociableness of the gathering was a paradox : the truth lay with the ice-capped hills and the ape-like nomads who infested the humid forests of the lower slopes .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 7]: She stole a glance at Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 29]: He was so keenly engaged on the business in hand , so bent on achieving accuracy in his figures , that she chided herself for her morbid reverie .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 32]: Then she wondered if he ever gave a thought to that promised wife of his , who must soon suffer the agony of knowing that the _ Kansas _ was overdue .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 31]: Elsie was sufficiently well acquainted with shipping to realize the sensation that would be created by the first cablegram from Coronel anouncing the non-appearance of the steamer in the Straits .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 15]: The Valparaiso newspapers would be full of surmises as to the vessel 's fate .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 20]: They would publish full details of the valuable cargo -- and give a list of the passengers and officers .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 20]: Ventana would learn then , if he had not heard of it earlier , that she was on board .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 14]: And he alone would understand the true reason of her flight from Chile .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 17]: Her cheeks flushed , and she applied herself more closely to the chart she was copying .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 14]: She had left a good deal unsaid in her brief statement that morning .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 27]: How strange , how utterly unexpected it was , that Ventana 's name should fall from Courtenay 's lips -- Courtenay , of all men living !
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 35]: And what did Isobel mean , during that last dreadful scene ere she was carried away to the boat , by screaming in her frenzy that Ventana had taken `` an ample vengeance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 4]: Vengeance for what ?
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 29]: Had the half-breed dared to make the same proposal to the rich and highly placed Isobel Baring that he did not scruple to put before the needy governess ?
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 5]: Surely that was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 19]: There were limits even to his audacity -- `` Well , how is my chief hydrographer progressing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 11]: Courtenay 's cheery voice banished the unwelcome specter of Ventana .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 3]: Elsie started .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 17]: `` I do believe you were day-dreaming , '' said the captain with a surprised smile .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 8]: `` A penny for your thoughts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 20]: `` I do n't think you can pay me , '' she retorted , hoping to cover her confusion .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 9]: `` Wo n't you accept Chilean currency ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 8]: `` Not on the high seas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 8]: `` But you are on dry land .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 25]: Please make a dot on your map at 51 degrees 14 minutes 9 seconds South , and 74 degrees 59 minutes 3 seconds West .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 9]: That is the present position of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 6]: Are you listening , Boyle ?
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 17]: According to the chart , the ship is high and dry , four miles inland . ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 4]: `` Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 3]: grunted Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 19]: `` Reminds me of a skipper I once sailed with , bound from Rotterdam to Hull in ballast .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 25]: There was a Scotch mist best part of the trip , an ' the old man loaded with schnapps to keep out the damp .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 18]: First time he got a squint of the sun he went as yaller as a Swede turnip .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 14]: ` It 's all up with us , boys , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 8]: ` My missus is forty fathoms below .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 8]: We 've just sailed over York . '
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 14]: You see , he 'd made a mistake of a few degrees . ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 16]: `` Boyle , '' said Courtenay , severely , `` what has come to you ?
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 8]: Are you actually making a joke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 13]: `` I think I must have bin tongue-tied before , captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 5]: `` Before what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 19]: `` Before that lame duck in the fo ` c ` sle stuck his tobacco-cutter into my jaw .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 17]: I can talk like a prize parrot now -- ca n't I , Miss Maxwell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 30]: Elsie was laughing , but she remembered the subject on which Boyle had displayed his new-found power of speech ; and human parrots are apt to say too much .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 28]: `` Please do n't tell any more funny little stories , '' she cried , `` or I shall be putting dots in the wrong places . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 9]: `` And causing us to waste time scandalously .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 7]: Are you ready , Miss Maxwell ?
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 10]: Let me pin this compass card on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 22]: Use the parallel ruler ; regard each inch as a mile , and I 'll do the rest by guesswork . ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 12]: Courtenay took his binoculars , and went on to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 22]: He called out the apparent distance of each landmark he could distinguish , described it , and gave its true bearing .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 37]: In the result , Elsie found she had prepared a clear and fairly accurate chart of the bay and its headlands , while the position of the distant range of mountains was marked with tolerable precision .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 8]: But Courtenay was far from being satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 35]: `` If I had a base line , or even a fresh set of points taken higher up the inlet , I could improve on my part of the survey , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 8]: `` Yours is admirable , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 17]: Of course , I know you are an artist ; but mapping is a thing apart .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 5]: That is first-rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 24]: `` Perhaps you may be able to secure fresh data when the _ Kansas _ puts to sea again , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 25]: `` If I am conning the wheel , I must leave the chart-making entirely to my assistant , '' replied the captain , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 14]: `` But I do mean to peep a little further into our estuary .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 16]: Before the ship sails I may have another spare hour to devote to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 6]: `` In what way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 3]: asked Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 6]: `` By utilizing the canoe .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 20]: A mile or so higher up the channel I should be clear of the bluff which hides Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 16]: I imagine it will be possible then to see the full extent of the bay .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 16]: I must get you to sound Suarez as to the lie of the land . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 17]: `` I hope you will do nothing of the sort , '' protested Elsie , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 8]: Do you think the canoe unsafe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 8]: `` No , no ; not that .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 5]: But those waiting Indians .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 6]: They might see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 7]: `` Oh , the Indians again !
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 9]: I shall run no risk of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 23]: It would indeed be the irony of fate if the _ Kansas _ slipped her cable and left the skipper behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 3]: `` Huh !
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 3]: No fear !
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 7]: She 'd follow you like Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 13]: I was tellin ' Miss Maxwell what a lucky fellow you were .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 20]: Besides , if you went , I 'd be in command , and you know what would happen then .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 20]: By gad , if all else failed , the bloomin ' tub would turn turtle in the Pool . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 20]: To emphasize his remarks , Boyle blew a big smoke ring , and shot several smaller rings through it .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 37]: Elsie felt Christobal 's critical eye on her ; she was shading the outlines of the map , and trusted that her head was bent sufficiently to hide the tell-tale color which leapt to her face .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 9]: But Courtenay wished to hear more of this .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 27]: `` I hope you do not credit everything my chief officer says about me , '' he said , glancing over her shoulder at the drawing .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 18]: `` Nor about himself , '' he added , as she was too busy to look up .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 23]: `` To my knowledge , he has refused the command of two ships since we both joined the _ Kansas _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 5]: `` Home orders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 9]: cried Boyle , who was certainly beyond himself .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 14]: Probably he missed his regular vocal exercise owing to lack of a crew .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 18]: `` My missus says to me , ` You just stick to Captain Courtenay , young feller-me-lad .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 8]: He 's one of the get-rich-quick sort .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: P'raps you 'll learn from him how to dodge Board of Trade inquiries . '
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 11]: You stand on what I told you , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 3]: You remember ?
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 2]: Commodore !
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 3]: Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 15]: Something must be done to stem the long-pent flood of Mr. Boyle 's gossip .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 6]: Elsie turned on him desperately .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 19]: `` How do you expect me to listen to you , and work at the same time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 12]: `` Sorry , '' he answered , composing himself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 6]: Courtenay glanced at the chronometer .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 10]: `` I must be off , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 18]: `` Tollemache may need some help with his bombs , and those Chileans require looking after . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 12]: Christobal , too , quitted the chart-room to visit his patients .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 27]: He had said very little while he sat there , and Elsie did not know whether to laugh or cry at the tragic-comedy of her environment .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 17]: She was only certain of one thing -- she would like to box Boyle 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 21]: She was completely at a loss to account for his persistent efforts to drag in references to their prior conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 6]: She dared not catechize him .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 11]: That would be piling up more difficulties for the future .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 28]: But what possessed him to blurt out such embarrassing details in the presence of the two men whom she most wished to remain in ignorance of them ?
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: She peeped at Boyle sideways .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 22]: His eyes were closed , the cigar was between his teeth , and he had a broad grin on his face .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 28]: She could not guess that the once taciturn chief officer of the _ Kansas _ was saying to himself : `` My godfather , how Pills glared !
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 19]: There will be trouble on this ship about a woman before long , or I 'm a Dutchman .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 13]: An ' did n't the skipper rise at the fly , too !
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 3]: Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 7]: He uttered the concluding monosyllable aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 6]: `` Did you speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 5]: inquired Elsie , severely .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 3]: `` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 6]: No , Miss Maxwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 12]: `` Oh , I thought you wanted to say something . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 5]: `` Not a word .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 9]: Too much talking makes my back stiff . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 11]: `` Your physical peculiarities are amazing , Mr. Boyle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 12]: `` Huh , it 's odd how things take some people .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 45]: I once knew a chap , skipper of the _ Flower of the Ocean _ , who could drink a hogshead of beer an ' be as sober as a judge except in one leg , an ' that was a wooden one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 9]: It was impossible to be vexed with him .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 20]: `` You have met some very remarkable shipmasters , if all you say be true , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: `` Sailors are queer folk , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 49]: That same brig , _ Flower of the Ocean _ , an ' a pretty flower she was , too -- all tar an ' coal-dust , with a perfume that would poison a rat -- put into Grimsby one day , an ' the crowd went ashore .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 15]: They kicked up a shindy with some bar-loungers , an ' the fur flew .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 32]: When the police came , old Peg-leg , the skipper , you know , was the only man left in the place , havin ' unshipped his crutch for the fight .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 16]: ` What have you bin a-doin ' of here -- throwin ' grapes about ? '
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 12]: asked the peeler , gazin ' at the floor , suspicious-like .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 16]: ` Grapes , ' said Dot-an ' - carry-one , ` them ai n't grapes .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 5]: Them 's eyeballs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 9]: Another time -- '' `` Mr. Boyle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 6]: shrieked Elsie , and fled .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 4]: `` Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 3]: he grunted .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 14]: `` Off before the wind when she hears a Sunday-school yarn like that .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 17]: Wonder what she 'd say if I told her about the plum-duff with beetles for Sultanas .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 8]: Girls are brought up nowadays like orchids .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 12]: They should n't be let loose in this wicked world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 19]: As Elsie passed along the promenade deck she saw Courtenay , Tollemache , and Walker deep in consultation .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 10]: They were arranging a percussion fuse of fulminating mercury .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 24]: While she was watching them , Walker dropped a broken furnace bar on top of a small package placed on an iron block .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 20]: Instantly there was a sharp report , and Joey , who was an interested observer , jumped several feet .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 19]: The men laughed , and she heard Courtenay say : `` That is the right proportion of fulminate .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 12]: Now , Tollemache , I 'll help you to fix them .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 14]: We do not know the moment those reptiles may choose to attack . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 14]: So the captain did not leave the Alaculof menace altogether out of count .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 16]: Something rose in her throat , some wave of emotion which threatened her splendid serenity .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 19]: She ran rather than walked to her cabin , flung herself on the bed , and sobbed piteously .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 10]: It had to come , this tempest of tears .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 16]: When desperate odds demanded unflinching courage , she faced them dry-eyed , with steadfast heart .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 21]: But to-day , in the bright sunshine and apparent security of the ship , sinister death-shadows tortured her into rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 42]: She did not stop to ask herself why she wept ; being a woman , she yielded to the gust , and when it had ended , with the suddenness of a summer shower , she smiled through the vanishing tears .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 13]: Her first concern was that none should be aware of her weakness .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 10]: `` How stupid of me , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 17]: `` What would the men think if they knew I broke down in this fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 6]: She looked in a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 43]: In the clear light without , any one could see she had been crying , and there was so much work to be done that she did not wish to remain in her stateroom until all tokens of the storm had passed .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 42]: She searched for a powder-puff , and was at a loss to discover its whereabouts until she recollected that the doctor had borrowed it for the use of a man slightly scalded when his own supply of antiseptic powder was exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 24]: So she went into Isobel 's room , entering it for the first time since the _ Kansas _ struck on the shoal .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 30]: The two cabins communicated , as Mr. Baring had gone to the expense of having a door broken through the partition for the girls ' use during the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 36]: If Elsie had not already given way to tears she must have faltered now at the sight of her friend 's belongings strewed in confusion over the floor , chairs , dressing-table , and bed .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 12]: Isobel possessed a gold-mounted dressing-case the size of an ordinary portmanteau .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 25]: It held an assortment of pretty , and mostly useless , knick-knacks , and they had all been tumbled out in a frantic hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 21]: At first Elsie flinched from further scrutiny , but common sense told her that this despondent mood must be fought .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 29]: She dropped to her knees , found a mother-o ' - pearl _ poudrier _ , and picked up other scattered articles and replaced them in the dressing-case .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 13]: To accomplish this it was necessary to rearrange various trays and drawers .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 30]: Portraits of girl friends , including her own , and of men unknown to her , letters , memoranda , and other documents , were thrown about in disorder .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 40]: All these she put back in their receptacles , wondering the while what motive had led Isobel to make such a frenzied search for some special object that she cared not a jot what became of the remaining articles .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 21]: Yet , who could account for the frenzy of that terrible hour when the captain announced the ship 's danger ?
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 40]: Even Courtenay himself , she remembered , had emptied a locker in a rapid hunt for the dog 's coat ; but he had laughingly explained his haste later when some chance reference was made to his soaked garments .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 9]: Anything was explicable in the light of panic .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 42]: She gathered up a skirt and some blouses , locked the dressing-case , put the key in her purse , and quitted the room with a heavy heart , for the handling of her friend 's treasures had brought sad memories .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 19]: Passing into the deck corridor , she heard the captain 's voice , apparently at a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 27]: Two hundred yards away from the ship , Courtenay and Tollemache were anchoring a flat framework , built of spare hatches and secured by wooden cross-pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 10]: On it stood the first of the infernal machines .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 32]: The raft floated level with the water , so its only conspicuous fitting was a small spar and a block , to which a line and an iron bar were attached .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 11]: The men looked strange in her eyes at that distance .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 50]: In the marvellously clear light she could see their features distinctly , and , when Courtenay shouted to a sailor to haul in the slack of the line , she caught a trumpet-like ring that recalled the scene in the saloon when he held back the mob of stewards .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 19]: His athletic figure , silhouetted against the shimmering green of the water , was instinct with graceful strength .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 38]: He looked a born leader of men , and , as though to mark his quickness of observation , no sooner had Elsie glanced over the side of the ship than he waved a hand to her .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 3]: She sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 21]: A bitter thought peeped up in her that he was perhaps a trifle careless in showing her these little attentions .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 17]: She wished he would speak to her of that other girl who awaited him in England .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 18]: A pleasant state of confidence would be established then ; these secret twitches of sentiment were irritating .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 52]: Some women , in her place , would pay no heed to that aspect of their enforced relations ; not so Elsie , whose virginal breast was unduly fluttered by the discovery that a young man is the most natural thing in the world for a young woman to think about .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 12]: She walked aft to obtain a nearer view of the operations .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 41]: The sailors had already shut in a large portion of the promenade deck with canvas , and she noticed that loopholes were provided , every ten feet or so , to permit the effective use of the defenders ' firearms .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 49]: Thus , at each step , she was reminded of the precarious hold she had on life , and she was positively frightened when some mad impulse surged through her whole being , bidding her imperiously to abandon her ultra-conscientious loyalty to a woman she had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 5]: Why struggle against circumstance ?
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 13]: If death were so near , what did she gain by prudery ?
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 15]: For an instant she stood aghast at the revelation which had come to her .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 7]: She was in love with Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 32]: She was ready to die by his side , fearless and joyous , if only he would put his arms around her and tell her that she was dear to him .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 11]: Ah , the fierce delight of that first silent surrender !
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 26]: Her heart beat as it had never pulsed before , even under the stress of the storm or the sudden terror of the night attack .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 13]: Her eyes shone , and her breath came laboriously between parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 7]: Golden dreams coursed through her brain .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: She was thrilled with an unutterable longing .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 15]: Then her swimming eyes rested on a group of men standing on the poop .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 18]: Among them was Christobal , interested , like the rest , in the floating of the mine .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 20]: And forthwith Elsie fell from the clouds , and was brought back , shuddering , to cold reason again .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 13]: She was sick at heart ; she hated herself for her self-abasement .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 45]: She must gird her with sackcloth and mourn ; and the fight must be fought now , without parley or hesitation , unless the sweetness were to go forth from life for ever , and all things should turn to ashes in her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 55]: So , marshaling the best qualities of her womanhood , she quelled the turmoil in her breast , forced herself to join the men on the after deck , and said , when the smiling Spaniard turned to receive her : `` Why am I denied the mild excitement of mine-laying , Dr. Christobal ?
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 16]: Is it that you dread the effect on my nerves of these murderous preparations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 18]: `` No , '' he answered , making room for her at the railing by his side .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 17]: `` I had missed you , of course , but I thought you were resting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 5]: `` Resting , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 6]: I have been quite busy .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 11]: Where do they mean to put the second contrivance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 22]: `` About there , '' he said , indicating a point on the surface of the bay eastward of the canoe .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 16]: His right arm was extended , and he placed his left hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 16]: Courtenay , hailing Walker , saw the two leaning over the rails in that attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 12]: Perhaps one of the two hoped that Courtenay would see them .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 25]: Elsie , as part of her punishment , did not shrink away , though the touch of Christobal 's hand made her flesh creep .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 16]: But Joey , whose mind was singularly free from complexities , leaped up at her .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 20]: He wanted Elsie to tell him what Courtenay was doing out there , so far away from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 7]: She stooped and picked him up .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: Christobal had no excuse for a second caress .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 16]: `` Bark , Joey , '' she whispered , `` bark and call your master .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 15]: If anything happens to him , you and I shall never see England again .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 9]: And I am longing for home to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 27]: CHAPTER XIII THE FIGHT Christmas Day arrived , and maintained its kindly repute by finding affairs on board the _ Kansas _ changed for the better .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 39]: Mr. Boyle was so far recovered that he could walk ; he even took command of two watches in the twenty-four hours , but was forbidden to exert himself , lest the wound in his back should reopen .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 46]: Several injured sailors and firemen were convalescent ; the two most serious cases were out of danger ; Frascuelo , hardy as a weed , dared the risk of using his damaged leg , and survived , though his progress along the deck was painful .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 21]: Nevertheless , on Christmas morning he presented himself before the captain , and asked leave to abandon his present quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 22]: He felt lonely in the forecastle , and wished to berth with the other Chileans in the neighborhood of the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 42]: Although his luck was bad in some respects , the coal-trimmer was endowed with the nine lives of a cat , for there could be no manner of doubt that he dragged himself aft just in time to avoid being killed .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 10]: Yet , never was day less ominous in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 12]: The breezy , sunlit morning brought no hint of coming tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 25]: The fine weather which had prevailed since the _ Kansas _ drifted into the estuary seemed to become more settled as the month wore .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 6]: Suarez said it was unprecedented .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 49]: Not only had he not witnessed in five years three consecutive days without rain , snow , or hail , but the Indians had a proverb : `` Who so-ever sees fire-in-the-sky -LRB- the sun -RRB- for seven days shall see the leaf red a hundred times . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 47]: In effect , centenarians were needed to bear testimony to a week 's fine weather ; whereas no man -- most certainly no woman -- among the Alaculofs ever succeeded in reaching the threescore years and ten regarded by the psalmist as the span of life .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 25]: But the miner from Argentina never wavered in his belief that the Indians would soon muster every adult for an assault on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 13]: The elements might waver , but not the hate of the savage .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 18]: From the rising of the sun to the going down thereof Suarez was ever on the alert .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 19]: He ate his meals with his eyes fixed on the low point of land which hid Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 17]: He saw thin columns of smoke rising when no other eye on board could discern them .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 56]: Once he made out the forms of a number of women searching for shellfish on some distant rocks at low water , and on Christmas morning he reported the presence of three canoes among the trees near Otter Creek , when Courtenay could scarce be sure of their character after scrutinizing them through his glasses .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 29]: Every other person on the ship held the opinion that the Alaculofs would attack by night , if they were not afraid to attempt the enterprise at all .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 22]: So Suarez slept soundly , while his companions were on the _ qui vive _ for a call to repel boarders .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 31]: Were it not for the strain induced by the silent menace of their savage neighbors , the small company suffered no ill from their prolonged stay in this peaceful anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 9]: There was work in plenty for all hands .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 31]: Walker was re-enforced by a trio of firemen , whose technical knowledge , slight as it was , proved useful when he began to fit and connect the disabled machinery .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 36]: For the rest , the promenade deck was walled with strong canvas , while Courtenay and Tollemache gave undivided attention to the fashioning of several other floating bombs which could be exploded from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 28]: They also provided flexible steam-pipes in places where a rush might be made if the Indians once secured a footing on the deck , fore or aft .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 53]: Steam was kept up constantly in the donkey-boiler , not alone for the electric light and the daily working of the pumps -- as the _ Kansas _ had not blundered over the shoal without straining some of her plates -- but for use against the naked bodies of their possible assailants .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 30]: When day followed day without any sign of hostility , not a man on board , save Suarez and Tollemache , paid much real heed to the shoreward peril .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 20]: Walker , with his hammers and cold chisels , his screw-jacks and wrenches , was the center of interest .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 20]: And Walker 's swarthy visage wore a permanent grin , which presaged well for the fulfilment of his promise .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 7]: Elsie devoted herself to the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 16]: She was thus brought more in contact with Christobal than with any of the others .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 11]: Nor did he make this close acquaintance irksome to her .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 14]: Always suave and charming in manner , he exerted himself to be entertaining .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 42]: Though she knew full well that if the _ Kansas _ reached the open sea again he would ask her to marry him , he was evidently content to deny himself the privileges of courtship until a proper time and season .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 11]: She was far too wise to appear to avoid Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 12]: Indeed , she was studiously agreeable to him when they met .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 25]: She adopted the safe role of good-fellowship , flattering herself that her own folly would shrink to nothingness under the hourly castigation thus inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 14]: During this period , Mr. Boyle 's changeable characteristics puzzled and amused her .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 25]: As he grew stronger , and took part in the active life of the ship , so did his sudden excess of talkativeness disappear .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 21]: Once she happened to overhear his remarks to a couple of Chileans who were told to swab off the decks .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 12]: Obviously , they had scamped their work , and Boyle expostulated .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 11]: Then she grasped the essential element in Boyle 's composition .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 9]: He was capable only of a single idea .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 28]: When he was chief officer he ceased to be an ordinary man ; the corollary was , of course , that he ceased to use ordinary language .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 16]: She was in her cabin , and dared not come out while the tornado raged .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 34]: She did not know that Tollemache was listening , too , until she heard him ask : `` Did you ever meet any fellow who could swear harder than you , Boyle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 11]: `` Yes , once , '' was the curt answer .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 8]: `` He must have been a rotter .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 6]: What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 3]: `` Huh !
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 36]: just the regulation patter , but he used a megaphone , so I gave him best ... '' But , so far as Elsie was concerned , Boyle 's fund of reminiscence had dried up .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 59]: After the midday meal on Christmas day -- a sumptuous repast , for the due preparation of which Elsie had come to the Chilean cook 's assistance in the matter of the plum-pudding -- Suarez suddenly reported that a new column of smoke was rising from Guanaco Hill , a crag dominating the eastern side of the bay .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 28]: The hill owed its name , he explained , to a large cave , in which a legendary herd of llama was said to have its abode .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 31]: Probably there had never been any llama on the island , but the Indians were frightened of the cave , with its galloping ghosts , and would not enter it .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 16]: He was unable to attribute any special significance to the signal on that particular place .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 18]: During the five years with the Alaculof tribe he had never seen a fire lit there before .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 12]: That , in itself , was a fact sinister and alarming .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 11]: Suarez had sufficient tact not to make this statement publicly .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 15]: He told Christobal , and the doctor passed on the information to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 17]: Both men went to the poop with their glasses , and carefully examined the coast line .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 19]: Courtenay was the first to break an oppressive silence , and his low pitched voice announced stirring tidings .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 9]: `` Do you see those canoes yonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 15]: `` There were three under the trees before Suarez discovered the smoke on Guanaco .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 11]: Now I fancy I can make out nearly a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 15]: Though they are not launched , they have been put there for some purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 16]: Would you mind going forrard and asking Mr. Boyle to summon all hands on deck ?
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 7]: He knows exactly what to do .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 21]: Remember that I regard you and Miss Maxwell as non-combatants , and expect you both to remain in the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 31]: If these painted devils really mean to attack , some of us will get hurt , and then your services will be of greater value than in the fighting line .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 23]: And , if I do not see Miss Maxwell before the trouble begins , please tell her she need fear no alarm .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 14]: We shall be able to beat off our assailants with comparative ease . ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 17]: When the captain of the _ Kansas _ spoke like that there was no gainsaying him .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 23]: Even Christobal , whose jealous suspicions were ever ready to burst into flame , was roused to enthusiasm by his cool gallantry .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 19]: But , ere the Spaniard turned to go , a disturbing thought forced its way to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 33]: `` We have every confidence in you , '' he said , `` and I admit that it should be a simple matter to prevent the savages from gaining the upper hand .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 5]: Yet , accidents happen .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 9]: Suppose they manage to rush your defense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 17]: `` They will not do that while I and every other man on deck are alive .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 21]: If the worst comes to the worst , you have a revolver -- '' `` Yes , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 14]: `` It will suffice for two , but not for a hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 24]: The two men , united by the very bond which threatened to bring them into antagonism , looked into each other 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 8]: `` Is that your last word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 3]: asked Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 5]: `` It is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 9]: `` I feel sure that you are right .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 4]: They shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 27]: They were nearer a real friendship then than either of them thought possible , and the bond which held them was love for the same woman .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 19]: Courtenay , using his glasses again , saw that a number of Indians were launching the canoes simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 43]: He counted nine small craft , each holding five or six men , or men and women -- at the distance , nearly three miles , he could not be certain whether or not they all wore the distinguishing head-dress of feathers .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 25]: Against wind and current they could not possibly reach the ship under half an hour , and the smallness of the fleet surprised him .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: He stooped and patted Joey , who was at peace with the world after a good dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 14]: `` We are in luck 's way , pup , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 26]: `` These rascals might get the better of us by sheer force of numbers , but there are not fifty of them , all told .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 3]: Poor devils !
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 8]: They are coming to the slaughter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 14]: The news that the Indians were advancing ran through the ship like wildfire .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 26]: Including Mr. Boyle , Frascuelo , and those among the Chileans whose wounds were not serious , there were fourteen men available for the defense .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 9]: Unfortunately , the supply of firearms was inadequate .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 20]: A shot-gun and five revolvers constituted the armory , and one of the pistols was in Christobal 's pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 45]: The supply of ammunition was so small that the revolvers could not be reloaded more than three times ; but Courtenay had two hundred shot cartridges , and , against naked men , an ounce of shot is far more effective than a bullet .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 17]: The captain hoped to terrify the Indians before they attempted to scale the ship 's sides .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 28]: If various ruses failed , and the attack was pressed , he had decided not to split up his small force in the effort to repel boarders .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 36]: A scattered resistance would surely break down at one point or another : there would be a rush of savages along the decks , a panic among the Chileans , and all would be ended .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 35]: On the other hand , when fighting collectively under European leadership , and well aware that the Indians would kill and spare not , the half-breeds might be trusted to acquit themselves like men .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 14]: The canvas awning constituted a flimsy citadel in the center of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 20]: Six men were stationed on the starboard side of the promenade deck , and six on the port side .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 65]: Tollemache and a Chilean , who said he could shoot well , were told to frustrate any attempt to climb the after part of the ship , while Courtenay , with his fowling-piece , would have the lion 's share of this work from the spar deck , as he undertook to keep the rails clear forward and help the revolver practise if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 26]: With him was Suarez , who knew what was expected of him , so the language difficulty offered no apparent hindrance once the fight began .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 32]: Finally , if the Indians made good their footing , the defenders were to rally towards the saloon companion where steam jets were ready to spurt withering blasts along the corridors .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 29]: It was a good plan , and might have kept at bay an enemy of higher valor than the Alaculofs , provided they were not armed with rifles .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 11]: Against modern weapons of long range nothing could be done .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 12]: If Suarez did not exaggerate , therein lay the real danger .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 39]: Courtenay wished to make sure at the outset of the number of guns carried by the savages ; it was also important to know whether their marksmen were distributed , or crowded together in one or two canoes .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 13]: If the latter , he would give those warriors his special attention .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 19]: His binocular glasses were not strong enough so he walked back towards the chart-house to procure a telescope .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 38]: Catching Joey under his left arm , he climbed the short ladder leading to the spar deck , and pulled it up after him , the bolts having been already removed to permit of that being done .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 22]: Walker was screwing tight the door of the engine-room , in order to safeguard the fireman in attendance on the donkey-boiler .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 22]: Now that the screw-driving was actually in operation , it very unpleasantly reminded Courtenay of the fastening of a coffin lid .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 33]: Neither Walker nor the man inside could guess the gruesome notion which held the captain in its chilly grip for an instant ; indeed , the engineer looked up with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 19]: `` I suppose it 's twue , sir , the-aw 's goin ' to be a fight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 12]: `` There 's a fair chance of one , Walker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: Walker winked suggestively .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 23]: `` That chap inside thinks he 's out of it , '' he said , `` so that 's all wight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 17]: An energetic turn of the screwdriver signified that the man from Newcastle held the opposite view .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 18]: Much as he loved his engines , he preferred to be on deck when the trouble came .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 38]: It happened that during this slight delay Courtenay glanced at the northern headland , which Elsie had christened Cape Templar , owing to the somewhat remarkable profile of a knight in armor offered by its seaward crags .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 30]: Possibly , had he gone straight to the chart-house , he might not have noticed a signal fire which was in full blast on the summit of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 44]: It had not been many minutes in existence , and it struck him at once that it was a vehicle of communication between the savages in the approaching canoes and others , yet invisible , who were expected to share in the attack .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 14]: He was quick to perceive how seriously this new peril affected his calculations .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 25]: By the time the nine canoes he had counted were alongside the ship , there might be dozens of others ready to help them .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 6]: He leaned over the rail .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 11]: `` Did you test those flexible pipes this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , they-aw in fine condition , '' said Walker .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 8]: `` Try them again , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 6]: I want to make sure .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 10]: Our lives may depend on them very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 8]: He saw Suarez watching the oncoming canoes .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 20]: By a touch on the shoulder he called the man 's attention to the smoke signal on Cape Templar .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 10]: A voluble and perfervid explanation in Spanish was useless .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 9]: Here arose the unforeseen need of an interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 24]: Without troubling to analyze his feelings , Courtenay was glad of the excuse which presented itself of obtaining a momentary glimpse of Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 28]: `` Bring the señorita , '' he said , and Elsie , wondering why she had been summoned from the saloon , ran up the bridge companion .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 12]: Her face was aglow with excitement , her heart going pit-a-pat .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 36]: She hoped that Courtenay meant to keep her near him during the fight ; she almost doubted Christobal 's statement that the captain had given specific orders that she was to remain in the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 21]: It was one thing that she should wish to avoid him , but why should he wish to avoid her ?
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 18]: The joy in her eyes died away when she found that the captain merely required a translator .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 11]: The restraint she imposed on herself made her tongue trip .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 20]: She had to ask Suarez to repeat his statement twice before she was able to put it into English .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 31]: `` He says that the Indians only kindle a fire on that point when they want the signal to be seen from the sea , '' she explained at last .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 25]: `` They used it once , to his knowledge , when some of them had gone to the island out there to kill seals .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 33]: He can not guess what it portends to-day , but he is quite sure that they have many more canoes at command than those which you now see up the bay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 9]: Courtenay could not fail to notice her agitation .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 8]: His quick intent was to soothe her .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 16]: `` I am afraid my sending for you in such a hurry rather alarmed you .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 17]: Suarez strikes me as a person of nerves ; he overrates the enemy , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 38]: I think you know me well enough to believe that I would not mislead you , and I am quite in earnest when I tell you that we shall drive off these unfortunate wretches with comparative ease .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 16]: Why , I had it in my heart to pity them a moment ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 11]: She was glad he misunderstood the cause of her agitation .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 14]: `` Suarez is certainly rather dramatic , '' she said , smiling wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 12]: `` I ought to have discounted his Spanish mode of address .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 12]: But is it really necessary that I should remain below ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 4]: `` It is .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 18]: If shots are fired , or stones slung at us , the chart-house will probably be hit .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 15]: Ah , yes , I am sure you would risk that , and more .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 6]: But we may sustain casualties .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 7]: And Christobal ought to have help .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 14]: You see , I am asking you to act the braver part . ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 10]: He caught her hand and looked into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 25]: There are so many messages that can be given in that silent language ; for a blissful moment , Elsie forgot the other woman .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 21]: Not until she had left the bridge did she realize that Courtenay , too , must have been equally forgetful .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 13]: And that was very distressing , both for her and the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 22]: But here she was , face to face with him , and in such close proximity that she was unaccountably timid .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 19]: While her heart leaped in tumult , she forced her lips to answer : `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 5]: You are always right .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 25]: I was selfish in thinking that -- that I -- might -- '' There was a pitiful quivering in the corners of her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 6]: Courtenay felt her hand tremble .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 12]: `` Be a brave girl , Elsie , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 6]: `` You must go now .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 4]: Have no fear .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 7]: We are in God 's care .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 8]: May His angels watch over you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 11]: `` But you , you will not risk your life ?
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 11]: What shall we do if anything happens to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 17]: She was strung to that tense pitch when unguarded speech bubbles forth the soul 's secrets .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: All she knew was that Courtenay was looking at her as a man looks at the woman he loves .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 4]: And that sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 12]: The mere sound of her name on his lips was music .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 14]: He told her to go , yet held her hand a willing prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 21]: His words had the sound of a prayer , but it was the orison of a knight to his lady .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 25]: He bade her fear not , while he trembled a little himself , though she well knew it was not fear which shook him .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 11]: Neither of them paid heed to the presence of Suarez .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 35]: For an instant they had a glimpse of heaven , but the curiously harsh voice of the Spanish miner fell on their ears , and they came back to earth with a sudden drop .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 24]: `` The Feathered People are singing their war chant , '' he said , and his gesture seemed to ask them to listen .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 13]: They started apart , and it was not Elsie alone who blushed .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 21]: Courtenay crimsoned beneath the tan on his face , and pretended a mighty interest in the doings of the savages .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 8]: The girl recovered her self-control more rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 17]: She half whispered the meaning of the miner 's cry , whereon Courtenay tried to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 17]: `` They will be singing a dirge next , '' said he with a jaunty confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 9]: `` Now , Elsie , off with you !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 16]: Be sure I shall come and tell you when you may appear on deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 4]: She hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 8]: She recked naught of the Alaculof challenge .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 21]: Though the raucous notes of the tuneless lay could be heard plainly enough , they did not reach her ears .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 21]: When she raced down the saloon companion she found Christobal bending over the small case of instruments he always carried .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 9]: He straightened himself in his peculiarly stiff way .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 8]: `` What did the captain want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 18]: he asked , with a suspicious peevishness which , for once , detracted from his habitual courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 11]: The note of distrust jarred Elsie back into her senses .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 19]: `` He wished me to translate Señor Suarez 's explanation of another smoke signal , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 8]: `` Oh , was that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 5]: `` Practically all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 18]: `` He told you himself , I suppose , that he wished you to stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 5]: `` He did more .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 6]: He drove me away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 6]: `` Against your will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 10]: Am I not one of the ship 's company ?
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 6]: Is he not the centurion ?
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 23]: He says to this woman , Go , and she goeth , nor does she stand upon the order of her going .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 14]: Oh , please do n't look at me as if I were cracked .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: Surely one may mingle the Bible and Shakespeare in an emergency ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 16]: `` One may also tear linen sheets into strips , '' said Christobal , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 8]: Elsie 's quip had saved the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 16]: He attributed her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes to the fever of the threatened fight .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 8]: She applied herself eagerly to the task .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 21]: Already the fume and agony of vain regret were striving to conquer the ecstasy which had flooded her whole being .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 58]: She remembered that passionate longing to be clasped in Courtenay 's arms which she experienced when she saw him in the canoe , and now , after draining to the dregs the cup of bitterness she had forced on herself during these later days , here she was , ready as ever to quaff the love potion .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 3]: Poor Elsie !
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 22]: She longed for the waters of Lethe ; haply they are denied to young women with live blood in their veins .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 10]: Courtenay , meanwhile , was examining the advancing flotilla .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 34]: His brain was conning each detail of the Alaculof array , but his heart was whispering gladly : `` In another moment you would have kissed her and told her you loved her .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 11]: You know you would , so do n't deny it !
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 11]: kissed her , and held her to your breast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 42]: So Suarez spoiled a pretty bit of romance by his ruffling agitation over some bawl of savage frenzy , for Courtenay , of course , would have laughed away the girl 's protests that she was usurping another woman 's place .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 39]: It was really a pity that the man from Argentina had not found something else to occupy his mind at that precise juncture in the affairs of two young people who were obviously mated by the discriminating gods .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 64]: A good deal of suffering and heartburning would then have been avoided ; but perhaps it was just the whim of fate that the captain 's love affair should follow the irregular course mapped out for his ship , and the _ Kansas _ was not yet re-launched on the ocean high-road to London , no , not by any manner of means .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 28]: In fact , if the confident demeanor of the paddling warriors in the canoes were destined to be justified , the big steamer was in parlous state .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 13]: Her vast bulk and sheer walls of steel did not daunt them .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 25]: They came on steadily against the rapid current , and spread out into a crescent when within a few hundred yards of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 21]: Then three men , crouching in the bows of different canoes , produced rifles hitherto invisible and began to shoot .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 20]: The bullets ricochetted across the ripples , and Courtenay saw that the savages did not understand the sighting appliances .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 44]: They were aiming point-blank at the vessel , in so far as they could be said to aim at anything , and the low trajectory caused the first straight shot to rebound from the surface of the water and strike a plate amidships .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 16]: The loud clang of the metal was hailed by the Alaculofs with shouts of delight .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 15]: Probably they had no fixed idea of the distance the tiny projectiles would carry .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 12]: Joey began to bark furiously , and the Indians imitated him .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 44]: The hammer-like blow of the bullet , the defiance of the dog , and the curiously accurate yelping of the men in the canoes , mixed in wild medley with the volleyed echoes of the firing now rolled back from the opposing cliffs .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 8]: In such wise did the battle open .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 26]: Courtenay , more amused than anxious , did not silence the terrier , and Joey 's barking speedily rose to a shrill and breathless hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 16]: Some savage , more skilled than his fellows , reproduced this falsetto with marvelous exactness .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 31]: There never was a death struggle heralded by such grotesque humor ; it might have been a tragedy of marionettes , a Dutch concert on the verge of the pit .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 39]: The long-range firing was kept up for several minutes , much to Courtenay 's relief , as Suarez was certain that the Indians ' stock of cartridges did not amount to more than four hundred at the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: The canoes crept gradually nearer , and bullets began to strike the ship frequently .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 15]: One glanced off a davit and shattered a couple of windows in the chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 14]: This incident aroused even greater enthusiasm than the first blow of the attack .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 9]: There was renewed activity among the paddle wielders .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 13]: Two canoes were not fifty yards from the most southerly floating mine .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 46]: Courtenay commenced to haul in the slack of one among the half-dozen thin cords : he turned to tell Suarez to be ready for the duty which had been entrusted to him , when his glance happened to travel towards the mouth of the bay .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 15]: Then he learnt the significance of that column of smoke on the northern point .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 16]: A fleet of at least forty canoes was advancing on the ship from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 14]: Tide and paddles were swinging the small craft along at a spanking pace .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 37]: They were already much nearer the vessel than the first batch of Indians , who had very cleverly contrived to enlist the attention of the defenders while the real attack was developing without let or hindrance .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 25]: It was a smart ruse , worthy of a race of higher attainments than the tribe which is ranked lowest in the human scale .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 21]: During long days of patient watching , they had probably estimated to a nicety the number of men on board .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 63]: They reasoned that a show of force to the south would draw all eyes from the north , and the stronger squadron of canoes might be enabled to run under the bows of the ship so speedily and quietly that the occupants of the leading craft , men who could climb like monkeys , stood some chance of gaining the deck unobserved .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 18]: That this was their design was proved by the abstention of the newcomers from firing or stone-slinging .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 11]: They were gathering with the speed and silence of vultures .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 18]: Two mines protected the front of the _ Kansas _ , and several canoes had passed them .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 32]: Indeed , Courtenay soon found that some of the assailants were already screened by the ship 's bows , but the larger number were clustered thickly round Tollemache 's infernal machines .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 16]: It was well that a cool-headed sailor was called on to deal with this emergency .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 45]: The captain of the _ Kansas _ even smiled as he appreciated the full meaning of the trick which his adversaries had tried to play on him , and the man who smiles in the face of danger is one to be depended on .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 6]: The six cords were numbered .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 17]: He dropped No. 2 , which he was holding , and seized Nos. 4 and 5 .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 26]: He drew them in , hand over hand , as rapidly as possible , but careful not to sacrifice a smooth tension to undue hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 61]: In a few seconds two deafening reports split the air , the glass front of the chart-house shook , pieces of the broken panes rattled on the floor , several scraps of iron , bolts , nuts and heavy nails fell on the decks and hatches , and a tremendous hubbub of yells came from the main body of Indians .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 22]: A couple of heavily charged dynamite bombs had burst in their midst , dealing death and destruction over a wide area .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 29]: Several canoes near the floating platforms were torn asunder and sank , while men were killed or wounded out of all proportion to the number of craft disabled .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 22]: Courtenay at once picked up the governing cord of the mine which he was about to fire in the first instance .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 40]: He felt that the Alaculof flotilla would act in future on the `` once bitten twice shy '' principle where those innocent-looking little poles showed above sea level , and he must strike fierce blows while the opportunity served .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 41]: The nine canoes on the south were not clustered around the bomb in the same manner as the others , but they were near enough to sustain heavy loss , and their affrighted crews had ceased to ply their paddles .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 21]: So he fired that shell also , and had the satisfaction of seeing two more of the frail craft capsize .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 49]: He heard the crash of bullets against the ship 's sides ; a volley of stones smashed several more panes of stout glass ; many arrows were embedded in the woodwork : but he calmly pulled another cord , and blew a single loud blast on the siren .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 24]: That was the agreed signal to warn those below that they must expect to be attacked from the fore part of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 8]: His shot-gun was lying on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 32]: He took it up , and faced forward again ; several canoes were scurrying past and away from the ship as fast as the current and many arms could propel them .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 13]: He fired both barrels at those within range on the port side .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 19]: He reloaded , and the sharp snapping of revolver-shots told him that Tollemache and the Chilean were busy .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 13]: But the Indians were demoralized by the complete failure of their scheme .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 14]: They had ceased firing and stone-slinging ; they were flying for their lives .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 6]: Courtenay wheeled round on Suarez .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 8]: he cried , pointing to a speaking-trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 36]: Suarez ran out on deck , put the megaphone to his mouth , and roared after the discomfited enemy a threat of worse things in store if they dared to come near the ship again .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 55]: As he used the Alaculof language , the sounds he uttered were the most extraordinary that Courtenay had ever heard from a human throat -- a compound of hoarse , guttural vowels , and consonants ending in a series of clicks -- and the stentorian power of his lungs must have amazed the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 16]: Courtenay saw that the two fleets were combining forces about five hundred yards to westward .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 23]: They were close inshore , but none of the savages landed , nor did they head for the more remote Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 19]: As he was anxious to keep them on the run , he resolved to try the siren again .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 33]: He judged rightly , as it transpired , that they would fear the bellow of the fog-horn even more than the flying missiles which had dealt death and serious wounds so lavishly .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 22]: He knew sufficient Spanish , eked out by signs , to bid Suarez hold the siren cord taut for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 22]: While the _ Kansas _ was still trumpeting forth her loud blare of defiance , he ran down the bridge companion .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 38]: Mr. Boyle and the tiny garrison of the port promenade deck received him jubilantly ; they had escaped without a bruise , and , owing to their position , were able to witness the Indians ' retreat .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 28]: He raced across to starboard , and found that , by unfortunate mischance , a Chilean fireman in Tollemache 's detachment had been shot through the brain .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 36]: The poor fellow was prone on the deck ; it was only too evident that a doctor 's skill could avail him naught , so Tollemache had decided that he should not be taken below .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 8]: The incident marred an easily won victory .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 32]: Courtenay was assured in his own mind that none of the men had been injured , seeing that he and Suarez , who occupied the most dangerous position , were untouched .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 15]: This fatality was a mere blunder of fate , and it grieved him sorely .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 39]: Even while he bent reverently over the unlucky Chilean 's body , the deafening vibration of the fog-horn ceased , and he heard Elsie 's glad cry from the saloon : `` Oh my , here comes Joey !
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 11]: That means that Captain Courtenay has left the bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 38]: The girl 's joyous exclamation , her prelude to a paean of thanks that the dreadful necessary slaying of men had ceased , was a strange commentary on the shattered form stretched at the commander 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 31]: Among the small company on board , it had been decreed that one , at least , after surviving so many perils , should never see home and kin again .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 34]: He gave orders that the dead man should be carried to the poop to await a sailor 's burial ; then he turned , and with less sprightly step descended the main companion .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 13]: In the saloon he found Elsie and Christobal watching the stairs expectantly .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 39]: The girl had the dog in her arms , and Courtenay perceived , for the first time , that Joey 's off fore paw had been cut by the broken glass which littered the floor of the chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: `` Then the attack has really failed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 5]: was Elsie 's greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 12]: `` I saw some of the canoes turn and scurry away .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 7]: That was the first good sign .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 6]: And then Joey came . ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 6]: `` You saw them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 10]: repeated Courtenay , his bent brows emphasizing the question .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 9]: I was looking through one of the ports .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 5]: Was that wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 3]: She pointed .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 18]: `` That one , '' said she , wondering that he had never a smile for her .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 11]: `` Then you must obey orders more faithfully next time .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 17]: A man was shot dead by a stray bullet not three feet above your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 30]: She paled , and her eyes fell before his stern gaze , which did not deceive her at all , for she read the unspoken agony of his thought .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 34]: `` I am sorry , '' she murmured , `` not so much on my own account , though I shall be more careful in future , but because some one has suffered .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 4]: Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 11]: Not one of our own people , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 11]: `` A fireman ; I think his name is Gama .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 16]: You have hardly seen him , I fancy , but I regret his loss exceedingly .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 9]: It must have been the merest accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 26]: The captain of the _ Kansas _ was certainly preoccupied , or he would never have failed to inquire the extent of Joey 's injury .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 34]: Nor would either he or Elsie have forgotten that Christobal was not `` one of our own people , '' though the girl might protest hotly against any invidious twisting of the phrase .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 19]: The Spaniard missed nothing of Courtenay 's solicitude for Elsie 's well-being , nor of her shy confusion .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 28]: By operation of the occult law which governs static electricity , it was possible that the magnetism flowing between those two communicated itself to a third person .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 33]: However that might be , Christobal was under no sort of doubt that , unless another `` accident '' intervened , he had lost all chance of winning this woman 's love .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 28]: But he swallowed the bitter knowledge and said : `` If you undertake to hold the dog , Miss Maxwell , I will bind his paw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 9]: `` Oh , my ducky darling little pet !
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 12]: Did I actually forget all about his dear wounded little foot ?
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 18]: And he came hopping in so bravely , too , carrying himself with such a grand air .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: Come , then , Joey dear !
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 7]: Let us see what has happened .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 14]: Yes , this is the doctor , but he wo n't hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 26]: He is so good and kind to little dogs ; he will wrap up the bleedy part until it is quite nice and comfy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 22]: `` Your only patient , doctor , '' said the captain , cheerily , when Elsie had done fondling the dog .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 23]: `` Even crediting our poor fireman to the enemy 's score , we have had the best of the first round . ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 11]: `` Is there any likelihood of a second attack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: `` I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 15]: Indeed , I shall be very much surprised if they show up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 7]: `` Ah , that is excellent .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 16]: Our young lady here does not thrive on excitement , especially of the murderous variety .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 11]: She is on the verge of a high fever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 43]: `` Then she can calm down now ; there will be no more fighting to-day , '' said Courtenay , with a smiling glance at Elsie which told her quite plainly that Christobal did not really know what he was talking about .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 22]: Which goes to prove that even a prudent man may say mistaken things , with both his tongue and his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 18]: CHAPTER XIV THE FIRST WATCH On his way back to the deck , the captain encountered Suarez .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 41]: The man 's gestures , and the satisfaction which lit up his wrinkled face , would have told the news he wished to convey if Courtenay were not able to catch the words `` Indianos '' and `` van . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 18]: In his excitement the Spaniard pulled the Englishman towards one of the peep-holes in the canvas screen .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 12]: Sure enough , the canoes were making off towards Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 26]: In the marvelously clear light it was easy to see the threatening arms held out towards the ship by a few men who stood upright .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 8]: Even their raucous cries were yet audible .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 12]: Courtenay was glad he had not missed this demonstration of hatred .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 8]: It argued the necessity of continued watchfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 23]: The general attitude of the crew was one of real annoyance that the fight had not been carried on at close quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 59]: They had heard a good deal of noise and yelling , the starboard squad had experienced the thrill of having a man fall dead in their midst , but , with the exception of Tollemache and the Chilean marksman , the main body of the defenders took no part in the fray and saw but little of it .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 27]: And it is one of human nature 's queer proclivities that it seeks rather than shirks a combat when the loins are girt for the smiting .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 17]: Walker , though eager to return to his lathe , was no exception to the rule .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 15]: He looked a trifle discontented when the captain found him unscrewing the engine-room hatch .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 14]: `` That was a pwetty poo-aw scwap , sir , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 36]: `` I did expect to have a smack at some of those magpies , if only for the sake of washin ' the paint an ' feath-ahs off 'em with a jet of steam . ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 12]: `` They came quite near enough to be pleasant , Walker .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 40]: Their flank march was almost a surprise ; if a swarm of vicious savages had succeeded in reaching the decks -- well , we might have beaten them off , but it would have been touch and go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 7]: `` Mebbe you-aw wight , cap'n .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 19]: ` Best look at a bull ov-ah a fence , ' as they say in the Canny Toon .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 21]: Eh , but I 'll have a fine tale to tell when next I meet my butties on the Quay-side .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 18]: Did ye ev-ah see such faces as yon , all daubed wi ' black an ' white !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 11]: Talk about Chirgwin -- '' Courtenay smiled and passed on .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 20]: He was in no mood for jesting : the death of the Chilean fireman had damped his high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 12]: The _ Kansas _ bore tokens in plenty of the battle .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 45]: Many bullets and arrows had struck the ship ; the canvas was torn in several places ; a number of port lights were broken , and the open decks fore and aft , as well as the spar deck , were littered with stones .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 15]: He picked up some of these missiles , man 's earliest and latest projectile .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 42]: They were round and heavy ; a few bore the red streaks of oxidized iron ; some appeared to be veritable lumps of ore , though the action of water had made them `` smooth stones out of the brook . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 33]: He showed one to Tollemache , who seemed to possess a good deal of out-of-the-way knowledge , and the latter instantly pronounced the specimen to be almost pure copper veined with silver .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 5]: `` Queer thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 3]: he commented .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 16]: `` You find the worst rotters in any country squatted over the richest minerals . ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 15]: At the time , Courtenay gave slight heed to this bit of crude philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 43]: It was not until he called to mind the Kaffir , the Australian black , the Alaskan Indian , the primeval nomads of California , Colorado , and Northern Siberia , that he saw how extraordinarily true was his friend 's dictum .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 15]: Then he looked on the shores of Good Hope Inlet with a new interest .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 30]: Would a city ever spring up in that desolate land , a city builded of those pebbles which had clattered against the solid walls of the _ Kansas _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 4]: Who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 9]: The long romance of gold contained stranger chapters .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 30]: But the captain had more important things with which to bother his brains than the fanciful laying out of corner lots on the comparatively level bluff overlooking Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 52]: He saw to the reverent burial of poor Pietro Gama , entered full details of the fight in the ship 's log , and helped Walker to search the suspected coal for a further supply of dynamite , as the utility of the surface mines had been demonstrated beyond a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 20]: He thought it possible , given the necessary time , to rig a device which would be practically invisible .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 36]: A fresh set of dummy poles , which the Indians would probably avoid in the event of a second attack , might deflect the canoes into the area of new mines laid at sea level .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 13]: Their utmost diligence brought to light no further supply of the explosive .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 57]: Evidently , the prepared lumps of coal , each containing a stick of dynamite , which were placed among the bunker at Valparaiso , had been conveyed on board by one man , so it was more than likely there was not another ounce of the stuff on the ship except the three specimens first discovered .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 15]: These , water-soaked and useless , were locked in a drawer in the chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 47]: While scrutinizing the bunker , Courtenay found a grimy piece of paper , crushed into a ball and amalgamated with coaldust by means of the glue , or other substance , which had been used for making the bombs intended for the destruction of the furnaces .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 16]: He examined it carefully , believing it had the appearance and texture of cartridge paper .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 29]: He placed it in his pocket , and , while changing his clothes before joining the others at supper , came on it again with a certain surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 16]: He plunged it into a basin of hot water , and it yielded its secret .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 31]: It was the outer wrapper of a stick of dynamite ; it bore the circular stamp of the manufacturers , the `` Sociedad Anonyma de las Costas del Pacifico . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 8]: This , in itself , meant nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 42]: The same company probably supplied hundreds of mines with the five-pound boxes in which dynamite is packed , and , if the stamp were the only clue , none could possibly say when or where it had been issued for use .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 22]: But miners are apt to be careless ; men accustomed to dynamite will handle it with an astounding disregard for danger .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 8]: And here was a case in point .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 25]: Some Spanish overseer , evidently at a loss for a memorandum tablet , had scribbled hieroglyphics with an indelible pencil on this particular wrapper .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 40]: It was clear that the figures and abbreviated words referred to the development of a cross-heading and the position of certain lodes , but Courtenay was quick to see that the official who made those notes would recognize them .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 19]: Hence , the mine or store from which the package had been stolen or bought could be identified .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 8]: Such evidence was of high circumstantial value .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 32]: Courtenay put the wrapper in the same drawer as the cartridges , entered in the log the time and manner of its discovery , and forthwith dismissed it from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 10]: It was almost dark when he went on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 7]: The wind was keen and chilly .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 22]: It whistled through the broken windows of the wheel-house , and seemed to have in it a promise of bad weather .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 28]: But a glance aloft and at the sky beyond the southern headland -- Point _ Kansas _ , as it was called on board -- reassured him .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 7]: The far-flung arc overhead was cloudless .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 27]: The stars of the southern hemisphere , vivid and bright , though less familiar than those of the north , were reflected in the black water .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 50]: The ship was so still , the surroundings so peaceful , save for the plash of tiny waves created by the breeze , that he was almost startled when a soft voice came from the lower deck : `` Where in the world have you been , Captain Courtenay ?
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 20]: Joey is fretting for you , and I have carried him all over the ship in vain search . ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 6]: His heart jumped with gladness .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 11]: Elsie was awaiting him at the foot of the companion .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 11]: Be sure he was by her side without needless delay .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 22]: The dog wriggled in her arms , so she said : `` I do n't think he ought to run about .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 21]: His dear little paw is rather badly cut , and there may be more broken glass on the deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 15]: `` I hope not , for our Chileans ' sake , '' laughed Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 26]: `` I heard Mr. Boyle telling them to sweep it up , and they were hard at work when I went to my cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 10]: `` Oh , is that where you hid yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 8]: No wonder I could not find you .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 9]: Of course , Joey knew where you were .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 6]: How stupid of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 10]: `` Please do n't call yourself names , Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 6]: You do n't deserve them .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 15]: And , by the way , may I address you by your Christian name ?
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 6]: It slipped out to-day unawares .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 12]: Not that I feel like apologizing , because I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 14]: There are times when the heart speaks , not the guarded tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 14]: Luckily , the darkness covered the hot blush which leaped to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 17]: She gave a nervous little laugh , and strove desperately to parry this wholly unexpected assault .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 12]: `` I shall be delighted if you always call me Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 15]: It sounds friendly , and I think our circumstances warrant a true friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 3]: `` Excellent .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 11]: I suppose you know that my name is Arthur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 14]: `` Yes , but I had no notion of that sort of exchange .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 15]: You are the captain , and a very serious sort of captain at times .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 19]: I feel like a little girl when you look at me and tell me not to be naughty .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 19]: So ` Elsie ' sounds all right , but I simply dare not call you ` Arthur . '
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 12]: Just imagine what a sensation it would create in the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 7]: I should feel creepy all over .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 40]: And had n't we better be -- '' `` Elsie , '' said he , with a tender note in his voice which thrilled her like a chord of exquisite music , `` I want to tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 22]: The knowledge is forced on me that there is another man on this ship who wishes to make you his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 41]: But I , too , love you , and I see no reason why I should stand aside for any man on God 's earth until you tell me with your own lips that you prefer him to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 8]: gasped Elsie , and `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 20]: again , but not another word could she utter , she who had been so voluble a moment ago .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 12]: The bitter-sweet pain of hearing this sudden avowal was almost overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 44]: Her ideals of honor and truth were shocked ; but she was a woman as well as an idealist , and she was stirred to the depths of her soul by the knowledge that she had won the man whose love she craved .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 20]: Yet it must not be : she could never again hold her head high if she yielded to him .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 21]: She must relinquish him , drive him away from her by an assumed coldness which would wring her very heart-strings .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 21]: If he came nearer , if he took her in his arms , she would be unable to resist him .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 13]: Her impulse was to fly , to lock herself in her room .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 38]: But she could not drop the wounded dog on the deck , and Joey , satisfied by his master 's presence , snuggled up close to her breast , and made the most of his comfortable quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 20]: And now , while Courtenay stroked Joey with one hand , he placed the other on Elsie 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 12]: What a plight for a frightened maid who wished to escape !
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 21]: Of course , because she wished that some one would come to her help , the deck was practically deserted .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 35]: Certainly , Mr. Boyle did appear at the after end of the corridor ; but he seemed to remember something strong and urgent which the crew ought to hear , and he turned back .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 32]: And here was Courtenay speaking again , speaking in the slow and definite way of a man who was determined that there should be no lingering doubt as to his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 28]: `` I want you to listen to me , Elsie , '' he said , with a passionate intensity that stilled the rising storm in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 11]: `` Doctor Christobal may have pleaded his own cause already .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 13]: It is not for me to cavil at him for doing that .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 10]: But I can not lose you without a word .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 19]: Whether you marry him or me , or neither of us , I shall love you for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 7]: I want you to know that .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 8]: It is no new discovery to me .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 51]: I think my heart went out to you when I carried you in my arms through the gale , and since that hour you and I have had experiences denied to most men and women ere they reach the conclusion that they are fit mates for the voyage of life .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 7]: Do you feel that , sweetheart ?
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 13]: Have we known each other ten days , or ten years ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 9]: His face was very near to hers now .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 13]: His arm had encroached so far that it was around her neck .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 14]: It was quite dark where they stood in the shadow of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 33]: He could not see the tears in her eyes , but he heard her broken answer : `` Are you -- quite -- fair -- in using such words to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 5]: `` Fair , Elsie !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 7]: ` Fair ' to whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 11]: `` Because -- oh , how can I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 14]: Are you free to -- to speak to me in this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 18]: `` Elsie , I am pledged to no other woman , if that is what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 8]: Who has been telling you otherwise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 4]: `` No one .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 10]: Indeed , indeed , I alone am to blame .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 15]: You will be angry with me , but I could not help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 6]: She could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 15]: If she had uttered another syllable just then she would have broken down completely .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 37]: Joey did not seem to need any further fondling ; hence , having a hand at liberty , so to speak , Courtenay placed it under her chin , and lifted her unresisting lips to his .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 25]: He kissed her twice , and laughed softly , with a glad confidence that sent a wave of delight coursing through Elsie 's veins .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 30]: `` Sweetheart , '' he whispered , `` I am sure you would not have allowed me to speak so plainly if you were going to send me away .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 13]: Now , I do n't want you to bind yourself irrevocably to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 7]: That would certainly not be fair .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 29]: I do n't know why I am to be angry , or what it was you could n't help , and I do n't care a red cent .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 40]: All I want to know is this -- if the _ Kansas _ brings us both back to the outer world once more , have I as good a chance of winning your love as any other man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 7]: `` But I must tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 16]: I could not look you in the face again if you did not hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 36]: When I was left alone in your cabin , the second time , and the sea came in , a packet of letters fell out of some clothes which I picked up from the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 7]: There was one from your sister .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 33]: I hardly knew what I was doing , but I saw her name , ` Madge , ' and I read a few words on the half page above her signature . ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 23]: His left arm was now so well established that his hand touched her cheek , and he found it wet with tears .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 13]: `` What wild conceit has crept into your pretty little head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 11]: he cried in amaze , unconsciously raising his voice somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 7]: `` A letter from my sister !
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 12]: She is the most straightforward woman breathing , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 20]: Never a line has she written to me which could bear any construction such as seems to trouble you .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 24]: Why , on the contrary , Madge has often chaffed me for being so like herself in giving no thought to matrimony . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 22]: `` It is horrid of me to persist , but I owe it to you to tell you what I saw .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 29]: She alluded to your ` affianced wife , ' and said that ` under no other circumstances , ' whatever they were , would she receive her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 42]: Then Courtenay laughed again , and Elsie found it was absolutely essential , if Joey were not to be crushed , that her head should bend a little forward , with the obvious result that it rested on Courtenay 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 28]: `` I must show you the whole of that letter , '' he cried , `` and the others which are tied up in the same bundle .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 20]: You will see me blush , I admit , but it will not be from a sense of perfidy .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 41]: But there is one thing you have forgotten , Elsie -- '' and his voice dropped to a tense whisper again -- `` In telling me your secret , which is no secret , you have given me my answer .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 26]: Your heart must have crept out a little way to meet mine , dear , or my sister 's words would not have perplexed you .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 14]: So that is why you have avoided me during the past few days !
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 3]: But there !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 11]: Now , indeed , I am not acting quite fairly .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 43]: It is unfair to ask you to confess when I want you to wait until we win clear of our present difficulties before you decide whether or not you can find it to your liking to make a poor sailor-man happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 10]: Joey was a highly accommodating dog under certain conditions .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 19]: He had curled up so complacently that Elsie found she could hold him quite easily with one arm .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 19]: So the other went out in the darkness until it rested timidly on her lover 's disengaged shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 16]: `` It is easy to confess that which is already known , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 25]: `` Whether we are fated to live one day or fifty years , it will be all the same to me , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 29]: She lifted her face again to his , and would have returned the kisses he gave her were it not that they lost their one-sided character this time .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 21]: It was an odd place for love-making , this darkened nook on the deck of a disabled and beleaguered ship .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 24]: But a man and a woman reck little of time or locality when the call of love 's spring-time sounds in their ears .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 30]: That magic summons can be heard but once , and it is well with the world , for those two at least , while its ecstasy floods the soul .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 53]: There was a chance that Joey might have been partly suffocated -- though , to all appearance , he meant to die a willing martyr -- had not Suarez leaned over the upper rail , and asked , in his grating accents , if he heard the señor captain 's voice below .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 25]: Elsie , all tremulous and rosy , and profoundly thankful for the darkness , withdrew herself from Courtenay 's embrace and answered the Argentine .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 18]: `` Ah , '' said Suarez , `` I am glad you are there too , señorita .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 22]: Will you tell him that I am very hungry , and that I have not been relieved at the proper time .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 11]: I have been waiting half an hour or more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 19]: cried the captain , squeezing Elsie 's arm , `` that comes of using so many unnecessary explanations .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 20]: I ought to have adopted the recognized Jack Tar method and just grabbed you round the waist without ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 6]: I wonder where Boyle is .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 18]: He and Christobal take the first watch , and it must be two bells , or later .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 6]: I will hunt them up .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 4]: Good-by , sweetheart .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 9]: Meet you at supper in ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 86]: It was a strange and peculiar fact that Boyle had cornered Christobal in the saloon , and had insisted on telling him various remarkable anecdotes concerning the one-legged skipper of the _ Flower of the Ocean _ brig. It was still more odd that when Christobal yielded to a fit of unwonted and melancholy silence after learning from Suarez that the senor captain had been talking to the señorita for a very long time on the promenade deck , Boyle should feel inclined to sing .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 18]: The chief officer 's musical attainments were not of the highest , and his repertory was archaic .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 13]: But there must be some explanation of his unwonted and melancholy chanting .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 49]: He always spoke of Elsie with the utmost admiration , and it was no secret that he rendered Courtenay a sort of hero-worship hidden under the guise of an exaggerated belief in the good luck which followed the captain of the _ Kansas _ in all his doings .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 26]: And then , with a chilling inspiration , Christobal knew why the chief officer had caused him to miss the hour for relieving the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 15]: Boyle had seen those two together , and had planned to leave them undisturbed !
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 20]: The Spaniard was a dignified man ; he had inherited from his English mother a saving sense of humor .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 41]: It was intolerable that the pleasant relations existing between the few survivors on board the Kansas should be disturbed by reason of any failure on his part to acquiesce in Elsie 's right to bestow her affections where she listed .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 27]: He wondered if the girl had come on deck after supper ; her habit was to retire early , as she rose soon after the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 36]: He had seen her for a moment only in passing out of the saloon , and there was a suspicious brightness in her eyes for which solicitude on the dog 's behalf would hardly account .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 16]: Why not put his fortunes to the test that night and have done with it ?
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 8]: Yes , that was the right course .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 27]: He would cease this petty watchfulness , this campaign of planning and contriving lest others should monopolize more of her smiles and pleasant words than he .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 8]: A simple question would determine his fate .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 19]: Either she was heart-whole , or not ; at any rate , he would receive a straight answer .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 35]: So it was on the cards that Elsie would be the amazed recipient of two proposals in one evening , which is a better average than most women are favored with in a lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 45]: Christobal had entered the chart-house with the fixed intent of warning Boyle that he was going below for a moment to ask Miss Maxwell to come on deck , when a hurried step on the bridge companion caused the imminent words to be withheld .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 25]: It was Courtenay , who had run up from the saloon to procure those fateful letters which had so nearly parted Elsie and himself .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 10]: He had laughingly refused to tell her their history .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 9]: That would spoil their effect , he said .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 14]: She must take them to her state-room and read them at her leisure .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 31]: Then she would see their true inwardness , and his feelings would be spared , as he could not deny that the majority of them had been written by ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 10]: On his way , he looked into the wheel-house .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 8]: There was no light in the interior .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 16]: Boyle , wrapped in a heavy coat , was seated in the most sheltered corner .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 5]: `` All quiet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 9]: asked the captain , in his brisk way .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 12]: `` Nothin ' doin ' , sir , '' answered Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 10]: `` I expect you are both feeling pretty tired .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 12]: Tollemache and I propose to relieve you at six bells . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 3]: demanded Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 11]: `` It is you who have passed an exciting day .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 9]: I am ready to mount guard until dawn .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 19]: Tollemache can join me now if he likes , as Mr. Boyle ought to be in bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 12]: `` I 'm all right , '' said Boyle , gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 13]: `` I am only sitting here because my back is stiff . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 22]: Courtenay glanced at the somber shadow of Point _ Kansas _ , silhouetted against the deep blue of the seaward arc .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 11]: `` Suarez has retired to roost , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 18]: `` He seems to be quite assured that the Indians will never deliver a night attack . ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 21]: `` To-day 's hammering should teach them to leave the _ Kansas _ alone in future , '' said Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 17]: `` I hope so , but Suarez and Tollemache agree that they are most persistent wretches .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 10]: Now , Boyle , you must obey the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 19]: I am going back to the saloon to give Miss Maxwell some documents I wish her to see .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 12]: Then , Tollemache and I will relieve the pair of you .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 18]: All right , Christobal ; I promise to take my share of the blankets in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 11]: I shall be ready for a nap at four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 8]: At present I feel particularly wide-awake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 6]: He went to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 9]: They heard him unlock the door and enter .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 15]: At that instant a startling hail came from two sailors stationed on the poop .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 4]: `` Indianos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 3]: they yelled .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 23]: The three men were on the spar deck a second later , straining their eyes into the black vagueness of the water .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 4]: `` Indianos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 28]: shouted two other sailors on the forecastle , and from the spar deck it seemed to be possible to distinguish several black objects moving towards the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 14]: `` The siren , Boyle , '' cried Courtenay , striking a match .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 19]: At once the swelling note of the fog-horn smote the air and thundered away in tremendous sound waves .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 25]: Soon a hissing , fiery serpent ran up the port wall of the chart-house , and a fine star rocket soared into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 25]: It illuminated a wide area of the bay , and revealed a number of crowded canoes darting in on the ship from all sides .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 15]: Courtenay grasped the lines connected with the remaining mines and hauled for dear life .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 31]: Already the Indian rifle fire was crackling with vivid spurts of flame , and stones and arrows were beginning to patter on the deck and bang against the steel plates .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 27]: Two of the dynamite bombs exploded with the usual din , but it was impossible to ascertain their effect owing to the yelling of the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 35]: The loud summons of the siren brought all hands from below ; arms were hastily secured , the fore and aft awnings closed , and Walker made shift to hammer the engine-room door tight .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 17]: The increasing violence of the stone-slinging showed that the Alaculofs meant to press home this time .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 38]: Whatever their dread of the fiends who roam the world in the dark , they had conquered it , and this latest phase in the stormy history of the ship threatened to be its most trying one .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 26]: Courtenay , who seemed to be everywhere at once , lighted torches which were fastened to the empty davits in readiness for a night alarm .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 20]: He had used the last rocket on board , but the flares would burn for fifteen minutes at least .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 32]: By their light the defenders were able to shoot or smash the skulls of several savages who climbed up roughly contrived grapnells fashioned out of bent sticks and thongs of hide .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 17]: But there were only thirteen men to repel an attack which developed at fifty points simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 16]: Ere the torches flickered in their sockets the savages had swarmed over poop and bows .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 17]: They were tearing at the canvas shields and sweeping the hurricane deck with showers of missiles .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 7]: Tollemache was injured , and Walker .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 7]: Courtenay had his forehead cut open .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 21]: Suarez fell insensible while he was bellowing curses through the megaphone in the vain hope of frightening the determined enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 18]: Two Chileans were down , one struck with a stone and the other shot through the lungs .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 20]: So , at last , the _ Kansas _ was in the grip of a savage and implacable foe .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 23]: Courtenay , while hauling a steam hose to the weakest point , the after part of the promenade deck , met Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 13]: He clutched the Spaniard in a way there could be no mistaking .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 5]: `` Go below ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 7]: he muttered in a terrible voice .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 8]: `` I can not leave the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 4]: You must go .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 12]: And , for God 's sake , do n't tell her !
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 7]: Let her die without knowing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 21]: CHAPTER XV IN WHICH THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS When Christobal descended to the saloon he found Elsie holding the excited dog .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 18]: It was instantly perceptible that she was not aware of the grave position of affairs on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 35]: She knew , of course , that the Alaculof menace had become active again , but the first attack had been beaten off so easily that she was sure this later effort would fail .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 6]: The dog was better informed .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 13]: His alert ears told him that there were strange beings on board .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 19]: He struggled so resolutely that Elsie freed him just as the Spaniard reached the foot of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 24]: Forgetting his wounded paw , and all a-quiver with the fine courage of his race , Joey galloped up the companion and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 12]: Elsie was much distressed by her four-footed friend 's useless pugnacity .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 25]: `` I could not keep him back , '' she said , `` and I am afraid he runs some risk of being hit .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 10]: Do you think he will go to the chart-house ?
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 15]: That is so exposed -- Captain Courtenay is not there , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 14]: I left him a moment ago , close to the saloon entrance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 4]: She listened intently .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 15]: Her imagination led her astray , it was so hopelessly on the wrong tack .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 24]: `` There does not appear to be so much stone-throwing now , but I suppose I ought not to go on deck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 12]: `` It is not to be thought of , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 14]: Indeed , the captain asked me to come and bear you company . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 21]: `` Just fancy those horrid Indians venturing to approach the ship to-night after the dreadful lesson they received this afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 8]: And what will poor Señor Suarez say ?
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 15]: He was so positive that they would never come near us after dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 17]: `` I saw him , also , on the promenade deck , '' answered Christobal quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 13]: `` He had very much the semblance of a false prophet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 14]: The Spaniard meant to meet grim fate with a jest on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 13]: He had seen Suarez lying dead or insensible close to the rails .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 26]: In fact , the unlucky Argentine was only separated by the thickness of the ship 's deck from the table near which Elsie was standing .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 11]: Unless he were speedily rescued he would bleed to death .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 8]: `` Ah , I heard Joey barking .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 9]: He has gone aft , '' cried Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 7]: `` And what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 12]: she added , moving suddenly towards the center of the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 47]: She had caught the fierce hiss of steam , and she was well aware that steam would only be brought into use if the Indians were endeavoring to climb the ship 's sides : not yet had it occurred that they could possibly be on board .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 22]: `` Some of our friends the enemy have come near enough to be scalded , '' said the man , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 8]: `` That should soon drive them away .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 9]: You are not frightened , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 15]: My only regret is that I am not permitted to help in the defense .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 21]: It must be irksome for you , Dr. Christobal , to be stationed here when the ship is in danger .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 15]: I am certain you would prefer to be up there with the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 7]: `` Thank you for saying that .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 14]: I wish you were able to read all my thoughts as accurately . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 15]: His right hand went to the pocket in which he had placed the revolver .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 15]: The stock appeared to have a peculiar clamminess as his fingers closed around it .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 31]: Though he was proud of the iron nerve which had won him repute in his profession , he almost prayed now that it might not fail him at the last .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 24]: What a horror , to be compelled with his parting glance to see this bright and gracious woman crumple up on the deck !
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 18]: `` But I know you are a brave man , '' she said with a confidant smile .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 22]: `` It demanded a higher courage to pass undaunted through the ordeal of the storm than to face these ill-armed Indians .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 37]: Please do n't think I am a warlike person , but it makes my blood boil to find that there are wretches who regard our distress as their opportunity to murder us and pillage the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 7]: What have we done to them ?
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 32]: If they are poor and hungry , and they would only come to us in a peaceful way , Captain Courtenay would give them all the stores he could spare . ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 12]: Christobal heard ominous sounds from the fore part of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 16]: The revolver shooting had ceased , for the convincing reason there were no more cartridges .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 50]: Courtenay 's double barrelled gun was being fired as quickly as he could reload it , and the sharp snap of one of the rifles in the Indians ' possession was recognizable as coming from the poop , the remaining marksmen having preferred to fire wildly from their canoes .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 15]: But Christobal knew that a deadly struggle was in progress on the fore deck .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 37]: Tollemache , Frascuelo , and three Chileans were engaged in a hand-to-hand fight with nearly a score of savages ; the doctor could distinguish the cries of the combatants , the irregular stamping of boot-shod feet .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 65]: He wondered why the girl , with her acute senses , did not grasp the significance of the yells and trampling on the deck , until it occurred to him , with a quick pang , that she was listening for one voice alone ; owing to her ignorance of the desperate nature of the conflict raging overhead she had ears for nothing further .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 8]: He placed a hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 7]: She turned and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 12]: There was a gravity in his eyes , which startled her .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 20]: `` Elsie , '' he said , `` you believe in the efficacy of prayer , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 9]: Well , then , pray now a little .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 24]: I shall be glad to think , when this time of danger has passed , that we owed something to your invocation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 28]: It was in his mind that he must shoot her within a few seconds , and the immeasurable agony of the thought reflected itself in his face .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 21]: He had no notion that she would give his words a more direct significance than he intended them to bear .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 42]: But a strange , hoarse yell of triumph , the war-cry of an Alaculof leader who had hauled himself to the bridge and found it undefended , warned her in the same moment that all was not well with the defense .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 7]: She sprang towards the saloon stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 7]: `` Do you hear that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 7]: she cried in a ringing voice .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 7]: `` There are Indians on board .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 15]: We must not stay here when our friends are fighting for their lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 17]: Christobal knew that this active girl would readily outstrip him in a race to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 56]: She was already several feet distant , but he must detain her , no matter what the cost ; if she fell into the clutches of the ghouls then over-running the _ Kansas _ , she might not be killed , but only wounded , and her sufferings would be inconceivable ere the end came .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 12]: `` You are wrong , '' he shouted with convincing vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 20]: `` But , if you wish to see for yourself , at least allow me to go first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 9]: While he was speaking , he ran forward .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 13]: She thought he meant what he said , and waited for him .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 12]: Then he caught her right arm firmly in his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 14]: `` Let us wait here a moment or two , '' he breathed .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 10]: `` No , no ; I am going now .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 7]: You shall not hold me back .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 5]: You do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 13]: The man I love is up there , perhaps surrounded by savages .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 8]: Let me go , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 11]: If he is dying I shall die by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 4]: Let me go !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 8]: Would you have me strike you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 18]: She turned on him like an angry goddess , and strove to wrest herself from his grip .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 25]: At that instant Tollemache and Frascuelo , the only survivors of the deadly struggle forward , were driven back by a rush of Indians .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 11]: They caught sight of others leaping down the bridge companion .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 8]: `` To the saloon , Courtenay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 19]: roared Tollemache , clearing a path for himself with an iron bar which he swung in both hands .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 11]: Followed by Frascuelo , he jumped inside the saloon gangway .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 12]: Four savages followed , two entering through the doorway behind him .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 35]: One raised a hatchet-like implement , and would have brained the Englishman had not Christobal whipped out his revolver and shot him through the body , releasing the girl 's wrist in his flurry .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 15]: The Indian pitched headlong down the stairs , falling limply at Elsie 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 13]: She stooped over the terrifying figure and seized the man 's weapon .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 8]: Her eyes shone with a strange light .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 6]: She felt her arms tingle .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 17]: A wonderful power seemed to flow through her body , like a gush of strong wine .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 25]: She was assured that she , unaided , could beat down all the puny , despicable creatures who barred the path to her lover .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 33]: She vaulted over the writhing form of the Alaculof , and made to climb the stairs , but Christobal , admirably cool , fired again and brought another Indian to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 29]: The second Indian 's fall caused Frascuelo to trip ; and the Chilean , locked rib to rib with a somewhat sturdy opponent , rolled into the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 17]: Elsie drew back just in time , or the two men would have knocked her down .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 37]: Even as they were turning over on the steep steps she saw Frascuelo 's knife seek that favorite junction of neck and collar-bone which Christobal had said was so well understood by those of his ilk .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 17]: At the foot of the stairs the Indian lay still , and Frascuelo tried to rise .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 5]: She helped him gladly .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 10]: The awfulness of this killing no longer appalled her .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 14]: Each dead or disabled Indian was one less obstacle between her and Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 11]: A third time the revolver barked , but Christobal missed .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 24]: It did not matter greatly , as Tollemache had shortened his bar , using it twice as a miner delves at a rock .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 25]: But the doctor did not forget that he had only three cartridges left , two of which were bespoke long before the fight began .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 10]: At last , then , the way was clear .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 13]: Elsie would have mounted the stairs but an appealing hand detained her .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 8]: `` I can not walk , señorita .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 6]: My leg has given way .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 8]: And we can do no good there .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 6]: They are all down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 11]: A death chill gripped her heart at Frascuelo 's words .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 5]: `` All down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 5]: she repeated , white-lipped .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 11]: `` I think so , '' said he , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 13]: The man was dazed by the ordeal through which he had passed .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 35]: As if to answer and refute him , Joey 's hysterical yelp sounded from a point close at hand , and they distinctly heard Courtenay 's loud command : `` This way , Boyle !
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 6]: Rally to the bridge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 6]: `` You are mistaken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 12]: shrieked Elsie , wrenching herself free from the Chilean 's grasp .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 9]: Nothing short of violence would stop her now .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 17]: Tollemache darted out into the darkness , and she mounted the steps two at a time .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 6]: Christobal panted by her side .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 29]: He was determined not to be parted from her : if necessary , he would drag her away from any doubtful encounter on the battle-field of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 12]: But his blood was aflame now with the lust of combat .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 13]: He wished to die fighting rather than by a suicide 's bullet .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 25]: They were not yet clear of the doorway when an extraordinary burst of cheering and shouts in English and Spanish assailed their wondering ears .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 18]: The sounds seemed to come from the sea , from some point very near to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 31]: A loud hubbub arose among the Indians ; Courtenay , clubbing his gun , rushed past , with the dog at his heels , and ran up the bridge companion .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 27]: They could follow his progress as he raced towards the port side , and they heard his amazed cry : `` What boats are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 18]: `` Your own , captain , '' came the answering yell , plainly audible above the din .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 26]: `` That is Mr. Gray , '' screamed Elsie , and she , too , ran towards the bridge , with the doctor close behind .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 62]: `` Sink every canoe you can get alongside of , and knock those fellows on the head who are swimming , '' roared Courtenay , who was so carried away by the fierceness of the fight from which he had just emerged that he would have given the same directions to the archangel Michael had that warrior-spirit come to his aid .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 21]: He seemed to have eyes in the back of his head , he turned so suddenly when Elsie neared him .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 10]: `` Ah , thank God you are safe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 11]: he said , drawing her to him for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 8]: `` Stand there , dear heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 19]: He placed her in the forward angle of the bridge rail , and leaned out over the side .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 25]: She understood that she must not speak to him then , but a great joy overwhelmed her , and her eyes melted into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 49]: Christobal , who had missed no word of Elsie 's frenzied protest in the saloon , nor failed to note the manner of Courtenay 's greeting , seemed to take the collapse of his own aspirations with the unmoved stoicism he had displayed in the face of danger .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 27]: `` The ship 's boats -- '' he began , but the captain raised his gun and fired twice aft along the side of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 37]: Cries of pain and a good deal of splashing in the sea proved that he had expedited the departure of several Indians who were perched on the rails beyond the reach of Walker 's steam jet .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 28]: `` The ship 's boats , '' went on Christobal calmly , `` have turned up in some mysterious manner , just in the nick of time .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 14]: A few minutes more , and they would have been too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 8]: `` But where have they come from ?
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 10]: Where can they have been all these days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 28]: whispered Elsie , whose eyes were so dimmed that she perforce abandoned the effort to make out what was going on in the sea near the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 9]: `` My brain reels under the wildest guesses .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 14]: At present we are chiefly concerned in the fact that they are here .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 17]: Yet people say that the age of miracles has passed : obviously a foolish remark . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 34]: Those who have been plucked from the precipice by a sleeve , as it were , are seldom able to concentrate their attention on the one thought which should apparently swamp all others .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 36]: They either yield to the strain , and lapse into unconsciousness , or their minds become the arena of minor emotions , wherein trivialities play battledore and shuttlecock with the tremendous issues of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 56]: When a more extended knowledge of all that had happened , joined to a nicer adjustment of the time-factor in events , enabled Elsie to realise the extraordinary deliverance from death which she had been vouchsafed that night , she began to appreciate the service which Christobal rendered her in discussing matters with such nonchalance .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 25]: Barely a minute had elapsed since they were in the throes of a struggle which promised to be the last act of a tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 32]: The ship was then over-run by a horde of howling savages , maddened by the desperate resistance offered by the defenders , and ruthless as wolves in their lust for destruction .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 33]: Now , the _ Kansas _ was clear of every bedaubed Alaculof , save the many who cumbered the decks , either dead or so seriously wounded that they could not move .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 27]: These men were so near akin to animals , that this condition implied ultimate collapse save in a few instances of fractured skulls and broken limbs .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 25]: From the final stage of a hopeless butchery the survivors of the ship 's company were suddenly transferred to a position of reasonable security .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 29]: It was not that the arrival of the ship 's boats meant such an accession of fighting strength that the Alaculofs could not have made sure of victory .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 8]: Gray and his companions were badly armed .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 17]: The Indians remaining in the canoes could have pelted them to shreds in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 20]: Even those on the ship had the power to resist any attempt by the newcomers to gain the decks .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 44]: But the superstitious savages had already screwed themselves up to an act of unusual daring in delivering a night attack , and the appearance of boats filled with men of whose fighting qualities they had already such a lively experience quite demoralized them .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 8]: They fled without attempting a counter assault .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 21]: Just as negroes conjure up white demons , so did these nude Alaculofs regard with awe men who wore clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 42]: They were ready to kill and eat the strange beings of another race who , few in numbers and ill armed , wandered into their rock-pent fastness , but it was quite a different thing to face them in equal combat .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 9]: At last the sounds of conflict died away .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 16]: The black waters closed over the dead ; the last swimmer vanished into the silence .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 48]: The spasmodic barking of the dog , the groaning of men lying on the decks and the shouts exchanged between Courtenay and Gray for the guidance of the boats , were the only remaining symbols of the fiercest crisis which had yet befallen the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 44]: Elsie , wandering through a trance-like maze of vivid impressions , awoke with a start to the fact that Courtenay was giving directions for the lowering of the ship 's gangway , meanwhile receiving information as to the identity of the boats beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: `` Mr. Malcolm is in charge of the jolly-boat , '' Gray was saying .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 12]: `` Miss Baring and Mr. and Mrs. Somerville are with him .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 7]: Miss Baring 's maid is dead .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 10]: Señor Jerrera is in my boat , Number 2 .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 22]: We have been on White Horse Island all this time , but we have seen nothing of the other life-boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 17]: That meant that two boats out of those which quitted the ship had arrived thus opportunely .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 21]: Señor Jerrera was the Spanish mining engineer who had been hustled into one of the craft manned by the mutineers .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 15]: And Isobel was actually sitting down there in the darkness a few feet away .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 6]: How wonderful it all was !
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 11]: Elsie thought her heart would never cease its labored throbbing .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 9]: Even yet her breath came in little gasps .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 29]: How could the captain and Gray talk so coolly , as if some of the passengers and crew were returning on board the ship after an evening ashore ?
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 31]: It was the bedizened savages who now assumed reality : the simple orders which dealt with the clearing of the falls and the lowering of a ladder became wildly fantastic .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 22]: And Christobal was saying : `` Well , Miss Maxwell , you and I can look forward to a busy night .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 20]: The ship is littered with wounded men , and our newly arrived friends must be worn with fatigue . ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 18]: His smooth , even sentences helped to dispel the stupor of amazement which had made her dumb .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 41]: And the first reasoned thought which came to her was that the Spanish doctor had treated her with the kindness of an indulgent parent , for Elsie was far too unselfish not to be alive to the unselfishness of others .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 10]: `` How good you have been to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 7]: `` I can never repay you .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 14]: I remember now that I said dreadful things to you in the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 29]: But you did not know what it meant to me when I realized that Captain Courtenay might be falling even then beneath the blows of those merciless savages .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 24]: I have not had a chance to tell you that he has asked me to be his wife , and I have consented .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 9]: I love him more than all the world .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 29]: And you , Dr. Christobal , you who knew my father and mother , who have grown-up daughters of your own , you will wish me happiness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 18]: It was not easy to bear when it came , although he had guessed the truth already .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 30]: But he choked back the wrath and despair which surged up in him , and said with his stately courtesy : `` I do wish you well , Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 17]: No man can hope more earnestly than I that you have made the better choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 32]: Then he turned , with a certain abruptness which reminded her of the change in his manner she had noticed once or twice during recent days , and quitted the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 15]: She sighed , and was sorry for him , knowing that he loved her .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 44]: Courtenay , who had been far too busy to pay heed to anything beyond the brief fight between the boats and the canoes , perceived now that the gangway was in position ; lights were shining on both the upper and lower platforms .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 12]: He stretched out his hand , and drew Elsie to him .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 8]: `` Are you alone , sweetheart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 13]: `` Kiss me , then , and go to meet your friends .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 10]: They will be aboard in less than a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 15]: Oh , Elsie , I thought I had seen the last of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 9]: `` Was it so bad as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 30]: she murmured , a great content soothing her heart and brain at her lover 's admission that he was thinking of her during the worst agony of the fray .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 7]: He gave her a reassuring hug .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 14]: `` You will never know how bad it was , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 9]: `` I can not understand how we escaped .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 27]: One moment it all looks like blind chance ; the next I feel like going on my knees in thankfulness for the direct intervention of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 11]: Those brutes ought to have mastered us a dozen times .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 35]: I almost lost faith when I heard Tollemache shout that the saloon was in danger , but I could not leave the after deck , where four of us were keeping fifty in check .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 12]: The least sign of yielding would have caused an overwhelming rush .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 9]: Well , all 's well that ends well .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 19]: And not a sailor living can squeeze his best girl and do his work at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 19]: Off with you , or I shall never bring you on a voyage in my ship again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 18]: With her soul singing a canticle of joy she passed from the bridge to the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 10]: Mr. Boyle was waiting there , holding a lantern .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 4]: `` Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 29]: he growled , when he saw her , `` p ` raps you 'll believe what I tell you before your hair turns gray , if not sooner .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 2]: Luck !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 11]: Did any man ever have such luck as the skipper ?
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 21]: Why , if he fell off Mong Blong he 'd find a circus net rigged up to catch him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 25]: `` I agree with you so fully , Mr. Boyle , '' she whispered , `` that I am going to marry him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 10]: `` I guessed as much , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 19]: `` At any rate I fancied it would n't be for want of axing on his part . ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 20]: He whirled off into a tempest of wrath because a sailor beneath had failed to keep a guide-rope taut .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 27]: The occupants of the boats might have saved his life , but he would let them know that he was still chief officer for all that .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 18]: At last he stooped and gave his hand to some one who emerged from the darkness beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 15]: `` Glad to see you again , Miss Baring , '' he said gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 7]: `` And you , Mrs. Somerville .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 10]: And you , sir , '' to the missionary .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 20]: `` We thought you 'd gone under , an ' good folks are scarce enough as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 32]: It was a wan and broken-spirited Isobel whom Elsie led to her cabin , but notwithstanding her wretched state , her eyes quickly took in the orderly condition of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 28]: `` I left my clothes strewed all over the floor , '' she said , with a nervousness which Elsie attributed to the hardships she had undergone .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 11]: `` Why did you trouble to pack them away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 38]: Then Elsie told her of her hunt for the poudrière , and was so obviously unconcerned about any incident other than the adventures they had both experienced since they parted , that Isobel questioned her no further .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 10]: A bath and a change of clothing worked marvels .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 32]: Though thin and weak for want of proper food , neither Isobel nor Mrs. Somerville had suffered in health from the exposure and short fare involved by life on the island .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 24]: It was broad daylight ere they could be persuaded to retire to rest , there was so much to tell and to hear .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 14]: Meanwhile , the meeting between Tollemache and Gray was full of racial subtleties .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 22]: Tollemache , stepping forward to grasp Gray 's hand , felt it was incumbent on him to utter the first word .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 13]: `` Had a pretty rotten time of it , I expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 3]: `` Poisonous .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 4]: And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 5]: `` Oh , fair .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 9]: Beastly close squeak when you turned up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 35]: Gray became more explicit when Courtenay met him in the chart-room , where the table had to be cleared of debris before some glasses and a couple of bottles of champagne could be staged .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 33]: `` When those blackguards cast off from the ship , '' he said , `` we scudded away in a sort of ocean mill-race which threatened to upset us at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 41]: In fact , we gave up hope for a time , but , as the boat kept afloat , Mr. Malcolm and I managed to stir up the Chileans , and we got them to steady her with the oars .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 19]: Some time before daybreak we ran into smooth water , and made out land on the port bow .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 19]: In a few minutes we were ashore on a pebbly beach , in a place alive with seals .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 52]: When the sun rose we found we were on a barren island , and , what was more , that one of the ship 's life-boats had been upset on a reef which we just missed , and had lost all her stores , though the men had scrambled into safety .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 25]: With the aid of our boat , and helped by fine weather , we raised the life-boat , and recovered some of her fittings .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 17]: The water-casks and tins of food were hauled up by a chap who could dive well .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 42]: We have been on that lump of rock until today , when I finally persuaded the others that unless we made for the land which we could see in the dim distance the weather would break and our food give out .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 29]: The trouble with the Chileans was that they were afraid of the natives hereabouts , and preferred to wait on the off chance of a ship showing up .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 38]: At last they saw that Malcolm and I were right , but we missed the full run of the tide , and were some miles from the mainland , or whatever it is , when night fell .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 39]: We pushed along cautiously , found the entrance to the cove we had made out before the light failed , and were about to lay to until dawn , when we saw a rocket and heard the fog-horn .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 8]: That woke us up , you bet .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 36]: The Chileans pulled like mad , but when we came near enough to discover that the ship was being attacked by Indians , I had a fearful job to get my heroes to butt in .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 7]: That fellow Gomez is a brick .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 14]: He orated like a politician , and finally they got a move on .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 20]: From what I have seen since I came aboard , I guess you were hustling about that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' said Courtenay , filling a glass with wine as he heard Boyle 's step without .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 11]: He handed the glass to the chief when he entered .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 5]: `` How many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 3]: `` Huh !
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 13]: We 've slung fifty-three Indians an ' six of the crew overboard .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 17]: There 's fourteen wounded natives an ' five of our men in the doctor 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 19]: Two Alaculofs died of funk when they set eyes on the nigger who turned up in the life-boat .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 12]: They thought -- well , here 's chin chin to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 5]: I 'm thirsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 17]: CHAPTER XVI CHRISTOBAL 'S TEMPTATION `` By the way , what of Monsieur de Poincilit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 3]: said Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 21]: `` I saw him come aboard with Malcolm , but he dived into the saloon , and has not reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 5]: Is he ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 17]: Gray 's mouth set like a steel trap ; his eyes had a glint in them .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 18]: He seemed to be unwilling to speak ; when words came , they were cold and measured .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 14]: `` I have n't any use for that fellow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 17]: `` I suppose the unpleasant story must be told sooner or later , so here goes .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 37]: In the first place , Poincilit forgot that I understood Spanish , and I heard him yelping to the Chileans in the jolly-boat that if we took any more people on board we should be swamped .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 25]: It was he who put the notion in their heads to cast off while you were lowering Miss Baring 's maid into my arms .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 27]: I tried to forget that , as he was blue-white with fear , and some fellows are not responsible for their actions when their liver melts .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 11]: But I can never forget his action on the island .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 25]: Yesterday morning I was just in time to stop him and four others from sneaking off in the life-boat with all our provisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 6]: Courtenay 's face hardened too .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 27]: `` Necessity may have no laws , '' said he ; `` but I fancy I should have found a code to meet his case . ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 27]: `` I have organized a Vigilance Committee in my time , and its articles kind of fitted in , '' was the American 's quiet reply .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 31]: `` That is why I have a few recent knife-cuts distributed about my skin ; I began to shoot and we were two short on the muster roll next day .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 10]: De Poincilit ran , and fell on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 17]: So did a skunk of an Italian , and I did not want to waste cartridges .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 12]: They were tied back to back until we sailed to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 6]: `` And the fifth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 8]: `` The fifth was a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 4]: `` Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 13]: Boyle reached out for a bottle of wine and refilled his glass .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 8]: For a little while there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 11]: Then Courtenay muttered : `` Poor devil of a Count !
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 13]: ` She gave me of the tree and I did eat . '
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 7]: Did he blame the woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 5]: `` Well , yes .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 11]: But it was a mean business , any how . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 11]: `` Better sponge it off the slate , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 5]: `` I agree heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 10]: Drink up , Boyle , and pass the buck .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 9]: I have a five years ' thirst . ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 10]: They talked until day-break ; then Courtenay turned in .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 10]: He did not appear on deck again until noon .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 34]: By that time the _ Kansas _ had lost all marks of the fight excepting the smashed windows , and a sailor who understood the glazier 's art was replacing the broken glass .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 22]: Making the round of the ship , the captain found Elsie sitting with Isobel and Mrs. Somerville on the promenade deck .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 29]: She was binding Joey 's foot , and he knew then why the dog had scampered off on three legs as soon as the cabin door was opened .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 14]: The girl colored very prettily the moment she set eyes on her lover .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 9]: Memories of the previous night became exceedingly vivid .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 8]: She was adorably shy , Courtenay thought .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 21]: As he approached , he debated the manner of his greeting ; being a sailor , he did not hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 19]: Lifting his cap with a smile and a general `` Good morning , '' he bent over Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 18]: `` Well , '' he said , `` surely you owe me at least one kiss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 11]: If her cheeks were red before they became scarlet now .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 34]: But his kindling glance had warned her that he would adopt no pretence , so she lifted her face to his , though she did not dare to look at her amazed companions .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 6]: Courtenay explained matters quite coolly .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 30]: `` If Elsie has not told you already , it is my privilege to announce that she and I have signed articles , '' he said with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 18]: `` That is , we intend to get married as soon as the ship reaches England . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 17]: `` Indeed , I congratulate you both most heartily , '' said the missionary 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 17]: `` Events have marched , then , while we were stranded on that wretched island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 3]: tittered Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 6]: Her voice was rather shrill .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 13]: She , too , was excited , not quite mistress of herself .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 61]: She did not know how far Gray 's statements might have prejudiced her with the captain ; she had already sent de Poincilit a note urging him to deny absolutely all knowledge of the plot to steal the boat , and attribute the American 's summary action to his mistaken rendering of the Spanish patois used by the Chilean sailors .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' laughed Courtenay , ready to put her at ease .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 15]: `` One crowds the events of a month into a day under some conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 39]: Last night , for instance , I had five minutes ' amusement with a steampipe and a double-barrelled gun which will serve all my requirements in the way of physical exercise for a long time to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 15]: `` You feel sure that we shall see no more of the Indians ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 5]: asked Isobel , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 24]: One never can tell , but if they have the grit to attack us again I shall regard them as first-class fighters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 28]: `` Dr. Christobal says they have an astonishing power of bearing pain without flinching , '' said Elsie , plunging into the talk with a hot eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 57]: `` The Alaculofs in the fore cabin were afraid of him , thinking he meant to kill them , but , when they found that he wished only to dress their wounds , they followed his actions with a curious interest , as though he were tending some other person 's hurts and not their own .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 5]: And that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 14]: He told me you ought to have that cut on your forehead washed .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 7]: Let me look at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 12]: She stood up , and placed the dog on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 30]: Lifting Courtenay 's cap she brushed back his hair with her fingers , and found that he had covered an ugly scar with a long strip of skin plaster .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 13]: The tense anxiety in Isobel 's face forthwith yielded to sheer bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 22]: These two were behaving with the self-possession of young people who regard the `` engagement '' stage as a venerable institution .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 11]: Of course Courtenay liked to be fondled in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 10]: Elsie was at her best as a ministering angel .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 12]: But he protested against the need of the doctor 's precaution .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 19]: `` No , no , '' he cried , `` you already have one faithful patient in Joey .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 17]: I wonder he did not wake me earlier so that he might rush off to you .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 11]: I never have known him play the old soldier before .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 28]: To see him curled up there , gazing at you with those pathetic eyes , who would think that his teeth met in Alaculof sinews last night ?
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 11]: Twice , to my knowledge , he saved my life .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 13]: And the way he dodged blows aimed at him was something marvelous .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 12]: He used all four paws then , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 20]: `` Ah , yes , '' agreed Elsie , blushing again as she recalled the scene in the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 17]: `` He could have told me the Indians were aboard long before I knew it myself .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 19]: Dr. Christobal deceived me so admirably that I am not sure yet if I have forgiven him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 27]: `` He is a first-rate chap in an emergency , '' said Courtenay , `` though I have a bone to pick with him , too .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 26]: He promised to call me at eight o'clock , but I expect he and Boyle , or Tollemache , conspired to let me sleep on .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 9]: I was astounded when I saw the time .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 18]: What do you think of a skipper who lies abed all the morning , Miss Baring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 13]: `` Gray has told him nothing , '' she decided at once .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 8]: `` That is very nice of Gray .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 6]: I must thank him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 38]: But she replied instantly , in her piquant way : `` Elsie certainly kept us in the dark about her _ fiançailles _ , Captain Courtenay ; but has not been silent as to your other achievements .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 31]: If you were not telling us that you have actually slept , I should have cherished the belief that you had not closed an eyelid since the ship struck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 9]: Isobel meant to be on her best behavior .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 22]: Her pact with the Frenchman was discreditable but smooth words might restrain tongues from wagging until she could leave the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 16]: Moreover , the vicissitudes of life in these later days were not without their effect .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 9]: She had known what it was to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 11]: She had seen men dying like cattle in the shambles .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 28]: The shadow of eternity had fallen so closely that twice during the preceding night she was rudely awaked by the shrieking fear of a too vivid dream .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 11]: These things were not the butterfly flutterings of sunlit Valparaiso .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 19]: They were of a more ardent order , and her wings had not yet recovered from the singeing .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 58]: Courtenay , willing to maintain a fiction which evidently gave her relief , answered lightly that he yet had to earn these compliments , but he hoped to be able soon to fix a date when everybody might bombard him with the nicest phrases they could think of , and end the embarrassing ordeal once for all .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 21]: `` I went through something of the sort last year on board the _ Florida _ , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 20]: `` People insist on regarding it as marvelous that a man should strive to do his simple duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 20]: Suddenly it occurred to him that the topic was unpleasantly analogous to the little French count 's cowardly escapades .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 42]: If one talks of duty , and recognizes its prior claim , what of the man who , in his selfish frenzy , is prepared to leave others to their fate , whether on a wrecked ship or a barren island ?
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 7]: So he turned to Elsie again .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 16]: `` By the way , you have never seen those letters , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 14]: `` I was hunting for them when the alarm was raised last night .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 7]: Shall I bring them now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: Elsie gave him a glance of subtle meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 18]: Her eyes telegraphed `` What matters it whether I see them to-day or in half a century ?
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 7]: Do I not trust you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 21]: But she only murmured : `` Not now , I am telling Mrs. Somerville and Isobel all the news . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 5]: He squeezed her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 18]: Any excuse would serve for those slight pettings which mean so much during early days in wonderland .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 8]: `` Then I shall resume my rounds .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 9]: I expect to be received reproachfully by Walker .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 6]: He made great progress yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 6]: Let me whisper a secret .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 12]: Then you may pass it on , in strictest confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 9]: He placed his lips close to her ear .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 15]: `` I am dreadfully in love with you this morning , '' he breathed .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 10]: `` That is no secret , '' she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 4]: `` It is .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 12]: You and I together must daily find new paths in Eden .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 11]: But my less poetic tidings should be welcome , also .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 11]: Walker says he hopes to get steam up to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 23]: `` Well , tell us quickly , '' cried Isobel , with a show of intense interest , when Courtenay had gone .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 16]: She had decided on a line of conduct , and meant to follow it carefully .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 24]: The more sympathy she extended towards her friend 's love idyll , the less likelihood was there of disagreeable developments in other respects .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 11]: That trick of calculating gush was Isobel 's chief failing .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 15]: She was so wrapped up in self that her own interests governed every thought .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 15]: Courtenay 's reference to letters sent a wave of alarm pulsing through each nerve .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 35]: Though his manner betokened that the affair was something which concerned Elsie alone , she was on fire until she learnt that his `` secret '' alluded to the restored vitality of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 10]: For once , her expressions of gratitude were heartfelt .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 7]: Mrs. Somerville even wept for joy .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 26]: This poor woman after living twenty-five years in the oasis of a mission-house , was a strange subject for storm-tossed wandering and fights with cannibals .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 38]: Seldom has fate conspired with the fickle sea to sport with such helpless human flotsam , save , perhaps , in that crowning caprice of the waves which once cast ashore a live baby in a cradle .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 45]: But the baby 's emotions were crude , and probably in no wise connected with the tremors of ship-wreck , whereas Mrs. Somerville , during these full days , was constantly asking herself how it could be possible that she was living at all .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 27]: `` It will be a real manifestation of Providence if we ever reach England again , '' she cried , dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 18]: `` I 'm sure John and I have said so many a time during the past week .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 26]: To think of the ship 's blowing up in the way she did , it makes me all of a tremble , it does . ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 43]: `` Oh , '' broke in Elsie , thinking that the information she possessed would help to calm the older woman , `` we have made a good many discoveries since -- since the boat went away without me , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 31]: But do tell me , how did those horrid Chileans manage to cast off the tackle before Mr. Gray or some of the other men were able to stop them ?
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 29]: Of course , it is matterless now , in a sense , but at that moment it looked like leaving those on the ship to certain death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 6]: Mrs. Somerville was stricken dumb .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 34]: The American 's shooting of two men on White Horse Island had naturally called for a complete explanation on his part , and she did not know how to answer Elsie 's question .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 10]: Before she could gather her wits , Isobel intervened .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 27]: `` If you had been in that boat , dear , '' she said sweetly , `` you would realize the topsy-turvy condition of our brains .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 18]: Even Mr. Gray himself , the coolest man on board , imagined we might sink any moment .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 10]: So what can you expect of those excitable Chileans ?
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 25]: Besides , the thing was done so quickly that we were swept away by the tide before any one fully understood what was happening .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 13]: Anyhow , you had the best of it , as events transpired .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 9]: What are the discoveries you spoke of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 12]: `` Well , some one placed dynamite among the coal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 10]: `` But who would do such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 7]: `` That is hard to say .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 15]: The captain believes that the culprit will be found out through the insurance policies .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 44]: He and the others were discussing the affair one day in the chart-house -- soon after the dynamite cartridges were discovered -- and you can not tell how surprised I was to hear him mention Ventana 's name in connection with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 6]: `` Ventana 's name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 16]: The blood ebbed away from Isobel 's cheeks , leaving her pallid as a statue .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 13]: There was a gasp in her voice which startled her own ears .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 35]: Lest her agitation should be noted too keenly , she bent forward and propped her face on her clenched hands , staring fixedly at the distant cliffs in a supreme effort to appear apathetic .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 15]: Elsie heard that dry sob , but her friend 's seeming indifference misled her .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 40]: `` Yes , '' she said , wondering a little whether or not Christobal 's veiled hint regarding a by-gone tenderness between the two might account for Isobel 's hysterical outburst on the night of the ship 's break-down .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 45]: Indeed , so warm-hearted was she that she hesitated a moment before continuing ; but she felt that it would be altogether better for Isobel to be prepared for the revelations which the successful end of the ship 's voyage would assuredly bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 36]: So , pondering unspoken thoughts the while , she told the others exactly what Tollemache , Christobal and Courtenay had said , and even revealed to them that which Courtenay himself did not yet know .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 18]: `` You remember the poor fellow who got into trouble soon after we sailed from Valparaiso ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 6]: `` His name is Frascuelo .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 22]: He was wounded again in last night 's fight , but not seriously , and he and I are quite chums .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 33]: He assures me that he was drugged by a man named José Anacleto , who took his place among the coal-trimmers -- '' `` Oh , Miss Maxwell , come quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 37]: screamed Mrs. Somerville , for Isobel had lurched sideways out of her chair in a fainting fit , and the missionary 's wife was barely able to save her head from striking the ship 's rails .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 22]: Joey was shot out of Elsie 's lap with such surprising speed that he trotted away without any exhibition of lameness .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 53]: He was quite disgusted , for at least five minutes , but it is reasonable to suppose that a dog of his intelligence would brighten up when he heard the wholly unlooked-for story which Christobal was translating to Courtenay , word for word , as it was dragged hesitatingly out of Suarez .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 17]: The Argentine miner had been badly injured during the struggle for possession of the promenade deck .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 28]: Owing to loss of consciousness , supplemented by an awkward fall , he might have choked to death had he not been rescued within a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 28]: He was very ill all night , and it was not until midday that he recovered sufficient strength to enable him to question the Indians on board .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 21]: Courtenay wished specially to find out what chance , if any , there was of the Alaculof attack being renewed .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 35]: When Christobal assured him that Suarez might safely leave his bunk , he asked the doctor to bring the Spaniard to the fore-cabin , in which the wounded savages lay under an armed guard .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 24]: It was obvious that some of the maimed wretches recognized Suarez , notwithstanding his changed appearance , the instant he spoke to them .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 37]: At once they broke out into an excited chattering , and Suarez was so disconcerted by the tidings they conveyed that he stammered a good deal , and seemed to flounder in giving the Spanish rendering .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 34]: `` This fellow is telling us just as much as he thinks it is good for us to know , '' said Courtenay , sternly , when the interpreter avoided his accusing gaze .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 30]: `` Bid him out with the whole truth , Christobal , or it shall be his pleasing task to escort his dear friends back to their family circles . ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 8]: Being detected , Suarez faltered no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 13]: A ship 's life-boat had been driven ashore lower down the coast .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 23]: Fourteen men had landed ; they were captured by the Indians , after a useless resistance , in which three were killed .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 46]: The dead men supplied a ghoulish feast next day , and the others were bound securely , and placed in a cave , in order to be killed at intervals , an exact parallel to the fate of Suarez 's own companions five years earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 10]: But , on this occasion , a woman intervened .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 26]: Suarez confessed , very reluctantly , that there was a girl in the tribe to whom he had taught some words of his own language .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 25]: He said that she cooked for him , and caught fish or gathered shell-fish for their joint needs when the larder was otherwise empty .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 36]: He declared that the relations between them were those of master and servant , but the poor creature had fallen in love with him , and had become nearly frantic with grief when he disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 34]: It was difficult to analyze her motives , but she had undoubtedly freed the eleven sailors , and led them over the rocks at low water to the haunted cave on Guanaco Hill .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 38]: The Indians dared not follow ; but they took good care that no canoes were obtainable in which the unhappy fugitives could reach the ship , and they were confident that hunger would soon drive them forth .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 17]: Courtenay 's brow became black with anger when he understood the significance of this staggering story .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 12]: `` It comes to this , '' he said to Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 33]: `` The men who got away from the _ Kansas _ in No. 3 life-boat fell into the hands of the savages early on the day of the ship 's arrival here .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 20]: Suarez slipped his cable that night , being aware at the time that eleven white captives were still alive .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 25]: Yet he said no word , not even when he heard that we had seen one of the boat 's water-casks in a canoe .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 42]: He , a Christian , bolted and remained silent , while some poor creature of a woman risked her life , and ran counter to all her natural instincts , in the endeavor to save the men of his own race .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 10]: What sort of mean hound can he be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 13]: Suarez needed no translation to grasp the purport of Courtenay 's words .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 11]: He besought the señor captain to have patience with him .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 21]: He had escaped from a living tomb , and felt that he would yield up his life rather than return .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 36]: Therefore , when he saw how few in number and badly armed were they on board the ship , he thought it best to remain silent as to the fate of the boat 's crew .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 26]: In the first place , he fully expected that they had been killed by the Indians , who would be enraged by his own disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 15]: Secondly , he alone knew how hopeless any attempt at a rescue must prove .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 32]: Finally , he wished to spare the feelings of those who had befriended him ; of what avail were useless mind-torturings regarding the hapless beings in the hands of the savages ?
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 27]: There was a certain plausibleness in this reasoning which curbed Courtenay 's wrath , though it in no way diminished the disgust which filled his soul .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 15]: What quality was there lacking in the Latin races which rendered them so untrustworthy ?
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 44]: His crew had mutinied , de Poincilit was ready to consign his companions in misfortune to a most frightful death on the barren island , and here was Suarez hugging to his breast a ghastly secret which chance alone had brought to light .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 31]: He strove hard to repress the contempt which rose in his gorge , as it was essential that the broken-spirited miner should not be frightened out of his new-born candor .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 17]: `` Ask him to ascertain if the Indians believe the white men are still living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 28]: A fresh series of grunts and clicks elicited the fact that the smoke-column seen the previous day on Guanaco Hill had not been created by the tribe .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 23]: Suarez begged the señor captain to remember that he had spoken truly when he declared that its meaning was unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 24]: Probably , from what he now learnt , the girl who threw in her lot with the sailors had built a fire there .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 10]: Courtenay turned on his heel and quitted the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 15]: The smell of the Indians was loathsome , the mere sight of Suarez offensive .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 25]: For this discovery had overcast the happiness of his wooing as a thunder-cloud darkens and blots the smiling life out of a fair valley .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 16]: There rushed in on him a hundred chilling thoughts , each gloomier than its forerunner .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 17]: Ravens croaked within him ; misshapen imps whispered evil omens ; his spirit sat in gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 22]: Christobal , well knowing how the demons of doubt and despair were afflicting Courtenay , followed him to the upper deck .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 8]: Boyle was in the chart-house and Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 36]: Each man noted the captain 's troubled face ; from him they glanced towards the doctor ; but the Spaniard had undergone his purgatory some hours earlier ; his thin features were now quite expressionless .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 5]: Courtenay obtained a telescope .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 24]: With the tact which never failed him , even in such a desperate crisis as this , he handed the doctor his binoculars .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 12]: Then , both men looked at the summit of Guanaco Hill .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 38]: Though it was high noon , and the landscape was shimmering in the heat-mist created by the unusual power and brilliance of the sun , they distinctly saw a thin pillar of smoke rising above the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 5]: Courtenay closed his telescope .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 23]: He made to approach Boyle , evidently for the purpose of giving some order , when Christobal said quietly : `` Wait !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 8]: I have something to say to you .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 8]: You ought to remain on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 7]: Let _ me _ go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 4]: `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 5]: `` Yes , I .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 12]: After all , it is only a matter of taking command .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 7]: One man can not go alone .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 10]: He could not even pull the life-boat so far .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 22]: Hence , what you can do I can do , and I have no objection to dying in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 9]: `` Why should either of us die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 16]: `` You know better than I how little chance there is of saving those men .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 24]: You may deem me callous if I suggest that the reasonable thing would be to forget the miserable statement you have just heard .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 9]: Oh , please hear me to the end .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 12]: I am not talking for your sole benefit , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 32]: Greatly as I and all on board are beholden to you , I do not propose giving my life in your stead because of my abounding admiration for your many virtues .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 21]: Well , then since you are so impatient as to be almost rude , I come straight to the point .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 36]: If you take command of a boat 's crew and endeavor to save the men imprisoned over there , you will almost certainly throw away your life and the lives of those who help you .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 16]: In that event , a lady in whom we are both interested will suffer grievously .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 29]: On the other hand , if I were killed , she would weep a little , because she has a large heart , but you would console her .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 26]: And the odd thing is that you and I are fully aware that either you or I must go off on this fool 's errand .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 10]: There is none other to take the vacant place .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 9]: Now , have I made myself clear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 9]: `` You are a good fellow , Christobal .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 24]: You revive my faith in human nature , and that is my best apology if I irritated you just now by my attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 31]: But do n't you see that I can neither accept your generous offer nor sail away from our harbor of refuge without making an attempt to save my men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 7]: `` They are not your men .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 9]: They forfeited your captaincy by their own action .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 23]: In the effort to succor them you will lose at least one life which is precious to all on board this ship .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 18]: I am twice your age , Courtenay , and I affirm unhesitatingly that you are wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 11]: `` Yet you are ready to take my place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 9]: `` I have given you my reasons . ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 15]: `` They do you honor ; but you would fail where I might succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 6]: You are not a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 22]: Brave as I know you to be , you are not physically fitted for the rough work which may be needed .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 10]: I think , too , you exaggerate the risk .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 10]: The Alaculofs are broken by last night 's failure .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 9]: They will not dare to face us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 24]: `` At least spare me an argument which does not convince yourself ; otherwise you would depute me instantly for the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 8]: `` Well , you force plain speaking .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 24]: While I command the _ Kansas _ I am responsible for the well-being of the ship , her crew , and her passengers .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 17]: I could never forgive myself if I left those men to the mercy of the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 16]: I can not permit either you or Tollemache to take a risk which I shirk .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 12]: Boyle and Walker must remain on board -- lest I fail .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 11]: Now , Christobal , do n't make my duty harder .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 3]: Shake hands !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 11]: I am proud to claim you as a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: `` Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 7]: said Boyle , strolling towards them .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 4]: A bet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' laughed Courtenay , from whose face all doubt had vanished ; `` a bet , indeed , and you hold the stakes .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 9]: Have you seen the smoke signal yonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 7]: and he pointed across the bay .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 10]: Tollemache found it again , twenty minutes since . ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 17]: `` It means that eleven of our men are there , expecting us to save them .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 15]: Hoist the ship 's answering pennant from the main yard swung out to starboard .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 16]: Build a small fire on the poop and throw some oil and lampblack on it .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 13]: If they do n't recognize the pennant they will understand the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 28]: Get some food and water stowed in the life-boat , and offer five pounds a head to six men who will volunteer for a trip ashore . ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 12]: `` I go in charge , of course , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 3]: said Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 12]: `` You remain here , and take command during my absence .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 19]: I want two revolvers for a couple of the crew , and I shall take my own gun .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 6]: Please make all arrangements promptly .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 17]: I am going to my cabin for five minutes , and shall start immediately afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 6]: This was the captain speaking .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 7]: His tone admitted of no contention .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 11]: Boyle hurried off , and Courtenay went into his quarters .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 9]: `` What do you think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 16]: Christobal asked Tollemache , as the latter appeared to be sauntering after the chief officer .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 4]: `` Rot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 3]: said Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 7]: `` But what can we do ?
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 6]: He is committing suicide . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 7]: `` One must do that occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 12]: It 's rotten , but it ca n't be helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 10]: Christobal threw out his hands in a despairing gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 15]: `` I tried to stop him , but I failed , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 18]: `` Courtenay is a hard man to stop , '' said Tollemache , vanishing down the companion .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 9]: The Spaniard was left alone on the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 10]: He paced to and fro , deep in thought .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 8]: He scarce dared probe his own communings .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 26]: So complex were they , such a queer amalgam of noble fear and base expectation , that he could have cried aloud in his anguish .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 14]: Big drops of perspiration stood on his forehead when Courtenay came to him .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 15]: `` For God 's sake , do n't go , '' said he hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 13]: `` Do you know you are placing me on the rack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 11]: `` Your sufferings are of your own contriving , then .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 13]: Why , man , there is no reason for all this agony .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 10]: I have written to Elsie , briefly explaining matters .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 5]: Here is the letter .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 11]: Give it to her , if I do n't return .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 7]: And now , pull yourself together .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 7]: I want you to cheer her .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 15]: Above all things , do n't let her know I am leaving the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 11]: I 'll just swing myself overboard at the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 6]: I ca n't say good-by .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 10]: I do n't think I could stand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 19]: CHAPTER XVII A MAN 'S METHOD -- AND A WOMAN 'S Isobel 's drooping was of brief endurance .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 31]: Elsie and Mrs. Somerville supported her to the stateroom , and there Elsie sat with her a little while , soothing her as one might comfort a child in pain .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 29]: Once it seemed that the stricken girl was on the point of confiding in her friend , but the imminent words died away in a passion of tears .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 38]: Elsie besought her to rest , and strove to calm her with predictions of the joyous days they would pass together when the stress and terror of their present life should be a tale that is told .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 37]: Isobel , stupefied by some haunting knowledge which appeared to have a vague connection with the misfortunes of the _ Kansas _ , yielded to Elsie 's gentle compulsion , and endeavored to close her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 47]: All was quiet in the cabin , save for the sufferer 's labored breathing , and an occasional sob , while her wondering nurse smoothed her luxuriant hair , and whispered those meaningless little phrases which have such magic influence on the distracted nerves of woman-kind .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 20]: There was hardly a sound on the ship , beyond an unexplained creaking of pulleys , which soon ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 13]: Mrs. Somerville had gone , in response to Elsie 's mute appeal .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 26]: Somehow , from a piecing together of hints and half phrases , the girl feared a painful disclosure as the outcome of Isobel 's hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 8]: She was glad it had been averted .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 21]: If there were hidden scandals in her friend 's life in Chile , she prayed they might remain at rest .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 9]: She had not forgotten Christobal 's guarded words .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 27]: He probably knew far more than he chose to tell of the `` summer hotel attachment '' between Isobel and Ventana at which he had hinted .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 40]: But , even crediting that passing folly with a serious aspect , why should the daughter of the richest merchant in Valparaiso fall prostrate at the mere mention of the name of a disreputable loafer like José the Winebag ?
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 9]: To state the fact was to refute it .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 7]: Elsie dismissed the idea as preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 40]: It was clear enough that Isobel 's break-down arose from some other cause ; perhaps the relaxed tension of existence on board the _ Kansas _ , after the hardships borne on the island , supplied a simple explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 20]: Through the open port she heard a man walk rapidly along the deck , and halt outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 28]: She half rose from her knees to answer the expected knock , thinking that Mrs. Somerville had sent a steward to ascertain if Miss Baring needed anything .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 12]: But the newcomer evidently changed his mind , and turned back .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 19]: Then came Courtenay 's voice , low but compelling : `` One moment , M'sieu ' de Poincilit .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 6]: A word with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 4]: The French Count !
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 30]: During the whirl of the previous night , and by reason of the abiding joy of her morning 's reverie , she had failed to miss the dapper Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 28]: Once , indeed , she had mentioned him to Isobel , who offered a brief surmise that he might be ill , and keeping to his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 36]: Yet , here he was on deck , and possibly on the point of seeking an interview with the lady to whom he had paid such close attention during the early days of the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 26]: Perhaps Mrs. Somerville had told him of the fainting fit , and he was about to make a friendly inquiry when the captain accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 47]: But Elsie 's ears , tuned to fine precision where her lover 's utterances were concerned , had caught the note of contemptuous command , and she was even more surprised by the Count 's flurried answer in French : `` Another time , M'sieu ' .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 7]: I pray you pardon me now .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 14]: I find I am not strong enough yet to venture on deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 10]: `` Oh yes , you are , M'sieu ' .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 11]: I want to give you the chance of your life .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 25]: Mr. Gray has told me of your behavior , and he charitably added that your cowardice and treachery might have arisen from ungovernable fear .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 16]: Now , if you wish to atone for your conduct , here is an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 19]: I am taking a boat ashore to try to save some of my men who are imprisoned there .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 9]: There is a fair risk in the venture .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 6]: The outcome may be death .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 8]: Will you volunteer to take an oar ?
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 7]: That would whitewash your weather-marks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 5]: `` It is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 5]: I am too feeble .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 6]: I can not row . ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 6]: `` Ah , you swine !
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 10]: Can it be possible that you are a Frenchman ?
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 11]: What sort of countship is it you boast of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 20]: `` Sir , I am a passenger on this ship -- '' Courtenay 's voice was raised a little .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 29]: `` Mr. Boyle , '' he said , `` give orders that if this skunk shows his nose inside the saloon again he is to be kicked out .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 19]: He can eat his meals in his stateroom , or in the forecabin with the other savages . ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 5]: Elsie heard every word .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 16]: She fancied , too , that Isobel was listening , though she gave no sign .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 25]: But the unknown cause of the captain 's anger was as naught compared with the statement that he was about to leave the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 8]: That stabbed her with a nameless fear .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 28]: `` Love looks not with the eyes , but with the mind ; '' she saw her idyl destroyed , her sweet dreaming roused into cruel reality .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 15]: Her understanding heart told her that Courtenay meant to go without bidding her farewell .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 21]: She had heard the lowering of the boat without heeding ; he was already climbing down the ship 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 13]: Soon he would be far from her , perhaps never to return .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 26]: For he was not one to paint imaginary ills , and had he not told de Poincilit what the outcome of the undertaking might be ?
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 24]: Was it his wish that she should remain in seeming ignorance of his mission until it was too late for a parting word ?
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 11]: Did he dread the ordeal of telling her his errand ?
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 31]: Even he , so strong and resolute , who had so often smiled grim death out of countenance , feared the kiss which might wean him from the narrow way .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 9]: And she must prove herself worthy of him .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 17]: She must suffer in silence , trusting the All-powerful to bring him back to her arms .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 12]: And then she found Isobel looking at her with frightened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 6]: `` Did you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 5]: came the tense whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 11]: `` And you are content to let him go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 5]: `` Ah , God !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 5]: Yes , content . ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 6]: `` But it is folly .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: He is the captain .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 5]: He should not go .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 6]: We have risked enough already .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 17]: Who are these men for whose sake he leaves you , and all of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 19]: `` I know not , nor do I greatly care , may Heaven help me and them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 13]: `` Then you should appeal to him to abandon this mad undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 7]: It is not fair to you .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 17]: It is more than unfair to those who have entrusted their lives to his keeping . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 16]: Isobel would have risen in her excitement , had not Elsie leaped to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 30]: `` Oh , Isobel , '' she cried , all a-quiver with disdain , `` can you not for once conquer the self that is destroying your very soul ?
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 15]: Neither by word nor act shall you interfere between Arthur Courtenay and his duty .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 21]: Would you have him cling ignobly to life like that poor dandy whom he has sent to herd with savages ?
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 13]: Be sure he has not forgotten those who are beholden to him .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 6]: We are his first care .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 16]: Let it be mine to leave him unhindered in the task he has undertaken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 6]: Isobel was cowed into silence .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 11]: Elsie 's hero-worship had reached a height beyond her comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 49]: She would never understand how a woman who loved a man could send him voluntarily to his death , and her shallow mind did not contemplate the possibility of Courtenay 's refusing to be swayed by any other consideration than that which his conscience told him was right .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 24]: Thus , at arm 's length as it were , they waited until they caught the sharp command `` Give way there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 18]: and the plash of oars told them that the boat had really started on its journey shorewards .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 35]: Then Isobel , glancing furtively at her companion , saw the tears stealing down her cheeks , and the situation came back from the transcendental to that which was intelligible to her lower ideals .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 15]: `` I am sorry , '' she whispered , catching Elsie 's hand timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 11]: `` I said what I thought was for the best .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 11]: At any rate , it is too late now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 3]: Too late !
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 9]: The other girl groped blindly for the door .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 34]: She felt that she would yield to the strain if she did not go on deck and catch a parting glimpse of the man who had become dearer to her than life itself .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 13]: As she made her way forward , Joey ran to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 5]: He was whining anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 14]: He seemed to be demanding that sympathy which she alone could give him .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 20]: In his half-human way , he was asking : `` Why has my master gone away in that boat ?
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 10]: And why did he not take me with him ?
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 22]: When my master goes ashore he never leaves me on board ; what is the reason of to-day 's exception ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 13]: On the poop she found Boyle , Christobal , Gray and Walker .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 14]: A number of Chileans were leaning over the rails of the main deck .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 7]: All the men were talking earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 14]: It was ominous that they should cease their conversation the instant she appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 12]: One man may conceal his fears , but twenty can not .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 26]: Their studied unconcern , their covert glances under lowered eye-lids , told her that they believed the occupants of the life-boat were in gravest peril .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 25]: She brushed away the tears determinedly , and looked at the boat , already a white speck on the green carpet of the bay .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 37]: She could see Courtenay distinctly ; some magnetic impulse must have gone out from her , because she had not been watching him longer than a couple of seconds when he turned and waved his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 28]: She replied instantly , fluttering a handkerchief , poor girl , long after it became impossible for her to distinguish whether or not he returned her signals .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 19]: In the calm glory of the sunlit estuary , he might have been bent on a pleasant picnic .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 34]: It was outrageous to think of Good Hope Inlet as a place of skulls ; yet she knew that the sea floor beneath the ship was already littered with bodies of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 17]: Women would wait in vain for their men to return ; why should she be spared ?
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 14]: At last she appealed to Mr. Boyle , who was nearest to her .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 10]: `` Who is sitting next to Captain Courtenay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 24]: she asked , and she had a fleeting impression that he was anxious for her to speak , so quickly did he answer .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 3]: `` Tollemache .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 25]: He shinned down the ladder as the first volunteer ; the skipper ordered him to get out , but he said he was deaf .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 9]: Anyhow , I 'm glad he is there .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 14]: Courtenay ought to have one sure enough white man by his side . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 8]: `` And what are they attempting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 23]: `` Huh , it 's a bold plan , an ' I 'm not goin ' to condemn it on that account .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 30]: Have you heard this morning 's news -- how Suarez found out from the Indians that eleven of our crew are hiding in a cave on Guanaco Hill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 8]: `` Something of it , not all .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 15]: But why -- why has Captain Courtenay gone off in such a hurry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 22]: `` Well , Miss Elsie , he figures that an open effort by daylight is the only way to rescue them .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 17]: They will have seen our signals , and they can hardly fail to sight the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 34]: When he is close inshore they are sure to make a dash for it , and he hopes to get them off before the Indians wake up to the game he is playing .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 33]: There are eight men in the boat , and , with eleven others to help , there should n't be much difficulty in keepin ' the savages at a proper distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 12]: `` How soon -- will he -- reach the landing-place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 16]: `` Huh , mebbe an hour ; an ' another hour for the home trip .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 8]: He 'll be aboard for tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 10]: Boyle uttered that concluding statement a trifle too airily .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 20]: Elsie , for the first time in her life , knew what it meant to want to scream aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 12]: The dog was dancing about excitedly , and whining without cease .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 10]: She stooped and took him up in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 20]: `` Please , Joey , be quiet , '' she murmured , her voice breaking with a stifled sob .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 13]: She turned again to Mr. Boyle , who sedulously avoided her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 11]: `` Did Captain Courtenay leave any message for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 3]: `` Huh !
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 2]: Message !
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 13]: Why , he will be away only a couple of hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 25]: The chief officer 's tone was gruff , conveying the idea that women asked silly questions , but his gruffness did not hoodwink Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 7]: He had prepared his replies beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 11]: `` Surely you will tell me , Mr. Boyle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 4]: she pleaded wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 17]: `` Well , I happen to know there 's a letter in the doctor 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 14]: But that is to be given to you in case of accident alone .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 7]: Is n't that so , doctor ?
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 14]: And there 's no sign of any accident yet , thank goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 13]: Boyle sighed , like a man who lays down a heavy load .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 9]: He had successfully engineered Christobal into the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 5]: The Spaniard drew near .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 14]: He had heard all that had passed , and tried a new line .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 37]: `` I was rather hoping that you would not put that awkward query , '' he said , more alive than the sailor to the wisdom of discussing the very topic which offered so many thorns .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 21]: `` Of course , none of us , least of all Courtenay himself , disguises the difficulties which confront him .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 39]: We have not fought the Alaculofs in two serious battles without learning their tenacity of purpose , and the mere fact that the men hidden in that cleft are compelled to remain invisible shows that they are beleaguered .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 35]: But the last thing the Indians will expect is the appearance of a boat-load of armed men at this hour , and to take the enemy unawares is the essence of good generalship . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 10]: `` When am I to have my letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 18]: she persisted , clinging tenaciously to one clear thought amid the phantasms which thronged her dazed mind .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 7]: `` Oh , come , now !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 12]: That is not the hopeless view I want you to take .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 13]: In writing to you , Courtenay was only providing against a mishap .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 8]: He would not go to certain death .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 35]: He has too high a sense of what is due to his position as captain of a ship like the _ Kansas _ , loaded with a valuable cargo and carrying so many lives .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 10]: Nor does Tollemache impress me as a would-be suicide .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 22]: Both men think they will succeed , and they had not any trouble in obtaining a boat 's crew of Chileans .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 16]: So you see , there is a general belief in success , not failure . ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 10]: She felt that the doctor was talking against time .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 24]: He had instructions not to give her that letter until there could be no doubt of the fate which had befallen the rescuers .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 24]: A mist came over her eyes , but she bit her lower lip fiercely , and the white teeth left their deep impress .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 15]: The dog squirmed uneasily in her arms , and endeavored to lick her face .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 17]: Joey 's anxiety rivaled her own ; had he , too , a premonition of evil ?
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 6]: Christobal was watching her intently .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 15]: It was evident he feared the outcome of any sudden overthrow of her self-control .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 33]: `` I think , '' he suggested , with a real sympathy in his voice , `` that it would be better if you went to the saloon , or your cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 14]: Believe me , I shall come to you with every scrap of news .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 22]: Boyle will see all that happens and we shall know the best , or the worst , within an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 19]: `` If you would help me , '' she answered dully , `` please take the dog away .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 6]: He is tearing my heart-strings .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 10]: Poor little fellow , he makes no pretence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 24]: So Joey was fastened up , much against his will , and his piteous protests no longer added to the girl 's agony .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 28]: She clung to the after rail , and watched the boat , now a tiny dot hard to discern amidst the ripples caused by the inflowing tide .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 48]: Her intimate acquaintance with the daily happenings of life aboard told her that Courtenay had chosen the last hour of flood for his effort , thus gaining the advantage of the ebb in the event of the life-boat 's being pursued by canoes on the return journey .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 16]: By degrees , a tender little sprig of hope peeped up in her dulled consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 20]: The boat was very near the distant rocks , and there was neither sight nor sound of the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 20]: Could it be that they were afraid -- altogether broken and demoralized by the slaughter of the preceding night ?
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 11]: How quickly the acts of this drama shifted their scenes !
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 46]: Sixteen hours ago , she and Christobal were actually participating in the defense of the ship 's last stronghold ; now , the broad decks resembled the inner spaces of some impregnable fort , while the war was being carried into the enemy 's territory .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 12]: Yet the mortal peril which overshadowed them was threatening as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 11]: Life seemed to be doled out grudgingly , by minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 29]: Suddenly she had a breathless desire to know why Courtenay was so sure that the men to whose help he had gone were really members of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 22]: Christobal , dreading her despairing questions , was standing in the position he had occupied before Boyle dragged him into prominence .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 21]: The chief officer was bracing a telescope against the ensign staff , and keeping the lifeboat in a full field .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 24]: Gray , she noticed , was not looking towards Guanaco Hill , but swept all parts of the coastline constantly with his binoculars .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 10]: The Spaniard 's field-glasses were slung around his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 6]: He was not using them .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 8]: He appeared to be deep in thought .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 24]: More often than not , his glance rested on the eddy created by the swirl of the current past the ship 's quarter .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 15]: With a species of divination , she guessed somewhat the nature of his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 10]: The notion stung her into a sort of fury .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 9]: To quell it , she must speak again .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 15]: `` Will you tell me now what it was that Suarez found out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 12]: The doctor quickly appreciated her need of material for further thought .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 38]: She wanted to appraise at their true value all things affecting that daring enterprise , bringing the evidence to the bar of her hopes , and nerving herself to hear the crudest testimony as to its dangers .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: He was glad to be able to beguile the next half hour with his recital .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 17]: He suppressed no detail except his own willingness to take Courtenay 's place in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 13]: Notwithstanding his slight affectations , he was a man of finely-tempered judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 31]: He saw now that Courtenay could not have accepted his offer , nor was it likely that the men in the boat would follow any other leader than the captain .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 9]: He even smarted a little at the knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 17]: A super-sensitive honor led him to fear that his successful rival might suspect him of vaingloriousness .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 21]: Herein Christobal did himself an injustice , and Courtenay a greater one , as he was fated soon to learn .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 22]: When Elsie heard of the duplicity practised by Suarez it was good to see the hot indignation which reddened her brow .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 36]: She realized that the man was unscrupulous enough to remain silent concerning the captured sailors , whose unhappy fate had contributed , in no small degree , to the chance which brought him to safety .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 59]: She instantly fastened on to the theory that the Indians paid their first nocturnal visit to the ship in the belief that the vessel would prove as easy a prey as the castaways , whereas Suarez must have fallen beneath their stones and rude hatchets if he had attempted to board the _ Kansas _ in broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 47]: With all a woman 's single-mindedness , she regarded the Argentine miner as being directly responsible for Courtenay 's hazard , nor would she listen to Christobal 's mild protest that nothing could have been done earlier , no matter how outspoken Suarez chose to be .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 37]: The Spaniard encouraged her to debate this point -- anything was better than the dumb pain of thought -- but their talk ceased abruptly when a muttered exclamation from Gray sent Walker flying to the charthouse .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 16]: Forthwith the trumpet shriek of the siren sent its wild boom across the silent waters .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 8]: Elsie needed no explanation of this tumult .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 21]: Otter Creek was not so far distant that canoes quitting its shelter could not be seen with the naked eye .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 18]: She counted sixteen putting forth in a cluster , and they all made for the adventurous life-boat .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 17]: `` That is exactly what our captain expected , '' Christobal was ready to assure her .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 23]: `` He was certain he would reach the head of the bay before the Indians awoke to the meaning of his scheme .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 34]: By this time , unless his plan fails , the men on shore should have joined him , no matter what number of savages may seek to oppose their passage to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 25]: The only doubtful question is -- Will he be able to beat off the rascals who are now cutting his line of retreat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 4]: `` Huh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 12]: growled Boyle , `` the skipper 's out of sight now .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 11]: Gone into a small creek or something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 6]: Hope he heard the horn .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 5]: Let her rip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 25]: he added in a loud shout over his shoulder , and again the siren flung a warning to the foot of the mountain range .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 18]: It was evident that the wonderful eyesight of the Indians practically equalled the range of the telescope .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 44]: The men in the canoes were aware of the lifeboat 's disappearance , and their wet paddles flashed in the sun as they tore across the three miles of open water which separated the southern promontory from the inner shore of the island .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 29]: After a phenomenal spell of fine weather in that storm-swept latitude , the atmosphere was transparent and bright as that of Stornoway on a clear day in December .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 16]: The rays of the sun were reflected from many a blue glacier and ice-covered slope .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 28]: Even the green of the higher belt of firs was dazzling in its emerald luster , and the copper-hued beeches beneath shone in patches of burnished gold .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 29]: Elsie was sick at heart with the knowledge that red-eyed murder was stalking its prey under the resplendent mantle spread by nature over a scene of rare beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 13]: In an agony of apprehension she followed the progress of the canoes .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 21]: Creeping nearer Boyle , she whispered : `` For Heaven 's sake , say the life-boat is visible again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 9]: He held up a hand to enforce silence .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 8]: A deep hush fell on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 4]: `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 12]: he muttered , so low that Elsie alone caught the words .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 7]: `` Can you hear firing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 25]: She thought she could distinguish an irregular patter of dull reports , and the behavior of the Indians showed that additional excitement was toward .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 20]: Many of them stood up and waved their arms , possibly as a signal to their allies on shore .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 5]: The canoes raced madly .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 24]: Where speed was vital the rough-hewn native craft were far swifter than the solidly-built lifeboat , with its broad beam and deep draft .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 5]: And that was all .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 42]: Though they strained their eyes and spoke with bated breath , never a sight of boat or canoes was obtainable for hours after the latter were swallowed up by the trees which shrouded the creek at the foot of Guanaco Hill .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 21]: Isobel Baring , moved by genuine pity for her distraught friend , tried to induce her to leave the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 22]: But she shrank away , terrified by the fire which blazed from the blue eyes resting on her for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 12]: Mrs. Somerville came , but she , too , was repulsed .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 5]: Elsie spoke no word .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 4]: She hardly moved .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 20]: She clung to the rail , and gazed at the deepening shadows with the frozen stare of abiding horror .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 21]: All things around her were unreal , fantastic ; she dwelt in a world peopled by her own terrible imaginings .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 9]: The smiling landscape was alive with writhing shapes .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 14]: She fancied it a monstrous jungle full of serpents and grotesquely human beasts .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 28]: The inert mass of the _ Kansas _ , so modern , so perfectly appointed in its contours and appurtenances , crushed her by its immense helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 18]: The dominant idea in her mind was one of voiceless rage against the ship and its occupants .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 64]: Why should her lover , who had saved their lives -- who had plucked the eight thousand tons of steel fabric from the sharp-toothed rocks time and again -- why should he be lying dead , disfigured by savage spite , while those to whom he had rendered such devoted service were coolly discussing his fate and speculating on their own good fortune ?
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 5]: That thought maddened her .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 13]: Her very brain seemed to burn with the unfairness of it all .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 26]: When Christobal made a serious effort to lead her away , she threatened him with the fierceness of a mother defending her child from evil .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 12]: But relief was vouchsafed in the worst throes of her agony .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 19]: It was some poor consolation to let her sorrow-laden eyes rest on the far-off trees which enshrouded him .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 32]: What would befall her when night came , and the ship drew back out of the living world into the narrow gloom of deck and gangway , she could not know .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 15]: She felt that her labored heart would refuse to bear its pangs any longer .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 9]: If death came , that would be sweet .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 16]: Her only hope lay in the life beyond the grave ... And what a grave !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 7]: For her , the restless tides .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 3]: For him !
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 10]: Surely her mind would yield to this increasing madness .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 12]: Boyle or Gray had never relaxed their vigil by her side .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 14]: It was Gray who made the thrilling discovery that the canoes were returning .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 17]: As the fleet crossed the bay it could be seen that they were towing the life-boat .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 14]: But never a sign of any prisoners could the most careful scrutiny detect .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 22]: The boat was empty ; it was easy to count every man in the canoes as they passed into Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 11]: And there were wounded Indians on board many of them .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 10]: That was a significant , a tremendous , fact .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 35]: There had been hard fighting , and the boat was captured , but some , if not all , of the crew must have joined their comrades in the sanctuary of the haunted cave .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 18]: The accuracy of this deduction was proved by the presence of the smoke column on the hill .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 33]: Indeed , the opinion was generally held that its spiral clouds were denser than at any previous hour , thus showing that the defenders were endeavoring to make known their continued existence .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 25]: Elsie awoke from her trance , but , in returning to life , she was transformed into a stern , resourceful , commanding woman .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 69]: Her face had lost its gentleness ; the pleasant curves and dimples of mouth and chin had hardened into a sort of determination ; even her slight , graceful figure seemed to assume a certain squareness which betokened her resolve to act as her lover would have acted were he the watcher from the ship and she the prisoner pent behind that screen of rock and wild forest .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 13]: None suspected the mighty force which worked this resolution in her nature .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 14]: She conducted herself with a cunning that was wholly foreign to her character .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 20]: Her first care was to hoodwink her companions into the belief that the strain of the day had passed .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 52]: She accepted a cup of tea brought by Isobel , expressed her sorrow that if by word or look she had given cause for offence , and entered eagerly into the pros and cons of the debate which sprang up as to the best course to pursue on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 10]: Everyone agreed that nothing could be done that night .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 44]: If the pillar of smoke were visible at sunrise , and Walker could possibly manage to fire the boilers , Boyle suggested that some sailors in the jolly-boat should sound a channel along which the vessel itself might steam slowly towards Guanaco Hill .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 13]: That , in itself , would be a move of considerable value .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 46]: If they could lessen the distance between the shore and the ship , each yard thus gained would help the prisoners and impose a stronger barrier against the Alaculofs , who would probably be daunted when they found that the vessel 's mobility was restored .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 20]: This proposal was deemed so excellent that they all dined in vastly better spirits than any of them anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 22]: Christobal , puzzled out of his scientific senses by Elsie 's change of manner , kept a close eye on her .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 33]: He was amazed to see her eat a better meal than she had eaten for days , and she was normally a quite healthy young person , with a reasonably good appetite .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 14]: Boyle and Gray took the first watch , from eight o'clock to midnight .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 36]: Christobal and Walker shared the next one ; by four o'clock it would be daylight , so the doctor was retiring early to his cabin when he met Elsie , by chance as it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 13]: She was self-possessed , even smiling , with a certain dour serenity .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 13]: `` The day 's doings have tired me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: `` I am off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 11]: Will you rap on my door soon after dawn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' he replied , secretly marveling at her air .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 16]: `` I plead guilty to a slight feeling of nervousness , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 6]: `` Is your revolver loaded ?
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 8]: Would you mind lending it to me ?
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 19]: I think I could sleep more soundly if I had a reliable weapon tucked under my pillow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 17]: A whiff of suspicion crossed Christobal 's mind , but he brushed it aside as unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 14]: At five o'clock that day he certainly would not have granted her request .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 23]: But now , since the new hope had sprung up that Courtenay was alive , it was absurd to doubt her motives .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 28]: So it came to pass that Diego Suarez , lying asleep in his bunk , awoke with a start to find a shrouded figure bending over him .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 9]: `` Is that you , Señor Suarez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 15]: asked a voice , which he recognized instantly as belonging to the Señorita Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' said he , drowsily .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 18]: `` Have you the witch-doctor 's clothes you wore when you came on board the ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 7]: `` But yes , señorita . ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 13]: A hand , slight but strong , grasped him by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 13]: He felt the rim of a revolver barrel pressed against his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 6]: `` Get up , then !
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 12]: Dress quickly in those clothes , and come out on deck .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 22]: By the side of your bunk you will find tins of black and white paint to smear your face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 36]: At the slightest refusal on your part to do as I bid you -- if you utter a cry or make any noise to attract attention -- I shall kill you without another word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 21]: The soft voice had a steely ring in it which persuaded the man from Argentina that he had better obey .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 11]: In less than five minutes he emerged from the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 13]: The corridor in which his cabin was situated led into the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 4]: Elsie awaited him .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 12]: A lamp , dimly lighting the gangway , revealed her face .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 10]: Suarez thought he had to deal with a mad-woman .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 23]: The dog , standing by her side , sniffed at him gingerly , but a muttered `` Be quiet , Joey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 11]: prevented any outburst , every fox-terrier being a born conspirator .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 12]: `` What do you wish me to do , señorita ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 13]: began Suarez , thinking to placate her until he could obtain assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 13]: `` You must obey me in silence , '' she whispered tensely .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 7]: `` You must not even speak .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 10]: One syllable aloud on deck will mean your death .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 21]: Walk in front of me , up the main companion , and go straight to the ship 's side . ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 5]: `` But , señorita !
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 21]: -- '' The hammer of the revolver began to rise under the pressure of Elsie 's finger on the trigger .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 9]: The man 's hair rose even more rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 5]: His nerve was broken .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 22]: He turned along the corridor in front of her , not knowing the instant a bullet might crash into his head .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 12]: The girl followed so closely that she almost touched his heels .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 13]: The dog would have trotted in front , but she recalled him .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 35]: When Suarez reached the port rail of the promenade deck , Elsie breathed : `` Climb , quickly , and go down into the canoe by the rope ladder you will find there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 5]: `` The canoe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 3]: gasped he .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 3]: `` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 13]: One , two , -- '' Up went Suarez over the rail .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 9]: He found the top-most rungs of the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 10]: As he descended , the revolver followed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 21]: When his head was level with the deck the order came : `` Take the dog and go down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 8]: `` I can not , señorita . ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 5]: `` You must try .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 10]: You are going down , dead or alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 4]: He did try .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 19]: Joey scuffled a little , but Suarez caught him by the neck , and made shift to descend .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 22]: Elsie was already on the swaying ladder when Boyle 's voice rang out sharply from the spar-deck : `` Below there !
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 5]: Who is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 10]: `` I , Mr. Boyle , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 6]: `` You , Miss Elsie ?
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 5]: Where are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 9]: `` Here ; not so far away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 7]: She was descending all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 43]: She had cast loose the rope which fastened the canoe alongside , and her difficulty was to hold the ladder and at the same time , by clinging to the mast , to prevent the canoe from slipping away with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 11]: The revolver she gripped between her teeth by the butt .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 25]: Boyle , puzzled by the sound of her voice , ran from the side of the bridge down the stairs and across the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 20]: He was a second too late to grasp the top of the mast as it drifted out of reach .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 25]: He heard Elsie utter a low-voiced command in Spanish , and the dip of a paddle told him that the canoe was in motion .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 13]: `` For the Lord 's sake , what are you doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 14]: `` I am going to save Captain Courtenay , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 8]: `` You can not stop me now .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 6]: Please hoist plenty of lights .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 11]: If I succeed , look out for me before daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 7]: If I fail , good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 10]: CHAPTER XVIII A FULL NIGHT Boyle was very angry .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 14]: It was a situation which demanded earnest words , and they were forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 35]: Elsie understood them to mean that she need not be in such a purple hurry to disappear into the darkness without the least explanation ; thereupon she bade Suarez back the canoe a little .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 46]: `` I am sorry it is necessary to steal away in this fashion , '' she said , and the coolness of her tone was highly exasperating to a man who could no more detain her than he could move the _ Kansas _ unaided .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 18]: `` I have a plan which requires only a bit of good fortune to render it practicable .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 21]: I have two assistants -- Suarez , whose aid I am compelling , and Joey , who is quite eager .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 10]: There is no use in risking any more lives .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 15]: If I do not return you may be sure the worst has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 8]: `` But what is your plan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 3]: roared Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 8]: `` It may be just sheer nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 31]: Tell me what it is , and I swear by the Nautical Almanac I shall not prevent you from carrying it out if it has any reason behind it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 17]: `` I am going to collect all the Indian canoes , '' was the amazing answer .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 14]: `` I know it can be done , from what Suarez has said .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 40]: Once we have the canoes in mid channel , we can set most of them adrift , and bring Captain Courtenay and the others back to the ship in four or five which we will tow to Guanaco Hill .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 7]: And now , good-by again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 19]: `` One moment , Miss Maxwell , '' broke in Gray 's quiet voice from the upper deck .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 18]: `` You ca n't engineer that scheme with a one-man crew , and he sick and unwilling .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 6]: I am going with you .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 11]: You must take me aboard , wet or dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 17]: `` I am well armed , and shall admit of no interference , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 8]: `` I promise to obey orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 17]: `` If I wanted you , Mr. Gray , I should have sought your help . ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 21]: `` It is one thing or the other -- a wriggle down a rope or a high diving act . ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 14]: `` You have no right to impose such an alternative on me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 15]: `` I hate it myself , and I ca n't dive worth a cent .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 13]: You will hear a beastly flop when I strike the damp . ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 13]: `` Mr. Boyle -- I call on you to hold him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 20]: Boyle explained luridly that the American was doing a balancing act on the rail eight feet above his head .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 20]: Elsie , taking her eyes off Suarez for an instant , discerned Gray 's figure silhouetted against the sky .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 3]: She yielded .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 23]: `` There is a rope ladder fastened to the lowest rail , near where the canoe was moored , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 12]: `` Is there to be any catch-as-catch-can business , Boyle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 3]: demanded Gray .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 11]: All this is d -- d unfair to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 16]: `` You have my sympathy , friend , but you ca n't leave the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 8]: Now , Miss Maxwell , come alongside .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 7]: Boyle is going to be good .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 11]: He does n't mean half he says , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 35]: As the canoe slipped out of the dense gloom of the ship 's shadow , Elsie heard the wrathful chief officer interviewing the Chilean sailors on watch on the main deck fore and aft .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 22]: That is to say , he stirred them up from the bridge with a ritual laid down for such extreme cases .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 23]: Not yet had he realized the exceeding artifice which the girl displayed in throwing him and all the others off their guard .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 18]: She had maneuvered Suarez into the canoe with the fierce and silent strategy of a Red Indian .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 36]: The Argentine squatted on his knees in the bows , Gray placed himself amidships , and Elsie sat aft , holding the revolver in her right hand and the dog 's collar in her left .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 14]: The American groped for and found a paddle , which he plied vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 25]: `` Guess you 'd better discourse , '' said he over his shoulder , when the light craft was well clear of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 9]: `` You understand Spanish , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 10]: `` Please tell Suarez to cease paddling and listen .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 4]: Do n't move .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 14]: I can trust you , but I may have to shoot him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 10]: `` Best hand me that pop-gun , Miss Maxwell .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 24]: The gentleman in front seems to have a wholesome respect for you already ; anything you say goes , where he is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 25]: I am taking your word for it his name is Suarez , but he looks , and smells , more like an Indian . ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 11]: `` I forced him to dress in his discarded clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 15]: He may be able now to scare any of the savages we come across .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 13]: But why should I give you my weapon , Mr. Gray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 26]: `` Because I can hit most things I aim at , whereas you are more likely to bore a hole through me as a preliminary .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 21]: Moreover , you have the dog with you , and even the wisest dog may bark at the wrong moment .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 13]: You must have both hands at liberty to choke his enthusiasm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 14]: `` Do you pledge your word to go on with my scheme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 10]: `` That is what I am here for . ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 8]: `` Take the revolver , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 7]: `` Sure it 's loaded ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 4]: `` Quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 31]: I have fifteen extra cartridges , but , as I have practised refilling it in the dark , give it to me if you have occasion to empty it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 13]: `` You seem to have thought this thing out pretty fully ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 6]: `` I intend to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 15]: Now , please , I must explain what I want Suarez to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 26]: Speaking in Spanish , slow and clear , while the canoe drifted steadily up the bay with the rising tide , Elsie unfolded her project .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 17]: Behind the guardian cliff of Otter Creek a ridge of rocks created a small natural harbor .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 35]: It was the custom of the Alaculofs , when the weather was calm , and they meant to use their craft at daybreak , to anchor most of their vessels in this sheltered break-water .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 25]: At other times the canoes were drawn ashore , but she reasoned that such a precaution would not be taken during the present excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 19]: That was the first part of her program -- to capture the entire fleet , including the life-boat .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 44]: In any event , she intended to go next to the hidden cleft at the foot of Guanaco Hill , trusting to the dog 's sagacity to reveal the retreat where she believed that her lover and many of his men were hidden .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 58]: If a squad of Indians mounted guard there , the reappearance of Suarez in his war paint , backed by the alarm of a night attack from the sea , might mystify the enemy sufficiently to permit of a landing , while the frequent reports of the revolver would certainly lead to a counter demonstration by Courtenay .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 27]: Suarez was the only man on the _ Kansas _ who could act as guide , and the penalty of his refusal would be instant death .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 20]: She had provided a strong , sharp knife to cut the thongs which fastened the canoes to their anchor-stones .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 10]: For the rest , she trusted to the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 10]: It was her fixed resolve to succeed or die .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 12]: Gray listened to the girl 's cool statement with growing admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 7]: The plan began to look feasible .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 8]: It came within the bounds of reason .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 23]: The odds were against it , of course , but the law of probability is seldom in favor of a forlorn hope .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 32]: Suarez , too , making the best of a situation which gave him no option , agreed that they had a fair chance if once they got hold of the canoes .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 16]: Nevertheless , he warned them that he knew nothing of the surroundings of Guanaco Hill .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 20]: He believed there were no reefs on that side of the inlet , but he had never visited it .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 18]: Their greatest peril lay amid the almost impenetrable trees which grew down to the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 13]: On his advice , Gray unshipped the mast and threw it overboard .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 5]: Then silence became imperative .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 13]: If aught were said , they must speak in the merest whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 9]: The canoe darted forward again with stealthy haste .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 8]: The night was clear , though dark .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 16]: The stars helped them to distinguish the outlines of the shore now coming rapidly nearer .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 28]: As they crept round the southern cheek of Point _ Kansas _ , the Argentine ceased paddling , and placed a warning hand on Gray 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 20]: The cliff was so high and steep that its shadow plunged into deepest gloom the water at its base .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 20]: Suarez , however , had imbibed a good deal of savage lore during his enforced residence on the island .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 45]: He stretched well forward over the bows , held a paddle as far in front as possible , and thus not only guided the drifting canoe by an occasional dip of the blade , but trusted to it for warning of any unseen rock .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 29]: There was a cold breeze on the surface of the bay , but the dog was the only one who shivered , and his tremors arose from excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 8]: At last they felt a slight bump .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 52]: The Argentine had found the reef he was searching for ; by watching a star it was easy enough to follow the southerly bend taken by the canoe in skirting this barrier , while their ears caught the murmur of the swift current amid the numerous tiny channels of the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 10]: Suddenly this swirl and hum of fast-flowing water ceased .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 14]: Elsie and Gray became aware that Suarez was cautiously drawing himself inboard again .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 17]: Then his paddle dipped with a noiseless stroke ; the canoe was inside the Alaculof harbor .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 16]: The midnight blackness was now something that had a sense of actual obstruction in it .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 12]: It seemed that a hand put forth would encounter a wall .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 10]: The tide was here , but no perceptible current .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 23]: For all they could tell to the contrary , they might have been floating in Charon 's boat across some Stygian pool .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 13]: For a minute or two , Elsie 's brave heart failed her .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 11]: Here was a difficulty which desperate courage could not surmount .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 38]: There might be dozens of canoes moored on all sides , but to discover them in this pitch darkness was so obviously impossible that she almost made up her mind to abandon this part of her enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 24]: Yet the narrow-beamed Fuegian craft she was in would hold only four more occupants , and that with a certain risk and unwieldiness .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 19]: She was as determined as ever to cross the bay and endeavor to communicate with the imprisoned men .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 35]: But she recognized the absurdity of the thought that Courtenay and Tollemache would consent to escape in the canoe and leave the others to their fate , even if such a thing were practicable .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 22]: Oddly enough , the one person whose daring might reasonably be suspected , gave no signs of the pangs of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 5]: Suarez pushed forward resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 33]: He knew what Elsie had forgotten -- that in each canoe used by the Indians there was a carefully preserved fire , whose charcoal embers retained some heat and glow all night .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 16]: The first intimation of this fact was revealed by the pungent fumes which environed them .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 11]: Elsie could not help uttering a little gasp of relief .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 8]: There was a slight movement in front .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 8]: Gray leaned back and touched her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 20]: `` Suarez says , '' he whispered , `` that you are to be ready with your tow ropes .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 13]: As he secures each canoe he will pass it along to me .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 16]: You will be able to see its outlines by the dim glimmer of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 9]: But how will you manage about the dog ?
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 7]: He may cause an alarm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 46]: Much to Joey 's disgust , he was forthwith muzzled with a piece of rope , not that this device would stop him effectually from barking , but Elsie thought he would so resent the indignity that he might pay less heed to outer circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 9]: She needed no warning that Indians were near .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 23]: The Argentine miner 's description of the community which dwelt on Otter Creek made her understand that there were hundreds within hail .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 16]: A great joy leaped up in her when the first canoe came under her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 9]: It was quite easy to manipulate the painter-rope .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 34]: The stem had a notched knob provided for this very purpose , and there was a stern-post against which a steersman might press a paddle and thus swerve the canoe in any direction .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 6]: But it was slow work .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 31]: The craft were moored without any semblance of order , yet Suarez was forced to secure them in a definite sequence , or a string of half-a-dozen would become unmanageable .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 15]: When the second canoe was made fast Gray bent towards the girl once more .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 19]: `` I have been listening to the tick of my watch , '' he breathed against her ear .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 13]: `` I reckon it has taken ten minutes to collect two dug-outs .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 18]: Unless we mean to remain all night we must let up on the cutting adrift proposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 8]: `` I agree , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 9]: `` But we must have two more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 22]: He told Suarez of the new development , which was essential , though it added to the danger of the enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 13]: By sheer good fortune , however , they blundered against the life-boat .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 24]: A dog barked , and Elsie had a thrilling struggle with Joey , who was furious that this unlooked-for insolence should go unanswered .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 21]: The sleepless cur who yelped ashore speedily subsided , but it appeared to be an age before Suarez moved again .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 19]: He knew , better than his companions , how ready the Indians were to note such sentinel challenges .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 32]: Had the alarm continued , the whole village would have been aroused , and , if the attack on the canoes were suspected , the water would swarm with vengeful savages .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 13]: Elsie found the painter of the life-boat coiled in its proper place .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 10]: Soon she experienced a steady pull on the rope .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 7]: Her little fleet was in motion .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 8]: Gray began to help in the paddling .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 26]: Ere long they came under the influence of the tide , and she heard the ripple of the water against the planks of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 9]: Then Suarez called a halt and a parley .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 30]: It would be far better , he advised , to use the oars in the heavy boat than attempt to tow it across the strong current from a canoe .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 8]: They would gain time and be safer .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 14]: So they climbed into the life-boat , but continued to tow the canoes .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 13]: And now they saw the mast-head light of the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 40]: Boyle had also caused the side lights to be slung to davits , and the white , red , and green lamps made a triangle in the obscurity , though its base seemed to be strangely near sea level .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 22]: Even a big vessel like the Kansas shrinks to small proportions when she is a mile or more distant at night .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 37]: She becomes indivisible , a mere atom in the immensity of the black waters ; it demands an effort of the imagination to credit her with wide decks , streets of cabins , and cavernous holds .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 16]: In one respect the exhibition of the port and starboard lights served them most excellently .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 44]: Guanaco Hill was directly astern of the ship ; they had absolutely no trouble in maintaining a straight line for their destination , all that was necessary being to keep the mast-head light in the exact center of the green and red points .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 39]: Suarez , somewhat weak from his knock on the head over night , was not equal to the strain of continued exertion , so Elsie and Gray took two oars each , and allowed their companion to rest .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 33]: When , judging by the surrounding hills , they were half way across the inlet , Gray stooped low in the boat , struck a match , and looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 7]: It was long after one o'clock !
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 29]: There could be no doubt whatever that the dawn would find them far from the ship , no matter how fortunate they might be in their further adventures .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 32]: It was well for Elsie that she had learnt how to scull when in her teens , and that her muscles were in fair condition owing to her skill at tennis .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 22]: Even so , she feared that she could never hold out against the sustained stress of that pull across the bay .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 20]: The heavy boat , intended to be rowed by six men , had the added burthen of four canoes .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 25]: It was back-breaking work ; but she neither faltered nor sighed until Suarez said : `` Let me take your place now , señorita .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 24]: In ten minutes we shall be at the mouth of the creek , though heaven only knows how we shall find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 10]: He did not exaggerate in thus expressing his fear .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 20]: Time and again they neared the shore , only to hear the tidal swell breaking heavily on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 37]: The lights of the _ Kansas _ , fully three miles away , could only tell them that they were in the neighborhood of the place where Courtenay had last been seen in this identical boat .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 69]: The least divergence from the line given by the position of the ship meant a difference of hundreds of yards at such a distance , and there was an ominous lightening of the gloom , accompanied by a dimming of the stars , when Gray hit on the idea that the powerful current had probably carried them a good deal southward of the point they were aiming at .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 23]: He suggested that they should boldly pull a quarter of a mile or so against the tide and then try their luck .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 52]: Their progress , of course , became slower than ever , and Elsie began to despair that they would ever find the mouth of the stream which ran through the cleft in the hill , when she suddenly saw the luminous crescents which heralded the sunrise over the inner mountain range .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 17]: They could not be visible unless there was a break in the cliffs in that locality .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 43]: `` Pull in now , '' she whispered tensely , and , with a little further effort , they found that the boat was traveling not against but with the tide , which was flooding a small offshoot of the main estuary .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 8]: Precaution became not only useless but impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 6]: They were all worn out .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 35]: Nothing but the most inflexible determination on the part of Elsie and Gray , eked out by a certain desponding fear of both of them felt by Suarez , had sustained them thus far .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 32]: They went on , and on ; they swept rapidly into the jaws of a precipitous defile , the lofty crests on either hand coming momentarily nearer against the brightening sky .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 39]: It did not seem credible that this sheer cut through the heart of a gigantic hill could continue for more than a few yards , nor that anything save a bird could find foothold on its steep sides .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 22]: Yet the current flowed smoothly onwards , through a wealth of vegetation which clung precariously to every ledge and natural escarpment .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 15]: Joey , embarrassed by his gag , nevertheless managed to emit a warning growl .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 31]: Then the boat crashed into a canoe , and a hoarse yell of alarm came from beneath the lowermost trees , whose dense foliage flung a pall over the water .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 7]: Gray was seized with an inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 24]: He grasped the canoe as it bumped along the gunwale , and held it down on one side until it filled and sank .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 31]: He sent another , and yet a third , guzzling to the bottom before the outburst of raucous cries from both banks showed there were Indians here in some force .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 44]: Stones , too , began to hum around them ; some struck the boat , but the greater number whizzed unpleasantly close to the heads of the two men and the girl , proving conclusively that they were visible to the unseen enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 9]: Gray whipped forth the revolver and fired twice .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 17]: The second time a shriek of pain told that he had hit one of their assailants .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 13]: The two reports made a deafening din in that place of echoes .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 44]: They appeared to stir the Indians into a perfect frenzy , and it was evident , by the sounds , that the islanders had not much liberty of movement on the narrow strips of land they occupied on both sides of the gorge .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 8]: Elsie caught some significant splashing behind her .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 12]: `` They are swimming towards the canoes , '' she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 36]: Telling Suarez to pull for all he was worth , Gray , clambered to the stern of the boat and emptied the revolver at what he took to be the black heads of the swimmers .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 3]: `` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 20]: Load it again , '' he said , and Elsie obeyed with a nimbleness and certainty that were amazing .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 20]: The American fired three more shots before he was satisfied that the canoes were untenanted and not cut adrift .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 25]: They were now leaving the pandemonium behind , and Elsie , bethinking herself of the dog , freed him from that most objectionable muzzle .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 49]: Joey forthwith awoke the welkin with his uproar , but , although the girl strained her ears for some answering hail , she could detect nothing beyond the bawling of Indians at each other across the narrow creek , and the repeated echoes of the dog 's barking .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 19]: About this time Gray began to suspect that the tide was bearing them onward at a remarkable rate .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 30]: In the somber depths of the cleft or cañon it was difficult to discern stationary objects clearly enough to obtain a means of estimating the pace of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 17]: But the rapid dying down of the hubbub among the savages gave him cause to think .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 7]: He asked Suarez to cease pulling .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 28]: The canoes behind came crowding in on the more solid boat , and an oar held out until it encountered some invisible branch was rudely swept aside .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 22]: In a word , they were being impelled towards an unknown destination with the silence and gathering speed of a mill-race .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 38]: An expert engineer , though his work may have little to do with sea or river , can not fail to accumulate a store of theoretical knowledge as to the properties and limitations of water in motion .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 24]: Gray knew that the quickened impulse of the stream arose from the tidal force exerted in a channel which gradually lessened its width .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 8]: The boat was traveling at sea level .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 69]: Therefore , there could be neither rapids nor cataract in front ; but the steady rush of the current , now plainly audible , could not be accounted for simply by the effort of the tide to gain a passage through a mere by-way , as the boat was now nearly half a mile from the estuary , and the velocity of the current was increasing each moment .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 24]: `` We must endeavor to reach the bank and hold on to the branches of a tree , '' he shouted in Spanish .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 20]: `` Down with your heads until the boat strikes , and then try to lay hold of something . ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 7]: There was no time for explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 15]: He seized an oar ; a powerful stroke swung the boat 's nose round .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 9]: By chance , he used the starboard oar .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 15]: All unknowing he spun a coin for life or death , and life won .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 13]: They crashed through some drooping foliage and ran into a crumbling bank .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 10]: Gray unshipped the oar and jammed it straight down .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 21]: It stuck between stones at a depth of three feet , and the life-boat was held fast for the time .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 13]: The canoes hurtled against each other , but were swept aside instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 14]: When the noise ceased , they plainly heard the swirl of the water .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 17]: In their new environment , it had the uncanny and sinister hiss of some monstrous snake .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 5]: `` Everybody happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 4]: Gray demanded coolly .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 13]: `` I am clinging to a tree trunk , '' answered Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 5]: `` Bully for you .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 8]: Make fast with a piece of rope .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 19]: But be careful to provide a slip-knot , in case we have to sheer off in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 6]: Can you manage that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 5]: `` Quite well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 15]: Elsie was fully aware that the leadership of the expedition had gone from her .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 11]: She was not sorry ; it was in strong hands .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 16]: Suarez , too , secured a stout branch , and passed a rope around it .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 5]: `` Now , silence !
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 4]: and listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 3]: said Gray .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 15]: They soon detected a curiously subdued clamor from the inner recesses of the cleft .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 29]: At first almost indistinguishable , it gradually assumed the peculiar attribute of immense volumes of distant sound , and filled the ear to the exclusion of all else .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 34]: It was like nothing any of them had heard before ; now it recalled the roar of a mighty waterfall , and again its strange melody brought memories of a river in flood .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 12]: But the dominant note was the grinding noise of innumerable mill-stones .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 5]: It cowed them all .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 6]: Even the dog was afraid .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 19]: `` Guess we tied up just in time , '' exclaimed Gray , feeling the need of speech .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 6]: A little sob answered him .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 12]: Elsie was beginning to admit the sheer hopelessness of her undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 13]: `` Now , cheer up , Miss Maxwell , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 16]: `` All the water that is going in must come out by the same road .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 17]: At the worst , we can skate back the way we came and take our chance .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 49]: But it will soon be broad daylight , and I 'll answer for it that if Captain Courtenay is yet alive he is not between us and the mouth of the inlet , or he would have contrived some sort of racket to let us know his whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 22]: Now , I propose that our friend in the bows be asked to shin up the cliff and prospect a bit .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 11]: He ought to know how to crawl through this undergrowth .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 13]: Fifty feet higher he will be able to see some distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 4]: Elsie agreed miserably .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 12]: She was crushed by the immensity of the difficulties confronting them .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 23]: Expedients which looked simple beforehand were found lamentably deficient to cope with wild nature on the stupendous scale of this gloomy land .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 36]: Suarez , too , was very reluctant to leave the boat , but the American adopted a short cut in the argument , offering him the alternative of climbing ashore or of being thrown overboard .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 15]: So the Argentine adopted the less hazardous method , and climbed to the bank .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 20]: A splash , and a scramble , and a slight exclamation from Elsie told that the dog had followed .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 13]: Soon the swish of leaves and the crackling of rotten wood ceased .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 23]: Suarez might be out of earshot or merely hiding for a time , intending to return with news of an impassable precipice .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 13]: There was a crumb of comfort in the absence of the terrier .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 13]: Joey would either go on or come back to them at once .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 11]: Gray felt that the girl was too heart-broken to talk .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 43]: He listened to the rhythmical chorus of that witches ' cauldron in the heart of the defile , and watched the gray light slowly etching a path through the trees , until it touched the fast-running water with a shimmer of silver .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 34]: Neither of them knew how long they remained there ; at last , a straining and creaking of the boat warned them that the water level was rising and the ropes needed readjusting .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 32]: It was now possible to see that Elsie had made fast to a fallen tree ; its branches were locked among the gnarled roots of the lowermost growth above high-water mark .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 23]: Already there was a distinct lessening in the pace of the current , and Gray fancied that the distant rumble was softer .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 24]: It would not be many minutes before the neighboring rocks were covered ; high tide , he knew , was at 3.15 A.M. .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 16]: He forebore to look at his watch , lest the girl should note his action .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 9]: That would imply the utter abandonment of hope .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 30]: It might be that his mind was too taken up with the weird influences of the hour , or that Elsie 's senses were strung to a superhuman pitch .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 19]: Be that as it may , it was she who sprang to her feet all a-quiver with agitation .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 6]: `` Do you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 20]: she whispered , and her hand clutched Gray 's shoulder with an energy which set his heart beating high .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 5]: He did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 16]: He had heard no unusual sound , but he was not without faith in her .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 4]: she panted again .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 6]: `` Some one is hailing .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 7]: Some one cried ` Elsie . '
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 7]: I am sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 18]: `` Guess you 'd better toot ` Arthur ' on the off chance , '' said Gray .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 15]: Almost the last thing she remembered was the sound of her own wild scream .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 16]: There came back to her a stronger shout , and the bark of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 46]: She had a blurred consciousness of a whole troupe of men scrambling down the choked ravine , of glad questions and joyous answers , of a delirious dog leaping on board and yelping staccato assurances that everything was all right in a most wonderful world .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 30]: Then she found herself in Courtenay 's arms , and heard him say in a rapture of delight : `` I owe my life to you , dear heart .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 7]: That is the wonder of it .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 12]: No need to tell me you ran away from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 3]: I know .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 15]: One kiss , Elsie ; then full speed ahead for the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 9]: By the Lord , to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 3]: You here !
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 8]: At the very gate of the Inferno !
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 6]: Well , one more kiss !
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 15]: Yes , it is I , none other , and fit as a fiddle .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 5]: Never got a scratch .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 12]: There , now ; I really must see to the crew .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 12]: We must be ready for the turn of the tide . ''
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 22]: CHAPTER XIX WHEREIN THE KANSAS RESUMES HER VOYAGE The events of the next hour were shadowy as the dawn to Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 33]: She knew that her lover placed men in each of the canoes , that the life-boat itself was crowded , and that it began the seaward journey after the others had started .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 31]: She followed his explanation that if one of the lighter craft got into difficulties at the Indian barrier , the big , heavy boat would be able to extricate it .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 8]: But she feared neither Indians nor sea .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 17]: Had Courtenay proposed to sail away into the Pacific she would have listened with placid approval .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 9]: She was by his side ; that sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 12]: For the rest , they lived in the midst of adventures .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 28]: What did it matter if they were called on to run the gauntlet of one more ambuscade -- or a dozen , if it came to that ?
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 25]: But they sped out of the twilight into the morning glory of the open bay , and never a savage hoot disturbed the echoes .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 67]: Some of the Alaculofs had dragged a couple of canoes from beneath the trees and raced off toward the village ; others had followed a coast path known only to them , while , if there were watchers by the side of that mysterious river which flowed both ways with the tide , they kept a silent vigil , awed by the force arrayed against them .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 49]: As the life-boat emerged into the estuary under the vigorous sweep of six ash blades , Elsie 's wondering glance rested on the brown plumpness of a three-quarters naked girl who was gazing at Suarez with wistful , glistening eyes , much as Joey was regarding his master .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 24]: In the intense , penetrating light of sunrise , the bedaubed and skin-clothed Argentine was the most unlovely object that ever captivated woman .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 19]: Yet he satisfied the soul of this Fuegian maid , so what more was there to be said ?
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 26]: Courtenay caught the happy little sigh , half laugh , half sob , with which Elsie announced her discovery of the idyl in the canoe .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 14]: `` We owe a lot to that young person , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 17]: `` None of us could make out a word she uttered when first we saw her .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 53]: She loses what small amount of Spanish she can speak when she becomes excited , and it was sheer good fortune that some of the crew were with her when she swung herself down the side of the cliff to warn us of our danger ; otherwise she might have been shot .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 10]: I suppose Suarez told you what to expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 24]: `` You might as well be talking Alaculof yourself for all I can follow what you are saying , '' murmured Elsie happily .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 13]: `` Then how did _ you _ know where to tie up ?
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 7]: _ We _ went too far .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 13]: We lost the boat that way , and my gun as well .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 29]: We had to jump for it , and it was only the boat 's stout timbers which enabled her to live through that boiling pot in the volcano .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 13]: The native girl said that no Indian-built craft ever came back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 4]: `` Excellent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 3]: said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 15]: `` When we reach the ship I shall write down everything you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 10]: After a time I shall begin to understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 41]: Whereupon , Courtenay took thought , and explained that the channel which flowed through that amazing cut in the cliff led to the crater of an extinct volcano , into which the sea poured twenty feet of water each tide .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 42]: An almost everlasting maelstrom raged within , as the water entered by a side-long channel , and sent a whirlpool spinning with the hands of the clock until the enormous cistern was full , and against them until it was empty .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 36]: The sailors had taken refuge on a wide , sulphur-coated ledge high above the vortex , and the presence of several skeletons showed that many an unfortunate had sought a last shelter there against pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 24]: Every Alaculof knew of this retreat , but few dared approach it , as the roar of the water far below appalled them .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 16]: There was only one path ; when the hunters closed that their prey was safe .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 9]: The alternative to capture was death by starvation .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 32]: The Chileans , and he himself during the past fourteen hours , had subsisted on a bag of dried berries stolen by the girl when she first led the sailors thither .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 16]: `` Did n't you see how eager we all were to search the lockers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 22]: `` But the rascals had cleared every scrap when the boat fell into their hands again with the falling tide . ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 6]: She nestled close to him .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 9]: `` I saw nothing , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 24]: `` My mind held but one thought -- that you were alive , though , indeed , I was mourning you as dead .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 9]: But now I am restored to my senses .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 8]: I think I can grasp what happened .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 6]: Did Joey find you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 13]: You can guess my bewilderment when he sprang on top of me .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 16]: I was lying down ; I heard our sentries shouting , but paid no heed .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 16]: As a matter of fact , Elsie , I , too , had abandoned hope .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 8]: I could see no chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 3]: Great Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 9]: To think of your coming to my rescue !
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 7]: What made you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 5]: `` Please go on .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 4]: Tell me all .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 8]: You shall hear my story afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 17]: `` Well , I jumped up , and Joey nearly fell into the crater with delight .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 12]: I was just in time to save Suarez from being shot .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 16]: Luckily he was a long way behind the dog , and I recognized his make-up .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 17]: The guard , who belonged to the original lot , naturally thought he was an Indian .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 18]: And you ought to have seen that blessed girl skipping around when she set eyes on him .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 22]: We must give her money enough to fix her up as his wife if the _ Kansas _ gets off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 15]: `` If -- '' There was a world of belief in that one word .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 13]: Could any one doubt the ultimate hap of that thrice fortunate ship ?
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 12]: Had not Mr. Boyle said her captain was a lucky man ?
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 56]: Elsie laughed aloud in her joy , for the queer notion occurred to her that her grumpy friend would surely have some remarkable story of the one-legged skipper of the _ Flower of the Ocean _ brig , wherewith to point the moral and adorn the tale of the _ Kansas _ and her commander .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 32]: Though Courtenay did not allow ten seconds to pass without a glance at the charming face by his side , he , nevertheless , had a sharp eye for events elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 40]: He saw smoke rising from the funnel of the ship ; a line of flags dancing from the foremast told him that Boyle had discovered them as soon as they were clear of the deep shadow of Guanaco Hill .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 9]: But there were anxious moments yet in store .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 10]: A fleet of canoes put off from Otter Creek .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 13]: There was every prospect of a fight before they reached their fortress .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 22]: They had a long two miles to travel , and the Indians could attack them ere they covered half the distance .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 14]: Gray and Tollemache were sitting together in the fore part of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 37]: When they had met in the cañon they had merely exchanged a hearty grip , and Gray 's inquiry if his friend was O.K. had elicited the information that his general state was `` Fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 45]: But the sight of the sparkling bay had unlocked even the Englishman 's lips , for he was telling his friend some of the adventures of the previous afternoon , when he viewed the black dots darting forth from behind Point _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 10]: `` Here they come again , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 9]: `` I never have seen such persistent rotters .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 10]: And this time we 're in a fix . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 46]: A long blare from the ship 's siren thrilled their hearts , but the excitement became frantic when three short , sharp blasts followed , and every sailor knew that the chief officer had signalled : `` My engines are going full speed astern . ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 15]: That was a pardonable exaggeration , but the _ Kansas _ was certainly moving .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 12]: They could see the white foam churned up by her propeller .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 28]: With one accord they cheered madly , and the oars , double-handed now , tore the life-boat onward at a pace which outstripped even the shallow canoes .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 8]: Then the Indians did a wise thing .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 24]: They spared many of their own lives , and , perchance others of greater value to the world , by ceasing to paddle .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 13]: The unlooked-for interference of the great vessel was too much for them .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 45]: They merely stared and cackled in amaze , while the small flotilla dashed towards the towering black hull , and Boyle lowered the gangway in readiness to receive the captain , his bride elect , and a good half of the passengers and crew .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 12]: Courtenay lost not an instant of favoring tide and fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 26]: When Boyle told him that Walker could work the engines under easy steam , he dashed up to the bridge three steps at a time .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 44]: With his hand on the telegraph , he superintended the hoisting on board of the life-boat and two of the canoes , which he meant to carry away as trophies -- be sure that Elsie 's own special craft was one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 46]: Meanwhile , Boyle saw to the safe stowing in the remaining canoes of the wounded Indians in the fore cabin , and a few furnace bars attached to a rope anchored them in mid channel , whence their friends could bring them to shore later .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 44]: At last , the captain of the _ Kansas _ had the supreme satisfaction of hearing the clang of the electric bell in the engine-room as he put the telegraph lever successively to `` Stand By , '' and `` Slow Ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 27]: Gradually the ship crept north , gaining way as the engines increased their stroke and the full body of the ebb tide made its volume felt .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 23]: Round swung the _ Kansas _ to the west , just as the sun cleared the highest peak of the unknown mountains .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 7]: Courtenay had not forgotten his bearings .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 16]: Although he had men using the lead constantly , he did not need their help .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 67]: Once clear of the reefs which he had seen when the vessel first ran into the inlet , he made straight for the pillar rock , and rather raised the hair of the man at the wheel , not to mention most of the people on deck , by the nearness of his approach to that solitary buoy set in the midst of a broken sea .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 23]: How good it was to feel the steady thrust of the pistons , the long roll of the ship over the swell !
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 61]: And then , when Elsie brought him his breakfast , and stood by his side as he watched the set of the tide with unwavering eyes , what a joy that was , to listen to her story of the night 's wanderings , and to know that , with God 's help , their Odyssey was nearing its end !
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 50]: For every sailor is a fatalist , and in the unwritten code of the sea the law runs that once a ship has undergone her supreme trial she has the freedom of the great highway for that voyage , though she girdle the earth ere the dock gates open .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 45]: But best of all was it to hear Elsie tell how Dr. Christobal had handed her a bulky packet , in which she found Courtenay 's words of farewell , together with those wonderful letters which fate had held back from her twice already .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 52]: They were only glowing epistles from the hundreds of passengers on the _ Florida _ , but six of them were proposals from enthusiastic ladies , all well dowered , and eager to give their charms and their cash to the safe keeping of the man who had saved their lives .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 28]: It was with reference to some joking comment by Courtenay on these missives that his sister wrote to congratulate him on having escaped matrimony under such conditions .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 22]: Elsie , brimful of high spirits , amused herself by teasing him with nice phrases culled from each of the six .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 12]: Long before noon the _ Kansas _ cleared White Horse Island .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 14]: There was a ticklish hour while Courtenay and Boyle looked for the shoal .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 31]: When its long , low sandspit was revealed by the falling tide , the ship took thought of her agony there , and traversed those treacherous waters with due reverence .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 30]: Thenceforth , the run was due south until eight bells , when , for the second time within a fortnight , the captain set the course `` South-40-East . ''
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 43]: A stiff breeze blowing from the south-west , and heavy clouds rolling up over the horizon , showed that the land of storms was repenting the phenomenal frivolity which had let it bask in sunshine for an unbroken spell of ten days .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 20]: But the gale which whistled into Good Hope Inlet that night carried with it no disabled and blood-stained ship .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 80]: Mr. Malcolm , who got his diminished squad of stewards in hand as though the vessel had quitted port that day , served dinner promptly at two bells in the second dog watch -- by which no allusion is intended to an animal already gorged to repletion -- and wore a proper professional air of annoyance because everybody was late , owing to the interesting fact that the half-minute fixed dashing light on Evangelistas Island had just been sighted .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 17]: Elsie noted that Count Edouard de Poincilit came with the rest , and sat beside Isobel .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 13]: Courtenay put in an appearance later to partake of a hasty meal .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 36]: He gave monsieur a black look , but , of course , catching Elsie 's eye instantly , he meekly sat down and said nothing -- nothing , that is , of an unpleasant nature .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 22]: All good ladies will recognize such behavior as one of the points of a man likely to become a model husband .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 16]: Dr. Christobal and Gray were in great form , while Tollemache actually told a story .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 50]: When the captain sent Boyle down from the bridge , Elsie made Tollemache repeat it -- a simple yarn , detailing an all-night search for a Devonshire village , which he could not find because some rotter had deemed it funny to turn a sign-post the wrong way round .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 11]: `` Huh , that 's odd , '' said Boyle .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 37]: `` Reminds me of a thing that happened to a friend of mine , skipper of the _ Flower of the Ocean _ brig. Brown his name was , an ' he had a wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 28]: The day his son an ' heir was born , he dropped into a gin-mill to celebrate , an ' his stump stuck in a rope mat .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 33]: He swore a bit , but he chanced to see on one of the half doors the name ` Nosmo , ' an ' , on the other , ` King . '
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 31]: ` Dash me , ' says he , ' them 's two fine names for the kid -- Nosmo King Brown ' -- a bit of all right , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 10]: So he goes home an ' tells the missus .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 20]: After the christenin ' , he took a pal or two round to the same bar to stand treat .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 27]: That time the two halves of the door were closed , an ' any ass could see that the letters stood for ` No Smoking . '
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 19]: Well , the other fellows told me his language was so sultry that his prop caught fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 10]: So all was well with the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 30]: * * * * * * Crawling quietly into the Straits of Magellan at daybreak , the ship put forth her best efforts in the run through the narrows .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 23]: Passing Cape San Isidro , she signalled her name , and it was easy to see the commotion created by her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 10]: The real furore began when she approached Sandy Point .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 41]: A steam launch puffed off hastily from the side of a Chilean warship , and the commander brought the news that he had been sent specially from Coronel to search the western coast line thoroughly for the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 39]: He was about to return that day , to report his failure to discover any trace of the missing vessel , and he listened in amaze while Christobal gave him a succinct history of the ship 's doings .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 30]: At the end , Courtenay presented him with a photograph of Elsie 's chart , to which many additions had been made by her under her lover 's directions .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 47]: The position of the shoal , and of Pillar Rock , together with the set of the tidal current , were clearly shown , and it is probable that Good Hope Inlet , notwithstanding its dangerous approach , will be thoroughly surveyed one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 26]: Then , perhaps , more may be heard of those lumps of silver and copper ore which the savages hurled at the _ Kansas _ .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 18]: The cruiser hurried away , under forced draft , to report from Coronel , the nearest cable-station .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 21]: Thence she would go to Valparaiso , so she carried a sheaf of letters , and one passenger , Frascuelo .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 31]: Finding that he could not execute the needed repairs at Sandy Point , Courtenay decided to make for Montevideo , where he would be in telegraphic communication with Mr. Baring .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 16]: He was fortunate in finding a shipwrecked crew on shore , awaiting transport to England .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 25]: He secured a full complement of officers and engineers , and the _ Kansas _ reached the chief port of Uruguay without any difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 8]: A sack-load of telegrams awaited the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 27]: The Chilean man-of-war put into Valparaiso , after calling at Coronel , nearly three days before the _ Kansas _ dropped anchor on the east coast .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 16]: Hence , there was time for things to happen , and they seized the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 50]: The copper market had turned itself inside out ; the firm of Baring , Thompson , Miguel & Co. had rebounded from comparative ruin to a stronger financial state than ever , and Señor Pedro Ventana , after shooting a man named José Anacleto , had considerately shot himself .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 29]: Evidently , Frascuelo lost no time when he went ashore ; Mr. Baring , too , reported that the dynamite wrapper had been traced to Ventana 's possession .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 31]: When Isobel Baring heard this final item she fainted so badly that Dr. Christobal thought it advisable she should be taken to a hotel while the ship remained in port .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 23]: But she vetoed this proposal determinedly when she recovered her senses , and straightway confessed to Elsie that Ventana was her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 16]: She had foolishly agreed to marry him privately , and Anacleto had witnessed the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 27]: Within a month , she regretted her choice ; there were quarrels , and threats ; ultimately , an agreement was made that they should separate .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 9]: Her father knew and approved of the arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 44]: He could not afford to break openly with Ventana , and it must have been a dreadful shock to him when he learned that the scoundrel had plotted not only to destroy the ship but to murder his wife at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 26]: `` So you see , '' she added with a wan smile , `` I did not give serious thought to your troubles , Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 12]: Ventana could never have married you while I was alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 5]: Elsie 's cheeks reddened .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 16]: `` I never told you he asked me to marry him , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 13]: `` It would have been just the same had he done so .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 9]: As it was , I feared the man .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 10]: Now you know why I ran away from Chile .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 14]: If I permitted another impression to prevail , I acted for the best .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 15]: But the unhappy man is dead ; let us endeavor to forget him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 16]: `` His memory haunts me with an enduring curse , '' cried Isobel , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 24]: `` Among my papers I had some letters of his , the marriage certificate , and his written promise not to molest me .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 24]: On that awful night when the ship was disabled , I went to my cabin and secured them , or thought I did .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 41]: At any rate , I could not find them when we landed on White Horse Island , and , from hints dropped by that wretched little adventurer , de Poincilit , I feel sure they have fallen into his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 19]: Believe me , Elsie , I was half mad when I helped him to steal the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 5]: `` Steal the boat !
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 4]: What boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 9]: `` Has not Captain Courtenay told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 6]: `` Not a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 9]: `` Ah , he is a true gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 4]: But you forget .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 17]: You heard what he said to de Poincilit before he went to the Guanaco cañon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 8]: `` Yes ; I did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 20]: Oh , my poor Isobel , how you must have suffered , while I have been so happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 19]: `` If only I could recover my papers -- '' `` May I ask Arthur to help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 9]: `` He knows the worst of me already .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 12]: One more shameful disclosure can not add to my degradation . ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 10]: `` Isobel , how little you know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 8]: Thus spoke Elsie , after fourteen days .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 9]: Truly there is much enlightenment in a hug !
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 28]: Monsieur le Comte Edouard de Poincilit , to his intense chagrin , found that a ship 's captain has far-reaching powers when he chooses to exert them .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 62]: Rather than enter a Montevidean jail , where people have died suddenly of nasty fevers , he not only restored the missing documents but submitted to a close scrutiny of his own belongings , which resulted in the pleasing discovery that he was not a French count , but a denizen of Martinique -- most probably a defaulting valet or clerk .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 9]: No one troubled to inquire further about him .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 11]: His passage money was refunded and he was bundled ashore .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 49]: Courtenay 's view was that he had heard , by some means , of Isobel 's intended departure from Valparaiso , and deemed it a good chance of winning her approval of his countship , seeing that such titles are not subjected to serious investigation in South America .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 21]: Suarez took his Fuegian bride up country , where Mr. Baring and Dr. Christobal established them on a small ranch .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 9]: Isobel renewed her voyage somewhat chastened in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 12]: But her volatile nature soon survived the shocks it had received .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 45]: By the time the _ Kansas _ put her ashore at Tilbury , to be clasped in the arms of a timid and tearful aunt , she was ready as ever for the campaign of glory she had mapped out in London and Paris .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 8]: And she was a success , too .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 33]: Her father 's victory over the copper ring , her own adventures , which lost nothing in the telling , and her vivacious self-confidence , carried her into society with a whirl .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 11]: Recently , her engagement to an impecunious peer was announced .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 32]: * * * * * * Captain Courtenay , R.N. , and his wife are not such distinguished personages , but their romance had a sequel worthy of its unusual beginning .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 14]: They were married quietly a week after the _ Kansas _ reached London .
