Parsing [sent. 1 len. 56]: THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN I ENTER CHORUS A dry snow had fallen steadily throughout the still night , so that when a cold , upper wind cleared the sky gloriously in the morning the incongruous Indiana town shone in a white harmony -- roof , ledge , and earth as evenly covered as by moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 41]: There was no thaw ; only where the line of factories followed the big bend of the frozen river , their distant chimneys like exclamation points on a blank page , was there a first threat against the supreme whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 45]: The wind passed quickly and on high ; the shouting of the school-children had ceased at nine o'clock with pitiful suddenness ; no sleigh-bells laughed out on the air ; and the muffling of the thoroughfares wrought an unaccustomed peace like that of Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 26]: This was the phenomenon which afforded the opening of the morning debate of the sages in the wide windows of the `` National House . ''
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 95]: Only such unfortunates as have so far failed to visit Canaan do not know that the `` National House '' is on the Main Street side of the Court-house Square , and has the advantage of being within two minutes ' walk of the railroad station , which is in plain sight of the windows -- an inestimable benefit to the conversation of the aged men who occupied these windows on this white morning , even as they were wont in summer to hold against all comers the cane-seated chairs on the pavement outside .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 37]: Thence , as trains came and went , they commanded the city gates , and , seeking motives and adding to the stock of history , narrowly observed and examined into all who entered or departed .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 6]: Their habit was not singular .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 86]: He who would foolishly tax the sages of Canaan with a bucolic light-mindedness must first walk in Piccadilly in early June , stroll down the Corso in Rome before Ash Wednesday , or regard those windows of Fifth Avenue whose curtains are withdrawn of a winter Sunday ; for in each of these great streets , wherever the windows , not of trade , are widest , his eyes must behold wise men , like to those of Canaan , executing always their same purpose .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 55]: The difference is in favor of Canaan ; the `` National House '' was the club , but the perusal of traveller or passer by was here only the spume blown before a stately ship of thought ; and you might hear the sages comparing the Koran with the speeches of Robert J. Ingersoll .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 94]: In the days of board sidewalks , `` mail-time '' had meant a precise moment for Canaan , and even now , many years after the first postman , it remained somewhat definite to the aged men ; for , out of deference to a pleasant , olden custom , and perhaps partly for an excuse to `` get down to the hotel '' -LRB- which was not altogether in favor with the elderly ladies -RRB- , most of them retained their antique boxes in the post-office , happily in the next building .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 49]: In this connection it may be written that a subscription clerk in the office of the Chicago Daily Standard , having noted a single subscriber from Canaan , was , a fortnight later , pleased to receive , by one mail , nine subscriptions from that promising town .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 20]: If one brought nine others in a fortnight , thought he , what would nine bring in a month ?
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 12]: Amazingly , they brought nothing , and the rest was silence .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 16]: Here was a matter of intricate diplomacy never to come within that youth his ken .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 90]: The morning voyage to the post-office , long mocked as a fable and screen by the families of the sages , had grown so difficult to accomplish for one of them , Colonel Flitcroft -LRB- Colonel in the war with Mexico -RRB- , that he had been put to it , indeed , to foot the firing-line against his wife -LRB- a lady of celebrated determination and hale-voiced at seventy -RRB- , and to defend the rental of a box which had sheltered but three missives in four years .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 35]: Desperation is often inspiration ; the Colonel brilliantly subscribed for the Standard , forgetting to give his house address , and it took the others just thirteen days to wring his secret from him .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 7]: Then the Standard served for all .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 39]: Mail-time had come to mean that bright hour when they all got their feet on the brass rod which protected the sills of the two big windows , with the steam-radiators sizzling like kettles against the side wall .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 79]: Mr. Jonas Tabor , who had sold his hardware business magnificently -LRB- not magnificently for his nephew , the purchaser -RRB- some ten years before , was usually , in spite of the fact that he remained a bachelor at seventy-nine , the last to settle down with the others , though often the first to reach the hotel , which he always entered by a side door , because he did not believe in the treating system .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 44]: And it was Mr. Eskew Arp , only seventy-five , but already a thoroughly capable cynic , who , almost invariably `` opened the argument , '' and it was he who discovered the sinister intention behind the weather of this particular morning .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 63]: Mr. Arp had not begun life so sourly : as a youth he had been proud of his given name , which had come to him through his mother 's family , who had made it honorable , but many years of explanations that Eskew did not indicate his initials had lowered his opinion of the intelligence and morality of the race .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 38]: The malevolence of his voice and manner this morning , therefore , when he shook his finger at the town beyond the windows , and exclaimed , with a bitter laugh , `` Look at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 7]: was no surprise to his companions .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 6]: `` Jest look at it !
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: I tell you the devil is mighty smart .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 4]: Mighty smart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 28]: Through custom it was the duty of Squire Buckalew -LRB- Justice of the Peace in ' 59 -RRB- to be the first to take up Mr. Arp .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 8]: The others looked to him for it .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 19]: Therefore , he asked , sharply : `` What 's the devil got to do with snow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 14]: `` Everything to do with it , sir , '' Mr. Arp retorted .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 14]: `` It 's plain as day to anybody with eyes and sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 24]: `` Then I wish you 'd p ` int it out , '' said Buckalew , `` if you 've got either . ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 40]: `` By the Almighty , Squire '' -- Mr. Arp turned in his chair with sudden heat -- `` if I 'd lived as long as you -- '' `` You have , '' interrupted the other , stung .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 6]: `` Twelve years ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 56]: `` If I 'd lived as long as you , '' Mr. Arp repeated , unwincingly , in a louder voice , `` and had follered Satan 's trail as long as you have , and yet could n't recognize it when I see it , I 'd git converted and vote Prohibitionist . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 19]: _ I _ do n't see it , '' interjected Uncle Joe Davey , in his querulous voice .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 11]: -LRB- He was the patriarch of them all . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 13]: _ I _ ca n't find no cloven-hoof-prints in the snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 8]: `` All over it , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 4]: cried the cynic .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 5]: `` All over it !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 7]: Old Satan loves tricks like this .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 28]: Here 's a town that 's jest one squirmin ' mass of lies and envy and vice and wickedness and corruption -- '' `` Hold on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 4]: exclaimed Colonel Flitcroft .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 12]: `` That 's a slander upon our hearths and our government .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 26]: Why , when I was in the Council -- '' `` It was n't a bit worse then , '' Mr. Arp returned , unreasonably .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 10]: `` Jest you look how the devil fools us .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 103]: He drops down this here virgin mantle on Canaan and makes it look as good as you pretend you think it is : as good as the Sunday-school room of a country church -- though THAT '' -- he went off on a tangent , venomously -- `` is generally only another whited sepulchre , and the superintendent 's mighty apt to have a bottle of whiskey hid behind the organ , and -- '' `` Look here , Eskew , '' said Jonas Tabor , `` that 's got nothin ' to do with -- '' `` Why ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 4]: Answer me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 15]: cried Mr. Arp , continuing , without pause : `` Why ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 9]: Ca n't you wait till I git through ?
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 46]: You listen to me , and when I 'm ready I 'll listen to -- '' `` See here , '' began the Colonel , making himself heard over three others , `` I want to ask you -- '' `` No , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 11]: Mr. Arp pounded the floor irascibly with his hickory stick .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 8]: `` Do n't you ask me anything !
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 24]: How can you tell that I 'm not going to answer your question without your asking it , till I 've got through ?
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 4]: You listen first .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 77]: I say , here 's a town of nearly thirty thousand inhabitants , every last one of 'em -- men , women , and children -- selfish and cowardly and sinful , if you could see their innermost natures ; a town of the ugliest and worst built houses in the world , and governed by a lot of saloon-keepers -- though I hope it 'll never git down to where the ministers can run it .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 23]: And the devil comes along , and in one night -- why , all you got to do is LOOK at it !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 13]: You 'd think we need n't ever trouble to make it better .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 35]: That 's what the devil wants us to do -- wants us to rest easy about it , and paints it up to look like a heaven of peace and purity and sanctified spirits .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 23]: Snowfall like this would of made Lot turn the angel out-of-doors and say that the old home was good enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 36]: Gomorrah would of looked like a Puritan village -- though I 'll bet my last dollar that there was a lot , and a WHOLE lot , that 's never been told about Puritan villages .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 11]: A lot that -- '' `` WHAT never was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 21]: interrupted Mr. Peter Bradbury , whose granddaughter had lately announced her discovery that the Bradburys were descended from Miles Standish .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 10]: `` What was n't told about Puritan villages ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 7]: `` Ca n't you wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 9]: Mr. Arp 's accents were those of pain .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 15]: `` Have n't I got ANY right to present my side of the case ?
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 12]: Ai n't we restrained enough to allow of free speech here ?
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 22]: How can we ever git anywhere in an argument like this , unless we let one man talk at a time ?
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 18]: How -- '' `` Go on with your statement , '' said Uncle Joe Davey , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 7]: Mr. Arp 's grievance was increased .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 6]: `` Now listen to YOU !
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 8]: How many more interruptions are comin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 21]: I 'll listen to the other side , but I 've got to state mine first , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 17]: If I do n't make my point clear , what 's the use of the argument ?
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 36]: Argumentation is only the comparison of two sides of a question , and you have to see what the first side IS before you can compare it with the other one , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 8]: Are you all agreed to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 10]: `` Yes , yes , '' said the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 4]: `` Go ahead .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 10]: We wo n't interrupt until you 're through . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 38]: `` Very well , '' resumed Mr. Arp , with a fleeting expression of satisfaction , `` as I said before , I wish to -- as I said -- '' He paused , in some confusion .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 46]: `` As I said , argumentation is -- that is , I say -- '' He stopped again , utterly at sea , having talked himself so far out of his course that he was unable to recall either his sailing port or his destination .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 23]: Finally he said , feebly , to save the confession , `` Well , go on with your side of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 65]: This generosity was for a moment disconcerting ; however , the quietest of the party took up the opposition -- Roger Tabor , a very thin , old man with a clean-shaven face , almost as white as his hair , and melancholy , gentle , gray eyes , very unlike those of his brother Jonas , which were dark and sharp and button-bright .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 18]: -LRB- It was to Roger 's son that Jonas had so magnificently sold the hardware business . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 47]: Roger was known in Canaan as `` the artist '' ; there had never been another of his profession in the place , and the town knew not the word `` painter , '' except in application to the useful artisan who is subject to lead-poisoning .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 56]: There was no indication of his profession in the attire of Mr. Tabor , unless the too apparent age of his black felt hat and a neat patch at the elbow of his shiny , old brown overcoat might have been taken as symbols of the sacrifice to his muse which his life had been .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 42]: He was not a constant attendant of the conclave , and when he came it was usually to listen ; indeed , he spoke so seldom that at the sound of his voice they all turned to him with some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 21]: `` I suppose , '' he began , `` that Eskew means the devil is behind all beautiful things . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 17]: `` Ugly ones , too , '' said Mr. Arp , with a start of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 13]: `` And I wish to state -- '' `` Not now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 7]: Colonel Flitcroft turned upon him violently .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 8]: `` You 've already stated it . ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 38]: `` Then , if he is behind the ugly things , too , '' said Roger , `` we must take him either way , so let us be glad of the beauty for its own sake .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 8]: Eskew says this is a wicked town .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 9]: It may be -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 25]: He says it 's badly built ; perhaps it is ; but it does n't seem to me that it 's ugly in itself .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 17]: I do n't know what its real self is , because it wears so many aspects .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 76]: God keeps painting it all the time , and never shows me twice the same picture ; not even two snowfalls are just alike , nor the days that follow them ; no more than two misty sunsets are alike -- for the color and even the form of the town you call ugly are a matter of the season of the year and of the time of day and of the light and air .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 43]: The ugly town is like an endless gallery which you can walk through , from year-end to year-end , never seeing the same canvas twice , no matter how much you may want to -- and there 's the pathos of it .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 23]: Is n't it the same with people with the characters of all of us , just as it is with our faces ?
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 17]: No face remains the same for two successive days -- '' `` It do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 11]: Colonel Flitcroft interrupted , with an explosive and rueful incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 46]: `` Well , I 'd like to -- '' Second thoughts came to him almost immediately , and , as much out of gallantry as through discretion , fearing that he might be taken as thinking of one at home , he relapsed into silence .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 6]: Not so with the others .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 14]: It was as if a firecracker had been dropped into a sleeping poultry-yard .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 9]: Least of all could Mr. Arp contain himself .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 55]: At the top of his voice , necessarily , he agreed with Roger that faces changed , not only from day to day , and not only because of light and air and such things , but from hour to hour , and from minute to minute , through the hideous stimulus of hypocrisy .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 31]: The `` argument '' grew heated ; half a dozen tidy quarrels arose ; all the sages went at it fiercely , except Roger Tabor , who stole quietly away .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 13]: The aged men were enjoying themselves thoroughly , especially those who quarrelled .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 41]: Naturally , the frail bark of the topic which had been launched was whirled about by too many side-currents to remain long in sight , and soon became derelict , while the intellectual dolphins dove and tumbled in the depths .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 58]: At the end of twenty minutes Mr. Arp emerged upon the surface , and in his mouth was this : `` Tell me , why ai n't the Church -- why ai n't the Church and the rest of the believers in a future life lookin ' for immortality at the other end of life , too ?
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 26]: If we 're immortal , we always have been ; then why do n't they ever speculate on what we were before we were born ?
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 30]: It 's because they 're too blame selfish -- do n't care a flapdoodle about what WAS , all they want is to go on livin ' forever . ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 54]: Mr. Arp 's voice had risen to an acrid triumphancy , when it suddenly faltered , relapsed to a murmur , and then to a stricken silence , as a tall , fat man of overpowering aspect threw open the outer door near by and crossed the lobby to the clerk 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 10]: An awe fell upon the sages with this advent .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 33]: They were hushed , and after a movement in their chairs , with a strange effect of huddling , sat disconcerted and attentive , like school-boys at the entrance of the master .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 38]: The personage had a big , fat , pink face and a heavily undershot jaw , what whitish beard he wore following his double chin somewhat after the manner displayed in the portraits of Henry the Eighth .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 20]: His eyes , very bright under puffed upper lids , were intolerant and insultingly penetrating despite their small size .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 24]: Their irritability held a kind of hotness , and yet the personage exuded frost , not of the weather , all about him .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 22]: You could not imagine man or angel daring to greet this being genially -- sooner throw a kiss to Mount Pilatus !
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 49]: `` Mr. Brown , '' he said , with ponderous hostility , in a bull bass , to the clerk -- the kind of voice which would have made an express train leave the track and go round the other way -- `` do you hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 43]: `` Oh yes , Judge , '' the clerk replied , swiftly , in tones as unlike those which he used for strange transients as a collector 's voice in his ladylove 's ear is unlike that which he propels at delinquents .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 8]: `` Do you see that snow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 6]: asked the personage , threateningly .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 6]: `` Yes , Judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 7]: Mr. Brown essayed a placating smile .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 9]: `` Yes , indeed , Judge Pike . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 16]: `` Has your employer , the manager of this hotel , seen that snow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 12]: pursued the personage , with a gesture of unspeakable solemn menace .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 5]: Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 17]: `` Do you think he fully understands that I am the proprietor of this building ? ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 31]: `` Certainly , Judge , cer -- '' `` You will inform him that I do not intend to be discommoded by his negligence as I pass to my offices .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 24]: Tell him from me that unless he keeps the sidewalks in front of this hotel clear of snow I will cancel his lease .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 6]: Their present condition is outrageous .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 5]: Do you understand me ?
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 2]: Outrageous !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 5]: Do you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 18]: `` Yes , Judge , I do so , '' answered the clerk , hoarse with respect .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 13]: `` I 'll see to it this minute , Judge Pike . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 6]: `` You had better . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 31]: The personage turned himself about and began a grim progress towards the door by which he had entered , his eyes fixing themselves angrily upon the conclave at the windows .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 10]: Colonel Flitcroft essayed a smile , a faltering one .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 13]: `` Fine weather , Judge Pike , '' he said , hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 15]: There was no response of any kind ; the undershot jaw became more intolerant .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 62]: The personage made his opinion of the group disconcertingly plain , and the old boys understood that he knew them for a worthless lot of senile loafers , as great a nuisance in his building as was the snow without ; and much too evident was his unspoken threat to see that the manager cleared them out of there before long .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 25]: He nodded curtly to the only man of substance among them , Jonas Tabor , and shut the door behind him with majestic insult .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 6]: He was Canaan 's millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 67]: He was one of those dynamic creatures who leave the haunting impression of their wills behind them , like the tails of Bo-Peep 's sheep , like the evil dead men have done ; he left his intolerant image in the ether for a long time after he had gone , to confront and confound the aged men and hold them in deferential and humiliated silence .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 30]: Each of them was mysteriously lowered in his own estimation , and knew that he had been made to seem futile and foolish in the eyes of his fellows .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 59]: They were all conscious , too , that the clerk had been acutely receptive of Judge Pike 's reading of them ; that he was reviving from his own squelchedness through the later snubbing of the colonel ; also that he might further seek to recover his poise by an attack on them for cluttering up the office .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 10]: Naturally , Jonas Tabor was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 15]: `` Judge Pike 's lookin ' mighty well , '' he said , admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 19]: `` Yes , he is , '' ventured Squire Buckalew , with deference ; `` mighty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 15]: `` Yes , sir , '' echoed Peter Bradbury ; `` mighty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 27]: `` He 's a great man , '' wheezed Uncle Joe Davey ; `` a great man , Judge Martin Pike ; a great man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 21]: `` I expect he has considerable on his mind , '' said the Colonel , who had grown very red .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 12]: `` I noticed that he hardly seemed to see us . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir , '' Mr. Bradbury corroborated , with an attempt at an amused laugh .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: `` I noticed it , too .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 18]: Of course a man with all his cares and interests must git absent-minded now and then . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 11]: `` Of course he does , '' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 40]: `` A man with all his responsibilities -- '' `` Yes , that 's so , '' came a chorus of the brethren , finding comfort and reassurance as their voices and spirits began to recover from the blight .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 31]: `` There 's a party at the Judge 's to-night , '' said Mr. Bradbury -- `` kind of a ball Mamie Pike 's givin ' for the young folks .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 9]: Quite a doin 's , I hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 17]: `` That 's another thing that 's ruining Canaan , '' Mr. Arp declared , morosely .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 7]: `` These entertainments they have nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 20]: Spend all the money out of town -- band from Indianapolis , chicken salad and darkey waiters from Chicago !
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 22]: And what I want to know is , What 's this town goin ' to do about the nigger question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 6]: `` What about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 6]: asked Mr. Davey , belligerently .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 6]: `` What about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 6]: Mr. Arp mocked , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 12]: `` You better say , ` What about it ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 6]: `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 6]: maintained Mr. Davey , steadfastly .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 18]: `` I 'll bet there ai n't any less than four thousand niggers in Canaan to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 9]: Mr. Arp hammered the floor with his stick .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 17]: `` Every last one of 'em criminals , and more comin ' on every train . ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 18]: `` No such a thing , '' said Squire Buckalew , living up to his bounden duty .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 7]: `` You look down the street .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 9]: There 's the ten-forty-five comin ' in now .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 28]: I 'll bet you a straight five-cent Peek-a-Boo cigar there ai n't ary nigger on the whole train , except the sleepin ' - car porters . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 12]: `` What kind of a way to argue is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 6]: demanded Mr. Arp , hotly .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 10]: `` Bettin ' ai n't proof , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 11]: Besides , that 's the through express from the East .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 8]: I meant trains from the South . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 13]: `` You did n't say so , '' retorted Buckalew , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 14]: `` Stick to your bet , Eskew , stick to your bet . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 5]: `` My bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 5]: cried the outraged Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 7]: `` Who offered to bet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 15]: `` You did , '' replied the Squire , with perfect assurance and sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 18]: The others supported him in the heartiest spirit of on-with-the-dance , and war and joy were unconfined .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 40]: A decrepit hack or two , a couple of old-fashioned surreys , and a few `` cut-unders '' drove by , bearing the newly arrived and their valises , the hotel omnibus depositing several commercial travellers at the door .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 69]: A solitary figure came from the station on foot , and when it appeared within fair range of the window , Uncle Joe Davey , who had but hovered on the flanks of the combat , first removed his spectacles and wiped them , as though distrusting the vision they offered him , then , replacing them , scanned anew the approaching figure and uttered a smothered cry .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 6]: `` My Lord A'mighty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 5]: `` What 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 4]: Look there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 3]: They looked .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 24]: A truce came involuntarily , and they sat in paralytic silence as the figure made its stately and sensational progress along Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 8]: Not only the aged men were smitten .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 85]: Men shovelling snow from the pavements stopped suddenly in their labors ; two women , talking busily on a doorstep , were stilled and remained in frozen attitudes as it passed ; a grocer 's clerk , crossing the pavement , carrying a heavily laden basket to his delivery wagon , halted half-way as the figure came near , and then , making a pivot of his heels as it went by , behaved towards it as does the magnetic needle to the pole .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 20]: It was that of a tall gentleman , cheerfully , though somewhat with ennui , enduring his nineteenth winter .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 31]: His long and slender face he wore smiling , beneath an accurately cut plaster of dark hair cornicing his forehead , a fashion followed by many youths of that year .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 57]: This perfect bang was shown under a round black hat whose rim was so small as almost not to be there at all ; and the head was supported by a waxy-white sea-wall of collar , rising three inches above the blue billows of a puffed cravat , upon which floated a large , hollow pearl .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 50]: His ulster , sporting a big cape at the shoulders , and a tasselled hood over the cape , was of a rough Scotch cloth , patterned in faint , gray-and-white squares the size of baggage-checks , and it was so long that the skirts trailed in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 73]: His legs were lost in the accurately creased , voluminous garments that were the tailors ' canny reaction from the tight trousers with which the ` Eighties had begun : they were , in color , a palish russet , broadly striped with gray , and , in size , surpassed the milder spirit of fashion so far as they permitted a liberal knee action to take place almost without superficial effect .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 34]: Upon his feet glistened long shoes , shaped , save for the heels , like sharp racing-shells ; these were partially protected by tan-colored low gaiters with flat , shiny , brown buttons .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 105]: In one hand the youth swung a bone-handled walking-stick , perhaps an inch and a half in diameter , the other carried a yellow leather banjo-case , upon the outer side of which glittered the embossed-silver initials , `` E. B. '' He was smoking , but walked with his head up , making use , however , of a gait at that time new to Canaan , a seeming superbly irresponsible lounge , engendering much motion of the shoulders , producing an effect of carelessness combined with independence -- an effect which the innocent have been known to hail as an unconscious one .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 69]: He looked about him as he came , smilingly , with an expression of princely amusement -- as an elderly cabinet minister , say , strolling about a village where he had spent some months in his youth , a hamlet which he had then thought large and imposing , but which , being revisited after years of cosmopolitan glory , appeals to his whimsy and his pity .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 20]: The youth 's glance at the court-house unmistakably said : `` Ah , I recall that odd little box .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 31]: I thought it quite large in the days before I became what I am now , and I dare say the good townsfolk still think it an imposing structure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 23]: With everything in sight he deigned to be amused , especially with the old faces in the `` National House '' windows .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 10]: To these he waved his stick with airy graciousness .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 5]: `` My soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 4]: said Mr. Davey .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 10]: `` It seems to know some of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' agreed Mr. Arp , his voice recovered , `` and _ I _ know IT . ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 5]: `` You do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 4]: exclaimed the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 9]: `` I do , and so do you .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 18]: It 's Fanny Louden 's boy , ` Gene , come home for his Christmas holidays . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 4]: `` By George !
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 15]: you 're right , '' cried Flitcroft ; `` I recognize him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 10]: `` But what 's the matter with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 6]: asked Mr. Bradbury , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 9]: `` Has he joined some patent-medicine troupe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 9]: `` Not a bit , '' replied Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 10]: `` He went East to college last fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 11]: `` Do they MAKE the boys wear them clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 3]: persisted Bradbury .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 9]: `` Is it some kind of uniform ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 14]: `` I do n't care what it is , '' said Jonas Tabor .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 17]: `` If I was Henry Louden I would n't let him wear 'em around here . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 14]: `` Oh , you would n't , would n't you , Jonas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 8]: Mr. Arp employed the accents of sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 16]: `` I 'd like to see Henry Louden try to interfere with ` Gene Bantry .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 12]: Fanny 'd lock the old fool up in the cellar . ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 8]: The lofty vision lurched out of view .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 36]: `` I reckon , '' said the Colonel , leaning forward to see the last of it -- `` I reckon Henry Louden 's about the saddest case of abused step-father I ever saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 23]: `` It 's his own fault , '' said Mr. Arp -- `` twice not havin ' sense enough not to marry .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 11]: Him with a son of his own , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' assented the Colonel , `` marryin ' a widow with a son of her own , and that widow Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 15]: `` Was n't it just the same with her first husband -- Bantry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 14]: Mr. Davey asked , not for information , as he immediately answered himself .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 6]: `` You bet it was !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 8]: Did n't she always rule the roost ?
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 5]: Yes , she did .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 14]: She made a god of ` Gene from the day he was born .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 15]: Bantry 's house was run for him , like Louden 's is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 22]: `` And look , '' exclaimed Mr. Arp , with satisfaction , `` at the way he 's turned out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 19]: `` He ai n't turned out at all yet ; he 's too young , '' said Buckalew .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 11]: `` Besides , clothes do n't make the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 10]: `` Was n't he smokin ' a cigareet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 5]: cried Eskew , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 4]: This was final .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 21]: `` It 's a pity Henry Louden ca n't do something for his own son , '' said Mr. Bradbury .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 12]: `` Why do n't he send him away to college ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 14]: `` Fanny wo n't let him , '' chuckled Mr. Arp , malevolently .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 14]: `` Takes all their spare change to keep ` Gene there in style .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 6]: I do n't blame her .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 24]: ` Gene certainly acts the fool , but that Joe Louden is the orneriest boy I ever saw in an ornery world-full . ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 12]: `` He always was kind of misCHEEvous , '' admitted Buckalew .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 73]: `` I do n't think he 's mean , though , and it does seem kind of not just right that Joe 's father 's money -- Bantry did n't leave anything to speak of -- has to go to keepin ' ` Gene on the fat of the land , with Joe gittin ' up at half-past four to carry papers , and him goin ' on nineteen years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 10]: `` It 's all he 's fit for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 3]: exclaimed Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 10]: `` He 's low down , I tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 33]: Ai n't it only last week Judge Pike caught him shootin ' craps with Pike 's nigger driver and some other nigger hired-men in the alley back of Pike 's barn . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 18]: Mr. Schindlinger , the retired grocer , one of the silent members , corroborated Eskew 's information .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 17]: `` I heert dot , too , '' he gave forth , in his fat voice .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 16]: `` He blays dominoes pooty often in der room back off Louie Farbach 's tsaloon .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 5]: I see him myself .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 3]: Pooty often .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 10]: Blayin ' fer a leedle money -- mit loafers !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 3]: Loafers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 8]: `` Pretty outlook for the Loudens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 7]: said Eskew Arp , much pleased .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 20]: `` One boy a plum fool and dressed like it , the other gone to the dogs already ! ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 10]: `` What could you expect Joe to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 4]: retorted Squire Buckalew .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 8]: `` What chance has he ever had ?
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 16]: Long as I can remember Fanny 's made him fetch and carry for ` Gene .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 20]: ` Gene 's had everything -- all the fancy clothes , all the pocket-money , and now college ! ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: `` You ever hear that boy Joe talk politics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 12]: asked Uncle Joe Davey , crossing a cough with a chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 27]: `` His head 's so full of schemes fer running this town , and state , too , it 's a wonder it do n't bust .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 29]: Henry Louden told me he 's see Joe set around and study by the hour how to save three million dollars for the state in two years . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 34]: `` And the best he can do for himself , '' added Eskew , `` is deliverin ' the Daily Tocsin on a second-hand Star bicycle and gamblin ' with niggers and riff-raff !
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 16]: None of the nice young folks invite him to their doin 's any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 21]: `` That 's because he 's got so shabby he 's quit goin ' with em , '' said Buckalew .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 12]: `` No , it ai n't , '' snapped Mr. Arp .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 10]: `` It 's because he 's so low down .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 9]: He 's no more 'n a town outcast .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 47]: There ai n't ary one of the girls 'll have a thing to do with him , except that rip-rarin ' tom-boy next door to Louden 's ; and the others do n't have much to do with HER , neither , I can tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 14]: That Arie Tabor -- '' Colonel Flitcroft caught him surreptitiously by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 6]: `` SH , Eskew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: `` Look out what you 're sayin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 15]: `` You need n't mind me , '' Jonas Tabor spoke up , crisply .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 18]: `` I washed my hands of all responsibility for Roger 's branch of the family long ago .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 27]: Never was one of 'em had the energy or brains to make a decent livin ' , beginning with Roger ; not one worth his salt !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 40]: I set Roger 's son up in business , and all the return he ever made me was to go into bankruptcy and take to drink , till he died a sot , like his wife did of shame .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 25]: I done all I could when I handed him over my store , and I never expect to lift a finger for 'em again .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 29]: Ariel Tabor 's my grandniece , but she did n't act like it , and you can say anything you like about her , for what I care .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 28]: The last time I spoke to her was a year and a half ago , and I do n't reckon I 'll ever trouble to again . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 8]: `` How was that , Jonas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 19]: quickly inquired Mr. Davey , who , being the eldest of the party , was the most curious .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 5]: `` What happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 18]: `` She was out in the street , up on that high bicycle of Joe Louden 's .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 20]: He was teachin ' her to ride , and she was sittin ' on it like a man does .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 10]: I stopped and told her she was n't respectable .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 10]: Sixteen years old , goin ' on seventeen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 7]: `` What did she say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 24]: `` Laughed , '' said Jonas , his voice becoming louder as the recital of his wrongs renewed their sting in his soul .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 4]: `` Laughed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 7]: `` What did you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 22]: `` I went up to her and told her she was n't a decent girl , and shook the wheel . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 14]: Mr. Tabor illustrated by seizing the lapels of Joe Davey and shaking him .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 23]: `` I told her if her grandfather had any spunk she 'd git an old-fashioned hidin ' for behavin ' that way .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 8]: And I shook the wheel again . ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 38]: Here Mr. Tabor , forgetting in the wrath incited by the recollection that he had not to do with an inanimate object , swung the gasping and helpless Mr. Davey rapidly back and forth in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 9]: `` I shook it good and hard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 8]: `` What did she do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 4]: asked Peter Bradbury .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 12]: `` Fell off on me , '' replied Jonas , violently .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 5]: `` On purpose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 29]: `` I wisht she 'd killed ye , '' said Mr. Davey , in a choking voice , as , released , he sank back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 5]: `` On purpose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 3]: repeated Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 13]: `` And smashed a straw hat I had n't had three months !
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: All to pieces !
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 8]: So it could n't be fixed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 6]: `` And what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 3]: pursued Bradbury .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 13]: `` SHE ran , '' replied Jonas , bitterly -- `` ran !
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 13]: And Joe Louden -- Joe Louden -- '' He paused and gulped .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 7]: `` What did he do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 8]: Peter leaned forward in his chair eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 17]: The narrator of the outrage gulped again , and opened and shut his mouth before responding .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 23]: `` He said if I did n't pay for a broken spoke on his wheel he 'd have to sue me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 14]: No one inquired if Jonas had paid , and Jonas said no more .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 23]: The recollection of his wrongs , together with the illustrative violence offered to Mr. Davey , had been too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 23]: He sank back , panting , in his chair , his hands fluttering nervously over his heart , and closed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 23]: `` I wonder why , '' ruminated Mr. Bradbury -- `` I wonder why ` Gene Bantry walked up from the deepo .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 8]: Do n't seem much like his style .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 12]: Should think he 'd of rode up in a hack . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 4]: `` Sho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 9]: said Uncle Joe Davey , his breath recovered .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 48]: `` He wanted to walk up past Judge Pike 's , to see if there was n't a show of Mamie 's bein ' at the window , and give her a chance to look at that college uniform and banjo-box and new walk of his . ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 9]: Mr. Arp began to show signs of uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 44]: `` I 'd like mighty well to know , '' he said , shifting round in his chair , `` if there 's anybody here that 's been able to answer the question I PUT , yesterday , just before we went home .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 22]: You all tried to , but I did n't hear anything I could consider anyways near even a fair argument . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 6]: `` Who tried to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 9]: asked Buckalew , sharply , sitting up straight .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 5]: `` What question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 32]: `` What proof can you bring me , '' began Mr. Arp , deliberately , `` that we folks , modernly , ai n't more degenerate than the ancient Romans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 33]: II A RESCUE Main Street , already muffled by the snow , added to its quietude a frozen hush where the wonder-bearing youth pursued his course along its white , straight way .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 43]: None was there in whom impertinence overmastered astonishment , or who recovered from the sight in time to jeer with effect ; no `` Trab 's boy '' gathered courage to enact in the thoroughfare a scene of mockery and of joy .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 37]: Leaving business at a temporary stand-still behind him , Mr. Bantry swept his long coat steadily over the snow and soon emerged upon that part of the street where the mart gave way to the home .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 52]: The comfortable houses stood pleasantly back from the street , with plenty of lawn and shrubbery about them ; and often , along the picket-fences , the laden branches of small cedars , bending low with their burden , showered the young man 's swinging shoulders glitteringly as he brushed by .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 26]: And now that expression he wore -- the indulgent amusement of a man of the world -- began to disintegrate and show signs of change .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 25]: It became finely grave , as of a high conventionality , lofty , assured , and mannered , as he approached the Pike mansion .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 22]: -LRB- The remotest stranger must at once perceive that the Canaan papers could not have called it otherwise without pain . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 39]: It was a big , smooth-stone-faced house , product of the ` Seventies , frowning under an outrageously insistent mansard , capped by a cupola , and staring out of long windows overtopped with `` ornamental '' slabs .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 57]: Two cast-iron deer , painted death-gray , twins of the same mould , stood on opposite sides of the front walk , their backs towards it and each other , their bodies in profile to the street , their necks bent , however , so that they gazed upon the passer-by -- yet gazed without emotion .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 40]: Two large , calm dogs guarded the top of the steps leading to the front-door ; they also were twins and of the same interesting metal , though honored beyond the deer by coats of black paint and shellac .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 41]: It was to be remarked that these dogs were of no distinguishable species or breed , yet they were unmistakably dogs ; the dullest must have recognized them as such at a glance , which was , perhaps , enough .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 92]: It was a hideous house , important-looking , cold , yet harshly aggressive , a house whose exterior provoked a shuddering guess of the brass lambrequins and plush fringes within ; a solid house , obviously -- nay , blatantly -- the residence of the principal citizen , whom it had grown to resemble , as is the impish habit of houses ; and it sat in the middle of its flat acre of snowy lawn like a rich , fat man enraged and sitting straight up in bed to swear .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 12]: And yet there was one charming thing about this ugly house .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 17]: Some workmen were enclosing a large side porch with heavy canvas , evidently for festal purposes .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 28]: Looking out from between two strips of the canvas was the rosy and delicate face of a pretty girl , smiling upon Eugene Bantry as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 65]: It was an obviously pretty face , all the youth and prettiness there for your very first glance ; elaborately pretty , like the splendid profusion of hair about and above it -- amber-colored hair , upon which so much time had been spent that a circle of large , round curls rose above the mass of it like golden bubbles tipping a coronet .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 23]: The girl 's fingers were pressed thoughtfully against her chin as Eugene strode into view ; immediately her eyes widened and brightened .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 21]: He swung along the fence with the handsomest appearance of unconsciousness , until he reached a point nearly opposite her .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 15]: Then he turned his head , as if haphazardly , and met her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 36]: At once she threw out her hand towards him , waving him a greeting -- a gesture which , as her fingers had been near her lips , was a little like throwing a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 36]: He crooked an elbow and with a one-two-three military movement removed his small-brimmed hat , extended it to full arm 's - length at the shoulder-level , returned it to his head with Life-Guard precision .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 7]: This was also new to Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 11]: He was letting Mamie Pike have it all at once .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 11]: The impression was as large as he could have desired .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 27]: She remained at the opening in the canvas and watched him until he wagged his shoulders round the next corner and disappeared into a cross street .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 16]: As for Eugene , he was calm with a great calm , and very red .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 68]: He had not covered a great distance , however , before his gravity was replaced by his former smiling look of the landed gentleman amused by the innocent pastimes of the peasants , though there was no one in sight except a woman sweeping some snow from the front steps of a cottage , and she , not perceiving him , retired in-doors without knowing her loss .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 37]: He had come to a thinly built part of the town , the perfect quiet of which made the sound he heard as he opened the picket gate of his own home all the more startling .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 12]: It was a scream -- loud , frantic , and terror-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 9]: Eugene stopped , with the gate half open .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 44]: Out of the winter skeleton of a grape-arbor at one side of the four-square brick house a brown-faced girl of seventeen precipitated herself through the air in the midst of a shower of torn card-board which she threw before her as she leaped .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 29]: She lit upon her toes and headed for the gate at top speed , pursued by a pale young man whose thin arms strove spasmodically to reach her .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 62]: Scattering snow behind them , hair flying , the pair sped on like two tattered branches before a high wind ; for , as they came nearer Eugene -LRB- of whom , in the tensity of their flight , they took no note -RRB- , it was to be seen that both were so shabbily dressed as to be almost ragged .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 54]: There was a brown patch upon the girl 's faded skirt at the knee ; the shortness of the garment indicating its age to be something over three years , as well as permitting the knowledge to become more general than befitting that her cotton stockings had been clumsily darned in several places .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 53]: Her pursuer was in as evil case ; his trousers displayed a tendency to fringedness at pocket and heel ; his coat , blowing open as he ran , threw pennants of torn lining to the breeze , and made it too plain that there were but three buttons on his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 43]: The girl ran beautifully , but a fleeter foot was behind her , and though she dodged and evaded like a creature of the woods , the reaching hand fell upon the loose sleeve of her red blouse , nor fell lightly .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 75]: She gave a wrench of frenzy ; the antique fabric refused the strain ; parted at the shoulder seam so thoroughly that the whole sleeve came away -- but not to its owner 's release , for she had been brought round by the jerk , so that , agile as she had shown herself , the pursuer threw an arm about her neck , before she could twist away , and held her .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 13]: There was a sharp struggle , as short as it was fierce .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 7]: Neither of these extraordinary wrestlers spoke .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 3]: They fought .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 39]: Victory hung in the balance for perhaps four seconds ; then the girl was thrown heavily upon her back , in such a turmoil of snow that she seemed to be the mere nucleus of a white comet .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 50]: She struggled to get up , plying knee and elbow with a very anguish of determination ; but her opponent held her , pinioned both her wrists with one hand , and with the other rubbed great handfuls of snow into her face , sparing neither mouth nor eyes .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 5]: `` You will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 8]: `` You will tear up my pictures !
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 12]: A dirty trick , and you get washed for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 38]: Half suffocated , choking , gasping , she still fought on , squirming and kicking with such spirit that the pair of them appeared to the beholder like figures of mist writhing in a fountain of snow .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 10]: More violence was to mar the peace of morning .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 36]: Unexpectedly attacked from the rear , the conqueror was seized by the nape of the neck and one wrist , and jerked to his feet , simultaneously receiving a succession of kicks from his assailant .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 75]: Prompted by an entirely natural curiosity , he essayed to turn his head to see who this might be , but a twist of his forearm and the pressure of strong fingers under his ear constrained him to remain as he was ; therefore , abandoning resistance , and , oddly enough , accepting without comment the indication that his captor desired to remain for the moment incognito , he resorted calmly to explanations .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 20]: `` She tore up a picture of mine , '' he said , receiving the punishment without apparent emotion .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 18]: `` She seemed to think because she 'd drawn it herself she had a right to . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 25]: There was a slight whimsical droop at the corner of his mouth as he spoke , which might have been thought characteristic of him .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 16]: He was an odd-looking boy , not ill-made , though very thin and not tall .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 100]: His pallor was clear and even , as though constitutional ; the features were delicate , almost childlike , but they were very slightly distorted , through nervous habit , to an expression at once wistful and humorous ; one eyebrow was a shade higher than the other , one side of the mouth slightly drawn down ; the eyelids twitched a little , habitually ; the fine , blue eyes themselves were almost comically reproachful -- the look of a puppy who thinks you would not have beaten him if you had known what was in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 38]: All of this was in the quality of his voice , too , as he said to his invisible captor , with an air of detachment from any personal feeling : `` What peculiar shoes you wear !
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 13]: I do n't think I ever felt any so pointed before . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 43]: The rescuing knight took no thought of offering to help the persecuted damsel to arise ; instead , he tightened his grip upon the prisoner 's neck until , perforce , water -- not tears -- started from the latter 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 28]: `` You miserable little muff , '' said the conqueror , `` what the devil do you mean , making this scene on our front lawn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 8]: `` Why , it 's Eugene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 5]: exclaimed the helpless one .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 9]: `` They did n't expect you till to-night .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 7]: When did you get in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 19]: `` Just in time to give you a lesson , my buck , '' replied Bantry , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 12]: `` In GOOD time for that , my playful step-brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 28]: He began to twist the other 's wrist -- a treatment of bone and ligament in the application of which school-boys and even freshmen are often adept .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 59]: Eugene made the torture acute , and was apparently enjoying the work , when suddenly -- without any manner of warning -- he received an astounding blow upon the left ear , which half stunned him for the moment , and sent his hat flying and himself reeling , so great was the surprise and shock of it .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 41]: It was not a slap , not an open-handed push , nothing like it , but a fierce , well-delivered blow from a clinched fist with the shoulder behind it , and it was the girl who had given it .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 10]: `` Do n't you dare to touch Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 5]: she cried , passionately .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 11]: `` Do n't you lay a finger on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 12]: Furious and red , he staggered round to look at her .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 14]: `` You wretched little wild-cat , what do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 4]: he broke out .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 8]: `` Do n't you touch Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 3]: she panted .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 22]: `` Do n't you -- '' Her breath caught and there was a break in her voice as she faced him .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 18]: She could not finish the repetition of that cry , `` Do n't you touch Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 19]: But there was no break in the spirit , that passion of protection which had dealt the blow .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 9]: Both boys looked at her , something aghast .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 21]: She stood before them , trembling with rage and shivering with cold in the sudden wind which had come up .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 67]: Her hair had fallen and blew across her streaming face in brown witch-wisps ; one of the ill-darned stockings had come down and hung about her shoe in folds full of snow ; the arm which had lost its sleeve was bare and wet ; thin as the arm of a growing boy , it shook convulsively , and was red from shoulder to clinched fist .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 6]: She was covered with snow .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 13]: Mists of white drift blew across her , mercifully half veiling her .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 4]: Eugene recovered himself .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 27]: He swung round upon his heel , restored his hat to his head with precision , picked up his stick and touched his banjo-case with it .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 17]: `` Carry that into the house , '' he said , indifferently , to his step-brother .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 8]: `` Do n't you do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 11]: said the girl , hotly , between her chattering teeth .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 13]: Eugene turned towards her , wearing the sharp edge of a smile .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 78]: Not removing his eyes from her face , he produced with deliberation a flat silver box from a pocket , took therefrom a cigarette , replaced the box , extracted a smaller silver box from another pocket , shook out of it a fusee , slowly lit the cigarette -- this in a splendid silence , which he finally broke to say , languidly , but with particular distinctness : `` Ariel Tabor , go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 48]: The girl 's teeth stopped chattering , her lips remaining parted ; she shook the hair out of her eyes and stared at him as if she did not understand , but Joe Louden , who had picked up the banjo-case obediently , burst into cheerful laughter .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 14]: `` That 's it , ` Gene , '' he cried , gayly .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 11]: `` That 's the way to talk to her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 17]: `` Stow it , you young cub , '' replied Eugene , not turning to him .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 12]: `` Do you think I 'm trying to be amusing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 53]: `` I do n't know what you mean by ` stow it , ' '' Joe began , `` but if -- '' `` I mean , '' interrupted the other , not relaxing his faintly smiling stare at the girl -- `` I mean that Ariel Tabor is to go home .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 17]: Really , we ca n't have this kind of thing occurring upon our front lawn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 23]: The flush upon her wet cheeks deepened and became dark ; even her arm grew redder as she gazed back at him .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 50]: In his eyes was patent his complete realization of the figure she cut , of this bare arm , of the strewn hair , of the fallen stocking , of the ragged shoulder of her blouse , of her patched short skirt , of the whole dishevelled little figure .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 23]: He was the master of the house , and he was sending her home as ill-behaved children are sent home by neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 43]: The immobile , amused superiority of this proprietor of silver boxes , this wearer of strange and brilliant garments , became slightly intensified as he pointed to the fallen sleeve , a rag of red and snow , lying near her feet .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 9]: `` You might take that with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 5]: he said , interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 24]: Her gaze had not wavered in meeting his , but at this her eyelashes began to wink uncontrollably , her chin to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 26]: She bent over the sleeve and picked it up , before Joe Louden , who had started towards her , could do it for her .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 25]: Then turning , her head still bent so that her face was hidden from both of them , she ran out of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 5]: `` DO go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 7]: Joe called after her , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 3]: `` Go !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 17]: Just to show what a fool you are to think ` Gene 's in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 14]: He would have followed , but his step-brother caught him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 10]: `` Do n't stop her , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 16]: `` Ca n't you tell when I AM in earnest , you bally muff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 16]: `` I know you are , '' returned the other , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 14]: `` I did n't want her to think so for your sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 11]: `` Thousands of thanks , '' said Eugene , airily .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 8]: `` You are a wise young judge .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 12]: She could n't stay -- in THAT state , could she ?
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 9]: I sent her for her own good . ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 24]: `` She could have gone in the house and your mother might have loaned her a jacket , '' returned Joe , swallowing .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 17]: `` You had no business to make her go out in the street like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 3]: Eugene laughed .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 18]: `` There is n't a soul in sight -- and there , she 's all right now .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 5]: She 's home . ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 51]: Ariel had run along the fence until she came to the next gate , which opened upon a walk leading to a shabby , meandering old house of one story , with a very long , low porch , once painted white , running the full length of the front .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 11]: Ariel sprang upon the porch and disappeared within the house .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 13]: Joe stood looking after her , his eyelashes winking as had hers .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 17]: `` You ought n't to have treated her that way , '' he said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 4]: Eugene laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: `` How were YOU treating her when I came up ?
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 22]: You bully her all you want to yourself , but nobody else must say even a fatherly word to her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 10]: `` That was n't bullying , '' explained Joe .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 8]: `` We fight all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 5]: `` Mais oui ! ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 3]: assented Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 5]: `` I fancy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 6]: said the other , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 17]: `` Pick up that banjo-case again and come on , '' commanded Mr. Bantry , tartly .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 7]: `` Where 's the mater ? ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 5]: Joe stared at him .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 6]: `` Where 's what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 5]: `` The mater ! ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 5]: was the frowning reply .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 8]: `` Oh yes , I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 9]: said Joe , looking at his step-brother curiously .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 8]: `` I 've seen it in stories .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 4]: She 's up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 6]: You 'll be a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 11]: You 're wearing lots of clothes , ` Gene . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 17]: `` I suppose it will seem so to Canaan , '' returned the other , weariedly .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 6]: `` Governor feeling fit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 14]: `` I never saw him , '' Joe replied ; then caught himself .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 9]: `` Oh , I see what you mean !
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 8]: Yes , he 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 24]: They had come into the hall , and Eugene was removing the long coat , while his step-brother looked at him thoughtfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 22]: ` Gene , '' asked the latter , in a softened voice , `` have you seen Mamie Pike yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 38]: `` You will find , my young friend , '' responded Mr. Bantry , `` if you ever go about much outside of Canaan , that ladies ' names are not supposed to be mentioned indiscriminately . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 25]: `` It 's only , '' said Joe , `` that I wanted to say that there 's a dance at their house to-night .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 8]: I suppose you 'll be going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 4]: Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 23]: Both knew that the question was needless ; but Joe answered , gently : `` Oh no , of course not . ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 16]: He leaned over and fumbled with one foot as if to fasten a loose shoe-string .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: `` She would n't be very likely to ask me . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 8]: `` Well , what about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 11]: `` Only that -- that Arie Tabor 's going . ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 13]: Eugene paused on the stairs , which he had begun to ascend .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 5]: `` Very interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 26]: `` I thought , '' continued Joe , hopefully , straightening up to look at him , `` that maybe you 'd dance with her .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 56]: I do n't believe many will ask her -- I 'm afraid they wo n't -- and if you would , even only once , it would kind of make up for '' -- he faltered -- `` for out there , '' he finished , nodding his head in the direction of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 44]: If Eugene vouchsafed any reply , it was lost in a loud , shrill cry from above , as a small , intensely nervous-looking woman in blue silk ran half-way down the stairs to meet him and caught him tearfully in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 6]: `` Dear old mater ! ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 3]: said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 8]: Joe went out of the front-door quickly .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 52]: III OLD HOPES The door which Ariel had entered opened upon a narrow hall , and down this she ran to her own room , passing , with face averted , the entrance to the broad , low-ceilinged chamber that had served Roger Tabor as a studio for almost fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 44]: He was sitting there now , in a hopeless and disconsolate attitude , with his back towards the double doors , which were open , and had been open since their hinges had begun to give way , when Ariel was a child .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 32]: Hearing her step , he called her name , but did not turn ; and , receiving no answer , sighed faintly as he heard her own door close upon her .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 21]: Then , as his eyes wandered about the many canvases which leaned against the dingy walls , he sighed again .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 18]: Usually they showed their brown backs , but to-day he had turned them all to face outward .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 58]: Twilight , sunset , moonlight -LRB- the Court-house in moonlight -RRB- , dawn , morning , noon -LRB- Main Street at noon -RRB- , high summer , first spring , red autumn , midwinter , all were there -- illimitably detailed , worked to a smoothness like a glaze , and all lovingly done with unthinkable labor .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 68]: And there were `` Italian Flower-Sellers , '' damsels with careful hair , two figures together , one blonde , the other as brunette as lampblack , the blonde -- in pink satin and blue slippers -- leaning against a pillar and smiling over the golden coins for which she had exchanged her posies ; the brunette seated at her feet , weeping upon an unsold bouquet .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 66]: There were red-sashed `` Fisher Lads '' wading with butterfly-nets on their shoulders ; there was a `` Tying the Ribbon on Pussy 's Neck '' ; there were portraits in oil and petrifactions in crayon , as hard and tight as the purses of those who had refused to accept them , leaving them upon their maker 's hands because the likeness had failed .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 52]: After a time the old man got up , went to his easel near a window , and , sighing again , began patiently to work upon one of these failures -- a portrait , in oil , of a savage old lady , which he was doing from a photograph .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 36]: The expression of the mouth and the shape of the nose had not pleased her descendants and the beneficiaries under the will , and it was upon the images of these features that Roger labored .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 43]: He leaned far forward , with his face close to the canvas , holding his brushes after the Spencerian fashion , working steadily through the afternoon , and , when the light grew dimmer , leaning closer to his canvas to see .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 33]: When it had become almost dark in the room , he lit a student-lamp with a green-glass shade , and , placing it upon a table beside him , continued to paint .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: Ariel 's voice interrupted him at last .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 19]: `` It 's quitting-time , grandfather , '' she called , gently , from the doorway behind him .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 21]: He sank back in his chair , conscious , for the first time , of how tired he had grown .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 25]: `` I suppose so , '' he said , `` though it seemed to me that I was just getting my hand in . ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: His eyes brightened for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 15]: `` I declare , I believe I 've caught it a great deal better .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 6]: Come and look , Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 12]: Does n't it seem to you that I 'm getting it ?
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 15]: Those pearly shadows in the flesh -- '' `` I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 12]: Those people ought to be very proud to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 27]: She came to him quietly , took the palette and brushes from his hands and began to clean them , standing in the shadow behind him .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 9]: `` It 's too good for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 35]: `` I wonder if it is , '' he said , slowly , leaning forward and curving his hands about his eyes so as to shut off everything from his view except the canvas .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 8]: `` I wonder if it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 21]: Then his hands dropped sadly in his lap , and he sank back again with a patient kind of revulsion .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 9]: `` No , no , it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 13]: I always think they 're good when I 've just finished them .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 10]: I 've been fooled that way all my life .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 9]: They do n't look the same afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 12]: `` They 're always beautiful , '' she said , softly .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 6]: `` Ah , ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 3]: he sighed .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 6]: `` Now , Roger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 11]: she cried , with cheerful sharpness , continuing her work .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 18]: `` I know , '' he said , with a plaintive laugh , -- `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 21]: Sometimes I think that all my reward has been in the few minutes I 've had just after finishing them .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 54]: During those few minutes I seem to see in them all that I wanted to put in them ; I see it because what I 've been trying to express is still so warm in my own eyes that I seem to have got it on the canvas where I wanted it . ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 9]: `` But you do , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 8]: `` You do get it there . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 10]: `` No , '' he murmured , in return .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 5]: `` I never did .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 33]: I got out some of the old ones when I came in this morning , some that I had n't looked at for years , and it 's the same with them .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 14]: You can do it much better yourself -- your sketches show it . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 5]: she protested , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 18]: `` Yes , they do ; and I wondered if it was only because you were young .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 19]: But those I did when I was young are almost the same as the ones I paint now .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 6]: I have n't learned much .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 10]: There has n't been any one to show me !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 10]: And you ca n't learn from print , never !
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 30]: Yet I 've grown in what I SEE -- grown so that the world is full of beauty to me that I never dreamed of seeing when I began .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 16]: But I ca n't paint it -- I ca n't get it on the canvas .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 36]: Ah , I think I might have known how to , if I had n't had to teach myself , if I could only have seen how some of the other fellows did their work .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 41]: If I 'd ever saved money to get away from Canaan -- if I could have gone away from it and come back knowing how to paint it -- if I could have got to Paris for just one month !
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 8]: PARIS -- for just one month ! ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 14]: `` Perhaps we will ; you ca n't tell what MAY happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 11]: It was always her reply to this cry of his .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 9]: `` PARIS -- for just one month ! ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 56]: he repeated , with infinite wistfulness , and then realizing what an old , old cry it was with him , he shook his head , impatiently sniffing out a laugh at himself , rose and went pottering about among the canvases , returning their faces to the wall , and railing at them mutteringly .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 12]: `` Whatever took me into it , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 7]: I might have done something useful .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 23]: But I could n't bring myself ever to consider doing anything else -- I could n't bear even to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 14]: Lord forgive me , I even tried to encourage your father to paint .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 22]: Perhaps he might as well , poor boy , as to have put all he 'd made into buying Jonas out .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 8]: There you go , ` Flower-Girls ' !
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 24]: Turn your silly faces to the wall and smile and cry there till I 'm gone and somebody throws you on a bonfire .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 9]: I 'LL never look at you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 9]: He paused , with the canvas half turned .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 23]: `` And yet , '' he went on , reflectively , `` a man promised me thirty-five dollars for that picture once .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 26]: I painted it to order , but he went away before I finished it , and never answered the letters I wrote him about it .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 20]: I wish I had the money now -- perhaps we could have more than two meals a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 16]: `` We do n't need more , '' said Ariel , scraping the palette attentively .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 10]: `` It 's healthier with only breakfast and supper .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 13]: I think I 'd rather have a new dress than dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 13]: `` I dare say you would , '' the old man mused .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 9]: `` You 're young -- you 're young .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 11]: What were you doing all this afternoon , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 16]: `` In my room , trying to make over mamma 's wedding-dress for to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 4]: `` To-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 13]: `` Mamie Pike invited me to a dance at their house . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 30]: `` Very well ; I 'm glad you 're going to be gay , '' he said , not seeing the faintly bitter smile that came to her face .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 15]: `` I do n't think I 'll be very gay , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 17]: `` I do n't know why I go -- nobody ever asks me to dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 10]: he asked , with an old man 's astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 12]: Perhaps it 's because I do n't dress very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 18]: Then , as he made a sorrowful gesture , she cut him off before he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 33]: `` Oh , it is n't altogether because we 're poor ; it 's more I do n't know how to wear what I 've got , the way some girls do .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 15]: I never cared much and -- well , I 'M not worrying , Roger !
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 14]: And I think I 've done a good deal with mamma 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 7]: It 's a very grand dress .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 11]: I wonder I never thought of wearing it until to-day .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 24]: I may be '' -- she laughed and blushed -- `` I may be the belle of the ball -- who knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 20]: `` You 'll want me to walk over with you and come for you afterwards , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: `` Only to take me .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 22]: It may be late when I come away -- if a good many SHOULD ask me to dance , for once !
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 8]: Of course I could come home alone .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 27]: But Joe Louden is going to sort of hang around outside , and he 'll meet me at the gate and see me safe home . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 5]: he exclaimed , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 8]: `` Is n't it all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 16]: `` I think I 'd better come for you , '' he answered , gently .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 22]: `` The truth is , I -- I think you 'd better not be with Joe Louden a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 29]: `` Well , he does n't seem a vicious boy to me , but I 'm afraid he 's getting rather a bad name , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 13]: `` He 's not getting one , '' she said , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 7]: `` He 's already got one .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 13]: He 's had a bad name in Canaan for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 39]: It grew in the first place out of shabbiness and mischief , but it did grow ; and if people keep on giving him a bad name the time will come when he 'll live up to it .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 24]: He 's not any worse than I am , and I guess my own name is n't too good -- for a girl .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 17]: And yet , so far , there 's nothing against him except his bad name . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 11]: `` I 'm afraid there is , '' said Roger .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 24]: `` It does n't look very well for a young man of his age to be doing no better than delivering papers . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 15]: `` It gives him time to study law , '' she answered , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 15]: `` If he clerked all day in a store , he could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 10]: `` I did n't know he was studying now .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 44]: I thought I 'd heard that he was in a lawyer 's office for a few weeks last year , and was turned out for setting fire to it with a pipe -- '' `` It was an accident , '' she interposed .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 22]: `` But some pretty important papers were burned , and after that none of the other lawyers would have him . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 12]: `` He 's not in an office , '' she admitted .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 7]: `` I did n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 7]: But he studies a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 24]: He goes to the courts all the time they 're in session , and he 's bought some books of his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 42]: `` Well -- perhaps , '' he assented ; `` but they say he gambles and drinks , and that last week Judge Pike threatened to have him arrested for throwing dice with some negroes behind the Judge 's stable . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 5]: `` What of it ?
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 29]: I 'm about the only nice person in town that will have anything to do with him -- and nobody except you thinks I 'M very nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 3]: `` Ariel !
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 3]: Ariel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 60]: `` I know all about his gambling with darkies , '' she continued , excitedly , her voice rising , `` and I know that he goes to saloons , and that he 's an intimate friend of half the riffraff in town ; and I know the reason for it , too , because he 's told me .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 30]: He wants to know them , to understand them ; and he says some day they 'll make him a power , and then he can help them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 6]: The old man laughed helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 15]: `` But I ca n't let him bring you home , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 13]: She came to him slowly and laid her hands upon his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 18]: Grandfather and granddaughter were nearly of the same height , and she looked squarely into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 25]: `` Then you must say it is because you want to come for me , not because I must n't come with Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 27]: `` But I think it is a little because you must n't come with Joe , '' he answered , `` especially from the Pikes ' .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 23]: Do n't you see that it might n't be well for Joe himself , if the Judge should happen to see him ?
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 23]: I understand he warned the boy to keep away from the neighborhood entirely or he would have him locked up for dice-throwing .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 24]: The Judge is a very influential man , you know , and as determined in matters like this as he is irritable . ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 32]: `` Oh , if you put it on that ground , '' the girl replied , her eyes softening , `` I think you 'd better come for me yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 19]: `` Very well , I put it on that ground , '' he returned , smiling upon her .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 18]: `` Then I 'll send Joe word and get supper , '' she said , kissing him .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 33]: It was the supper-hour not only for them but everywhere in Canaan , and the cold air of the streets bore up and down and around corners the smell of things frying .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 62]: The dining-room windows of all the houses threw bright patches on the snow of the side-yards ; the windows of other rooms , except those of the kitchens , were dark , for the rule of the place was Puritanical in thrift , as in all things ; and the good housekeepers disputed every record of the meters with unhappy gas-collectors .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 44]: There was no better housekeeper in town than Mrs. Louden , nor a thriftier , but hers was one of the few houses in Canaan , that evening , which showed bright lights in the front rooms while the family were at supper .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 41]: It was proof of the agitation caused by the arrival of Eugene that she forgot to turn out the gas in her parlor , and in the chamber she called a library , on her way to the evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 13]: That might not have been thought a cheerful feast for Joe Louden .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 65]: The fatted calf was upon the board , but it had not been provided for the prodigal , who , in this case , was the brother that stayed at home : the fete rewarded the good brother , who had been in strange lands , and the good one had found much honor in his wanderings , as he carelessly let it appear .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 19]: Mrs. Louden brightened inexpressibly whenever Eugene spoke of himself , and consequently she glowed most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 40]: Her husband -- a heavy , melancholy , silent man with a grizzled beard and no mustache -- lowered at Joe throughout the meal , but appeared to take a strange comfort in his step-son 's elegance and polish .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 13]: Eugene wore new evening clothes and was lustrous to eye and ear .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 40]: Joe escaped as soon as he could , though not before the count of his later sins had been set before Eugene in detail , in mass , and in all of their depth , breadth , and thickness .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 19]: His father spoke but once , after nodding heavily to confirm all points of Mrs. Louden 's recital .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 27]: `` You better use any influence you 've got with your brother , '' he said to Eugene , `` to make him come to time .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 8]: I ca n't do anything with him .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 13]: If he gets in trouble , he need n't come to me !
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 7]: I 'll never help him again .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 7]: I 'm TIRED of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: Eugene glanced twinklingly at the outcast .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 15]: `` I did n't know he was such a roarer as all that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 19]: he said , lightly , not taking Joe as of enough consequence to be treated as a sinner .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 31]: This encouraged Mrs. Louden to pathos upon the subject of her shame before other women when Joe happened to be mentioned , and the supper was finished with the topic .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 15]: Joe slipped away through the kitchen , sneakingly , and climbed the back fence .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 53]: In the alley he lit a cheap cigarette , and thrusting his hands into his pockets and shivering violently -- for he had no overcoat , -- walked away singing to himself , `` A Spanish cavalier stood in his retreat , '' his teeth affording an appropriate though involuntary castanet accompaniment .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 14]: His movements throughout the earlier part of that evening are of uncertain report .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 87]: It is known that he made a partial payment of forty-five cents at a second-hand book-store for a number of volumes -- Grindstaff on Torts and some others -- which he had negotiated on the instalment system ; it is also believed that he won twenty-eight cents playing seven-up in the little room behind Louie Farbach 's bar ; but these things are of little import compared to the established fact that at eleven o'clock he was one of the ball guests at the Pike Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 31]: He took no active part in the festivities , nor was he one of the dancers : his was , on the contrary , the role of a quiet observer .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 43]: He lay stretched at full length upon the floor of the enclosed porch -LRB- one of the strips of canvas was later found to have been loosened -RRB- , wedged between the outer railing and a row of palms in green tubs .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 38]: The position he occupied was somewhat too draughty to have been recommended by a physician , but he commanded , between the leaves of the screening palms , an excellent view of the room nearest the porch .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 41]: A long window , open , afforded communication between this room , one of those used for dancing , and the dim bower which had been made of the veranda , whither flirtatious couples made their way between the dances .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 17]: It was not to play eavesdropper upon any of these that the uninvited Joe had come .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 40]: He was not there to listen , and it is possible that , had the curtains of other windows afforded him the chance to behold the dance , he might not have risked the dangers of his present position .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 50]: He had not the slightest interest in the whispered coquetries that he heard ; he watched only to catch now and then , over the shoulders of the dancers , a fitful glimpse of a pretty head that flitted across the window -- the amber hair of Mamie Pike .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 72]: He shivered in the draughts ; and the floor of the porch was cement , painful to elbow and knee , the space where he lay cramped and narrow ; but the golden bubbles of her hair , the shimmer of her dainty pink dress , and the fluffy wave of her lace scarf as she crossed and recrossed in a waltz , left him , apparently , in no discontent .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 17]: He watched with parted lips , his pale cheeks reddening whenever those fair glimpses were his .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 58]: At last she came out to the veranda with Eugene and sat upon a little divan , so close to Joe that , daring wildly in the shadow , he reached out a trembling hand and let his fingers rest upon the end of her scarf , which had fallen from her shoulders and touched the floor .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 12]: She sat with her back to him , as did Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 20]: `` You have changed , I think , since last summer , '' he heard her say , reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 9]: `` For the worse , ma cherie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 38]: Joe 's expression might have been worth seeing when Eugene said `` ma cherie , '' for it was known in the Louden household that Mr. Bantry had failed to pass his examination in the French language .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 7]: `` No , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 14]: `` But you have seen so much and accomplished so much since then .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 32]: You have become so polished and so -- '' She paused , and then continued , `` But perhaps I 'd better not say it ; you might be offended . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 43]: I want you to say it , '' he returned , confidently , and his confidence was fully justified , for she said : `` Well , then , I mean that you have become so thoroughly a man of the world .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 6]: Now I 've said it !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 9]: You ARE offended -- are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 27]: `` Not at all , not at all , '' replied Mr. Bantry , preventing by a masterful effort his pleasure from showing in his face .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 15]: `` Though I suppose you mean to imply that I 'm rather wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 18]: `` Oh no , '' said Mamie , with profound admiration , `` not exactly wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 11]: `` University life IS fast nowadays , '' Eugene admitted .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 12]: `` It 's difficult not to be drawn into it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 19]: `` And I suppose you look down on poor little Canaan now , and everybody in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 10]: `` Oh no , '' he laughed , indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 9]: `` Not at all , not at all !
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: I find it very amusing . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 6]: `` All of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 12]: `` Not you , '' he answered , becoming very grave .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 8]: `` Honestly -- DO N'T you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 7]: Her young voice trembled a little .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 21]: `` Honestly -- indeed -- truly -- '' Eugene leaned very close to her and the words were barely audible .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 8]: `` You KNOW I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 25]: `` Then I 'm -- glad , '' she whispered , and Joe saw his step-brother touch her hand , but she rose quickly .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 12]: `` There 's the music , '' she cried , happily .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 12]: `` It 's a waltz , and it 's YOURS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 28]: Joe heard her little high heels tapping gayly towards the window , followed by the heavier tread of Eugene , but he did not watch them go .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 21]: He lay on his back , with the hand that had touched Mamie 's scarf pressed across his closed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 44]: The music of that waltz was of the old-fashioned swingingly sorrowful sort , and it would be hard to say how long it was after that before the boy could hear the air played without a recurrence of the bitterness of that moment .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 44]: The rhythmical pathos of the violins was in such accord with a faint sound of weeping which he heard near him , presently , that for a little while he believed this sound to be part of the music and part of himself .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 17]: Then it became more distinct , and he raised himself on one elbow to look about .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 23]: Very close to him , sitting upon the divan in the shadow , was a girl wearing a dress of beautiful silk .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 11]: She was crying softly , her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 27]: IV THE DISASTER Ariel had worked all the afternoon over her mother 's wedding-gown , and two hours were required by her toilet for the dance .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 55]: She curled her hair frizzily , burning it here and there , with a slate-pencil heated over a lamp chimney , and she placed above one ear three or four large artificial roses , taken from an old hat of her mother 's , which she had found in a trunk in the store-room .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 51]: Possessing no slippers , she carefully blacked and polished her shoes , which had been clumsily resoled , and fastened into the strings of each small rosettes of red ribbon ; after which she practised swinging the train of her skirt until she was proud of her manipulation of it .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 40]: She had no powder , but found in her grandfather 's room a lump of magnesia , that he was in the habit of taking for heart-burn , and passed it over and over her brown face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 29]: Then a lingering gaze into her small mirror gave her joy at last : she yearned so hard to see herself charming that she did see herself so .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 41]: Admiration came and she told herself that she was more attractive to look at than she had ever been in her life , and that , perhaps , at last she might begin to be sought for like other girls .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 42]: The little glass showed a sort of prettiness in her thin , unmatured young face ; tripping dance-tunes ran through her head , her feet keeping the time , -- ah , she did so hope to dance often that night !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 11]: Perhaps -- perhaps she might be asked for every number .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 28]: And so , wrapping an old waterproof cloak about her , she took her grandfather 's arm and sallied forth , high hopes in her beating heart .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 12]: It was in the dressing-room that the change began to come .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 34]: Alone , at home in her own ugly little room , she had thought herself almost beautiful , but here in the brightly lighted chamber crowded with the other girls it was different .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 33]: There was a big cheval-glass at one end of the room , and she faced it , when her turn came -- for the mirror was popular -- with a sinking spirit .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 12]: There was the contrast , like a picture painted and framed .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 29]: The other girls all wore their hair after the fashion introduced to Canaan by Mamie Pike the week before , on her return from a visit to Chicago .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 17]: None of them had `` crimped '' and none had bedecked their tresses with artificial flowers .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 48]: Her alterations of the wedding-dress had not been successful ; the skirt was too short in front and higher on one side than on the other , showing too plainly the heavy-soled shoes , which had lost most of their polish in the walk through the snow .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 29]: The ribbon rosettes were fully revealed , and as she glanced at their reflection she heard the words , `` LOOK AT THAT TRAIN AND THOSE ROSETTES ! ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 28]: whispered behind her , and saw in the mirror two pretty young women turn away with their handkerchiefs over their mouths and retreat hurriedly to an alcove .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 35]: All the feet in the room except Ariel 's were in dainty kid or satin slippers of the color of the dresses from which they glimmered out , and only Ariel wore a train .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 19]: She went away from the mirror and pretended to be busy with a hanging thread in her sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 24]: She was singularly an alien in the chattering room , although she had been born and lived all her life in the town .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 39]: Perhaps her position among the young ladies may be best defined by the remark , generally current among them , that evening , to the effect that it was `` very sweet of Mamie to invite her . ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 18]: Ariel was not like the others ; she was not of them , and never had been .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 10]: Indeed , she did not know them very well .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 33]: Some of them nodded to her and gave her a word of greeting pleasantly ; all of them whispered about her with wonder and suppressed amusement ; but none talked to her .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 30]: They were not unkindly , but they were young and eager and excited over their own interests , -- which were then in the `` gentlemen 's dressing-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 42]: Each of the other girls had been escorted by a youth of the place , and , one by one , joining these escorts in the hall outside the door , they descended the stairs , until only Ariel was left .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 20]: She came down alone after the first dance had begun , and greeted her young hostess 's mother timidly .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 32]: Mrs. Pike -- a small , frightened-looking woman with a prominent ruby necklace -- answered her absently , and hurried away to see that the imported waiters did not steal anything .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 23]: Ariel sat in one of the chairs against the wall and watched the dancers with a smile of eager and benevolent interest .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 44]: In Canaan no parents , no guardians nor aunts , were haled forth o ' nights to duenna the junketings of youth ; Mrs. Pike did not reappear , and Ariel sat conspicuously alone ; there was nothing else for her to do .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 7]: It was not an easy matter .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 78]: When the first dance reached an end , Mamie Pike came to her for a moment with a cheery welcome , and was immediately surrounded by a circle of young men and women , flushed with dancing , shouting as was their wont , laughing inexplicably over words and phrases and unintelligible mono-syllables , as if they all belonged to a secret society and these cries were symbols of things exquisitely humorous , which only they understood .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 54]: Ariel laughed with them more heartily than any other , so that she might seem to be of them and as merry as they were , but almost immediately she found herself outside of the circle , and presently they all whirled away into another dance , and she was left alone again .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 48]: So she sat , no one coming near her , through several dances , trying to maintain the smile of delighted interest upon her face , though she felt the muscles of her face beginning to ache with their fixedness , her eyes growing hot and glazed .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 28]: All the other girls were provided with partners for every dance , with several young men left over , these latter lounging hilariously together in the doorways .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 17]: Ariel was careful not to glance towards them , but she could not help hating them .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 63]: Once or twice between the dances she saw Miss Pike speak appealingly to one of the superfluous , glancing , at the same time , in her own direction , and Ariel could see , too , that the appeal proved unsuccessful , until at last Mamie approached her , leading Norbert Flitcroft , partly by the hand , partly by will-power .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 19]: Norbert was an excessively fat boy , and at the present moment looked as patient as the blind .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 34]: But he asked Ariel if she was `` engaged for the next dance , '' and , Mamie having flitted away , stood disconsolately beside her , waiting for the music to begin .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 6]: Ariel was grateful for him .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 22]: `` I think you must be very good-natured , Mr. Flitcroft , '' she said , with an air of raillery .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 13]: `` No , I 'm not , '' he replied , plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 27]: `` Everybody thinks I am because I 'm fat , and they expect me to do things they never dream of asking anybody else to do .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 25]: I 'd like to see 'em even ASK ` Gene Bantry to go and do some of the things they get me to do !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 26]: A person is n't good-natured just because he 's fat , '' he concluded , morbidly , `` but he might as well be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 27]: `` Oh , I meant good-natured , '' she returned , with a sprightly laugh , `` because you 're willing to waltz with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 18]: `` Oh , well , '' he returned , sighing , `` that 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 44]: The orchestra flourished into `` La Paloma '' ; he put his arm mournfully about her , and taking her right hand with his left , carried her arm out to a rigid right angle , beginning to pump and balance for time .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 10]: They made three false starts and then got away .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 21]: Ariel danced badly ; she hopped and lost the step , but they persevered , bumping against other couples continually .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 40]: Circling breathlessly into the next room , they passed close to a long mirror , in which Ariel saw herself , although in a flash , more bitterly contrasted to the others than in the cheval-glass of the dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 26]: The clump of roses was flopping about her neck , her crimped hair looked frowzy , and there was something terribly wrong about her dress .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 19]: Suddenly she felt her train to be ominously grotesque , as a thing following her in a nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 33]: A moment later she caught her partner making a burlesque face of suffering over her shoulder , and , turning her head quickly , saw for whose benefit he had constructed it .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 19]: Eugene Bantry , flying expertly by with Mamie , was bestowing upon Mr. Flitcroft a condescendingly commiserative wink .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 24]: The next instant she tripped in her train and fell to the floor at Eugene 's feet , carrying her partner with her .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 7]: There was a shout of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 25]: The young hostess stopped Eugene , who would have gone on , and he had no choice but to stoop to Ariel 's assistance .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 17]: `` It seems to be a habit of mine , '' she said , laughing loudly .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 38]: She did not appear to see the hand he offered , but got to her feet without help and walked quickly away with Norbert , who proceeded to live up to the character he had given himself .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 14]: `` Perhaps we had better not try it again , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 17]: `` Well , I should think not , '' he returned , with the frankest gloom .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 22]: With the air of conducting her home he took her to the chair against the wall whence he had brought her .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 9]: There his responsibility for her seemed to cease .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 7]: `` Will you excuse me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 29]: he asked , and there was no doubt that he felt that he had been given more than his share that evening , even though he was fat .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 5]: Her laughter was continuous .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 16]: `` I should think you WOULD be glad to get rid of me after that .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 10]: Poor Mr. Flitcroft , you know you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 40]: It was the deadly truth , and the fat one , saying , `` Well , if you 'll just excuse me now , '' hurried away with a step which grew lighter as the distance from her increased .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 24]: Arrived at the haven of a far doorway , he mopped his brow and shook his head grimly in response to frequent rallyings .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 35]: Ariel sat through more dances , interminable dances and intermissions , in that same chair , in which , it began to seem , she was to live out the rest of her life .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 33]: Now and then , if she thought people were looking at her as they passed , she broke into a laugh and nodded slightly , as if still amused over her mishap .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 45]: After a long time she rose , and laughing cheerfully to Mr. Flitcroft , who was standing in the doorway and replied with a wan smile , stepped out quickly into the hall , where she almost ran into her great-uncle , Jonas Tabor .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 26]: He was going towards the big front doors with Judge Pike , having just come out of the latter 's library , down the hall .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 16]: Jonas was breathing heavily and was shockingly pale , though his eyes were very bright .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 15]: He turned his back upon his grandniece sharply and went out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 16]: Ariel turned from him quite as abruptly and re-entered the room whence she had come .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 42]: She laughed again to her fat friend as she passed him , and , still laughing , went towards the fatal chair , when her eyes caught sight of Eugene Bantry and Mamie coming in through the window from the porch .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 26]: Still laughing , she went to the window and looked out ; the porch seemed deserted and was faintly illuminated by a few Japanese lanterns .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 20]: She sprang out , dropped upon the divan , and burying her face in her hands , cried heart-brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 22]: Presently she felt something alive touch her foot , and , her breath catching with alarm , she started to rise .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 29]: A thin hand , issuing from a shabby sleeve , had stolen out between two of the green tubs and was pressing upon one of her shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 4]: ` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 8]: `` Do n't make a noise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 15]: His warning was not needed ; she had recognized the hand and sleeve instantly .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 42]: She dropped back with a low sound which would have been hysterical if it had been louder , while he raised himself on his arm until she could see his face dimly , as he peered at her between the palms .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 9]: `` What were you going on about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 5]: he asked , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 7]: `` Nothing , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 5]: `` I was n't .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 8]: You must go away , and quick .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 5]: It 's too dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 13]: If the Judge found you -- '' `` He wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 21]: `` Ah , you 'd risk anything to see Mamie Pike -- '' `` What were you crying about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 3]: he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 8]: `` Nothing , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 13]: she repeated , the tears not ceasing to gather in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 6]: `` I was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 13]: `` I want to know what it was , '' he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 10]: `` Did n't the fools ask you to dance ?
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 6]: You need n't tell me .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 4]: That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 22]: I 've been here for the last three dances and you were n't in sight till you came to the window .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 11]: Well , what do you care about that for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 6]: `` I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 6]: `` I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 13]: Then suddenly , without being able to prevent it , she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 16]: `` No , '' he said , gently , `` I see you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 18]: And you let yourself be a fool because there are a lot of fools in there . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 32]: She gave way , all at once , to a gust of sorrow and bitterness ; she bent far over and caught his hand and laid it against her wet cheek .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 24]: `` Oh , Joe , '' she whispered , brokenly , `` I think we have such hard lives , you and I !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 12]: It does n't seem right -- while we 're so young !
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 9]: Why ca n't we be like the others ?
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 11]: Why ca n't we have some of the fun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 20]: He withdrew his hand , with the embarrassment and shame he would have felt had she been a boy .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 5]: `` Get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 5]: he said , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 25]: She did not seem to notice , but , still stooping , rested her elbows on her knees and her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 30]: `` I try so hard to have fun , to be like the rest , -- and it 's always a mistake , always , always , always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 11]: She rocked herself , slightly , from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 19]: `` I am a fool , it 's the truth , or I would n't have come to-night .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 13]: I want to be attractive -- I want to be in things .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 25]: I want to laugh like they do -- '' `` To laugh just to laugh , and not because there 's something funny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 9]: `` Yes , I do , I do !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 24]: And to know how to dress and to wear my hair -- there must be some place where you can learn those things .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 10]: I 've never had any one to show me !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 11]: Grandfather said something like that this afternoon -- poor man !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 7]: We 're in the same case .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 10]: If we only had some one to show us !
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 15]: It all seems so BLIND , here in Canaan , for him and me !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 16]: I do n't say it 's not my own fault as much as being poor .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 24]: I 've been a hoyden ; I do n't feel as if I 'd learned how to be a girl yet , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 48]: It 's only lately I 've cared , but I 'm seventeen , Joe , and -- and to-day -- to-day -- I was sent home -- and to-night -- '' She faltered , came to a stop , and her whole body was shaken with sobs .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 12]: `` I hate myself so for crying -- for everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 15]: `` I 'll tell you something , '' he whispered , chuckling desperately . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 26]: ` Gene made me unpack his trunk , and I do n't believe he 's as great a man at college as he is here .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 24]: I opened one of his books , and some one had written in it , ` Prigamaloo Bantry , the Class Try-To-Be ' !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 15]: He 'd never noticed , and you ought to have heard him go on !
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 14]: You 'd have just died , Ariel -- I almost bust wide open !
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 19]: It was a mean trick in me , but I could n't help showing it to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 6]: Joe 's object was obtained .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 13]: She stopped crying , and , wiping her eyes , smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 5]: Then she became grave .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 11]: `` You 're jealous of Eugene , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: He considered this for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' he answered , thoughtfully , `` I am .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 12]: But I would n't think about him differently on that account .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 14]: And I would n't talk about him to any one but you . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 12]: `` Not even to -- '' She left the question unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 9]: `` No , '' he said , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 6]: `` Of course not . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 9]: Because it would n't be any use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 13]: I never have a chance to talk to her , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 8]: `` Of course you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 6]: Her voice had grown steady .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 8]: `` You say I 'm a fool .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 5]: What are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 12]: `` You need n't worry about me , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 12]: `` I can take care -- '' '' ` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 5]: she whispered , warningly .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 15]: The music had stopped , a loud clatter of voices and laughter succeeding it .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 21]: `` What need to be careful , '' Joe assured her , `` with all that noise going on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 12]: `` You must go away , '' she said , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 8]: `` Oh , please , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 12]: `` Not yet ; I want -- '' She coughed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 35]: Eugene and Mamie Pike had come to the window , with the evident intention of occupying the veranda , but perceiving Ariel engaged with threads in her sleeve , they turned away and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 34]: Other couples looked out from time to time , and finding the solitary figure in possession , retreated abruptly to seek stairways and remote corners for the things they were impelled to say .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 31]: And so Ariel held the porch for three dances and three intermissions , occupying a great part of the time with entreaties that her obdurate and reckless companion should go .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 22]: When , for the fourth time , the music sounded , her agitation had so increased that she was visibly trembling .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 17]: `` I ca n't stand it , Joe , '' she said , bending over him .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 13]: `` I do n't know what would happen if they found you .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 7]: You 've GOT to go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 11]: `` No , I have n't , '' he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 11]: `` They have n't even distributed the supper yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 27]: `` And you take all the chances , '' she said , slowly , `` just to see her pass that window a few times . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 5]: `` What chances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 14]: `` Of what the Judge will do if any one sees you . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 14]: `` Nothing ; because if any one saw me I 'd leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 5]: `` Please go . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 10]: `` Not till -- '' '' ` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 24]: A colored waiter , smiling graciously , came out upon the porch bearing a tray of salad , hot oysters , and coffee .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 5]: Ariel shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 11]: `` I do n't want any , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 27]: The waiter turned away in pity and was re-entering the window , when a passionate whisper fell upon his ear as well as upon Ariel 's .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: `` TAKE IT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 4]: said the waiter .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 13]: `` I 've changed my mind , '' she replied , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 27]: The waiter , his elation restored , gave of his viands with the superfluous bounty loved by his race when distributing the product of the wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 17]: When he had gone , `` Give me everything that 's hot , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 8]: `` You can keep the salad . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 21]: `` I could n't eat it or anything else , '' she answered , thrusting the plate between the palms .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 7]: For a time there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 20]: From within the house came the continuous babble of voices and laughter , the clink of cutlery on china .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 11]: The young people spent a long time over their supper .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 26]: By-and-by the waiter returned to the veranda , deposited a plate of colored ices upon Ariel 's knees with a noble gesture , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 10]: `` No ice for me , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 9]: `` Wo n't you please go now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 3]: she entreated !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 12]: `` It would n't be good manners , '' he responded .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 18]: `` They might think I only came for supper -- '' `` Hand me back the things .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 10]: The waiter might come for them any minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 4]: `` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 6]: I have n't quite finished .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 23]: I eat with contemplation , Ariel , because there 's more than the mere food and the warmth of it to consider .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 13]: There 's the pleasure of being entertained by the great Martin Pike .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 12]: Think what a real kindness I 'm doing him , too .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 19]: I increase his good deeds and his hospitality without his knowing it or being able to help it .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 14]: Do n't you see how I boost his standing with the Recording Angel ?
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 25]: If Lazarus had behaved the way I do , Dives need n't have had those worries that came to him in the after-life . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 14]: `` Give me the dish and coffee-cup , '' she whispered , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 12]: `` Suppose the waiter came and had to look for them ?
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 6]: `` Take them , then .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 38]: You 'll see that jealousy has n't spoiled my appetite -- '' A bottle-shaped figure appeared in the window and she had no time to take the plate and cup which were being pushed through the palm-leaves .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 30]: She whispered a syllable of warning , and the dishes were hurriedly withdrawn as Norbert Flitcroft , wearing a solemn expression of injury , came out upon the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 4]: He halted suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 6]: he asked , with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 9]: `` Nothing , '' answered Ariel , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 6]: `` Behind those palms . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 23]: `` Probably your own shadow , '' she laughed ; `` or it might have been a draught moving the leaves . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 26]: He did not seem satisfied , but stared hard at the spot where the dishes had disappeared , meantime edging back cautiously nearer the window .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 13]: `` They want you , '' he said , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 9]: `` Some one 's come for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 8]: `` Oh , is grandfather waiting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 12]: She rose , at the same time letting her handkerchief fall .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 31]: She stooped to pick it up , with her face away from Norbert and towards the palms , whispering tremulously , but with passionate urgency , `` Please GO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 20]: `` It is n't your grandfather that has come for you , '' said the fat one , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 7]: `` It is old Eskew Arp .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 5]: Something 's happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 20]: She looked at him for a moment , beginning to tremble violently , her eyes growing wide with fright .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 10]: `` Is my grandfather -- is he sick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 7]: `` You better go and see .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 8]: Old Eskew 's waiting in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: He 'll tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 10]: She was by him and through the window instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 38]: Norbert did not follow her ; he remained for several moments looking earnestly at the palms ; then he stepped through the window and beckoned to a youth who was lounging in the doorway across the room .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 19]: `` There 's somebody hiding behind those plants , '' he whispered , when his friend reached him .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 26]: `` Go and tell Judge Pike to send some of the niggers to watch outside the porch , so that he does n't get away .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 12]: Then tell him to get his revolver and come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 20]: Meanwhile Ariel had found Mr. Arp waiting in the hall , talking in a low voice to Mrs. Pike .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 16]: `` Your grandfather 's all right , '' he told the frightened girl , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 11]: `` He sent me for you , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 8]: Just hurry and get your things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 31]: She was with him again in a moment , and seizing the old man 's arm , hurried him down the steps and toward the street almost at a run .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 13]: `` You 're not telling me the truth , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 10]: `` You 're not telling me the truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 12]: `` Nothing has happened to Roger , '' panted Mr. Arp .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 8]: `` Nothing to mind , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 10]: We 're going this way , not that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 23]: They had come to the gate , and as she turned to the right he pulled her round sharply to the left .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 10]: `` We 're not going to your house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 7]: `` Where are we going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 11]: `` We 're going to your uncle Jonas 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 7]: she cried , in supreme astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 11]: `` What do you want to take me there for ?
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 13]: Do n't you know that he 's stopped speaking to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 39]: `` Yes , '' said the old man , grimly , with something of the look he wore when delivering a clincher at the `` National House , '' -- `` he 's stopped speaking to everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 149]: V BEAVER BEACH The Canaan Daily Tocsin of the following morning `` ventured the assertion '' upon its front page that `` the scene at the Pike Mansion was one of unalloyed festivity , music , and mirth ; a fairy bower of airy figures wafting here and there to the throb of waltz-strains ; a veritable Temple of Terpsichore , shining forth with a myriad of lights , which , together with the generous profusion of floral decorations and the mingled delights afforded by Minds 's orchestra of Indianapolis and Caterer Jones of Chicago , was in all likelihood never heretofore surpassed in elegance in our city ... Only one incident , '' the Tocsin remarked , `` marred an otherwise perfect occasion , and out of regard for the culprit 's family connections , which are prominent in our social world , we withhold his name .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 40]: Suffice it to say that through the vigilance of Mr. Norbert Flitcroft , grandson of Colonel A. A. Flitcroft , who proved himself a thorough Lecoq -LRB- the celebrated French detective -RRB- , the rascal was seized and recognized .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 46]: Mr. Flitcroft , having discovered him in hiding , had a cordon of waiters drawn up around his hiding-place , which was the charmingly decorated side piazza of the Pike Mansion , and sent for Judge Pike , who came upon the intruder by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 35]: He evaded the Judge 's indignant grasp , but received a well-merited blow over the head from a poker which the Judge had concealed about his person while pretending to approach the hiding-place casually .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 58]: Attracted to the scene by the cries of Mr. Flitcroft , who , standing behind Judge Pike , accidentally received a blow from the same weapon , all the guests of the evening sprang to view the scene , only to behold the culprit leap through a crevice between the strips of canvas which enclosed the piazza .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 36]: He was seized by the colored coachman of the Mansion , Sam Warden , and immediately pounced upon by the cordon of Caterer Jones 's dusky assistants from Chicago , who were in ambush outside .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 33]: Unfortunately , after a brief struggle he managed to trip Warden , and , the others stumbling upon the prostrate body of the latter , to make his escape in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 44]: `` It is not believed by many that his intention was burglary , though what his designs were can only be left to conjecture , as he is far beyond the age when boys perform such actions out of a sense of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 32]: He had evidently occupied his hiding-place some time , and an idea of his coolness may be obtained from his having procured and eaten a full meal through an unknown source .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 26]: Judge Pike is justly incensed , and swears that he will prosecute him on this and other charges as soon as he can be found .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 54]: Much sympathy is felt for the culprit 's family , who feel his shame most keenly , but who , though sorrowing over the occurrence , declare that they have put up with his derelictions long enough , and will do nothing to step between him and the Judge 's righteous indignation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 71]: The Pike Mansion , `` scene of festivity , music , and mirth '' -LRB- not quite so unalloyed , after all , the stricken Flitcroft keeping his room for a week under medical supervision -RRB- , had not been the only bower of the dance in Canaan that evening : another Temple of Terpsichore had shone forth with lights , though of these there were not quite a myriad .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 34]: The festivities they illumined obtained no mention in the paper , nor did they who trod the measures in this second temple exhibit any sense of injury because of the Tocsin 's omission .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 46]: Nay , they were of that class , shy without being bashful , exclusive yet not proud , which shuns publicity with a single-heartedness almost unique in our republic , courting observation neither in the prosecution of their professions nor in the pursuit of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 52]: Not quite a mile above the northernmost of the factories on the water-front , there projected into the river , near the end of the crescent bend above the town , a long pier , relic of steamboat days , rotting now , and many years fallen from its maritime uses .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 20]: About midway of its length stood a huge , crazy shed , long ago utilized as a freight storeroom .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 19]: This had been patched and propped , and a dangerous-looking veranda attached to it , over-hanging the water .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 23]: Above the doorway was placed a sign whereon might be read the words , `` Beaver Beach , Mike 's Place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 49]: The shore end of the pier was so ruinous that passage was offered by a single row of planks , which presented an appearance so temporary , as well as insecure , that one might have guessed their office to be something in the nature of a drawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 24]: From these a narrow path ran through a marsh , left by the receding river , to a country road of desolate appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 47]: Here there was a rough enclosure , or corral , with some tumble-down sheds which afforded shelter , on the night of Joseph Louden 's disgrace , for a number of shaggy teams attached to those decrepit and musty vehicles known picturesquely and accurately as Night-Hawks .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 54]: The presence of such questionable shapes in the corral indicated that the dance was on at Beaver Beach , Mike 's Place , as surely as the short line of cabs and family carriages on upper Main Street made it known that gayety was the order of the night at the Pike Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 33]: But among other differences was this , that at the hour when the guests of the latter were leaving , those seeking the hospitalities of Beaver Beach had just begun to arrive .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 32]: By three o'clock , however , joy at Mike 's Place had become beyond question unconfined , and the tokens of it were audible for a long distance in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 23]: If , however , there is no sound where no ear hears , silence rested upon the country-side until an hour later .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 28]: Then a lonely figure came shivering from the direction of the town , not by the road , but slinking through the snow upon the frozen river .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 22]: It came slowly , as though very tired , and cautiously , too , often turning its head to look behind .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 13]: Finally it reached the pier , and stopped as if to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 25]: Within the house above , a piano of evil life was being beaten to death for its sins and clamoring its last cries horribly .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 37]: The old shed rattled in every part with the thud of many heavy feet , and trembled with the shock of noise -- an incessant roar of men 's voices , punctuated with women 's screams .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 25]: Then the riot quieted somewhat ; there was a clapping of hands , and a violin began to squeak measures intended to be Oriental .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 18]: The next moment the listener scrambled up one of the rotting piles and stood upon the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 38]: A shaft of red light through a broken shutter struck across the figure above the shoulders , revealing a bloody handkerchief clumsily knotted about the head , and , beneath it , the face of Joe Louden .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 10]: He went to the broken shutter and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 43]: Around the blackened walls of the room stood a bleared mob , applausively watching , through a fog of smoke , the contortions of an old woman in a red calico wrapper , who was dancing in the centre of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 132]: The fiddler -- a rubicund person evidently not suffering from any great depression of spirit through the circumstance of being `` out on bail , '' as he was , to Joe 's intimate knowledge -- sat astride a barrel , resting his instrument upon the foamy tap thereof , and playing somewhat after the manner of a ` cellist ; in no wise incommoded by the fact that a tall man -LRB- known to a few friends as an expert in the porch-climbing line -RRB- was sleeping on his shoulder , while another gentleman -LRB- who had prevented many cases of typhoid by removing old plumbing from houses -RRB- lay on the floor at the musician 's feet and endeavored to assist him by plucking the strings of the fiddle .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 8]: Joe opened the door and went in .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 33]: All of the merry company -LRB- who were able -RRB- turned sharply toward the door as it opened ; then , recognizing the new-comer , turned again to watch the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 21]: One or two nearest the door asked the boy , without great curiosity , what had happened to his head .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 18]: He merely shook it faintly in reply , and crossed the room to an open hallway beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 19]: At the end of this he came to a frowzy bedroom , the door of which stood ajar .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 41]: Seated at a deal table , and working by a dim lamp with a broken chimney , a close-cropped , red-bearded , red-haired man in his shirt-sleeves was jabbing gloomily at a column of figures scrawled in a dirty ledger .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 18]: He looked up as Joe appeared in the doorway , and his eyes showed a slight surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 20]: `` I never thought ye had the temper to git somebody to split yer head , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 8]: `` Where 'd ye collect it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 13]: `` Nowhere , '' Joe answered , dropping weakly on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 9]: `` It does n't amount to anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 20]: `` Well , I 'll take just a look fer myself , '' said the red-bearded man , rising .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 16]: `` And I 've no objection to not knowin ' how ye come by it .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 16]: Ye 've always been the great one fer keepin ' yer mysteries to yerself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: He unwound the handkerchief and removed it from Joe 's head gently .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 4]: `` WHEE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 13]: he cried , as a long gash was exposed over the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 20]: `` I hope ye left a mark somewhere to pay a little on the score o ' this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 10]: Joe chuckled and dropped dizzily back upon the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 33]: `` There was another who got something like it , '' he gasped , feebly ; `` and , oh , Mike , I wish you could have heard him going on !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 13]: Perhaps you did -- it was only three miles from here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 8]: `` Nothing I 'd liked better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 17]: said the other , bringing a basin of clear water from a stand in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 24]: `` It 's a beautiful thing to hear a man holler when he gits a grand one like ye 're wearing to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 21]: He bathed the wound gently , and hurrying from the room , returned immediately with a small jug of vinegar .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 21]: Wetting a rag with this tender fluid , he applied it to Joe 's head , speaking soothingly the while .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 20]: `` Nothing in the world like a bit o ' good cider vinegar to keep off the festerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 18]: It may seem a trifle scratchy fer the moment , but it assassinates the blood-p ` ison .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 4]: There ye go !
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 18]: It 's the fine thing fer ye , Joe -- what are ye squirmin ' about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 21]: `` I 'm only enjoying it , '' the boy answered , writhing as the vinegar worked into the gash .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 11]: `` Do n't you mind my laughing to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: `` Ye 're a good one , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 8]: said the other , continuing his ministrations .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 20]: `` I wisht , after all , ye felt like makin ' me known to what 's the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 28]: There 's some of us would be glad to take it up fer ye , and -- '' `` No , no ; it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 16]: I was somewhere I had no business to be , and I got caught . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 6]: `` Who caught ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 36]: `` First , some nice white people '' -- Joe smiled his distorted smile -- `` and then a low-down black man helped me to get away as soon as he saw who it was .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 18]: He 's a friend of mine , and he fell down and tripped up the pursuit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 14]: `` I always knew ye 'd git into large trouble some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 23]: The red-bearded man tore a strip from an old towel and began to bandage the boy 's head with an accustomed hand .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 23]: `` Yer taste fer excitement has been growin ' on ye every minute of the four years I 've known ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 4]: `` Excitement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 9]: echoed Joe , painfully blinking at his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: `` Do you think I 'm hunting excitement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 7]: `` Be hanged to ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 5]: said the red-bearded man .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 17]: `` Ca n't I say a teasing word without gittin ' called to order fer it ?
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 14]: I know ye , my boy , as well as ye know yerself .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: Ye 're a queer one .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 25]: Ye 're one of the few that must know all sides of the world -- and ca n't content themselves with bein ' respectable !
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 31]: Ye have n't sunk to ` low life ' because ye 're low yourself , but ye 'll never git a damned one o ' the respectable to believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 22]: There 's a few others like ye in the wide world , and I 've seen one or two of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 57]: I 've been all over , steeple-chasin ' , sailorman , soldier , pedler , and in the PO-lice ; I 've pulled the Grand National in Paris , and I 've been handcuffed in Hong-Kong ; I 've seen all the few kinds of women there is on earth and the many kinds of men .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 30]: Yer own kind is the one I 've seen the fewest of , but I knew ye belonged to it the first time I laid eyes on ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 32]: He paused , then continued with conviction : `` Ye 'll come to no good , either , fer yerself , yet no one can say ye have n't the talents .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 24]: Ye 've helped many of the boys out of a bad hole with a word of advice around the courts and the jail .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 15]: Who knows but ye 'd be a great lawyer if ye kept on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 35]: Young people usually like to discuss themselves under any conditions -- hence the rewards of palmistry , -- but Joe 's comment on this harangue was not so responsive as might have been expected .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 23]: `` I 've got seven dollars , '' he said , `` and I 'll leave the clothes I 've got on .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 10]: Can you fix me up with something different ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 5]: cried the red-bearded man .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 7]: `` Then ye ARE in trouble !
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: I thought it 'd come to ye some day !
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 9]: Have ye been dinnymitin ' Martin Pike ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 11]: `` See what you can do , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 10]: `` I want to wait here until daybreak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 11]: `` Lie down , then , '' interrupted the other .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 11]: `` And fergit the hullabaloo in the throne-room beyond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 28]: `` I can easily do that '' -- Joe stretched himself upon the bed , -- `` I 've got so many other things to remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 31]: `` I 'll have the things fer ye , and I 'll let ye know I have no use fer seven dollars , '' returned the red-bearded man , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: `` What are ye sniffin ' fer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 23]: `` I 'm thinking of the poor fellow that got the mate to this , '' said Joe , touching the bandage .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 21]: `` I ca n't help crying when I think they may have used vinegar on his head , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 9]: `` Git to sleep if ye can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 28]: exclaimed the Samaritan , as a hideous burst of noise came from the dance-room , where some one seemed to be breaking a chair upon an acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 13]: `` I 'll go out and regulate the boys a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 17]: He turned down the lamp , fumbled in his hip-pocket , and went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 11]: `` Do n't forget , '' Joe called after him .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 17]: `` Go to sleep , '' said the red-bearded man , his hand on the door-knob .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 21]: `` That is , go to thinkin ' , fer ye wo n't sleep ; ye 're not the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 12]: But think easy ; I 'll have the things fer ye .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 19]: It 's a matter of pride with me that I always knew ye 'd come to trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 54]: VI YE 'LL TAK ' THE HIGH ROAD AND I 'LL TAK ' THE LOW ROAD The day broke with a scream of wind out of the prairies and such cloudbursts of snow that Joe could see neither bank of the river as he made his way down the big bend of ice .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 23]: The wind struck so bitterly that now and then he stopped and , panting and gasping , leaned his weight against it .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 48]: The snow on the ground was caught up and flew like sea spume in a hurricane ; it swirled about him , joining the flakes in the air , so that it seemed to be snowing from the ground upward as much as from the sky downward .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 54]: Fierce as it was , hard as it was to fight through , snow from the earth , snow from the sky , Joe was grateful for it , feeling that it veiled him , making him safer , though he trusted somewhat the change of costume he had effected at Beaver Beach .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 53]: A rough , workman 's cap was pulled down over his ears and eyebrows ; a knitted comforter was wound about the lower part of his face ; under a ragged overcoat he wore blue overalls and rubber boots ; and in one of his red-mittened hands he swung a tin dinner-bucket .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 29]: When he reached the nearest of the factories he heard the exhaust of its engines long before he could see the building , so blinding was the drift .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 53]: Here he struck inland from the river , and , skirting the edges of the town , made his way by unfrequented streets and alleys , bearing in the general direction of upper Main Street , to find himself at last , almost exhausted , in the alley behind the Pike Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 32]: There he paused , leaning heavily against a board fence and gazing at the vaguely outlined gray plane which was all that could be made of the house through the blizzard .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 34]: He had often , very often , stood in this same place at night , and there was one window -LRB- Mrs. Pike 's -RRB- which he had guessed to be Mamie 's .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 36]: The storm was so thick that he could not see this window now , but he looked a long time through the thickness at that part of the gray plane where he knew it was .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 5]: Then his lips parted .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 11]: `` Good-bye , Mamie , '' he said , softly .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 6]: `` Goodbye , Mamie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 50]: He bent his body against the wind and went on , still keeping to the back ways , until he came to the alley which passed behind his own home , where , however , he paused only for a moment to make a quick survey of the premises .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 27]: A glance satisfied him ; he ran to the next fence , hoisted himself wearily over it , and dropped into Roger Tabor 's back yard .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 85]: He took shelter from the wind for a moment or two , leaning against the fence , breathing heavily ; then he stumbled on across the obliterated paths of a vegetable-garden until he reached the house , and beginning with the kitchen , began to make the circuit of the windows , peering cautiously into each as he went , ready to tap on the pane should he catch a glimpse of Ariel , and prepared to run if he stumbled upon her grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 69]: But the place seemed empty : he had made his reconnaisance apparently in vain , and was on the point of going away , when he heard the click of the front gate and saw Ariel coming towards him , her old water-proof cloak about her head and shoulders , the patched , scant , faded skirt , which he knew so well , blowing about her tumultuously .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 24]: At the sound of the gate he had crouched close against the side of the house , but she saw him at once .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 23]: She stopped abruptly , and throwing the water-proof back from her head , looked at him through the driven fog of snow .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 115]: One of her hands was stretched towards him involuntarily , and it was in that attitude that he long remembered her : standing in the drift which had piled up against the gate almost knee-deep , the shabby skirt and the black water-proof flapping like torn sails , one hand out-stretched like that of a figure in a tableau , her brown face with its thin features mottled with cold and unlovely , her startled eyes fixed on him with a strange , wild tenderness that held something of the laughter of whole companionship in it mingling with a loyalty and championship that was almost ferocious -- she looked an Undine of the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 17]: Suddenly she ran to him , still keeping her hand out-stretched until it touched his own .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 8]: `` How did you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 5]: `` Know you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 10]: was all the answer she made to that question .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: `` Come into the house .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 11]: I 've got some coffee on the stove for you .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 20]: I 've been up and down the street waiting for you ever since it began to get light . ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 23]: `` Your grandfather wo n't -- '' `` He 's at Uncle Jonas 's ; he wo n't be back till noon .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 7]: There 's no one here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 22]: She led him to the front-door , where he stamped and shook himself ; he was snow from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 32]: `` I 'm running away from the good Gomorrah , '' he said , `` but I 've stopped to look back , and I 'm a pretty white pillar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 22]: `` I know where you stopped to look back , '' she answered , brushing him heartily with her red hands .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 8]: `` You came in the alley way .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 7]: It was Mamie 's window . ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 29]: He did not reply , and the only visible token that he had any consciousness of this clairvoyance of hers was a slight lift of his higher eyebrow .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 47]: She wasted no time in getting him to the kitchen , where , when she had removed his overcoat , she placed him in a chair , unwound the comforter , and , as carefully as a nurse , lifted the cap from his injured head .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 46]: When the strip of towel was disclosed she stood quite still for a moment with the cap in her hand ; then with a broken little cry she stooped and kissed a lock of his hair , which escaped , discolored , beneath the bandage .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 5]: `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 6]: he commanded , horribly embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 13]: `` Oh , Joe , '' she cried , `` I knew !
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 11]: I knew it was there -- but to SEE it !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 31]: And it 's my fault for leaving you -- I HAD to go or I would n't have -- I -- '' `` Where 'd you hear about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 5]: he asked , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 12]: `` I have n't been to bed , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 27]: `` Grandfather and I were up all night at Uncle Jonas 's , and Colonel Flitcroft came about two o'clock , and he told us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 9]: `` Did he tell you about Norbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 8]: `` Yes -- a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 38]: She poured coffee into a cup from a pot on the stove , brought it to him , then placing some thin slices of bread upon a gridiron , began to toast them over the hot coals .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 38]: `` The Colonel said that Norbert thought he would n't get well , '' she concluded ; `` and Mr. Arp said Norbert was the kind that never die , and they had quite an argument . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 11]: `` What were you doing at Jonas Tabor 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 11]: asked Joe , drinking his coffee with a brightening eye .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 10]: `` We were sent for , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 25]: She toasted the bread attentively without replying , and when she decided that it was brown enough , piled it on a warm plate .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 31]: This she brought to him , and kneeling in front of him , her elbow on his knee , offered for his consideration , looking steadfastly up at his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 6]: He began to eat ravenously .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 14]: `` I did n't suppose Jonas would let you come in his house .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 5]: Was he sick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 24]: `` Joe , '' she said , quietly , disregarding his questions -- `` Joe , have you GOT to run away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 12]: `` Yes , I 've got to , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 13]: `` Would you have to go to prison if you stayed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 8]: She asked this with a breathless tensity .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 19]: `` I 'm not going to beg father to help me out , '' he said , determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 15]: `` He said he would n't , and he 'll be spared the chance .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 10]: He wo n't mind that ; nobody will care !
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 2]: Nobody !
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 11]: What does anybody care what _ I _ do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 9]: `` Now you 're thinking of Mamie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 6]: `` I can always tell .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 13]: Whenever you do n't talk naturally you 're thinking of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 18]: He poured down the last of the coffee , growing red to the tips of his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 22]: `` Ariel , '' he said , `` if I ever come back -- '' `` Wait , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 16]: `` Would you have to go to prison right away if they caught you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 14]: `` Oh , it is n't that , '' he laughed , sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 9]: `` But I 'm going to clear out .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 9]: I 'm not going to take any chances .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 15]: I want to see other parts of the world , other kinds of people .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 19]: I might have gone , anyhow , soon , even if it had n't been for last night .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 9]: Do n't you ever feel that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 10]: `` You know I do , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 9]: `` I 've told you -- how often !
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 13]: But , Joe , Joe , -- you have n't any MONEY !
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 10]: You 've got to have money to LIVE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 18]: `` You need n't worry about that , '' returned the master of seven dollars , genially .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 16]: `` I 've saved enough to take care of me for a LONG time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 5]: `` Joe , PLEASE !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 7]: I know it is n't so .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 27]: If you could wait just a little while -- only a few weeks , -- only a FEW , Joe -- '' `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 10]: `` I could let you have all you want .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 12]: It would be such a beautiful thing for me , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 50]: Oh , I know how you 'd feel ; you would n't even let me give you that dollar I found in the street last year ; but this would be only lending it to you , and you could pay me back sometime -- '' `` Ariel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 39]: he exclaimed , and , setting his empty cup upon the floor , took her by the shoulders and shook her till the empty plate which had held the toast dropped from her hand and broke into fragments .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 10]: `` You 've been reading the Arabian Nights ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 11]: `` No , no , '' she cried , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 7]: `` Grandfather would give me anything .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 12]: He 'll give me all the money I ask for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 4]: `` Money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 7]: `` Which of us is wandering ?
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 2]: MONEY ?
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 7]: Roger Tabor give you MONEY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 6]: `` Not for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 11]: A great many things have to be settled first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 5]: `` What things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 28]: `` Joe , '' she asked , earnestly , `` do you think it 's bad of me not to feel things I OUGHT to feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 45]: `` Then I 'm glad , '' she said , and something in the way she spoke made him start with pain , remembering the same words , spoken in the same tone , by another voice , the night before on the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 15]: `` I 'm glad , Joe , because I seemed all wrong to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 16]: Uncle Jonas died last night , and I have n't been able to get sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 32]: Perhaps it 's because I 've been so frightened about you , but I think not , for I was n't sorry even before Colonel Flitcroft told me about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 6]: `` Jonas Tabor dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 12]: `` Why , I saw him on the street yesterday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 19]: `` Yes , and I saw him just before I came out on the porch where you were .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 34]: He was there in the hall ; he and Judge Pike had been having a long talk ; they 'd been in some speculations together , and it had all turned out well .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 40]: It 's very strange , but they say now that Uncle Jonas 's heart was weak -- he was an old man , you know , almost eighty , -- and he 'd been very anxious about his money .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 50]: The Judge had persuaded him to risk it ; and the shock of finding that he 'd made a great deal suddenly -- '' `` I 've heard he 'd had that same shock before , '' said Joe , `` when he sold out to your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 11]: `` Yes , but this was different , grandfather says .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 20]: He told me it was in one of those big risky businesses that Judge Pike likes to go into .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 19]: And last night it was all finished , the strain was over , and Uncle Jonas started home .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 38]: His house is only a little way from the Pikes ' , you know ; but he dropped down in the snow at his own gate , and some people who were going by saw him fall .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 9]: He was dead before grandfather got there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 13]: `` I ca n't be sorry , '' said Joe , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 12]: `` Neither can I. That 's the dreadful part of it !
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 37]: They say he had n't made a will , that though he was sharper than anybody else in the whole world about any other matter of business , that was the one thing he put off .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 68]: And we 're all the kin he had in the world , grandfather and I. And they say '' -- her voice sank to a whisper of excitement -- `` they say he was richer than anybody knew , and that this last business with Judge Pike , the very thing that killed him -- something about grain -- made him five times richer than before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 17]: She put her hand on the boy 's arm , and he let it remain there .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 10]: Her eyes still sought his with a tremulous appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 8]: `` God bless you , Ariel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 13]: `` It 's going to be a great thing for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 6]: Yes , it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 8]: The tears came suddenly to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 39]: `` I was foolish last night , but there had been such a long time of WANTING things ; and now -- and now grandfather and I can go -- '' `` You 're going , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 3]: Joe chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 14]: `` It 's heartless , I suppose , but I 've settled it !
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 15]: We 're going -- '' '' _ I _ know , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 18]: `` You 've told me a thousand times what HE 'S said -- ten times a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 7]: You 're going to Paris ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 3]: `` Paris !
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 6]: Yes , that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 24]: To Paris , where he can see at last how the great ones have painted , -- where the others can show him !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 37]: To Paris , where we can study together , where he can learn how to put the pictures he sees upon canvas , and where I -- '' `` Go on , '' Joe encouraged her .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 9]: `` I want to hear you say it .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 32]: You do n't mean that you 're going to study painting ; you mean that you 're going to learn how to make such fellows as Eugene ask you to dance .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 7]: Go ahead and SAY it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 10]: `` Yes -- to learn how to DRESS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 7]: Joe was silent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 15]: Then he rose and took the ragged overcoat from the back of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 7]: `` Where 's that muffler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 16]: She brought it from where she had placed it to dry , behind the stove .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 37]: `` Joe , '' she said , huskily , `` ca n't you wait till -- '' `` Till the estate is settled and you can coax your grandfather to -- '' `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 8]: But you could go with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 5]: `` To Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 10]: `` He would take you as his secretary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 24]: Joe 's voice rang out gayly as he rose , refreshed by the coffee , toast , and warmth she had given him .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 11]: `` You 've been story-reading , Ariel , like Eugene !
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 5]: ` Secretary ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: `` Please , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 8]: `` Where 's my tin dinner-pail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 14]: He found it himself upon the table where he had set it down .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 15]: `` I 'm going to earn a dishonest living , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 27]: `` I have an engagement to take a freight at a water-tank that 's a friend of mine , half a mile south of the yards .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 13]: Thank God , I 'm going to get away from Canaan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 6]: `` Wait , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 6]: She caught at his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 21]: `` I want you to -- '' He had swung out of the room and was already at the front-door .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 5]: She followed him closely .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: `` Good-bye , Ariel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 5]: WAIT , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 16]: He took her right hand in his own , and gave it a manly shake .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 10]: `` It 's all right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 16]: He threw open the door and stepped out , but she sought to detain him .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 10]: `` Oh , have you GOT to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 10]: `` Do n't you ever worry about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 20]: He bent his head to the storm as he sprang down the steps , and snow-wreaths swirled between them .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 7]: He disappeared in a white whirlwind .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 10]: She stood for several minutes shivering in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 16]: Then it came to her that she would not know where to write to him .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 10]: She ran down to the gate and through it .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 8]: Already the blizzard had covered his footprints .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 16]: VII GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME The passing of Joseph from Canaan was complete .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 42]: It was an evanishment for which there was neither sackcloth nor surprise ; and though there came no news of him it can not be said that Canaan did not hear of him , for surely it could hear itself talk .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 42]: The death of Jonas Tabor and young Louden 's crime and flight incited high doings in the `` National House '' windows ; many days the sages lingered with the broken meats of morals left over from the banquet of gossip .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 32]: But , after all , it is with the ladies of a community that reputations finally rest , and the matrons of Canaan had long ago made Joe 's exceedingly uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 6]: Now they made it certain .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 7]: They did not fail of assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 97]: The most powerful influence in the town was ponderously corroborative : Martin Pike , who stood for all that was respectable and financial , who passed the plate o ' Sundays , who held the fortunes of the town in his left hand , who was trustee for the widow and orphan , -- Martin Pike , patron of all worthy charities , courted by ministers , feared by the wicked and idle , revered by the good , -- Judge Martin Pike never referred to the runaway save in the accents of an august doomster .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: His testimony settled it .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 52]: In time the precise nature of the fugitive 's sins was distorted in report and grew vague ; it was recalled that he had done dread things ; he became a tradition , a legend , and a warning to the young ; a Richard in the bush to frighten colts .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 25]: He was preached at boys caught playing marbles `` for keeps '' : `` Do you want to grow up like Joe Louden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 28]: The very name became a darkling threat , and children of the town would have run had one called suddenly , `` HERE COMES JOE LOUDEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 22]: Thus does the evil men do live after them , and the ill-fame of the unrighteous increase when they are sped !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 46]: Very little of Joseph 's adventures and occupations during the time of his wandering is revealed to us ; he always had an unwilling memory for pain and was not afterwards wont to speak of those years which cut the hard lines in his face .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 38]: The first account of him to reach Canaan came as directly to the windows of the `` National House '' as Mr. Arp , hastening thither from the station , satchel in hand , could bring it .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 56]: This was on a September morning , two years after the flight , and Eskew , it appears , had been to the State Fair and had beheld many things strangely affirming his constant testimony that this unhappy world increaseth in sin ; strangest of all , his meeting with our vagrant scalawag of Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 17]: `` Not a BLAMEBIT of doubt about it , '' declared Eskew to the incredulous conclave .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 36]: `` There was that Joe , and nobody else , stuck up in a little box outside a tent at the Fair Grounds , and sellin ' tickets to see the Spotted Wild Boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 7]: Yes , it was Joe Louden !
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 14]: Think you , Mr. Arp could forget that face , those crooked eyebrows ?
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 6]: Had Eskew tested the recognition ?
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 7]: Had he spoken with the outcast ?
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 4]: Had he not !
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 54]: Ay , but with such peculiar result that the battle of words among the sages began with a true onset of the regulars ; for , according to Eskew 's narrative , when he had delivered grimly at the boy this charge , `` I know you -- YOU 'RE JOE LOUDEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 20]: the extraordinary reply had been made promptly and without change of countenance : `` POSITIVELY NO FREE SEATS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 56]: On this , the house divided , one party maintaining that Joe had thus endeavored to evade recognition , the other -LRB- to the embitterment of Mr. Arp -RRB- that the reply was a distinct admission of identity and at the same time a refusal to grant any favors on the score of past acquaintanceship .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 83]: Goaded by inquiries , Mr. Arp , who had little desire to recall such waste of silver , admitted more than he had intended : that he had purchased a ticket and gone in to see the Spotted Wild Boy , halting in his description of this marvel with the unsatisfactory and acrid statement that the Wild Boy was `` simply SPOTTED , '' -- and the stung query , `` I suppose you know what a spot IS , Squire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 39]: When he came out of the tent he had narrowly examined the ticket-seller , -- who seemed unaware of his scrutiny , and , when not engaged with his tickets , applied himself to a dirty law-looking book .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 22]: It was Joseph Louden , reasserted Eskew , a little taller , a little paler , incredibly shabby and miraculously thin .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 37]: If there were any doubt left , his forehead was somewhat disfigured by the scar of an old wound -- such as might have been caused by a blunt instrument in the nature of a poker .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 33]: Mr. Arp whirled upon Uncle Joe Davey , who was enjoying himself by repeating at intervals the unreasonable words , `` Could n't of be 'n Joe , '' without any explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: `` Why could n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 3]: shouted Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 4]: `` It was !
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 12]: Do you think my eyes are as fur gone as yours ?
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 8]: I saw him , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 16]: The same ornery Joe Louden , run away and sellin ' tickets for a side-show .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 37]: He was n't even the boss of it ; the manager was about the meanest-lookin ' human I ever saw -- and most humans look mighty mean , accordin ' to my way of thinkin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 15]: Riffraff of the riffraff are his friends now , same as they were here .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 2]: Weeds !
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 13]: and HE 'S a weed , always was and always will be !
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 20]: Him and his kind ai n't any more than jimpsons ; overrun everything if you give 'em a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 2]: Devil-flowers !
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 30]: They have to be hoed out and scattered -- even then , like as not , they 'll come back next year and ruin your plantin ' once more .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 19]: That boy Joe 'll turn up here again some day ; you 'll see if he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 23]: He 's a seed of trouble and iniquity , and anything of that kind is sure to come back to Canaan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 18]: Mr. Arp stuck to his prediction for several months ; then he began to waver and evade .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 76]: By the end of the second year following its first utterance , he had formed the habit of denying that he had ever made it at all , and , finally having come to believe with all his heart that the prophecy had been deliberately foisted upon him and put in his mouth by Squire Buckalew , became so sore upon the subject that even the hardiest dared not refer to it in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 21]: Eskew 's story of the ticket-seller was the only news of Joe Louden that came to Canaan during seven years .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 38]: Another citizen of the town encountered the wanderer , however , but under circumstances so susceptible to misconception that , in a moment of illumination , he decided to let the matter rest in a golden silence .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 5]: This was Mr. Bantry .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 50]: Having elected an elaborate course in the Arts , at the University which was of his possessions , what more natural than that Eugene should seek the Metropolis for the short Easter vacation of his Senior year , in order that his perusal of the Masters should be uninterrupted ?
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 47]: But it was his misfortune to find the Metropolitan Museum less interesting than some intricate phases of the gayety of New York -- phases very difficult to understand without elaborate study and a series of experiments which the discreetly selfish permit others to make for them .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 44]: Briefly , Eugene found himself dancing , one night , with a young person in a big hat , at the `` Straw-Cellar , '' a crowded hall , down very deep in the town and not at all the place for Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 43]: Acute crises are to be expected at the `` Straw-Cellar , '' and Eugene was the only one present who was thoroughly surprised when that of this night arrived , though all of the merrymakers were frightened when they perceived its extent .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 9]: There is no need to detail the catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 11]: It came suddenly , and the knife did not flash .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 20]: Sick and thinking of himself , Eugene stood staring at the figure lying before him upon the reddening floor .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 36]: A rabble fought with the quick policemen at the doors , and then the lights went out , extinguished by the proprietor , living up to his reputation for always being thoughtful of his patrons .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 13]: The place had been a nightmare ; it became a black impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 20]: Eugene staggered to one of the open windows , from the sill of which a man had just leaped .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 14]: `` Do n't jump , '' said a voice close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 25]: `` That fellow broke his leg , I think , and they caught him , anyway , as soon as he struck the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 6]: It 's a big raid .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 5]: Come this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 52]: A light hand fell upon his arm and he followed its leading , blindly , to find himself pushed through a narrow doorway and down a flight of tricky , wooden steps , at the foot of which , silhouetted against a street light , a tall policeman was on guard .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 8]: He laid masterful hands on Eugene . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 6]: ` SH , Mack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 8]: whispered a cautious voice from the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 15]: `` That 's a friend of mine and not one of those you need .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 11]: He 's only a student and scared to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 36]: `` Hurry , '' said the policeman , under his breath , twisting Eugene sharply by him into the street ; after which he stormed vehemently : `` On yer way , both of ye !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 6]: Move on up the street !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 12]: Do n't be tryin ' to poke yer heads in here !
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 19]: Ye 'd be more anxious to git out , once ye got in , I tell ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 24]: A sob of relief came from Bantry as he gained the next corner , the slight figure of his conductor at his side .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 21]: `` You 'd better not go to places like the ` Straw-Cellar , ' '' said the latter , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 10]: `` I 'd been watching you for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 12]: You were dancing with the girl who did the cutting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 14]: Eugene leaned against a wall , faint , one arm across his face .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 18]: He was too ill to see , or care , who it was that had saved him .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 20]: `` I never saw her before , '' he babbled , incoherently , `` never , never , never !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 16]: I thought she looked handsome , and asked her if she 'd dance with me .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 60]: Then I saw she seemed queer -- and wild , and she kept guiding and pushing as we danced until we were near that man -- and then she -- then it was all done -- before -- '' `` Yes , '' said the other ; `` she 's been threatening to do it for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 2]: Jealous .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 14]: Mighty good sort of a girl , though , in lots of ways .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 17]: Only yesterday I talked with her and almost thought I 'd calmed her out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 9]: But you ca n't tell with some women .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 42]: They 'll brighten up and talk straight and seem sensible , one minute , and promise to behave , and mean it too , and the next , there they go , making a scene , cutting somebody or killing themselves !
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 7]: You ca n't count on them .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 13]: But that 's not to the point , exactly , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 11]: You 'd better keep away from the ` Straw-Cellar . '
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 71]: If you 'd been caught with the rest you 'd have had a hard time , and they 'd have found out your real name , too , because it 's pretty serious on account of your dancing with her when she did it , and the Canaan papers would have got hold of it and you would n't be invited to Judge Pike 's any more , Eugene . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 16]: Eugene dropped his arm from his eyes and stared into the face of his step-brother .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 5]: `` Joe Louden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 10]: `` I 'll never tell , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 11]: `` You 'd better keep out of all this sort .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 21]: You do n't understand it , and you do n't -- you do n't do it because you care . ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 11]: He smiled wanly , his odd distorted smile of friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 14]: `` When you go back you might tell father I 'm all right .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 23]: I 'm working through a law-school here -- and remember me to Norbert Flitcroft , '' he finished , with a chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 8]: Eugene covered his eyes again and groaned .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 11]: `` It 's all right , '' Joe assured him .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 12]: `` You 're as safe as if it had never happened .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 35]: And I expect '' -- he went on , thoughtfully -- `` I expect , maybe , you 'd prefer NOT to say you 'd seen me , when you go back to Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 7]: Well , that 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 14]: I do n't suppose father will be asking after me -- exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 16]: `` No , he does n't , '' said Eugene , still white and shaking .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 6]: `` Do n't stand talking .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 5]: I 'm sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 8]: `` Of course , '' returned Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 26]: `` But there 's one thing I would like to ask you -- '' `` Your father 's health is perfect , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 16]: `` It -- it -- it was something else , '' Joe stammered , pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 19]: `` Are they all -- are they all -- all right at -- at Judge Pike 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 4]: `` Quite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 5]: Eugene replied , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: `` Are you going to get me away from here ?
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 9]: I 'm sick , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 14]: `` This street , '' said Joe , and cheerfully led the way .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 33]: Five minutes later the two had parted , and Joe leaned against a cheap restaurant sign-board , drearily staring after the lamps of the gypsy night-cab he had found for his step-brother .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 19]: Eugene had not offered to share the vehicle with him , had not even replied to his good-night .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 25]: And Joe himself had neglected to do something he might well have done : he had not asked Eugene for news of Ariel Tabor .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 53]: It will not justify him entirely to suppose that he assumed that her grandfather and she had left Canaan never to return , and therefore Eugene knew nothing of her ; no such explanation serves Joe for his neglect , for the fair truth is that he had not thought of her .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 36]: She had been a sort of playmate , before his flight , a friend taken for granted , about whom he had consciously thought little more than he thought about himself -- and easily forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 54]: Not forgotten in the sense that she had passed out of his memory , but forgotten none the less ; she had never had a place in his imaginings , and so it befell that when he no longer saw her from day to day , she had gone from his thoughts altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 93]: VIII A BAD PENNY TURNS UP Eugene did not inform Canaan , nor any inhabitant , of his adventure of `` Straw-Cellar , '' nor did any hear of his meeting with his step-brother ; and after Mr. Arp 's adventure , five years passed into the imperishable before the town heard of the wanderer again , and then it heard at first hand ; Mr. Arp 's prophecy fell true , and he took it back to his bosom again , claimed it as his own the morning of its fulfilment .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 8]: Joe Louden had come back to Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 14]: The elder Louden was the first to know of his prodigal 's return .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 26]: He was alone in the office of the wooden-butter-dish factory , of which he was the superintendent , when the young man came in unannounced .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 65]: He was still pale and thin ; his eyebrows had the same crook , one corner of his mouth the same droop ; he was only an inch or so taller , not enough to be thought a tall man ; and yet , for a few moments the father did not recognize his son , but stared at him , inquiring his business .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 19]: During those few seconds of unrecognition , Mr. Louden was somewhat favorably impressed with the stranger 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 14]: `` You do n't know me , '' said Joe , smiling cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 10]: `` Perhaps I 've changed in seven years . ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 7]: And he held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 17]: Then Mr. Louden knew ; he tilted back in his desk-chair , his mouth falling open .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 5]: `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 9]: he said , not noticing the out-stretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: `` Have YOU come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 5]: Joe 's hand fell .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 11]: `` Yes , I 've come back to Canaan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 29]: Mr. Louden looked at him a long time without replying ; finally he remarked : `` I see you 've still got a scar on your forehead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 22]: `` Oh , I 've forgotten all about that , '' said the other , twisting his hat in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 13]: `` Seven years wipes out a good many grievances and wrongs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 6]: `` You think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 4]: Mr Louden grunted .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 14]: `` I suppose it might wipe out a good deal with some people .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 10]: How 'd you happen to stop off at Canaan ?
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 9]: On your way somewhere , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 11]: `` No , I 've come back to stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 10]: Mr. Louden plainly received this as no pleasant surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 5]: he asked , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 8]: `` To practise law , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' said the young man .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 11]: `` There ought to be an opening here for me .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 22]: I 'm a graduate of as good a law-school as there is in the country -- '' `` You are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 9]: `` Certainly , '' said Joe , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 17]: `` I 've put myself through , working in the summer -- '' `` Working ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 4]: Mr. Louden snorted .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 4]: `` Side-shows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 16]: `` Oh , worse than that , sometimes , '' returned his son , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 6]: `` Anything I could get .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 14]: But I 've always wanted to come back home and work here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 16]: Mr. Louden leaned forward , a hand on each knee , his brow deeply corrugated .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 13]: `` Do you think you 'll get much practice in Canaan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 30]: I 've had a year in a good office in New York since I left the school , and I think I ought to get along all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: `` Oh , '' said Mr. Louden , briefly .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 5]: `` You do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 16]: `` Who do you think in Canaan would put a case in your hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 15]: `` Oh , I do n't expect to get anything important at the start .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 12]: But after a while -- '' `` With your reputation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 13]: The smile which had faded from Joe 's lips returned to them .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 58]: `` Oh , I know they thought I was a harum-scarum sort of boy , '' he answered lightly , `` and that it was a foolish thing to run away for nothing ; but you had said I must n't come to you for help -- '' `` I meant it , '' said Mr. Louden .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 25]: `` But that 's seven years ago , and I suppose the town 's forgotten all about it , and forgotten me , too .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 12]: So , you see , I can make a fresh start .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 9]: That 's what I came back for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 14]: `` You 've made up your mind to stay here , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 30]: `` I do n't believe , '' said Mr. Louden , with marked uneasiness , `` that Mrs. Louden would be willing to let you live with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 9]: `` No , '' said Joe , gently .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 8]: `` I did n't expect it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 30]: He turned to the window and looked out , averting his face , yet scoring himself with the contempt he had learned to feel for those who pity themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 11]: His father had not even asked him to sit down .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 23]: There was a long silence , disturbed only by Mr. Louden 's breathing , which could be heard , heavy and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 10]: At last Joe turned again , smiling as before .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 16]: `` Well , I wo n't keep you from your work , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 22]: `` I suppose you 're pretty busy -- '' `` Yes , I am , '' responded his father , promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 11]: `` But I 'll see you again before you go .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 9]: I want to give you some advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 10]: `` I 'm not going , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 10]: `` Not going to leave Canaan , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 7]: Where will I find Eugene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 12]: `` At the Tocsin office ; he 's the assistant editor .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 17]: Judge Pike bought the Tocsin last year , and he thinks a good deal of Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 16]: Do n't forget I said to come to see me again before you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 13]: Joe came over to the older man and held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 10]: `` Shake hands , father , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 31]: Mr. Louden looked at him out of small implacable eyes , the steady hostility of which only his wife or the imperious Martin Pike , his employer , could quell .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 14]: `` I do n't see any use in it , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: `` It would n't mean anything .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 14]: All my life I 've been a hard-working man and an abiding man .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 33]: Before you got in trouble you never did anything you ought to ; you ran with the lowest people in town , and I and all your folks were ashamed of you .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 17]: I do n't see that we 've got a call to be any different now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 22]: He swung round to his desk emphatically , on the last word , and Joe turned away and went out quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 31]: But it was a bright morning to which he emerged from the outer doors of the factory , and he made his way towards Main Street at a lively gait .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 19]: As he turned the corner opposite the `` National House , '' he walked into Mr. Eskew Arp .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 7]: The old man drew back angrily .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 8]: `` Lord ` a ' mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 5]: cried Joe , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 6]: `` It 's Mr. Arp !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 7]: I almost ran you down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 32]: Then , as Mr. Arp made no response , but stood stock-still in the way , staring at him fiercely , `` Do n't you know me , Mr. Arp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 5]: the young man asked .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 7]: `` I 'm Joe Louden . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 11]: Eskew abruptly thrust his face close to the other 's .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: `` NO FREE SEATS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 17]: he hissed , savagely ; and swept across to the hotel to set his world afire .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 25]: Joe looked after the irate , receding figure , and watched it disappear into the Main Street door of the `` National House . ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 44]: As the door closed , he became aware of a mighty shadow upon the pavement , and turning , beheld a fat young man , wearing upon his forehead a scar similar to his own , waddling by with eyes fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 8]: `` How are you , Norbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 3]: Joe began .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 7]: `` Do n't you remember me ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 31]: I -- '' He came to a full stop , as the fat one , thrusting out an under lip as his only token of recognition , passed balefully on .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 11]: Joe proceeded slowly until he came to the Tocsin building .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 32]: At the foot of the stairway leading up to the offices he hesitated for a few moments ; then he turned away and walked towards the quieter part of Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 78]: Most of the people he met took no notice of him , only two or three giving him second glances of half-cognizance , as though he reminded them of some one they could not place , and it was not until he had come near the Pike Mansion that he saw a full recognition in the eyes of one of the many whom he knew , and who had known him in his boyhood in the town .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 25]: A lady , turning a corner , looked up carelessly , and then half-stopped within a few feet of him , as if startled .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 18]: Joe 's cheeks went a sudden crimson ; for it was the lady of his old dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 9]: Seven years had made Mamie Pike only prettier .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 33]: She had grown into her young womanhood with an ampleness that had nothing of oversufficiency in it , nor anywhere a threat that some day there might be too much of her .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 56]: Not quite seventeen when he had last seen her , now , at twenty-four , her amber hair elaborately becoming a plump and regular face , all of her old charm came over him once more , and it immediately seemed to him that he saw clearly his real reason for coming back to Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 59]: She had been the Rich-Little-Girl of his child days , the golden princess playing in the Palace-Grounds , and in his early boyhood -LRB- until he had grown wicked and shabby -RRB- he had been sometimes invited to the Pike Mansion for the games and ice-cream of the daughter of the house , before her dancing days began .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 32]: He had gone timidly , not daring ever to `` call '' her in `` Quaker Meeting '' or `` Post-office , '' but watching her reverently and surreptitiously and continually .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 22]: She had always seemed to him the one thing of all the world most rare , most mysterious , most unapproachable .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 38]: She had not offered an apparition less so in those days when he began to come under the suspicion of Canaan , when the old people began to look upon him hotly , the young people coldly .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 45]: His very exclusion wove for him a glamour about her , and she was more than ever his moon , far , lovely , unattainable , and brilliant , never to be reached by his lifted arms , but only by his lifted eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 38]: Nor had his long absence obliterated that light ; somewhere in his dreams it always had place , shining , perhaps , with a fainter lustre as the years grew to seven , but never gone altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 28]: Now , at last , that he stood in her very presence again , it sprang to the full flood of its old brilliance -- and more !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 30]: As she came to her half-stop of surprise , startled , he took his courage in two hands , and , lifting his hat , stepped to her side .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 8]: `` You -- you remember me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 3]: he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' she answered , a little breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 10]: `` Ah , that 's kind of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 13]: he cried , and began to walk on with her , unconsciously .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 14]: `` I feel like a returned ghost wandering about -- invisible and unrecognized .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 9]: So few people seem to remember me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 7]: `` I think you are wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 15]: I think you 'll find everybody remembers you , '' she responded , uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 12]: `` No , I 'm afraid not , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 12]: `` I -- '' `` I 'm afraid they do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: Joe laughed a little .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 14]: `` My father was saying something like that to me a while ago .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 13]: He meant that they used to think me a great scapegrace here .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 6]: Do you mean that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 27]: `` I 'd scarcely like to say , '' she answered , her face growing more troubled ; for they were close on the imperial domain .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 23]: `` But it 's long ago -- and I really did n't do anything so outrageous , it seems to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 4]: He laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 33]: `` I know your father was angry with me once or twice , especially the night I hid on your porch to watch you -- to watch you dance , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 20]: But , you see , I 've come back to rehabilitate myself , to -- '' She interrupted him .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 32]: They were not far from her gate , and she saw her father standing in the yard , directing a painter who was at work on one of the cast-iron deer .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 27]: The Judge was apparently in good spirits , laughing with the workman over some jest between them , but that did not lessen Mamie 's nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 30]: `` Mr. Louden , '' she said , in as kindly a tone as she could , `` I shall have to ask you not to walk with me .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 8]: My father would not like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 6]: Joe stopped with a jerk .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 39]: `` Why , I -- I thought I 'd go in and shake hands with him , -- and tell him I -- '' Astonishment that partook of terror and of awe spread itself instantly upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 4]: `` NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 10]: `` Very well , '' said Joe , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 4]: `` Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 12]: He was too late to get away with any good grace .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 32]: Judge Pike had seen them , and , even as Joe turned to go , rushed down to the gate , flung it open , and motioned his daughter to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 27]: This he did with one wide sweep of his arm , and , with another sweep , forbade Joe to look upon either moon OR sun .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 30]: It was a magnificent gesture : it excluded the young man from the street , Judge Pike 's street , and from the town , Judge Pike 's town .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 63]: It swept him from the earth , abolished him , denied him the right to breathe the common air , to be seen of men ; and , at once a headsman 's stroke and an excommunication , destroyed him , soul and body , thus rebuking the silly Providence that had created him , and repairing Its mistake by annihilating him .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 58]: This hurling Olympian gesture smote the street ; the rails of the car-track sprang and quivered with the shock ; it thundered , and , amid the dumfounding uproar of the wrath of a god , the Will of the Canaanite Jove wrote the words in fiery letters upon the ether : `` CEASE TO BE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 12]: Joe did not go in to shake hands with Judge Pike .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 26]: He turned the next corner a moment later , and went down the quiet street which led to the house which had been his home .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 31]: He did not glance at that somewhat grim edifice , but passed it , his eyes averted , and stopped in front of the long , ramshackle cottage next door .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 44]: The windows were boarded ; the picket-fence dropped even to the ground in some sections ; the chimneys sagged and curved ; the roof of the long porch sprinkled shingles over the unkempt yard with every wind , and seemed about to fall .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 43]: The place was desolate with long emptiness and decay : it looked like a Haunted House ; and nailed to the padlocked gate was a sign , half obliterated with the winters it had fronted , `` For Sale or Rent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 14]: Joe gat him meditatively back to Main Street and to the Tocsin building .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 21]: This time he did not hesitate , but mounted the stairs and knocked upon the door of the assistant editor .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 7]: `` Oh , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: `` YOU 'VE turned up , you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 18]: Mr. Bantry of the Tocsin was not at all the Eugene rescued from the `` Straw-Cellar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 20]: The present gentleman was more the electric Freshman than the frightened adventurer whom Joe had encountered in New York .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 31]: It was to be seen immediately that the assistant editor had nothing undaintily business-like about him , nor was there the litter on his desk which one might have expected .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 25]: He had the air of a gentleman dilettante who amused himself slightly by spending an hour or two in the room now and then .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 39]: It was the evolution to the perfect of his Freshman manner , and his lively apparel , though somewhat chastened by an older taste , might have been foretold from that which had smitten Canaan seven years before .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 36]: He sat not at the orderly and handsome desk , but lay stretched upon a divan of green leather , smoking a cigar of purest ray and reading sleepily a small verse-looking book in morocco .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 66]: His occupation , his general air , the furniture of the room , and his title -LRB- doubtless equipped with a corresponding salary -RRB- might have inspired in an observant cynic the idea that here lay a pet of Fortune , whose position had been the fruit of nepotism , or , mayhap , a successful wooing of some daughter , wife , or widow .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 6]: Eugene looked competent for that .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 15]: `` I 've come back to stay , ` Gene , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 12]: Bantry had dropped his book and raised himself on an elbow .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 8]: `` Exceedingly interesting , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 12]: `` I suppose you 'll try to find something to do .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 29]: I do n't think you could get a place here ; Judge Pike owns the Tocsin , and I greatly fear he has a prejudice against you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 13]: `` I expect he has , '' Joe chuckled , somewhat sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 9]: `` But I do n't want newspaper work .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 8]: I 'm going to practice law . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: you have courage , my festive prodigal .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 3]: VRAIMENT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 16]: Joe cocked his head to one side with his old look of the friendly puppy .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 19]: `` You always did like to talk that noveletty way , ` Gene , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 5]: he said , impersonally .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 5]: Eugene 's color rose .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 11]: `` Have you saved up anything to starve on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 5]: he asked , crisply .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: `` Oh , I 'm not so badly off .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 39]: I 've had a salary in an office for a year , and I had one pretty good day at the races -- '' `` You 'd better go back and have another , '' said his step-brother .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 13]: `` You do n't seem to comprehend your standing in Canaan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 7]: `` I 'm beginning to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 6]: Joe turned to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 11]: `` It 's funny , too -- in a way .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 10]: Well -- I wo n't keep you any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 14]: I just stopped in to say good-day -- '' He paused , faltering .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 13]: `` All right , all right , '' Eugene said , briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 18]: `` And , by-the-way , I have n't mentioned that I saw you in New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 12]: `` Oh , I did n't suppose that you would . ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 14]: `` And you need n't say anything about it , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 26]: `` I do n't think , '' said Joe , -- `` I do n't think that you need be afraid I 'll do that .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 18]: `` Be sure to shut the door , please ; it 's rather noisy with it open .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 11]: Eugene waved his hand and sank back upon the divan .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 12]: Joe went across the street to the `` National House . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 13]: The sages fell as silent as if he had been Martin Pike .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 27]: They had just had the pleasure of hearing a telephone monologue by Mr. Brown , the clerk , to which they listened intently : `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 4]: This is Brown .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 9]: Oh -- oh , it 's Judge Pike ?
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 16]: Yes indeed , Judge , yes indeed , I hear you -- ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 6]: Of course , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 11]: Yes , Judge , I heard he was in town .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 8]: No , he has n't been here .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 8]: Not yet , that is , Judge .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 5]: Yes , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 9]: No , I wo n't , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 3]: Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 6]: I will , I will .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 7]: I hear perfectly , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 4]: Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 5]: Good-bye , Judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 11]: Joe had begun to write his name in the register .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 13]: `` My trunk is still at the station , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 14]: `` I 'll give you my check to send down for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 9]: `` Excuse me , '' said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 7]: `` We have no rooms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: cried Joe , innocently .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 22]: `` Why , I never knew more than eight people to stay here at the same time in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 13]: `` We have no rooms , '' repeated the clerk , curtly .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 8]: `` Is there a convention here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 10]: `` We have no rooms , I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 11]: Joe looked up into the condensed eyes of Mr. Brown .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 12]: `` Oh , '' he said , `` I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 34]: Deathly silence followed him to the door , but , as it closed behind him , he heard the outbreak of the sages like a tidal wave striking a dump-heap of tin cans .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 32]: Two hours later he descended from an evil ark of a cab at the corral attached to Beaver Beach , and followed the path through the marsh to the crumbling pier .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 15]: A red-bearded man was seated on a plank by the water edge , fishing .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 15]: `` Mike , '' said Joe , `` have you got room for me ?
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 24]: Can you take me in for a few days until I find a place in town where they 'll let me stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 38]: The red-bearded man rose slowly , pushed back his hat , and stared hard at the wanderer ; then he uttered a howl of joy and seized the other 's hands in his and shook them wildly .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 7]: `` Glory be on high ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 8]: `` It 's Joe Louden come back !
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 12]: We never knew how we missed ye till ye 'd gone !
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 4]: Place fer ye !
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 5]: Can I find it ?
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 25]: There ai n't a imp o ' perdition in town , includin ' myself , that would n't kill me if I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 21]: Ye 'll have old Maggie 's room , my own aunt 's ; ye remember how she used to dance !
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 10]: She 's been burnin ' below these four years !
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 12]: And we 'll have the celebration of yer return this night .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 17]: There 'll be many of 'em will come when they hear ye 're back in Canaan !
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 17]: Praise God , we 'll all hope ye 're goin ' to stay a while ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 26]: IX `` OUTER DARKNESS '' If any echo of doubt concerning his undesirable conspicuousness sounded faintly in Joe 's mind , it was silenced eftsoons .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 10]: Canaan had not forgotten him -- far from it !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 21]: -- so far that it began pointing him out to strangers on the street the very day of his return .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 57]: His course of action , likewise that of his friends , permitted him little obscurity , and when the rumors of his finally obtaining lodging at Beaver Beach , and of the celebration of his installation there , were presently confirmed , he stood in the lime-light indeed , as a Mephistopheles upsprung through the trap-door .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 20]: The welcoming festivities had not been so discreetly conducted as to accord with the general policy of Beaver Beach .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 40]: An unfortunate incident caused the arrest of one of the celebrators and the ambulancing to the hospital of another on the homeward way , the ensuing proceedings in court bringing to the whole affair a publicity devoutly unsought for .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 55]: Mr. Happy Fear -LRB- such was the habitual name of the imprisoned gentleman -RRB- had to bear a great amount of harsh criticism for injuring a companion within the city limits after daylight , and for failing to observe that three policemen were not too distant from the scene of operations to engage therein .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 44]: `` Happy , if ye had it in mind to harm him , '' said the red-bearded man to Mr. Fear , upon the latter 's return to society , `` why did n't ye do it out here at the Beach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 27]: `` Because , '' returned the indiscreet , `` he did n't say what he was goin ' to say till we got in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 26]: Extraordinary probing on the part of the prosecutor had developed at the trial that the obnoxious speech had referred to the guest of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 76]: The assaulted party , one `` Nashville '' Cory , was not of Canaan , but a bit of drift-wood haply touching shore for the moment at Beaver Beach ; and -- strange is this world -- he had been introduced to the coterie of Mike 's Place by Happy Fear himself , who had enjoyed a brief acquaintance with him on a day when both had chanced to travel incognito by the same freight .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 65]: Naturally , Happy had felt responsible for the proper behavior of his protege -- was , in fact , bound to enforce it ; additionally , Happy had once been saved from a term of imprisonment -LRB- at a time when it would have been more than ordinarily inconvenient -RRB- by help and advice from Joe , and he was not one to forget .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 29]: Therefore he was grieved to observe that his own guest seemed to be somewhat jealous of the hero of the occasion and disposed to look coldly upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 60]: The stranger , however , contented himself with innuendo -LRB- mere expressions of the face and other manner of things for which one could not squarely lay hands upon him -RRB- until such time as he and his sponsor had come to Main Street in the clear dawn on their way to Happy 's apartment -- a variable abode .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 40]: It may be that the stranger perceived what Happy did not ; the three bluecoats in the perspective ; at all events , he now put into words of simple strength the unfavorable conception he had formed of Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 31]: The result was mediaevally immediate , and the period of Mr. Cory 's convalescence in the hospital was almost half that of his sponsor 's detention in the county jail .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 29]: It needed nothing to finish Joe with the good people of Canaan ; had it needed anything , the trial of Happy Fear would have overspilled the necessity .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 41]: An item of the testimony was that Joseph Louden had helped to carry one of the ladies present -- a Miss Le Roy , who had fainted -- to the open air , and had jostled the stranger in passing .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 38]: After this , the oldest woman in Canaan would not have dared to speak to Joe on the street -LRB- even if she wanted to -RRB- , unless she happened to be very poor or very wicked .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 46]: The Tocsin printed an adequate account -LRB- for there was `` a large public interest '' -RRB- , recording in conclusion that Mr. Louden paid the culprit 's fine which was the largest in the power of the presiding judge in his mercy to bestow .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 22]: Editorially , the Tocsin leaned to the facetious : `` Mr. Louden has but recently ` returned to our midst . '
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 16]: We fervently hope that the distinguished Happy Fear will appreciate his patron 's superb generosity .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 14]: We say ` his patron , ' but perhaps we err in this .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 23]: Were it not better to figure Mr. Louden as the lady in distress , Mr. Fear as the champion in the lists ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 25]: In the present case , however , contrary to the rules of romance , the champion falls in duress and passes to the dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 46]: We merely suggest , en passant , that some of our best citizens might deem it a wonderful and beauteous thing if , in addition to paying the fine , Mr. Louden could serve for the loyal Happy his six months in the Bastile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 28]: `` En passant , '' if nothing else , would have revealed to Joe , in this imitation of a better trick , the hand of Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 26]: And , little doubt , he would have agreed with Squire Buckalew in the Squire 's answer to the easily expected comment of Mr. Arp .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 25]: `` Sometimes , '' said Eskew , `` I think that ` Gene Bantry is jest a leetle bit spiderier than he is lazy .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 23]: That 's the first thing he 's written in the Tocsin this month -- one of the boys over there told me .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 18]: He wrote it out of spite against Joe ; but he 'd ought to of done better .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 35]: If his spite had n't run away with what mind he 's got , he 'd of said that both Joe Louden and that tramp Fear ought to of had ten years ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 15]: ` Gene Bantry did n't write that out of spite , '' answered Buckalew .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 18]: `` He only thought he saw a chance to be kind of funny and please Judge Pike .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 18]: The Judge has always thought Joe was a no-account -- '' `` Ai n't he right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 5]: cried Mr. Arp . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 11]: _ I _ do n't say he ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 30]: Squire Buckalew cast a glance at Mr. Brown , the clerk , and , perceiving that he was listening , added , `` The Judge always IS right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 4]: said Colonel Flitcroft .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 40]: `` I ca n't stand up for Joe Louden to any extent , but I do n't think he done wrong , '' Buckalew went on , recovering , `` when he paid this man Fear 's fine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 6]: `` You do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Arp .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 24]: `` Why , have n't you got gumption enough to see -- '' `` Look here , Eskew , '' interposed his antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 18]: `` How many friends have you got that hate to hear folks talk bad about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 6]: `` Not a one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 16]: For once Eskew 's guard was down , and his consistency led him to destruction .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 5]: `` Not a one !
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 7]: It ai n't in human nature .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 8]: They 're bound to enjoy it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 11]: `` Got any friends that would FIGHT for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 8]: Eskew walked straight into this hideous trap .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 11]: There ai n't a dozen men ever LIVED that had !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 58]: Caesar was a popular man , but he did n't have a soul to help him when the crowd lit on him , and I 'll bet old Mark Antony was mighty glad they got him out in the yard before it happened , -- HE would n't have lifted a finger without a gang behind him !
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 21]: Why , all Peter himself could do was to cut off an ear that was n't no use to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 10]: What are you tryin ' to get AT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 19]: The Squire had him ; and paused , and stroked his chin , to make the ruin complete .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 62]: `` Then I reckon you 'll have to admit , '' he murmured , `` that , while I ai n't defendin ' Joe Louden 's character , it was kind of proper for him to stand by a feller that would n't hear nothin ' against him , and fought for him as soon as he DID hear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 11]: Eskew Arp rose from his chair and left the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 20]: It was the only morning in all the days of the conclave when he was the first to leave .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 16]: Squire Buckalew looked after the retreating figure , total triumph shining brazenly from his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 68]: `` I expect , '' he explained , modestly , to the others , -- `` I expect I do n't think any more of Joe Louden than he does , and I 'll be glad when Canaan sees the last of him for good ; but sometimes the temptation to argue with Eskew does lead me on to kind of git the better of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 50]: When Happy Fear had suffered -- with a give-and-take simplicity of patience -- his allotment of months in durance , and was released and sent into the streets and sunshine once more , he knew that his first duty lay in the direction of a general apology to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 37]: But the young man was no longer at Beaver Beach ; the red-bearded proprietor dwelt alone there , and , receiving Happy with scorn and pity , directed him to retrace his footsteps to the town .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 38]: `` Ye must have been in the black hole of incarceration indeed , if ye have n't heard that Mr. Louden has his law-office on the Square , and his livin ' - room behind the office .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 28]: It 's in that little brick buildin ' straight acrost from the sheriff 's door o ' the jail -- ye 've been neighbors this long time !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 30]: A hard time the boy had , persuadin ' any one to rent to him , but by payin ' double the price he got a place at last .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 12]: He 's a practisin ' lawyer now , praise the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 16]: And all the boys and girls of our acquaintance go to him with their troubles .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 23]: Ye 'll see him with a murder case to try before long , as sure as ye 're not worth yer salt !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 19]: But I expect ye can still call him by his name of Joe , all the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 19]: It was a bleak and meagre little office into which Mr. Fear ushered himself to offer his amends .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 100]: The cracked plaster of the walls was bare -LRB- save for dust -RRB- ; there were no shelves ; the fat brown volumes , most of them fairly new , were piled in regular columns upon a cheap pine table ; there was but one window , small-paned and shadeless ; an inner door of this sad chamber stood half ajar , permitting the visitor unreserved acquaintance with the domestic economy of the tenant ; for it disclosed a second room , smaller than the office , and dependent upon the window of the latter for air and light .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 58]: Behind a canvas camp-cot , dimly visible in the obscurity of the inner apartment , stood a small gas-stove , surmounted by a stew-pan , from which projected the handle of a big tin spoon , so that it needed no ghost from the dead to whisper that Joseph Louden , attorney-at-law , did his own cooking .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 6]: Indeed , he looked it !
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 39]: Upon the threshold of the second room reposed a small , worn , light-brown scrub-brush of a dog , so cosmopolitan in ancestry that his species was almost as undeterminable as the cast-iron dogs of the Pike Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 33]: He greeted Mr. Fear hospitably , having been so lately an offcast of the streets himself that his adoption had taught him to lose only his old tremors , not his hopefulness .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 33]: At the same time Joe rose quickly from the deal table , where he had been working with one hand in his hair , the other splattering ink from a bad pen .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 8]: `` Good for you , Happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 5]: he cried , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 11]: `` I hoped you 'd come to see me to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 11]: I 've been thinking about a job for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 8]: `` What kind of a job ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 9]: asked the visitor , as they shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 24]: `` I need one bad enough , but you know there ai n't nobody in Canaan would gim me one , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 17]: Joe pushed him into one of the two chairs which completed the furniture of his office .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 6]: `` Yes , there is .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 42]: I 've got an idea -- '' `` First , '' broke in Mr. Fear , fingering his shapeless hat and fixing his eyes upon it with embarrassment , -- `` first lem me say what I come here to say .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 19]: I -- well -- '' His embarrassment increased and he paused , rubbing the hat between his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 9]: `` About this job , '' Joe began .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 15]: `` We can fix it so -- '' `` No , '' said Happy .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 7]: `` You lem me go on .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 36]: I did n't mean fer to cause you no trouble when I lit on that loud-mouth , ` Nashville ' ; I never thought they 'd git me , or you 'd be dragged in .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 10]: But I jest could n't stand him no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 32]: He had me all wore out -- all evening long a-hintin ' and sniffin ' and wearin ' that kind of a high-smile 'cause they made so much fuss over you .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 14]: And then when we got clear in town he come out with it !
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 19]: Said you was too quiet to suit HIM -- said he could n't see nothin ' TO you !
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 31]: ` Well , ' I says to myself , ` jest let him go on , jest one more , ' I says , ` then he gits it . '
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 4]: And he did .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 31]: Said you tromped on his foot on purpose , said he knowed it , -- when the Lord-a ` mightiest fool on earth knows you never tromped on no one !
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 21]: Said you was one of the po ` rest young sports he ever see around a place like the Beach .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 44]: You see , he thought you was jest one of them fool ` Bloods ' that come around raisin ' a rumpus , and did n't know you was our friend and belonged out there , the same as me or Mike hisself .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 16]: ` Go on , ' I says to myself , ` jest one more ! '
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 24]: ` HE better go home to his mamma , ' he says ; ` he 'll git in trouble if he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 12]: Somebody 'll soak him if he hangs around in MY company .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 10]: _ I _ do n't like his WAYS . '
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 7]: Then I HAD to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 33]: There jest was n't nothin ' LEFT -- but I would n't of done you no harm by it -- '' `` You did n't do me any harm , Happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 7]: `` I mean your repitation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 16]: `` I did n't have one -- so nothing in the world could harm it .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 21]: About your getting some work , now -- '' `` I 'll listen , '' said Happy , rather suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 27]: `` You see , '' Joe went on , growing red , `` I need a sort of janitor here -- '' `` What fer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 8]: Mr. Fear interrupted , with some shortness .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 8]: `` To look after the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 8]: `` You mean these two rooms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 15]: `` There 's a stairway , too , '' Joe put forth , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 10]: `` It would n't be any sinecure , Happy .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 14]: You 'd earn your money ; do n't be afraid of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: Mr. Fear straightened up , his burden of embarrassment gone from him , transferred to the other 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 18]: `` There always was a yellow streak in you , Joe , '' he said , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 15]: `` You 're no good as a liar except when you 're jokin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 7]: A lot you need a janitor !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 19]: You had no business to pay my fine ; you 'd ort of let me worked it out .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 32]: Do you think my eyes ai n't good enough to see how much you needed the money , most of all right now when you 're tryin ' to git started ?
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 23]: If I ever take a cent from you , I hope the hand I hold out fer it 'll rot off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 10]: `` Now do n't say that , Happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 11]: `` I do n't want a job , nohow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 17]: said Mr. Fear , going to the door ; `` I do n't want to work .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 12]: There 's plenty ways fer me to git along without that .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 19]: But I 've said what I come here to say , and I 'll say one thing more .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 10]: Do n't you worry about gittin ' law practice .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 37]: Mike says you 're goin ' to git all you want -- and if there ai n't no other way , why , a few of us 'll go out and MAKE some fer ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 37]: These prophecies and promises , over which Joe chuckled at first , with his head cocked to one side , grew very soon , to his amazement , to wear a supernatural similarity to actual fulfilment .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 73]: His friends brought him their own friends , such as had sinned against the laws of Canaan , those under the ban of the sheriff , those who had struck in anger , those who had stolen at night , those who owed and could not pay , those who lived by the dice , and to his other titles to notoriety was added that of defender of the poor and wicked .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 41]: He found his hands full , especially after winning his first important case -- on which occasion Canaan thought the jury mad , and was indignant with the puzzled Judge , who could not see just how it had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 7]: Joe did not stop at that .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 82]: He kept on winning cases , clearing the innocent and lightening the burdens of the guilty ; he became the most dangerous attorney for the defence in Canaan ; his honorable brethren , accepting the popular view of him , held him in personal contempt but feared him professionally ; for he proved that he knew more law than they thought existed ; nor could any trick him -- failing which , many tempers were lost , but never Joe 's .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 60]: His practice was not all criminal , as shown by the peevish outburst of the eminent Buckalew -LRB- the Squire 's nephew , esteemed the foremost lawyer in Canaan -RRB- , `` Before long , there wo n't be any use trying to foreclose a mortgage or collect a note -- unless this shyster gets himself in jail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 34]: The wrath of Judge Martin Pike was august -- there was a kind of sublimity in its immenseness -- on a day when it befell that the shyster stood betwixt him and money .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 32]: That was a monstrous task -- to stand between these two and separate them , to hold back the hand of Martin Pike from what it had reached out to grasp .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 67]: It was in the matter of some tax-titles which the magnate had acquired , and , in court , Joe treated the case with such horrifying simplicity that it seemed almost credible that the great man had counted upon the ignorance and besottedness of Joe 's client -- a hard-drinking , disreputable old farmer -- to get his land away from him without paying for it .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 68]: Now , as every one knew such a thing to be ludicrously impossible , it was at once noised abroad in Canaan that Joe had helped to swindle Judge Pike out of a large sum of money -- it was notorious that the shyster could bamboozle court and jury with his tricks ; and it was felt that Joe Louden was getting into very deep waters indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 21]: THIS was serious : if the young man did not LOOK OUT , he might find himself in the penitentiary .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 67]: The Tocsin paragraphed him with a fine regularity after this , usually opening with a Walrus-and-the-Carpenter gravity : `` The time has come when we must speak of a certain matter frankly , '' or , `` At last the time has arrived when the demoralization of the bar caused by a certain criminal lawyer must be dealt with as it is and without gloves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 41]: Once when Joe had saved a half-witted negro from `` the extreme penalty '' for murder , the Tocsin had declared , with great originality : `` This is just the kind of thing that causes mobs and justifies them .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 55]: If we are to continue to permit the worst class of malefactors to escape the consequences of their crimes through the unwholesome dexterities and the shifty manipulations and technicalities of a certain criminal lawyer , the time will come when an outraged citizenry may take the enforcement of the law in its own hands .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 8]: Let us call a spade a spade .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 78]: If Canaan 's streets ever echo with the tread of a mob , the fault lies upon the head of Joseph Louden , who has once more brought about a miscarriage of justice ... '' Joe did not move into a larger office ; he remained in the little room with its one window and its fine view of the jail ; his clients were nearly all poor , and many of his fees quite literally nominal .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 53]: Tatters and rags came up the narrow stairway to his door -- tatters and rags and pitiful fineries : the bleared , the sodden , the flaunting and rouged , the furtive and wary , some in rags , some in tags , and some -- the sorriest -- in velvet gowns .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 31]: With these , the distressed , the wrong-doers , the drunken , the dirty , and the very poor , his work lay and his days and nights were spent .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 27]: Ariel had told Roger Tabor that in time Joe might come to be what the town thought him , if it gave him no other chance .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 34]: Only its dinginess and evil surrounded him ; no respectable house was open to him ; the barrooms -- except that of the `` National House '' -- welcomed him gratefully and admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 39]: Once he went to church , on a pleasant morning when nice girls wear pretty spring dresses ; it gave him a thrill of delight to see them , to be near clean , good people once more .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 57]: Inadvertently , he took a seat by his step-mother , who rose with a slight rustle of silk and moved to another pew ; and it happened , additionally , that this was the morning that the minister , fired by the Tocsin 's warnings , had chosen to preach on the subject of Joe himself .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 8]: The outcast returned to his own kind .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 9]: No lady spoke to him upon the street .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 50]: Mamie Pike had passed him with averted eyes since her first meeting with him , but the shunning and snubbing of a young man by a pretty girl have never yet , if done in a certain way , prevented him from continuing to be in love with her .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 8]: Mamie did it in the certain way .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 24]: Joe did not wince , therefore it hurt all the more , for blows from which one cringes lose much of their force .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 18]: The town dog had been given a bad name , painted solid black from head to heel .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 31]: He was a storm centre of scandal ; the entrance to his dingy stairway was in square view of the `` National House , '' and the result is imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 28]: How many of Joe 's clients , especially those sorriest of the velvet gowns , were conjectured to ascend his stairs for reasons more convivial than legal !
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 38]: Yes , he lived with his own kind , and , so far as the rest of Canaan was concerned , might as well have worn the scarlet letter on his breast or branded on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 68]: When he went about the streets he was made to feel his condition by the elaborate avoidance , yet furtive attention , of every respectable person he met ; and when he came home to his small rooms and shut the door behind him , he was as one who has been hissed and shamed in public and runs to bury his hot face in his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 11]: He petted his mongrel extravagantly -LRB- well he might ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 23]: , and would sit with him in his rooms at night , holding long converse with him , the two alone together .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 8]: The dog was not his only confidant .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 22]: There came to be another , a more and more frequent partner to their conversations , at last a familiar spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 23]: This third came from a brown jug which Joe kept on a shelf in his bedroom , a vessel too frequently replenished .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 18]: When the day 's work was done he shut himself up , drank alone and drank hard .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 44]: Sometimes when the jug ran low and the night was late he would go out for a walk with his dog , and would awake in his room the next morning not remembering where he had gone or how he had come home .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 45]: Once , after such a lapse of memory , he woke amazed to find himself at Beaver Beach , whither , he learned from the red-bearded man , Happy Fear had brought him , having found him wandering dazedly in a field near by .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 21]: These lapses grew more frequent , until there occurred that which was one of the strange things of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 37]: It was a June night , a little more than two years after his return to Canaan , and the Tocsin had that day announced the approaching marriage of Eugene Bantry and his employer 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 21]: Joe ate nothing during the day , and went through his work clumsily , visiting the bedroom shelf at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 56]: At ten in the evening he went out to have the jug refilled , but from the moment he left his door and the fresh air struck his face , he had no clear knowledge of what he did or of what went on about him until he woke in his bed the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 40]: And yet , whatever little part of the soul of him remained , that night , still undulled , not numbed , but alive , was in some strange manner lifted out of its pain towards a strange delight .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 34]: His body was an automaton , his mind in bondage , yet there was a still , small consciousness in him which knew that in his wandering something incredible and unexpected was happening .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 74]: What this was he did not know , could not see , though his eyes were open , could not have told himself any more than a baby could tell why it laughs , but it seemed something so beautiful and wonderful that the night became a night of perfume , its breezes bearing the music of harps and violins , while nightingales sang from the maples that bordered the streets of Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 27]: X THE TRYST He woke to the light of morning amazed and full of a strange wonder because he did not know what had amazed him .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 27]: For a little while after his eyes opened , he lay quite motionless ; then he lifted his head slightly and shook it with some caution .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 7]: This had come to be custom .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 31]: The operation assured him of the worst ; the room swam round him , and , with a faint groan , he let his head fall back upon the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 52]: But he could not sleep again ; pain stung its way through his heart as memory began to come back to him , not of the preceding night -- that was all blank , -- but realization that the girl of whom he had dreamed so long was to be married .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 14]: That his dreams had been quite hopeless was no balm to his hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 67]: A chime of bells sounded from a church steeple across the Square , ringing out in assured righteousness , summoning the good people who maintained them to come and sit beneath them or be taken to task ; and they fell so dismally upon Joe 's ear that he bestirred himself and rose , to the delight of his mongrel , who leaped upon him joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 33]: An hour later , or thereabout , the pair emerged from the narrow stairway and stood for a moment , blinking in the fair sunshine , apparently undecided which way to go .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 39]: The church bells were silent ; there was no breeze ; the air trembled a little with the deep pipings of the organ across the Square , and , save for that , the town was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 33]: The paths which crossed the Court-house yard were flecked with steady shadow , the strong young foliage of the maples not moving , having the air of observing the Sabbath with propriety .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 22]: There were benches here and there along the walks , and to one of these Joe crossed , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 33]: The mongrel , at his master 's feet , rolled on his back in morning ecstasy , ceased abruptly to roll and began to scratch his ear with a hind foot intently .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 16]: A tiny hand stretched to pat his head , and the dog licked it appreciatively .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 40]: It belonged to a hard-washed young lady of six -LRB- in starchy , white frills and new , pink ribbons -RRB- , who had run ahead of her mother , a belated church-goer ; and the mongrel charmed her .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: `` Will you give me this dog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 8]: she asked , without any tedious formalities .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 9]: Involuntarily , she departed before receiving a reply .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 42]: The mother , a red-faced matron whom Joe recognized as a sister of Mrs. Louden 's , consequently his step-aunt , swooped at the child with a rush and rustle of silk , and bore her on violently to her duty .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 56]: When they had gone a little way the matron 's voice was heard in sharp reproof ; the child , held by one wrist and hurried along on tiptoe , staring back over one shoulder at Joe , her eyes wide , and her mouth the shape of the `` O '' she was ejaculating .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 26]: The dog looked up with wistful inquiry at his master , who cocked an eyebrow at him in return , wearing much the same expression .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 17]: The mother and child disappeared within the church doors and left the Square to the two .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 21]: Even the hotel showed no signs of life , for the wise men were not allowed to foregather on Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 26]: The organ had ceased to stir the air and all was in quiet , yet a quiet which , for Louden , was not peace .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 23]: He looked at his watch and , without intending it , spoke the hour aloud : `` A quarter past eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 57]: The sound of his own voice gave him a little shock ; he rose without knowing why , and , as he did so , it seemed to him that he heard close to his ear another voice , a woman 's , troubled and insistent , but clear and sweet , saying : `` REMEMBER !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 8]: ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 11]: It was so distinct that he started and looked round .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 4]: Then he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 10]: `` I 'll be seeing circus parades next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 39]: His laughter fled , for , louder than the ringing in his ears , unmistakably came the strains of a far-away brass band which had no existence on land or sea or in the waters under the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 6]: he said to the mongrel .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 9]: `` We need a walk , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 15]: Let 's you and me move on before the camels turn the corner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 37]: The music followed him to the street , where he turned westward toward the river , and presently , as he walked on , fanning himself with his straw hat , it faded and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 8]: But the voice he had heard returned .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 3]: `` REMEMBER !
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 8]: ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 9]: it said again , close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 7]: This time he did not start .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 26]: `` All right , '' he answered , wiping his forehead ; `` if you 'll let me alone , I 'll be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 22]: At a dingy saloon corner , near the river , a shabby little man greeted him heartily and petted the mongrel .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 24]: `` I 'm mighty glad you did n't go , after all , Joe , '' he added , with a brightening face .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 7]: `` Go where , Happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 5]: Mr. Fear looked grave .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 14]: `` Do n't you rec ` lect meetin ' me last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 5]: Louden shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 4]: Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 12]: The other 's jaw fell and his brow corrugated with self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 14]: `` Well , if that do n't show what a thick-head I am !
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 14]: I thought ye was all right er I 'd gone on with ye .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 12]: Nobody c 'd ` a ' walked straighter ner talked straighter .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 19]: Said ye was goin ' to leave Canaan fer good and did n't want nobody to know it .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 29]: Said ye was goin ' to take the ` leven-o'clock through train fer the West , and told me I could n't come to the deepo with ye .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 13]: Said ye 'd had enough o ' Canaan , and of everything !
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 47]: I follered ye part way to the deepo , but ye turned and made a motion fer me to go back , and I done it , because ye seemed to be kind of in trouble , and I thought ye 'd ruther be by yerself .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 11]: Well , sir , it 's one on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 9]: `` Not at all , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 7]: `` I was all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 5]: `` Was ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 8]: `` DO remember , do ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 9]: `` Almost , '' Joe smiled , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 12]: `` ALMOST , '' echoed Happy , shaking his head seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 25]: `` I tell ye , Joe , ef I was YOU -- '' he began slowly , then paused and shook his head again .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 54]: He seemed on the point of delivering some advice , but evidently perceiving the snobbishness of such a proceeding , or else convinced by his own experience of the futility of it , he swerved to cheerfulness : `` I hear the boys is all goin ' to work hard fer the primaries .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 24]: Mike says ye got some chances ye do n't know about ; HE swears ye 'll be the next Mayor of Canaan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 6]: Folly and nonsense , Happy !
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 16]: That 's the kind of thing I used to think when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 6]: But now -- pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 8]: Joe broke off with a tired laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: `` Tell them not to waste their time .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 11]: Are you going out to the Beach this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 8]: The little man lowered his eyes moodily .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 21]: `` I 'll be near there , '' he said , scraping his patched shoe up and down the curbstone .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 9]: `` That feller 's in town agin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 6]: `` What fellow ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 30]: ` Nashville ' they call him ; Ed 's the name he give the hospital : Cory -- him that I soaked the night you come back to Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 11]: He 's after Claudine to git his evens with me .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 12]: He 's made a raise somewheres , and plays the spender .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 25]: And her -- well , I reckon she 's tired waitin ' table at the National House ; tired o ' me , too .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 18]: I got a hint that they 're goin ' out to the Beach together this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 10]: Joe passed his hand wearily over his aching forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 16]: `` I understand , '' he said , `` and you 'd better try to .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 9]: Cory 's laying for you , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 8]: You say he 's after your wife ?
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 27]: He must have set about it pretty openly if they 're going to the Beach to-day , for there is always a crowd there on Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 13]: Is it hard for you to see why he 's doing it ?
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 10]: It 's because he wants to make you jealous .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 3]: What for ?
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 8]: So that you 'll tackle him again .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 7]: And why does he want that ?
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 8]: Because he 's ready for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: The other 's eyes suddenly became bloodshot , his nostrils expanding incredibly .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 6]: `` READY , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 5]: He BETTER be ready .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 9]: I -- '' `` That 's enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 5]: Joe interrupted , swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 9]: `` We 'll have no talk like that .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 9]: I 'll settle this for you , myself .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 28]: You send word to Claudine that I want to see her at my office to-morrow morning , and you -- you stay away from the Beach to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: Give me your word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 6]: Mr. Fear 's expression softened .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 10]: `` All right , Joe , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 10]: `` I 'll do whatever you tell me to .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 16]: Any of us 'll do that ; we sure know who 's our friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 9]: `` Keep out of trouble , Happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 9]: Joe turned to go and they shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 12]: `` Good day , and -- keep out of trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 30]: When he had gone , Mr. Fear 's countenance again gloomed ominously , and , shaking his head , he ruminatively entered an adjacent bar through the alley door .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 36]: The Main Street bridge was an old-fashioned , wooden , covered one , dust-colored and very narrow , squarely framing the fair , open country beyond ; for the town had never crossed the river .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 31]: Joe found the cool shadow in the bridge gracious to his hot brow , and through the slender chinks of the worn flooring he caught bright glimpses of running water .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 17]: When he came out of the other end he felt enough refreshed to light a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 11]: `` Well , here I am , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 16]: `` Across Main Street bridge -- and it must be getting on toward noon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 17]: He spoke almost with the aspect of daring , and immediately stood still , listening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 17]: ` REMEMBER , '' ' he ventured to repeat , again daring , '' ` REMEMBER !
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 9]: ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 5]: And again he listened .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 14]: Then he chuckled faintly with relief , for the voice did not return .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 12]: `` Thank God , I 've got rid of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 9]: `` And of the circus band too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 38]: A dust road turned to the right , following the river and shaded by big sycamores on the bank ; the mongrel , intensely preoccupied with this road , scampered away , his nose to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 9]: `` Good enough , '' said the master .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 11]: `` Lead on and I 'll come after you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 8]: But he had not far to follow .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 59]: The chase led him to a half-hollow log which lay on a low , grass-grown levee above the stream , where the dog 's interest in the pursuit became vivid ; temporarily , however , for after a few minutes of agitated investigation , he was seized with indifference to the whole world ; panted briefly ; slept .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 16]: Joe sat upon the log , which was in the shade , and smoked . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 5]: ` REMEMBER ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 7]: He tried it once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 10]: ` ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 8]: Safety still ; the voice came not .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 59]: But the sound of his own repetition of the words brought him an eerie tremor ; for the mist of a memory came with it ; nothing tangible , nothing definite , but something very far away and shadowy , yet just poignant enough to give him a queer feeling that he was really keeping an appointment here .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 12]: Was it with some water-sprite that would rise from the river ?
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 9]: Was it with a dryad of the sycamores ?
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 39]: He knew too well that he might expect strange fancies to get hold of him this morning , and , as this one grew uncannily stronger , he moved his head briskly as if to shake it off .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 18]: The result surprised him ; the fancy remained , but his headache and dizziness had left him .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 15]: A breeze wandered up the river and touched the leaves and grass to life .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 67]: Sparrows hopped and chirped in the branches , absurdly surprised ; without doubt having concluded in the Sunday stillness that the world would drowse forever ; and the mongrel lifted his head , blinked at them , hopelessly wishing they would alight near him , scratched his ear with the manner of one who has neglected such matters overlong ; reversed his position ; slept again .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 41]: The young corn , deep green in the bottomland , moved with a staccato flurry , and the dust ghost of a mad whirling dervish sped up the main road to vanish at the bridge in a climax of lunacy .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 49]: The stirring air brought a smell of blossoms ; the distance took on faint lavender hazes which blended the outlines of the fields , lying like square coverlets upon the long slope of rising ground beyond the bottom-land , and empurpled the blue woodland shadows of the groves .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 48]: For the first time , it struck Joe that it was a beautiful day , and it came to him that a beautiful day was a thing which nothing except death , sickness , or imprisonment could take from him -- not even the ban of Canaan !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 65]: Unforewarned , music sounded in his ears again ; but he did not shrink from it now ; this was not the circus band he had heard as he left the Square , but a melody like a far-away serenade at night , as of `` the horns of elf-land faintly blowing '' ; and he closed his eyes with the sweetness of it .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 5]: `` Go ahead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 8]: `` Do that all you want to .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 25]: If you 'll keep it up like this awhile , I 'll follow with ` Little Brown Jug , How I Love Thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 9]: It seems to pay , after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 27]: The welcome strains , however , were but the prelude to a harsher sound which interrupted and annihilated them : the Court-house bell clanging out twelve .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 15]: `` It 's noon and I 'm ` across Main Street bridge . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 10]: He opened his eyes and looked about him whimsically .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 7]: Then he shook his head again .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 14]: A lady had just emerged from the bridge and was coming toward him .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 14]: It would be hard to get at Joe 's first impressions of her .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: We can find conveyance for only the broadest and heaviest .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 37]: Ancient and modern instances multiply the case of the sleeper who dreams out a long story in accurate color and fine detail , a tale of years , in the opening and shutting of a door .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 14]: So with Joseph , in the brief space of the lady 's approach .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 30]: And with him , as with the sleeper , it must have been -- in fact it was , in his recollections , later -- a blur of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 27]: At first sight of her , perhaps it was pre-eminently the shock of seeing anything so exquisite where he had expected to see nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 55]: For she was exquisite -- horrid as have been the uses of the word , its best and truest belong to her ; she was that and much more , from the ivory ferrule of the parasol she carried , to the light and slender footprint she left in the dust of the road .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 16]: Joe knew at once that nothing like her had ever before been seen in Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 32]: He had little knowledge of the millinery arts , and he needed none to see the harmony -- harmony like that of the day he had discovered a little while ago .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 24]: Her dress and hat and gloves and parasol showed a pale lavender overtint like that which he had seen overspreading the western slope .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 27]: -LRB- Afterward , he discovered that the gloves she wore that day were gray , and that her hat was for the most part white . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 39]: The charm of fabric and tint belonging to what she wore was no shame to her , not being of primal importance beyond herself ; it was but the expression of her daintiness and the adjunct of it .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 68]: She was tall , but if Joe could have spoken or thought of her as `` slender , '' he would have been capable of calling her lips `` red , '' in which case he would not have been Joe , and would have been as far from the truth as her lips were from red , or as her supreme delicateness was from mere slenderness .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 29]: Under the summer hat her very dark hair swept back over her temples with something near trimness in the extent to which it was withheld from being fluffy .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 41]: It may be that this approach to trimness , which was , after all , only a sort of coquetry with trimness , is the true key to the mystery of the vision of the lady who appeared to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 22]: Let us say that she suppressed everything that went beyond grace ; that the hint of floridity was abhorrent to her .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 29]: `` Trim '' is as clumsy as `` slender '' ; she had escaped from the trimness of girlhood as wholly as she had gone through its coltishness .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 4]: `` Exquisite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 19]: Let us go back to Joe 's own blurred first thought of her and be content with that !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 21]: She was to pass him -- so he thought -- and as she drew nearer , his breath came faster .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 3]: `` REMEMBER !
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 8]: ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 12]: Was THIS the fay of whom the voice had warned him ?
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 12]: With that , there befell him the mystery of last night .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 40]: He did not remember , but it was as if he lived again , dimly , the highest hour of happiness in a life a thousand years ago ; perfume and music , roses , nightingales and plucked harp-strings .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 9]: Yes ; something wonderful was happening to him .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 20]: She had stopped directly in front of him ; stopped and stood looking at him with her clear eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 33]: He did not lift his own to hers ; he had long experience of the averted gaze of women ; but it was not only that ; a great shyness beset him .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 59]: He had risen and removed his hat , trying -LRB- ineffectually -RRB- not to clear his throat ; his every-day sense urging upon him that she was a stranger in Canaan who had lost her way -- the preposterousness of any one 's losing the way in Canaan not just now appealing to his every -- day sense .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 31]: `` Can I -- can I -- '' he stammered , blushing miserably , meaning to finish with `` direct you , '' or `` show you the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 19]: Then he looked at her again and saw what seemed to him the strangest sight of his life .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 13]: The lady 's eyes had filled with tears -- filled and overfilled .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 15]: `` I 'll sit here on the log with you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 15]: And her voice was the voice which he had heard saying , `` REMEMBER !
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 8]: ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 4]: `` WHAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 10]: `` You do n't need to dust it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 6]: she went on , tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 11]: And even then he did not know who she was .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 44]: XI WHEN HALF-GODS GO There was a silence , for if the dazzled young man could have spoken at all , He could have found nothing to say ; and , perhaps , the lady would not trust her own voice just then .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 46]: His eyes had fallen again ; he was too dazed , and , in truth , too panic-stricken , now , to look at her , though if he had been quite sure that she was part of a wonderful dream he might have dared .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 59]: She was seated beside him , and had handed him her parasol in a little way which seemed to imply that of course he had reached for it , so that it was to be seen how used she was to have all tiny things done for her , though this was not then of his tremulous observing .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 65]: He did perceive , however , that he was to furl the dainty thing ; he pressed the catch , and let down the top timidly , as if fearing to break or tear it ; and , as it closed , held near his face , he caught a very faint , sweet , spicy emanation from it like wild roses and cinnamon .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 33]: He did not know her ; but his timidity and a strange little choke in his throat , the sudden fright which had seized upon him , were not caused by embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 42]: He had no thought that she was one he had known but could not , for the moment , recall ; there was nothing of the awkwardness of that ; no , he was overpowered by the miracle of this meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 32]: And yet , white with marvelling , he felt it to be so much more touchingly a great happiness than he had ever known that at first it was inexpressibly sad .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 24]: At last he heard her voice again , shaking a little , as she said : `` I am glad you remembered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 5]: `` Remembered what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 3]: he faltered .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 7]: `` Then you do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 7]: `` And yet you came . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 9]: `` Came here , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 9]: `` Yes -- now , at noon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 9]: he half whispered , unable to speak aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 13]: `` Was it you who said -- who said , ` Remember !
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 17]: Across -- across -- '' ' '' ` Across Main Street bridge at noon ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 7]: she finished for him , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 11]: He took a deep breath in the wonder of it .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 9]: `` Where was it you said that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 5]: he asked , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 7]: `` Was it last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 15]: `` Do n't you even know that you came to meet me ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 13]: _ I _ -- came to -- to meet -- you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 17]: She gave a little pitying cry , very near a sob , seeing his utter bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 15]: `` It was like the strangest dream in the world , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 13]: `` You were at the station when I came , last night .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 8]: You do n't remember at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 16]: His eyes downcast , his face burning hotly , he could only shake his head .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 57]: `` I thought no one would be there , for I had not written to say what train I should take , but when I stepped down from the platform , you were standing there ; though you did n't see me at first , not until I had called your name and ran to you .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 21]: You said , ` I 've come to meet you , ' but you said it queerly , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 39]: And then you called a carriage for me ; but you seemed so strange you could n't tell how you knew that I was coming , and -- and then I -- I understood you were n't yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 12]: You were very quiet , but I knew , I knew !
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 36]: So I made you get into the carriage -- and -- and -- '' She faltered to a stop , and with that , shame itself brought him courage ; he turned and faced her .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 40]: She had lifted her handkerchief to her eyes , but at his movement she dropped it , and it was not so much the delicate loveliness of her face that he saw then as the tears upon her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 7]: `` Ah , poor boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 4]: `` I knew !
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 4]: I knew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 9]: `` You -- you took me home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 12]: `` You told me where you lived , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 9]: `` Yes , I took you home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 12]: `` I do n't understand , '' he stammered , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 13]: She leaned toward him slightly , looking at him with great intentness .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 13]: `` You did n't know me last night , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 8]: `` Do you know me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 11]: For answer he could only stare at her , dumfounded .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 9]: He lifted an unsteady hand toward her appealingly .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 18]: But the manner of the lady , as she saw the truth , underwent an April change .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 39]: She drew back lightly ; he was favored with the most delicious , low laugh he had ever heard , and , by some magic whisk which she accomplished , there was no sign of tears about her .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 11]: I 'm glad you 're the same , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 10]: `` You never would or could pretend very well .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 26]: I 'm glad you 're the same , and I 'm glad I 've changed , though that is n't why you have forgotten me .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 11]: You 've forgotten me because you never thought of me .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 20]: Perhaps I should not have known you if you had changed a great deal -- as I have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 8]: He started , leaning back from her .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 5]: `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 47]: That funny little twist of the head you always had , like a -- like a -- well , you know I must have told you a thousand times that it was like a nice friendly puppy ; so why should n't I say so now ?
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 4]: And your eyebrows !
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 15]: When you look like that , nobody could ever forget you , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 25]: He rose from the log , and the mongrel leaped upon him uproariously , thinking they were to go home , belike to food .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 5]: The lady laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: `` Do n't let him spoil my parasol .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 15]: And I must warn you now : Never , never TREAD ON MY SKIRT !
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 9]: I 'm very irritable about such things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 12]: He had taken three or four uncertain backward steps from her .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 99]: She sat before him , radiant with laughter , the loveliest creature he had ever seen ; but between him and this charming vision there swept , through the warm , scented June air , a veil of snow like a driven fog , and , half obscured in the heart of it , a young girl stood , knee-deep in a drift piled against an old picket gate , her black water-proof and shabby skirt flapping in the blizzard like torn sails , one of her hands out-stretched toward him , her startled eyes fixed on his .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 34]: `` And , oh , how like you , '' said the lady ; `` how like you and nobody else in the world , Joe , to have a yellow dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 5]: `` ARIEL TABOR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 8]: His lips formed the words without sound .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 8]: `` Is n't it about time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 17]: `` Are strange ladies in the HABIT of descending from trains to take you home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 23]: Once , upon a white morning long ago , the sensational progress of a certain youth up Main Street had stirred Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 9]: But that day was as nothing to this .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 48]: Mr. Bantry had left temporary paralysis in his wake ; but in the case of the two young people who passed slowly along the street to-day it was petrifaction , which seemingly threatened in several instances -LRB- most notably that of Mr. Arp -RRB- to become permanent .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 73]: The lower portion of the street , lined with three and four story buildings of brick and stone , rather grim and hot facades under the mid-day sun , afforded little shade to the church-comers , who were working homeward in processional little groups and clumps , none walking fast , though none with the appearance of great leisure , since neither rate of progress would have been esteemed befitting the day .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 37]: The growth of Canaan , steady , though never startling , had left almost all of the churches down-town , and Main Street the principal avenue of communication between them and the `` residence section . ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 42]: So , to-day , the intermittent procession stretched along the new cement side-walks from a little below the Square to Upper Main Street , where maples lined the thoroughfare and the mansions of the affluent stood among pleasant lawns and shrubberies .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 77]: It was late ; for this had been a communion Sunday , and those far in advance , who had already reached the pretty and shady part of the street , were members of the churches where services had been shortest ; though few in the long parade looked as if they had been attending anything very short , and many heads of families were crisp in their replies to the theological inquiries of their offspring .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 123]: The men imparted largely a gloom to the itinerant concourse , most of them wearing hot , long black coats and having wilted their collars ; the ladies relieving this gloom somewhat by the lighter tints of their garments ; the spick-and-span little girls relieving it greatly by their white dresses and their faces , the latter bright with the hope of Sunday ice-cream ; while the boys , experiencing some solace in that they were finally out where a person could at least scratch himself if he had to , yet oppressed by the decorous necessities of the day , marched along , furtively planning , behind imperturbably secretive countenances , various means for the later dispersal of an odious monotony .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 87]: Usually the conversation of this long string of the homeward-bound was not too frivolous or worldly ; nay , it properly inclined to discussion of the sermon ; that is , praise of the sermon , with here and there a mild `` I-didn ` t-like-his-saying '' or so ; and its lighter aspects were apt to concern the next `` Social , '' or various pleasurable schemes for the raising of funds to help the heathen , the quite worthy poor , or the church .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 41]: This was the serious and seemly parade , the propriety of whose behavior was to-day almost disintegrated when the lady of the bridge walked up the street in the shadow of a lacy , lavender parasol carried by Joseph Louden .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 37]: The congregation of the church across the Square , that to which Joe 's step-aunt had been late , was just debouching , almost in mass , upon Main Street , when these two went by .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 28]: It is not quite the truth to say that all except the children came to a dead halt , but it is not very far from it .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 10]: The air was thick with subdued exclamations and whisperings .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 5]: Here is no mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 26]: Joe was probably the only person of respectable derivation in Canaan who had not known for weeks that Ariel Tabor was on her way home .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 30]: And the news that she had arrived the night before had been widely disseminated on the way to church , entering church , IN church -LRB- even so ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 7]: , and coming out of church .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 33]: An account of her house in the Avenue Henri Martin , and of her portrait in the Salon -- a mysterious business to many , and not lacking in grandeur for that !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 38]: -- had occupied two columns in the Tocsin , on a day , some months before , when Joe had found himself inimically head-lined on the first page , and had dropped the paper without reading further .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 34]: Ariel 's name had been in the mouth of Canaan for a long time ; unfortunately for Joe , however , not in the mouth of that Canaan which held converse with him .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 6]: Joe had not known her .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 19]: The women recognized her , infallibly , at first glance ; even those who had quite forgotten her .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: And the women told their men .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 27]: Hence the un-Sunday-like demeanor of the procession , for few towns hold it more unseemly to stand and stare at passers-by , especially on the Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 14]: -- BUT Ariel Tabor returned -- and walking with -- WITH JOE LOUDEN !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 13]: ... A low but increasing murmur followed the two as they proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 29]: It ran up the street ahead of them ; people turned to look back and paused , so that they had to walk round one or two groups .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 20]: They had , also , to walk round Norbert Flitcroft , which was very like walking round a group .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 28]: He was one of the few -LRB- he was waddling home alone -RRB- who did not identify Miss Tabor , and her effect upon him was extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 19]: His mouth opened and he gazed stodgily , his widening eyes like sun-dogs coming out of a fog .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 94]: He did not recognize her escort ; did not see him at all until they had passed , after which Mr. Flitcroft experienced a few moments of trance ; came out of it stricken through and through ; felt nervously of his tie ; resolutely fell in behind the heeling mongrel and followed , at a distance of some forty paces , determined to learn what household this heavenly visitor honored , and thrilling with the intention to please that same household with his own presence as soon and as often as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 49]: Ariel flushed a little when she perceived the extent of their conspicuousness ; but it was not the blush that Joe remembered had reddened the tanned skin of old ; for her brownness had gone long ago , though it had not left her merely pink and white .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 18]: This was a delicate rosiness rising from her cheeks to her temples as the earliest dawn rises .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 41]: If there had been many words left in Joe , he would have called it a divine blush ; it fascinated him , and if anything could have deepened the glamour about her , it would have been this blush .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 14]: He did not understand it , but when he saw it he stumbled .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 66]: Those who gaped and stared were for him only blurs in the background ; truly , he saw `` men as trees walking '' ; and when it became necessary to step out to the curb in passing some clump of people , it was to him as if Ariel and he , enchantedly alone , were working their way through underbrush in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 45]: He kept trying to realize that this lady of wonder was Ariel Tabor , but he could not ; he could not connect the shabby Ariel , whom he had treated as one boy treats another , with this young woman of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 52]: He had always been embarrassed , himself , and ashamed of her , when anything she did made him remember that , after all , she was a girl ; as , on the day he ran away , when she kissed a lock of his hair escaping from the bandage .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 22]: With that recollection , even his ears grew red : it did not seem probable that it would ever happen again !
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 13]: The next instant he heard himself calling her `` Miss Tabor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 6]: At this she seemed amused .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 24]: `` You ought to have called me that , years ago , '' she said , `` for all you knew me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 12]: `` I did know her -- YOU , I mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 17]: `` I used to know nearly everything you were going to say before you said it .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 13]: It seems strange now -- '' `` Yes , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 8]: `` It does seem strange now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 18]: `` Somehow , '' he went on , `` I doubt if now I 'd know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 19]: `` Somehow , '' she echoed , with fine gravity , `` I doubt it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 45]: Although he had so dim a perception of the staring and whispering which greeted and followed them , Ariel , of course , was thoroughly aware of it , though the only sign she gave was the slight blush , which very soon disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 61]: That people turned to look at her may have been not altogether a novelty : a girl who had learned to appear unconscious of the Continental stare , the following gaze of the boulevards , the frank glasses of the Costanza in Rome , was not ill equipped to face Main Street , Canaan , even as it was to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 52]: Under the sycamores , before they started , they had not talked a great deal ; there had been long silences : almost all her questions concerning the period of his runaway absence ; she appeared to know and to understand everything which had happened since his return to the town .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 32]: He had not , in his turn , reached the point where he would begin to question her ; he was too breathless in his consciousness of the marvellous present hour .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 15]: She had told him of the death of Roger Tabor , the year before .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 31]: `` Poor man , '' she said , gently , `` he lived to see ` how the other fellows did it ' at last , and everybody liked him .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 8]: He was very happy over there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 21]: After a little while she had said that it was growing close upon lunch-time ; she must be going back .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 13]: `` Then -- then -- good-bye , '' he replied , ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 9]: `` I 'm afraid you do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 12]: It would n't do for you to be seen with me .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 8]: Perhaps , though , you do understand .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 17]: Was n't that why you asked me to meet you out here beyond the bridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 26]: In answer she looked at him full and straight for three seconds , then threw back her head and closed her eyes tight with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 32]: Without a word she took the parasol from him , opened it herself , placed the smooth white coral handle of it in his hand , and lightly took his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 13]: There was no further demur on the part of the young man .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 14]: He did not know where she was going ; he did not ask .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 28]: Soon after Norbert turned to follow them , they came to the shady part of the street , where the town in summer was like a grove .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 18]: Detachments from the procession had already , here and there , turned in at the various gates .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 27]: Nobody , however , appeared to have gone in-doors , except for fans , armed with which immediately to return to rockers upon the shaded verandas .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 32]: As Miss Tabor and Joe went by , the rocking-chairs stopped ; the fans poised , motionless ; and perspiring old gentlemen , wiping their necks , paused in arrested attitudes .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 65]: Once Ariel smiled politely , not at Mr. Louden , and inclined her head twice , with the result that the latter , after thinking for a time of how gracefully she did it and how pretty the top of her hat was , became gradually conscious of a meaning in her action : that she had bowed to some one across the street .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 28]: He lifted his hat , about four minutes late , and discovered Mamie Pike and Eugene , upon the opposite pavement , walking home from church together .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 4]: Joe changed color .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 44]: There , just over the way , was she who had been , in his first youth , the fairy child , the little princess playing in the palace yard , and always afterward his lady of dreams , his fair unreachable moon !
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 14]: And Joe , seeing her to-day , changed color ; that was all !
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 52]: He had passed Mamie in the street only a week before , and she had seemed all that she had always seemed ; to-day an incomprehensible and subtle change had befallen her -- a change so mystifying to him that for a moment he almost doubted that she was Mamie Pike .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 44]: It came to him with a breath-taking shock that her face lacked a certain vivacity of meaning ; that its sweetness was perhaps too placid ; that there would have been a deeper goodness in it had there been any hint of daring .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 27]: Astonishing questions assailed him , startled him : could it be true that , after all , there might be some day too much of her ?
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 10]: Was her amber hair a little too -- FLUFFY ?
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 8]: Was something the matter with her dress ?
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 9]: Everything she wore had always seemed so beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 8]: Where had the exquisiteness of it gone ?
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 10]: For there was surely no exquisiteness about it now !
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 21]: It was incredible that any one could so greatly alter in the few days elapsed since he had seen her .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 3]: Strange matters !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 6]: Mamie had never looked prettier .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 20]: At the sound of Ariel 's voice he emerged from the profundities of his psychic enigma with a leap .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 12]: `` She is lovelier than ever , is n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 11]: `` Yes , indeed , '' he answered , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 36]: `` Would you still risk -- '' she began , smiling , but , apparently thinking better of it , changed her question : `` What is the name of your dog , Mr. Louden ?
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 7]: You have n't told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 16]: `` Oh , he 's just a yellow dog , '' he evaded , unskilfully .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 5]: `` YOUNG MAN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 5]: she said , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 18]: `` Well , '' he admitted , reluctantly , `` I call him Speck for short . ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 6]: `` And what for long ?
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 9]: I want to know his real name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 50]: `` It 's mighty inappropriate , because we 're fond of each other , '' said Joe , `` but when I picked him up he was so yellow , and so thin , and so creeping , and so scared that I christened him ` Respectability . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 18]: She broke into light laughter , stopped short in the midst of it , and became grave .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 14]: `` Ah , you 've grown bitter , '' she said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 9]: `` I told you I liked him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 5]: She did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 40]: They were now opposite the Pike Mansion , and to his surprise she turned , indicating the way by a touch upon his sleeve , and crossed the street toward the gate , which Mamie and Eugene had entered .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 19]: Mamie , after exchanging a word with Eugene upon the steps , was already hurrying into the house .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 15]: Ariel paused at the gate , as if waiting for Joe to open it .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 16]: He cocked his head , his higher eyebrow rose , and the distorted smile appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 15]: `` I do n't believe we 'd better stop here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 18]: `` The last time I tried it I was expunged from the face of the universe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 7]: `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 6]: `` I 'm staying here .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 18]: Judge Pike has charge of all my property ; he was the administrator , or something . ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 19]: Then seeing him chopfallen and aghast , she went on : `` Of course you do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 8]: You do n't know anything about me .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 7]: You have n't even asked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 9]: `` You 're going to live HERE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 9]: `` Will you come to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 8]: `` Will you come this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 4]: He grew white .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 11]: `` You know I ca n't , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 6]: `` You came here once .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 16]: You risked a good deal then , just to see Mamie dance by a window .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 12]: Do n't you dare a little for an old friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 8]: `` All right , '' he gulped .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 6]: `` I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 26]: Mr. Bantry had come down to the gate and was holding it open , his eyes fixed upon Ariel , within them a rising glow .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 14]: An impression came to Joe afterward that his step-brother had looked very handsome .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 10]: `` Possibly you remember me , Miss Tabor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 14]: said Eugene , in a deep and impressive voice , lifting his hat .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 14]: `` We were neighbors , I believe , in the old days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 20]: She gave him her hand in a fashion somewhat mannerly , favoring him with a bright , negligent smile .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 19]: `` Oh , quite , '' she answered , turning again to Joe as she entered the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 8]: `` Then I shall expect you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 9]: `` I 'll try , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 6]: `` I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 34]: He stumbled away ; Respectability and he , together , interfering alarmingly with the comfort of Mr. Flitcroft , who had stopped in the middle of the pavement to stare glassily at Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 33]: Eugene accompanied the latter into the house , and Joe , looking back , understood : Mamie had sent his step-brother to bring Ariel in -- and to keep him from following .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 5]: `` This afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 12]: The thought took away his breath , and he became paler .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 33]: The Pike brougham rolled by him , and Sam Warden , from the box , favored his old friend upon the pavement with a liberal display of the whites of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 20]: The Judge , evidently , had been detained after services -- without doubt a meeting of the church officials .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 51]: Mrs. Pike , blinking and frightened , sat at her husband 's side , agreeing feebly with the bull-bass which rumbled out of the open window of the brougham : `` I want orthodox preaching in MY church , and , by God , madam , I 'll have it !
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 8]: That fellow has got to go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 10]: Joe took off his hat and wiped his brow .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 63]: XII TO REMAIN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS NOT ALWAYS A VICTORY Mamie , waiting just inside the door as Ariel and Eugene entered , gave the visitor a pale greeting , and , a moment later , hearing the wheels of the brougham crunch the gravel of the carriage-drive , hurried away , down the broad hall , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 36]: Ariel dropped her parasol upon a marble-topped table near the door , and , removing her gloves , drifted into a room at the left , where a grand piano found shelter beneath crimson plush .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 78]: After a moment of contemplation , she pushed back the coverlet , and , seating herself upon the plush-covered piano-stool -LRB- to match -RRB- , let her fingers run up and down the key-board once and fall listlessly in her lap , as she gazed with deep interest at three life-sized colored photographs -LRB- in carved gilt frames -RRB- upon the wall she was facing : Judge Pike , Mamie , and Mrs. Pike with her rubies .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 17]: `` Please do n't stop playing , Miss Tabor , '' said a voice behind her .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 13]: She had not observed that Eugene had followed her into the room .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 20]: `` Very well , if you like , '' she answered , looking up to smile absently at him .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 34]: And she began to play a rakish little air which , composed by some rattle-brain at a cafe table , had lately skipped out of the Moulin Rouge to disport itself over Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 50]: She played it slowly , in the minor , with elfish pathos ; while he leaned upon the piano , his eyes fixed upon her fingers , which bore few rings , none , he observed with an unreasonable pleasure , upon the third finger of the left hand .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 15]: `` It 's one of those simpler Grieg things , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 6]: he said , sighing gently .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 7]: `` I care for Grieg . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 9]: `` Would you mind its being Chaminade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 11]: she returned , dropping her eyes to cloak the sin .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 13]: `` Ah no ; I recognize it now , '' replied Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 11]: `` He appeals to me even more than Grieg . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 29]: At this she glanced quickly up at him , but more quickly down again , and hastened the time emphatically , swinging the little air into the major .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 12]: `` Do you play the ` Pilgrim 's Chorus ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 7]: `` Vous name pas Wagner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 7]: inquired Eugene , leaning toward her .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 42]: `` Oh yes , '' she answered , bending her head far over , so that her face was concealed from him , except the chin , which , he saw with a thrill of inexplicable emotion , was trembling slightly .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 15]: There were some small white flowers upon her hat , and these shook too .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 34]: She stopped playing abruptly , rose from the stool and crossed the room to a large mahogany chair , upholstered in red velvet and of hybrid construction , possessing both rockers and legs .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 44]: She had moved in a way which prevented him from seeing her face , but he was certain of her agitation , and strangely glad , while curious , tremulous half-thoughts , edged with prophecy , bubbled to the surface of his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 31]: When she turned to him , he was surprised to see that she looked astonishingly happy , almost as if she had been struggling with joy , instead of pain .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 20]: `` This chair , '' she said , sinking into it , `` makes me feel at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 6]: Naturally he could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 19]: `` Because , '' she explained , `` I once thought I was going to live in it .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 20]: It has been reupholstered , but I should know it if I met in anywhere in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 6]: `` How very odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 5]: exclaimed Eugene , staring .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 21]: `` I settled here in pioneer days , '' she went on , tapping the arms lightly with her finger-tips .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 13]: `` It was the last dance I went to in Canaan . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 31]: `` I fear the town was very provincial at that time , '' he returned , having completely forgotten the occasion she mentioned , therefore wishing to shift the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 10]: `` I fear you may still find it so .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 22]: There is not much here that one is in sympathy with , intellectually -- few people really of the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 35]: `` Few people , I suppose you mean , '' she said , softly , with a look that went deep enough into his eyes , `` few people who really understand one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 14]: Eugene had seated himself on the sill of an open window close by .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 21]: `` There has been , '' he answered , with the ghost of a sigh , `` no one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 19]: She turned her head slightly away from him , apparently occupied with a loose thread in her sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 17]: There were no loose threads ; it was an old habit of hers which she retained .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 34]: `` I suppose , '' she murmured , in a voice as low as his had been , `` that a man of your sort might find Canaan rather lonely and sad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 6]: `` It HAS been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 9]: Whereupon she made him a laughing little bow .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 10]: `` You are sure you complain of Canaan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 19]: `` You do n't know what it is to live here -- '' `` I think I do .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 7]: I lived here seventeen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 38]: `` Oh yes , '' he began to object , `` as a child , but -- '' `` Have you any recollection , '' she interrupted , `` of the day before your brother ran away ?
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 28]: Of coming home for vacation -- I think it was your first year in college -- and intervening between your brother and me in a snow-fight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 13]: For a moment he was genuinely perplexed ; then his face cleared .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 23]: `` Certainly , '' he said : `` I found him bullying you and gave him a good punishing for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 8]: `` Is that all you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' he replied , honestly .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 7]: `` Was n't that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 4]: `` Quite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 8]: she smiled , her eyes half closed .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 10]: `` Except that I went home immediately afterward . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 7]: `` Naturally , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 14]: `` My step-brother was n't very much chevalier sans peur et sans reproche !
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 13]: Ah , I should like to polish up my French a little .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 29]: Would you mind my asking you to read a bit with me , some little thing of Daudet 's if you care for him , in the original ?
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 20]: An hour , now and then , perhaps -- '' Mamie appeared in the doorway and Eugene rose swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 26]: `` I have been trying to persuade Miss Tabor , '' he explained , with something too much of laughter , `` to play again .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 31]: You heard that little thing of Chaminade 's -- '' Mamie did not appear to hear him ; she entered breathlessly , and there was no color in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 28]: `` Ariel , '' she exclaimed , `` I do n't want you to think I 'm a tale-bearer -- '' `` Oh , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 9]: Ariel said , with a gesture of deprecation .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 35]: `` No , '' Miss Pike went on , all in one breath , `` but I 'm afraid you will think it , because papa knows and he wants to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 9]: `` What is it that he knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 10]: `` That you were walking with Joseph Louden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 18]: -LRB- This was as if she had said , `` That you poisoned your mother . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 36]: `` I DID N'T tell him , but when we saw you with him I was troubled , and asked Eugene what I 'd better do , because Eugene always knows what is best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 15]: -LRB- Mr. Bantry 's expression , despite this tribute , was not happy . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 17]: `` And he advised me to tell mamma about it and leave it in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 27]: But she always tells papa everything -- '' `` Certainly ; that is understood , '' said Ariel , slowly , turning to smile at Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 13]: `` And she told him this right away , '' Mamie finished .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 17]: `` Why should n't she , if it is of the slightest interest to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 10]: The daughter of the house exhibited signs of consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 13]: `` He wants to see you , '' she repeated , falteringly .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 8]: `` He 's in the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 45]: Having thus discharged her errand , she hastened to the front-door , which had been left open , and out to the steps , evidently with the intention of removing herself as soon and as far as possible from the vicinity of the library .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 17]: Eugene , visibly perturbed , followed her to the doorway of the room , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 8]: `` Do you know the way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 9]: he inquired , with a note of solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 5]: Ariel had not risen .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 6]: `` To the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 12]: `` Of course , '' she said , beaming upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 18]: `` I was about to ask you if you would n't speak to the Judge for me .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 12]: This is such a comfortable old friend , this chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 8]: `` Speak to him for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 5]: repeated the non-plussed Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 4]: She nodded cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 7]: `` If I may trouble you .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 14]: Tell him , certainly , I shall be glad to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 31]: He threw a piteous glance after Mamie , who was now , as he saw , through the open door , out upon the lawn and beyond easy hailing distance .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 35]: When he turned again to look at Ariel he discovered that she had shifted the position of her chair slightly , and was gazing out of the window with every appearance of cheerful meditation .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 50]: She assumed so unmistakably that he had of course gone on her mission that , dismayed and his soul quaking , he could find neither an alternative nor words to explain to this dazzling lady that not he nor any other could bear such a message to Martin Pike .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 3]: Eugene went .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 27]: There was nothing else to do ; and he wished with every step that the distance to the portals of the library might have been greater .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 13]: In whatever guise he delivered the summons , it was perfectly efficacious .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 33]: A door slammed , a heavy and rapid tread was heard in the hall , and Ariel , without otherwise moving , turned her head and offered a brilliant smile of greeting .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 32]: `` It was good of you , '' she said , as the doorway filled with red , imperial wrath , `` to wish to have a little chat with me .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 28]: I 'm anxious , of course , to go over my affairs with you , and last night , after my journey , I was too tired .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 16]: But now we might begin ; not in detail , of course , just yet .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 15]: That will do for later , when I 've learned more about business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 9]: The great one had stopped on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 33]: `` Madam , '' he began , coldly , `` when I say my library , I mean my -- '' `` Oh yes , '' she interrupted , with amiable weariness .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 4]: `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 40]: You mean you keep all the papers and books of the estate in there , but I think we 'd better put them off for a few days -- '' `` I 'm not talking about the estate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 17]: `` What I want to talk to you about is being seen with Joseph Louden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' she nodded , brightly .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 13]: `` That 's along the line we must take up first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 7]: `` Yes , it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 7]: He hurled his bull-bass at her .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 13]: `` You knew everything about him and his standing in this community !
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 46]: I know you did , because Mrs. Pike told me you asked all about him from Mamie after you came last night , and , see here , do n't you -- '' `` Oh , but I knew before that , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 20]: `` I had a correspondent in Canaan , one who has always taken a great interest in Mr. Louden .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 14]: I asked Miss Pike only to get her own point of view . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 37]: `` I want to tell you , madam , '' he shouted , coming toward her , `` that no member of my household -- '' `` That 's another point we must take up to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 40]: I 'm glad you remind me of it , '' she said , thoughtfully , yet with so magically compelling an intonation that he stopped his shouting in the middle of a word ; stopped with an apoplectic splutter .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 15]: `` We must arrange to put the old house in order at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 20]: `` We 'll arrange nothing of the sort , '' he responded , after a moment of angry silence .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 10]: `` You 're going to stay right here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 14]: `` Ah , I know your hospitality , '' she bowed , graciously .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 12]: `` But of course I must not tax it too far .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 5]: And about Mr. Louden ?
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 14]: As I said , I want to speak to you about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' he intervened , harshly .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 14]: `` So do I , and I 'm going to do it quick !
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 11]: You 'll find -- '' Again she mysteriously baffled him .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 35]: `` He 's a dear old friend of mine , you know , and I have made up my mind that we both need his help , you and I. '' `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' she continued , calmly , `` in a business way I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 49]: I know you have great interests in a hundred directions , all more important than mine ; it is n't fair that you should bear the whole burden of my affairs , and I think it will be best to retain Mr. Louden as my man of business .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 14]: He could take all the cares of the estate off your shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 42]: Martin Pike spoke no word , but he looked at her strangely ; and she watched him with sudden keenness , leaning forward in her chair , her gaze alert but quiet , fixed on the dilating pupils of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 22]: He seemed to become dizzy , and the choleric scarlet which had overspread his broad face and big neck faded splotchily .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 66]: Still keeping her eyes upon him , she went on : `` I have n't asked him yet , and so I do n't know whether or not he 'll consent , but I think it possible that he may come to see me this afternoon , and if he does we can propose it to him together and go over things a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 6]: Judge Pike recovered his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 24]: `` He 'll get a warm welcome , '' he promised , huskily , `` if he sets foot on my premises ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 13]: `` You mean you prefer I should n't receive him here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 4]: She nodded pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 7]: `` Then certainly I shall not .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 14]: Such things are much better for offices ; you are quite right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 10]: `` You 'll not see him at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 28]: `` Ah , Judge Pike , '' she lifted her hand with gentle deprecation , `` do n't you understand that we ca n't quite arrange that ?
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 30]: You see , Mr. Louden is even an older friend of mine than you are , and so I must trust his advice about such things more than yours .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 24]: Of course , if he too should think it better for me not to see him -- '' The Judge advanced toward her .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 16]: `` I 'm tired of this , '' he began , in a loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 63]: `` I 'm -- '' She moved as if to rise , but he had come very close , leaning above her , one arm out-stretched and at the end of it a heavy forefinger which he was shaking at her , so that it was difficult to get out of her chair without pushing him away -- a feat apparently impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 43]: Ariel Tabor , in rising , placed her hand upon his out-stretched arm , quite as if he had offered it to assist her ; he fell back a step in complete astonishment ; she rose quickly , and released his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 10]: `` Thank you , '' she said , beamingly .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 12]: `` It 's quite all my fault that you 're tired .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 19]: I 've been thoughtless to keep you so long , and you have been standing , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 17]: She swept lightly and quickly to the door , where she paused , gathering her skirts .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 9]: `` I shall not detain you another instant !
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 13]: And if Mr. Louden comes , this afternoon , I 'll remember .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 11]: I 'll not let him come in , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 15]: It will be perhaps pleasanter to talk over my proposition as we walk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 30]: There was a very faint , spicy odor like wild roses and cinnamon left in the room where Martin Pike stood alone , staring whitely at the open doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 41]: XIII THE WATCHER AND THE WARDEN There was a custom of Canaan , time-worn and seldom honored in the breach , which put Ariel , that afternoon , in easy possession of a coign of vantage commanding the front gate .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 64]: The heavy Sunday dinner was finished in silence -LRB- on the part of Judge Pike , deafening -RRB- about three o'clock , and , soon after , Mamie tossed a number of cushions out upon the stoop between the cast-iron dogs , -- Sam Warden having previously covered the steps with a rug and placed several garden chairs near by on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 51]: These simple preparations concluded , Eugene sprawled comfortably upon the rug , and Mamie seated herself near him , while Ariel wandered with apparent aimlessness about the lawn , followed by the gaze of Mr. Bantry , until Miss Pike begged her , a little petulantly , to join them .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 37]: She came , looking about her dreamily , and touching to her lips , now and then , with an absent air , a clover blossom she had found in the longer grass against the fence .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 28]: She stopped to pat the neck of one of the cast-iron deer , and with grave eyes proffered the clover-top first for inspection , then as food .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 26]: There were those in the world who , seeing her , might have wondered that the deer did not play Galatea and come to life .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 10]: she said , aloud , to the steadfast head .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 5]: `` You wo n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 10]: What a mistake to be made of cast-iron ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 35]: She smiled and nodded to a clump of lilac-bushes near a cedar-tree , and to nothing else -- so far as Eugene and Mamie could see , -- then walked thoughtfully to the steps .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 11]: `` Who in the world were you speaking to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 5]: asked Mamie , curiously .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 5]: `` That deer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 9]: `` But you bowed to some one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 18]: `` Oh , that , '' Ariel lifted her eyebrows , -- `` that was your father .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 7]: Did n't you see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 18]: `` I believe you ca n't from here , after all , '' said Ariel , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 20]: `` He is sitting upon a rustic bench between the bushes and the cedar-tree , quite near the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 39]: No , you could n't see him from here ; you 'd have to go as far as the deer , at least , and even then you might not notice him , unless you looked for him .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 21]: He has a book -- a Bible , I think -- but I do n't think he is reading . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 14]: `` He usually takes a nap on Sunday afternoons , '' said Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 11]: `` I do n't think he will , to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 11]: Ariel looked at Eugene , who avoided her clear gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 21]: `` He has the air of having settled himself to stay for a long time , perhaps until evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 40]: She had put on her hat after dinner , and Mamie now inquired if she would not prefer to remove it , offering to carry it in-doors for her , to Ariel 's room , to insure its safety .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 27]: `` You look so sort of temporary , wearing it , '' she urged , `` as if you were only here for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 36]: It 's the loveliest hat I ever saw , and so fragile , too , but I 'll take care -- '' Ariel laughed , leaned over , and touched the other 's hand lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 9]: `` It is n't that , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 8]: `` What is it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 8]: Mamie beamed out into a joyful smile .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 42]: She had felt sure that she could not understand Ariel ; was , indeed , afraid of her ; and she found herself astonishingly pleased to be called `` dear , '' and delighted with the little familiarity of the hand-tap .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 32]: Her feeling toward the visitor -LRB- who was , so her father had announced , to become a permanent member of the household -RRB- had been , until now , undefined .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 68]: She had been on her guard , watching for some sign of conscious `` superiority '' in this lady who had been so long over-seas , not knowing what to make of her ; though thrown , by the contents of her trunks , into a wistfulness which would have had something of rapture in it had she been sure that she was going to like Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 35]: She had gone to the latter 's room before church , and had perceived uneasily that it had become , even by the process of unpacking , the prettiest room she had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 23]: Mrs. Warden , wife of Sam , and handmaiden of the mansion , was assisting , alternately faint and vociferous with marvelling .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 10]: Mamie feared that Ariel might be a little overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 53]: With the word `` dear '' -LRB- that is , of course , with the way it was spoken -RRB- , and with the touch upon the hand , it was all suddenly settled ; she would not understand Ariel always -- that was clear -- but they would like each other .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 27]: `` I am wearing my hat , '' answered Ariel , `` because at any moment I may decide to go for a long walk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 11]: `` Oh , I hope not , '' said Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 21]: `` There are sure to be people : a few still come , even though I 'm an engaged girl .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 37]: I expect that 's just to console me , though , '' she added , smiling over this worn quip of the betrothed , and shaking her head at Eugene , who grew red and coughed .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 17]: `` There 'll be plenty to-day , but they wo n't be here to see me .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 18]: It 's you , Ariel , and they 'd be terribly disappointed if you were n't here .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 18]: I should n't wonder if the whole town came ; it 's curious enough about you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 27]: Canaan -LRB- at least that part of it which Mamie meant when she said `` the whole town '' -RRB- already offered testimony to her truthfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 32]: Two gentlemen , aged nine and eleven , and clad in white `` sailor suits , '' were at that moment grooving their cheeks between the round pickets of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 94]: They had come from the house across the street , evidently stimulated by the conversation at their own recent dinner-table -LRB- they wore a few deposits such as are left by chocolate-cake -RRB- , and the motive of their conduct became obvious when , upon being joined by a person from next door -LRB- a starched and frilled person of the opposite sex but sympathetic age -RRB- , one of them waggled a forefinger through the gate at Ariel , and a voice was heard in explanation : `` THAT 'S HER . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 35]: There was a rustle in the lilac-bushes near the cedar-tree ; the three small heads turned simultaneously in that direction ; something terrific was evidently seen , and with a horrified `` OOOH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 5]: the trio skedaddled headlong .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 24]: They were but the gay vanguard of the life which the street , quite dead through the Sunday dinner-hour , presently took on .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 67]: Young couples with their progeny began to appear , returning from the weekly reunion Sunday dinner with relatives ; young people meditative -LRB- until they reached the Pike Mansion -RRB- , the wives fanning themselves or shooing the tots-able-to-walk ahead of them , while the husbands , wearing long coats , satin ties , and showing dust upon their blazing shoes , invariably pushed the perambulators .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 26]: Most of these passers-by exchanged greetings with Mamie and Eugene , and all of them looked hard at Ariel as long as it was possible .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 83]: And now the young men of the town , laboriously arranged as to apparel , began to appear on the street in small squads , making their Sunday rounds ; the youngest working in phalanxes of threes and fours , those somewhat older inclining to move in pairs ; the eldest , such as were now beginning to be considered middle-aged beaux , or -LRB- by the extremely youthful -RRB- `` old bachelors , '' evidently considered it advantageous to travel alone .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 25]: Of all these , there were few who did not , before evening fell , turn in at the gate of the Pike Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 29]: Consciously , shyly or confidently , according to the condition of their souls , they made their way between the cast-iron deer to be presented to the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 26]: Ariel sat at the top of the steps , and , looking amiably over their heads , talked with such as could get near her .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 21]: There were many who could not , and Mamie , occupying the bench below , was surrounded by the overflow .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 41]: The difficulty of reaching and maintaining a position near Miss Tabor was increased by the attitude and behavior of Mr. Flitcroft , who that day cooled the feeling of friendship which several of his fellow-townsmen had hitherto entertained for him .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 73]: He had been the first to arrive , coming alone , though that was not his custom , and he established himself at Ariel 's right , upon the step just below her , so disposing the great body and the ponderous arms and legs the gods had given him , that no one could mount above him to sit beside her , or approach her from that direction within conversational distance .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 42]: Once established , he was not to be dislodged , and the only satisfaction for those in this manner debarred from the society of the beautiful stranger was obtained when they were presented to her and when they took their departure .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 58]: On these occasions it was necessary by custom for them to shake her hand , a ceremony they accomplished by leaning across Mr. Flitcroft , which was a long way to lean , and the fat back and shoulders were sore that night because of what had been surreptitiously done to them by revengeful elbows and knees .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 41]: Norbert , not ordinarily talkative , had nothing to say ; he seemed to find sufficient occupation in keeping the place he had gained ; and from this close vantage he fastened his small eyes immovably upon Ariel 's profile .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 43]: Eugene , also apparently determined not to move , sat throughout the afternoon at her left , but as he was thin , others , who came and went , were able to approach upon that side and hold speech with her .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 21]: She was a stranger to these young people , most of whom had grown up together in a nickname intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 26]: Few of them had more than a very imperfect recollection of her as she was before Roger Tabor and she had departed out of Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 45]: She had lived her girlhood only upon their borderland , with no intimates save her grandfather and Joe ; and she returned to her native town `` a revelation and a dream , '' as young Mr. Bradbury told his incredulous grandmother that night .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 49]: The conversation of the gallants consisted , for the greater part , of witticisms at one another 's expense , which , though evoked for Ariel 's benefit -LRB- all eyes furtively reverting to her as each shaft was loosed -RRB- , she found more or less enigmatical .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 22]: The young men , however , laughed at each other loudly , and seemed content if now and then she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 16]: `` You must be frightfully ennuied with all this , '' Eugene said to her .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: `` You see how provincial we still are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 11]: She did not answer ; she had not heard him .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 63]: The shadows were stretching themselves over the grass , long and attenuated ; the sunlight upon the trees and houses was like a thin , rosy pigment ; black birds were calling each other home to beech and elm ; and Ariel 's eyes were fixed upon the western distance of the street where gold-dust was beginning to quiver in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 38]: She did not hear Eugene , but she started , a moment later , when the name `` Joe Louden '' was pronounced by a young man , the poetic Bradbury , on the step below Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 9]: Some one immediately said '' ` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 46]: But she leaned over and addressed Mr. Bradbury , who , shut out , not only from the group about her , but from the other centring upon Miss Pike , as well , was holding a private conversation with a friend in like misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 10]: `` What were you saying of Mr. Louden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 10]: she asked , smiling down upon the young man .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 21]: -LRB- It was this smile which inspired his description of her as `` a revelation and a dream . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 12]: `` Oh , nothing particular , '' was his embarrassed reply .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 36]: `` I only mentioned I 'd heard there was some talk among the -- '' He paused awkwardly , remembering that Ariel had walked with Joseph Louden in the face of Canaan that very day .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 20]: `` That is , I mean to say , there 's some talk of his running for Mayor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 4]: `` WHAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 16]: There was a general exclamation , followed by an uncomfortable moment or two of silence .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 78]: No one present was unaware of that noon walk , though there was prevalent a pleasing notion that it would not happen again , founded on the idea that Ariel , having only arrived the previous evening , had probably met Joe on the street by accident , and , remembering him as a playmate of her childhood and uninformed as to his reputation , had , naturally enough , permitted him to walk home with her .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 34]: Mr. Flitcroft broke the silence , rushing into words with a derisive laugh : `` Yes , he 's ` talked of ' for Mayor -- by the saloon people and the niggers !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 27]: I expect the Beaver Beach crowd would be for him , and if tramps could vote he might -- '' `` What is Beaver Beach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 6]: asked Ariel , not turning .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 7]: `` What is Beaver Beach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 16]: he repeated , and cast his eyes to the sky , shaking his head awesomely .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 31]: `` It 's a Place , '' he said , with abysmal solemnity , -- `` a Place I should n't have mentioned in your presence , Miss Tabor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 11]: `` What has it to do with Mr. Louden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 34]: The predestined Norbert conceived the present to be a heaven-sent opportunity to enlighten her concerning Joe 's character , since the Pikes appeared to have been derelict in the performance of this kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 6]: `` He goes there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 4]: he proceeded heavily .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 43]: `` He lived there for a while when he first came back from running away , and he 's a friend of Mike Sheehan 's that runs it ; he 's a friend of all the riff-raff that hang around there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 10]: `` How do you know he goes there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 16]: `` Why , it was in the paper the day after he came back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 5]: He appealed for corroboration .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 8]: `` Was n't it , Eugene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 3]: she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 11]: `` Newspapers are sometimes mistaken , are n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 21]: Laughing a little , she swept across the bulbous face beside her a swift regard that was like a search-light .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 35]: `` How do you KNOW , Mr. Flitcroft , '' she went on very rapidly , raising her voice , -- `` how do you KNOW that Mr. Louden is familiar with this place ?
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 13]: The newspapers may have been falsely informed ; you must admit that ?
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 6]: Then how do you KNOW ?
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 13]: Have you ever MET any one who has seen him there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: `` I 've seen him there myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 20]: The words skipped out of Norbert 's mouth like so many little devils , the instant he opened it .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 37]: She had spoken so quickly and with such vehemence , looking him full in the eye , that he had forgotten everything in the world except making the point to which her insistence had led him .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 27]: Mamie looked horrified ; there was a sound of smothered laughter , and Norbert , overwhelmed by the treachery of his own mouth , sat gasping .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 37]: `` It ca n't be such a terrific place , then , after all , '' said Ariel , gently , and turning to Eugene , `` Have you ever been there , Mr. Bantry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 14]: He changed color , but answered with enough glibness : `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 58]: Several of the young men rose ; the wretched Flitcroft , however , evading Mamie 's eye -- in which there was a distinct hint , -- sat where he was until all of them , except Eugene , had taken a reluctant departure , one group after another , leaving in the order of their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 63]: The rosy pigment which had colored the trees faded ; the gold-dust of the western distance danced itself pale and departed ; dusk stalked into the town from the east ; and still the watcher upon the steps and the warden of the gate -LRB- he of the lilac-bushes and the Bible -RRB- held their places and waited -- waited , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 5]: in vain ... Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 10]: Joe , is THIS the mettle of your daring ?
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 10]: Did you not say you would `` try '' ?
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 19]: Was your courage so frail a vessel that it could not carry you even to the gate yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 18]: Surely you knew that if you had striven so far , there you would have been met !
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 24]: Perhaps you foresaw that not one , but two , would meet you at the gate , both the warden and the watcher .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 4]: What of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 8]: What of that , O faint heart ?
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 6]: What was there to fear ?
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 2]: Listen !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 4]: The gate clicks .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 8]: Ah , have you come at last ?
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 25]: Ariel started to her feet , but the bent figure , coming up the walk in the darkness , was that of Eskew Arp .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 38]: He bowed gloomily to Mamie , and in response to her inquiry if he wished to see her father , answered no ; he had come to talk with the granddaughter of his old friend Roger Tabor .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 5]: `` Mr. Arp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 3]: called Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 8]: `` I am so very glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 11]: She ran down to him and gave him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 15]: `` We 'll sit here on the bench , sha 'n' t we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 21]: Mamie had risen , and skirting Norbert frostily , touched Eugene upon the shoulder as she went up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 31]: He understood that he was to follow her in-doors , and , after a deep look at the bench where Ariel had seated herself beside Mr. Arp , he obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 13]: Norbert was left a lonely ruin between the cold , twin dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 47]: He had wrought desolation this afternoon , and that sweet verdure , his good name , so long in the planting , so carefully tended , was now a dreary waste ; yet he contemplated this not so much as his present aspect of splendid isolation .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 53]: Frozen by the daughter of the house , forgotten by the visitor , whose conversation with Mr. Arp was carried on in tones so low that he could not understand it , the fat one , though heart-breakingly loath to take himself away , began to comprehend that his hour had struck .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 23]: He rose , descended the steps to the bench , and seated himself unexpectedly upon the cement walk at Ariel 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 55]: `` Leg 's gone to sleep , '' he explained , in response to her startled exclamation ; but , like a great soul , ignoring the accident of his position as well as the presence of Mr. Arp , he immediately proceeded : `` Will you go riding with me to-morrow afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 11]: `` Are n't you very good-natured , Mr. Flitcroft ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 8]: she asked , with an odd intonation .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 25]: `` I 'm imposed on , often enough , '' he replied , rubbing his leg , `` by people who think I am !
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 34]: `` It is only that your sitting so abruptly upon the ground reminded me of something that happened long ago , before I left Canaan , the last time I met you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 13]: `` I do n't think I knew you before you went away .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 13]: You have n't said if you 'll go riding with me to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 14]: Please -- '' `` Get up , '' interrupted Mr. Arp , acidly .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 12]: `` Somebody 'll fall over you if you stay there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 8]: Such a catastrophe in truth loomed imminent .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 45]: Judge Pike was rapidly approaching on his way to the house , Bible in hand -- far better in hand than was his temper , for it is an enraging thing to wait five hours in ambush for a man who does not come .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 24]: In the darkness a desecration occurred , and Norbert perfected to the last detail whatever had been left incomplete of his own destruction .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 63]: He began lumberingly to rise , talking at the same time , urging upon Ariel the charms of the roadside ; wild flowers were in blossom , he said , recounting the benefits she might derive through acceptance of his invitation ; and having , thus busily , risen to his knees , became aware that some one was passing near him .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 23]: This some one Mr. Flitcroft , absorbed in artful persuasions , may have been betrayed by the darkness to mistake for Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 52]: Reaching out for assistance , he mechanically seized upon the skirts of a coat , which he put to the uses of a rope , coming up hand-over-hand with such noble weight and energy that he brought himself to his feet and the owner of the coat to the ground simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 23]: The latter , hideously astonished , went down with an objurgation so outrageous in venom that Mr. Arp jumped with the shock .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 26]: Judge Pike got to his feet quickly , but not so quickly as the piteous Flitcroft betook himself into the deep shadows of the street .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 52]: Only a word , hoarse and horror-stricken , was left quivering on the night breeze by this accursed , whom the gods , intent upon his ruin , had early in the day , at his first sight of Ariel , in good truth , made mad : `` MURDER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 11]: `` Can I help you brush off , Judge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 6]: asked Eskew , rising painfully .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 61]: Either Martin Pike was beyond words , or the courtesy proposed by the feeble old fellow -LRB- for Eskew was now very far along in years , and looked his age -RRB- emphasized too bitterly the indignity which had been put upon him : whatever the case , he went his way in-doors , leaving the cynic 's offer unacknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 26]: Eskew sank back upon the bench , with the little rusty sounds , suggestions of creaks and sighs , which accompany the movement of antiques .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 24]: `` I 've always thought , '' he said , `` that the Judge had spells when he was hard of hearing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 34]: Oblongs of light abruptly dropped from the windows confronting them , one , falling across the bench , appropriately touching with lemon the acrid , withered face and trembling hands of the veteran .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 20]: `` You are younger than you were nine years ago , Mr. Arp , '' said Ariel , gayly .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 19]: `` I caught a glimpse of you upon the street , to-day , and I thought so then .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 9]: Now I see that I was right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 6]: `` Me -- YOUNGER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 5]: `` No , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 39]: I 'm mighty near through with this fool world -- and I 'd be glad of it , if I did n't expect that if there IS another one afterwards , it would be jest as ornery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 34]: She laughed , leaning forward , resting her elbows on her knee , and her chin in her hand , so that the shadow of her hat shielded her eyes from the light .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 14]: `` I thought you looked surprised when you saw me to day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 7]: `` I reckon I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 8]: `` Who would n't of been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 8]: he repeated , confounded by her simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 11]: `` That 's what I 'm anxious to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 11]: `` Was n't the whole town the same way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 12]: `` Did you meet anybody that did n't look surprised ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 7]: `` But why should they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 6]: `` Good Lord Admighty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 4]: he broke out .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 12]: `` Ai n't you got any lookin ' - glasses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 15]: `` I think almost all I have are still in the customs warehouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 13]: `` Then use Mamie Pike 's , '' responded the old man .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 26]: `` The town never dreamed you were goin ' to turn out pretty at all , let alone the WAY you 've turned out pretty !
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 54]: The Tocsin had a good deal about your looks and so forth in it once , in a letter from Paris , but the folks that remembered you kind of set that down to the way papers talk about anybody with money , and nobody was prepared for it when they saw you .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 12]: You do n't need to drop no curtseys to ME . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 16]: He set his mouth grimly , in response to the bow she made him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 29]: _ I _ think female beauty is like all other human furbelows , and as holler as heaven will be if only the good people are let in !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 30]: But yet I did stop to look at you when you went past me to-day , and I kept on lookin ' , long as you were in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 21]: I reckon I always will , when I git the chance , too -- only shows what human nature IS !
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 13]: But that was n't all that folks were starin ' at to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 33]: It was your walkin ' with Joe Louden that really finished 'em , and I can say it upset me more than anything I 've seen for a good many years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: `` Upset you , Mr. Arp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 8]: `` I do n't quite see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: The old man shook his head deploringly .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 38]: `` After what I 'd written you about that boy -- '' `` Ah , '' she said , softly , touching his sleeve with her fingers , `` I have n't thanked you for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 11]: `` You need n't , '' he returned , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 6]: `` It was a pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 12]: Do you remember how easy and quick I promised you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 10]: `` I remember that you were very kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 4]: `` Kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 9]: He gave forth an acid and chilling laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 49]: `` It was about two months after Louden ran away , and before you and Roger left Canaan , and you asked me to promise to write to you whenever word of that outcast came -- '' `` I did n't put it so , Mr. Arp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: `` No , but you 'd ought of !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 29]: You asked me to write you whatever news of him should come , and if he came back to tell you how and when and all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 19]: And I did it , and kept you sharp on his record ever since he landed here again .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 9]: Do you know why I 've done it ?
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 16]: Do you know why I promised so quick and easy I WOULD do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 13]: `` Out of the kindness of your heart , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 6]: The acid laugh was repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 7]: `` NO , ma ` am !
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 7]: You could n't of guessed colder .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 21]: I promised , and I kept my promise , because I knew there would never be anything good to tell !
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 6]: AND THERE NEVER WAS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 6]: `` Nothing at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 5]: she insisted , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 16]: I leave it to you if I 've written one good word of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 33]: `` You 've written of the treatment he has received here , '' she began , `` and I 've been able to see what he has borne -- and bears ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 17]: `` But have I written one word to show that he did n't deserve it all ?
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 20]: Have n't I told you everything , of his associates , his -- '' `` Indeed you have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 21]: `` Then do you wonder that I was more surprised than most when I saw you walking with him to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 13]: Because I knew you did it in cold blood and knowledge aforethought !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 23]: Other folks thought it was because you had n't been here long enough to hear his reputation , but I KNEW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 21]: `` Tell me , '' she said , `` if you were disappointed when you saw me with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he snapped .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 5]: `` I was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 8]: I saw the consternation in your face !
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 8]: You APPROVED , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 12]: `` I do n't know what you 're talking about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 6]: `` Yes , you do !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 23]: I know it bothers you to have me read you between the lines , but for this once you must let me .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 26]: You are so consistent that you are never disappointed when things turn out badly , or people are wicked or foolish , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 6]: `` No , certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 5]: I expect it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 9]: `` And you were disappointed in me to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 17]: Therefore , it must be that I was doing something you knew was right and good .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 4]: You see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 11]: She leaned a little closer to him , smiling angelically .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 21]: `` Ah , Mr. Arp , '' she cried , `` I know your secret : you ADMIRE me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 16]: He rose , confused and incoherent , as full of denial as a detected pickpocket .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 5]: `` I DO N'T !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 3]: Me ADMIRE ?
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 2]: WHAT ?
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 10]: It 's an ornery world , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 12]: `` I do n't admire any human that ever lived ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 10]: `` Yes , you do , '' she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 7]: `` I 've just proved it !
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 21]: But that is the least of your secret ; the great thing is this : YOU ADMIRE MR. LOUDEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 31]: `` I never heard such nonsense , '' he continued to protest , at the same time moving down the walk toward the gate , leaning heavily on his stick .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 7]: `` Nothin ' of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 17]: There ai n't any LOGIC to that kind of an argument , nor no REASON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 14]: `` You see , I understand you , '' she called after him .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 16]: `` I 'm sorry you go away in the bitterness of being found out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 5]: `` Found out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 11]: His stick ceased for a moment to tap the cement .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 5]: he ejaculated , uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 11]: There was a pause , followed by a malevolent chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 27]: `` At any rate , '' he said , with joy in the afterthought , `` you 'll never go walkin ' with him AGAIN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: He waited for the answer , which came , after a time , sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 6]: `` Perhaps you are right .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 6]: Perhaps I shall not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 7]: `` Ha , I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 7]: `` Good-night , Mr. Arp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 7]: She turned toward the lighted house .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 36]: Through the windows nearest her she could see Mamie , seated in the familiar chair , following with happy and tender eyes the figure of Eugene , who was pacing up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 18]: The town was deadly quiet : Ariel could hear the sound of footsteps perhaps a block away .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 52]: She went to the gate and gazed a long time into the empty street , watching the yellow grains of light , sieved through the maples from the arc lights on the corner , moving to and fro in the deep shadow as the lamp swung slightly in the night air .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 39]: Somewhere , not far away , the peace was broken by the screams of a `` parlor organ , '' which honked and wailed in pious agonies -LRB- the intention was hymnal -RRB- , interminably protracting each spasm .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 44]: Presently a woman 's voice outdid the organ , a voice which made vivid the picture of the woman who owned it , and the ploughed forehead of her , above the nose-glasses , when the `` grace-notes '' were proudly given birth .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 25]: `` Rescue the Perishing '' was the startlingly appropriate selection , rendered with inconceivable lingering upon each syllable : `` Roos-cyoo the Poor-oosh-oong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 35]: At unexpected intervals two male voices , evidently belonging to men who had contracted the habit of holding tin in their mouths , joined the lady in a thorough search for the Lost Chord .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 14]: That was the last of silence in Canaan for an hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 35]: The organ was merely inaugural : across the street a piano sounded ; firm , emphatic , determined , vocal competition with the instrument here also ; `` Rock of Ages '' the incentive .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 16]: Another piano presently followed suit , in a neighboring house : `` Precious Jewels . ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 91]: More distant , a second organ was heard ; other pianos , other organs , took up other themes ; and as a wakeful puppy 's barking will go over a village at night , stirring first the nearer dogs to give voice , these in turn stimulating those farther away to join , one passing the excitement on to another , until hounds in farm-yards far beyond the town contribute to the long-distance conversation , even so did `` Rescue the Perishing '' enliven the greater part of Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 49]: It was this that made Ariel realize a thing of which hitherto she had not been able to convince herself : that she was actually once more in the town where she had spent her long-ago girlhood ; now grown to seem the girlhood of some other person .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 35]: It was true : her foot was on her native heath and her name was Ariel Tabor -- the very name of the girl who had shared the town 's disapproval with Joe Louden !
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 31]: `` Rescue the Perishing '' brought it all back to her ; and she listened to these sharply familiar rites of the Canaanite Sabbath evening with a shiver of pain .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 22]: She turned from the gate to go into the house , heard Eugene 's voice at the door , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 7]: He was saying good-night to Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 24]: `` And please say ` au revoir ' to Miss Tabor for me , '' he added , peering out under his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 12]: `` I do n't know where she can have gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 15]: `` Probably she came in and went to her room , '' said Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 13]: `` Do n't forget to tell her ` au revoir . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 7]: `` I wo n't , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 4]: `` Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 10]: She lifted her face and he kissed her perfunctorily .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 42]: Then he came down the steps and went slowly toward the gate , looking about him into the darkness as if searching for something ; but Ariel had fled away from the path of light that led from the open door .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 38]: She skimmed noiselessly across the lawn and paused at the side of the house , leaning against the veranda , where , on a night long past , a boy had hid and a girl had wept .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 24]: A small creaking sound fell upon her ear , and she made out an ungainly figure approaching , wheeling something of curious shape .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 8]: `` Is that you , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 7]: Mr. Warden stopped , close by .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 8]: `` Yes 'm , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 16]: `` I 'm a-gittin ' out de hose to lay de dus ' yonnah . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 19]: He stretched an arm along the cross-bar of the reel , relaxing himself , apparently , for conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 25]: `` Y' all done change consid ` able , Miss Airil , '' he continued , with the directness of one sure of privilege .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 8]: `` You think so , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 11]: Ev ` ybody think so , _ I _ reckon .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 15]: Be 'n a tai ` ble lot o ' talkum ` bout you to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 17]: Dun ` no ' how all dem oth ' young ladies goin ' take it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 25]: He laughed with immoderate delight , yet , as to the volume of mere sound , discreetly , with an eye to open windows .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 10]: `` You got 'em all beat , Miss Airil !
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 22]: Dey ain ' be 'n no one ` roun ' dis town evah got in a thousum mile o ' you !
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 44]: Fer looks , an ' de way you walk an ' ca ' y yo ` self ; an ' as fer de clo'es -- name o ' de good lan ' , honey , dey ain ' nevah SEE style befo ' !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 25]: My ole woman say you got mo ' fixin 's in a minute dan de whole res ' of 'em got in a yeah .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 24]: She say when she helpin ' you onpack she must ` a ' see mo 'n a hunerd paihs o ' slippahs alone !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 37]: An ' de good Man knows I ` membuh w ` en you runnin ' roun ' back-yods an ' up de alley rompin ' ` ith Joe Louden , same you 's a boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 11]: `` Do you ever see Mr. Louden , nowadays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 10]: His laugh was repeated with the same discreet violence .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 39]: `` Ain ' I seen him dis ve ' y day , fur up de street at de gate yonnah , stan ` in ' ` ith you , w ` en I drivin ' de Judge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 17]: `` You -- you did n't happen to see him anywhere this -- this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 11]: `` No 'm , I ain ' SEE him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: Sam 's laughter vanished and his lowered voice became serious .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 14]: `` I ain ' SEE him , but I hearn about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 7]: `` What did you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 49]: `` Dey be 'n consid ` able stir on de aidge o ' town , I reckon , '' he answered , gravely , `` an ' dey be 'n havin ' some trouble out at de Beach -- '' `` Beaver Beach , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 14]: Dey be 'n some shootin ' goin ' on out dat way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 11]: She sprang forward and caught at his arm without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 12]: `` Joe Louden all right , '' he said , reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 8]: `` Ain ' nuffum happen to him !
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 38]: Nigh as I kin mek out f 'm de TALK , dat Happy Fear gone on de ramPAGE ag ` in , an ' dey hatta sent fer Mist ' Louden to come in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 50]: XIV WHITE ROSES IN A LAW-OFFICE As upon a world canopied with storm , hung with mourning purple and habited in black , did Mr. Flitcroft turn his morning face at eight o'clock antemeridian Monday , as he hied himself to his daily duty at the Washington National Bank .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 16]: Yet more than the merely funereal gloomed out from the hillocky area of his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 23]: Was there not , i ` faith , a glow , a Vesuvian shimmer , beneath the murk of that darkling eye ?
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 13]: Was here one , think you , to turn the other cheek ?
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 19]: Little has he learned of Norbert Flitcroft who conceives that this fiery spirit was easily to be quenched !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 37]: Look upon the jowl of him , and let him who dares maintain that people -- even the very Pikes themselves -- were to grind beneath their brougham wheels a prostrate Norbert and ride on scatheless !
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 13]: In this his own metaphor is nearly touched `` I guess not !
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 7]: They do n't run over ME !
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 11]: Martin Pike better look out how he tries it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 57]: So Mother Nature at her kindly tasks , good Norbert , uses for her unguent our own perfect inconsistency : and often when we are stabbed deep in the breast she distracts us by thin scratches in other parts , that in the itch of these we may forget the greater hurt till it be healed .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 72]: Thus , the remembrance of last night , when you undisguisedly ran from the wrath of a Pike , with a pretty girl looking on -LRB- to say nothing of the acrid Arp , who will fling the legend on a thousand winds -RRB- , might well agonize you now , as , in less hasty moments and at a safe distance , you brood upon the piteous figure you cut .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 41]: On the contrary , behold : you see no blood crimsoning the edges of the horrid gash in your panoply of self-esteem : you but smart and scratch the scratches , forgetting your wound in the hot itch for vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 32]: It is an itch which will last -LRB- for in such matters your temper shall be steadfast -RRB- , and let the great Goliath in the mean time beware of you !
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 6]: You ran , last night .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 8]: You ran -- of course you ran .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 7]: You ran to fight another day !
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 7]: A bank clerk sometimes has opportunities .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 26]: The stricken fat one could not understand how it came about that he had blurted out the damning confession that he had visited Beaver Beach .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 24]: When he tried to solve the puzzle , his mind refused the strain , became foggy and the terrors of his position acute .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 29]: Was he , like Joe Louden , to endure the ban of Canaan , and like him stand excommunicate beyond the pale because of Martin Pike 's displeasure ?
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 15]: For Norbert saw with perfect clearness to-day what the Judge had done for Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 17]: Now that he stood in danger of a fate identical , this came home to him .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 32]: How many others , he wondered , would do as Mamie had done and write notes such as he had received by the hand of Sam Warden , late last night ?
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 5]: `` DEAR SIR . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 24]: -LRB- This from Mamie , who , in the Canaanitish way , had been wont to address him as `` Norb '' ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 62]: -- `` My father wishes me to state that after your remark yesterday afternoon on the steps which was overheard by my mother who happened to be standing in the hall behind you and your BEHAVIOR to himself later on -- he considers it impossible to allow you to call any more or to speak to any member of his household .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 9]: `` Yours respectfully , `` MAMIE PIKE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 47]: Erasures and restorations bore witness to a considerable doubt in Mamie 's mind concerning `` Yours respectfully , '' but she had finally let it stand , evidently convinced that the plain signature , without preface , savored of an intimacy denied by the context . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 6]: ` DEAR SIR ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 8]: repeated Norbert , between set teeth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 12]: ` IMPOSSIBLE TO ALLOW YOU TO CALL any more ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 43]: These and other terms of his dismissal recurred to him during the morning , and ever and anon he looked up from his desk , his lips moving to the tune of those horrid phrases , and stared out at the street .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 37]: Basilisk glaring this , with no Christian softness in it , not even when it fell upon his own grandfather , sitting among the sages within easy eye-shot from the big window at Norbert 's elbow .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 24]: However , Colonel Flitcroft was not disturbed by the gaze of his descendant , being , in fact , quite unaware of it .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 9]: The aged men were having a busy morning .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 9]: The conclave was not what it had been .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 9]: -LSB- See Arp and all his works . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 51]: There had come , as the years went by , a few recruits ; but faces were missing : the two Tabors had gone , and Uncle Joe Davey could no longer lay claim to the patriarchship ; he had laid it down with a half-sigh and gone his way .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 28]: Eskew himself was now the oldest of the conscript fathers , the Colonel and Squire Buckalew pressing him closely , with Peter Bradbury no great time behind .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 46]: To-day they did not plant their feet upon the brass rail inside the hotel windows , but courted the genial weather out-doors , and , as their summer custom was , tilted back their chairs in the shade of the western wall of the building .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 37]: `` And who could of dreamed , '' Mr. Bradbury was saying , with a side-glance of expectancy at Eskew , `` that Jonas Tabor would ever turn out to have a niece like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 32]: Mr. Arp ceased to fan himself with his wide straw hat and said grimly : `` I do n't see as Jonas HAS ` turned out ' -- not in particular !
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 41]: If he 's turned at all , lately , I reckon it 's in his grave , and I 'll bet he HAS if he had any way of hearin ' how much she must of spent for clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 19]: `` I believe , '' Squire Buckalew began , `` that young folks ' memories are short . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 6]: `` They 're lucky ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 3]: interjected Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 12]: `` The shorter your memory the less meanness you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 20]: `` I meant young folks do n't remember as well as older people do , '' continued the Squire .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 22]: `` I do n't see what 's so remarkable in her comin ' back and walkin ' up-street with Joe Louden .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 18]: She used to go kitin ' round with him all the time , before she left here .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 15]: And yet everybody talks as if they never HEARD of sech a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 19]: `` It seems to me , '' said Colonel Flitcroft , hesitatingly , `` that she did right .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 36]: I know it sounds kind of a queer thing to say , and I stirred up a good deal of opposition at home , yesterday evening , by sort of mentioning something of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 36]: Nobody seemed to agree with me , except Norbert , and he did n't SAY much , but -- '' He was interrupted by an uncontrollable cackle which issued from the mouth of Mr. Arp .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 16]: The Colonel turned upon him with a frown , inquiring the cause of his mirth .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 22]: `` It put me in mind , '' Mr. Arp began promptly , `` of something that happened last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 72]: Eskew 's mouth was open to tell , but he remembered , just in time , that the grandfather of Norbert was not the audience properly to be selected for this recital , choked a half-born word , coughed loudly , realizing that he must withhold the story of the felling of Martin Pike until the Colonel had taken his departure , and replied : `` Nothin ' to speak of .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 7]: Go on with your argument . ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 10]: `` I 've finished , '' said the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 34]: `` I only wanted to say that it seems to me a good action for a young lady like that to come back here and stick to her old friend and playmate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 6]: `` STICK to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 4]: echoed Mr. Arp .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 10]: `` She walked up Main Street with him yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 9]: Do you call that stickin ' to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 15]: She 's been away a good while ; she 's forgotten what Canaan IS .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 29]: You wait till she sees for herself jest what his standing in this com -- '' `` I agree with Eskew for once , '' interrupted Peter Bradbury .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 34]: `` I agree because -- '' `` Then you better wait , '' cried Eskew , allowing him to proceed no farther , `` till you hear what you 're agreein ' to !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 43]: I say : you take a young lady like that , pretty and rich and all cultured up , and it stands to reason that she wo n't -- '' `` No , it do n't , '' exclaimed Buckalew , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 6]: `` Nothing of the sort !
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 18]: I tell you -- '' Eskew rose to his feet and pounded the pavement with his stick .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 58]: `` It stands to reason that she wo n't stick to a man no other decent woman will speak to , a feller that 's been the mark for every stone throwed in the town , ever since he was a boy , an outcast with a reputation as black as a preacher 's shoes on Sunday !
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 20]: I do n't care if he 's her oldest friend on EARTH , she wo n't stick to him !
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 19]: She walked with him yesterday , but you can mark my words : his goose is cooked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 11]: The old man 's voice rose , shrill and high .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 13]: `` It ai n't in human nature fer her to do it !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 35]: You hear what I say : you 'll never see her with Joe Louden again in this livin ' world , and she as good as told me so , herself , last night .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 11]: You can take your oath she 's quit him already !
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 34]: Do n't -- '' Eskew paused abruptly , his eyes widening behind his spectacles ; his jaw fell ; his stick , raised to hammer the pavement , remained suspended in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 16]: A sudden color rushed over his face , and he dropped speechless in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 18]: The others , after staring at him in momentary alarm , followed the direction of his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 23]: Just across Main Street , and in plain view , was the entrance to the stairway which led to Joe 's office .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 35]: Ariel Tabor , all in cool gray , carrying a big bunch of white roses in her white-gloved hands , had just crossed the sidewalk from a carriage and was ascending the dark stairway .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 19]: A moment later she came down again , empty-handed , got into the carriage , and drove away .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 10]: `` She missed him , '' said Squire Buckalew .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 11]: `` I saw him go out half an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 37]: BUT , '' he added , and , exercising a self-restraint close upon the saintly , did not even glance toward the heap which was Mr. Arp , `` I notice she left her flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 30]: Ariel was not the only one who climbed the dingy stairs that day and read the pencilled script upon Joe 's door : `` Will not return until evening .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 4]: J. Louden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 59]: Many others came , all exceedingly unlike the first visitor : some were quick and watchful , dodging into the narrow entrance furtively ; some smiled contemptuously as long as they were in view of the street , drooping wanly as they reached the stairs : some were brazen and amused ; and some were thin and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 48]: Not all of them read the message , for not all could read , but all looked curiously through the half-opened door at the many roses which lifted their heads delicately from a water-pitcher on Joe 's desk to scent that dusty place with their cool breath .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 51]: Most of these clients , after a grunt of disappointment , turned and went away ; though there were a few , either unable to read the message or so pressed by anxiety that they disregarded it , who entered the room and sat down to wait for the absentee .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 21]: -LSB- There were plenty of chairs in the office now , bookcases also , and a big steel safe . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 62]: But when evening came and the final gray of twilight had vanished from the window-panes , all had gone except one , a woman who sat patiently , her eyes upon the floor , and her hands folded in her lap , until the footsteps of the last of the others to depart had ceased to sound upon the pavement below .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 60]: Then , with a wordless exclamation , she sprang to her feet , pulled the window-shade carefully down to the sill , and , when she had done that , struck a match on the heel of her shoe -- a soiled white canvas shoe , not a small one -- and applied the flame to a gas jet .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 15]: The yellow light flared up ; and she began to pace the room haggardly .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 59]: The court-house bell rang nine , and as the tremors following the last stroke pulsed themselves into silence , she heard a footfall on the stairs and immediately relapsed into a chair , folding her hands again in her lap , her expression composing itself to passivity , for the step was very much lighter than Joe 's .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 12]: A lady beautifully dressed in white dimity appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 51]: She hesitated at the threshold , not , apparently , because of any timidity -LRB- her expression being too thoughtfully assured for that -RRB- , but almost immediately she came in and seated herself near the desk , acknowledging the other 's presence by a slight inclination of the head .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 30]: This grave courtesy caused a strong , deep flush to spread itself under the rouge which unevenly covered the woman 's cheeks , as she bowed elaborately in return .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 60]: Then , furtively , during a protracted silence , she took stock of the new-comer , from the tip of her white suede shoes to the filmy lace and pink roses upon her wide white hat ; and the sidelong gaze lingered marvellingly upon the quiet , delicate hands , slender and finely expressive , in their white gloves .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 62]: Her own hands , unlike the lady 's , began to fidget confusedly , and , the silence continuing , she coughed several times , to effect the preface required by her sense of fitness , before she felt it proper to observe , with a polite titter : `` Mr. Louden seems to be a good while comin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 9]: `` Have you been waiting very long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 4]: asked the lady .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 7]: `` Ever since six o'clock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 7]: `` That is very long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 12]: `` Yes , ma'am , it cert ` nly is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 41]: The ice thus broken , she felt free to use her eyes more directly , and , after a long , frank stare , exclaimed : `` Why , you must be Miss Ariel Tabor , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 14]: Ariel touched one of the roses upon Joe 's desk with her finger-tips .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 7]: `` I am Miss Tabor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 33]: `` Well , excuse me fer asking ; I 'm sure it ai n't any business of mine , '' said the other , remembering the manners due one lady from another .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 8]: `` But I thought it must be .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 29]: I expect , '' she added , with loud , inconsequent laughter , `` there 's not many in Canaan ai n't heard you 've come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 49]: She paused , laughed again , nervously , and again , less loudly , to take off the edge of her abruptness : gradually tittering herself down to a pause , to fill which she put forth : `` Right nice weather we be 'n havin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 12]: `` It was rainy , first of last week , though .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 27]: _ I _ do n't mind rain so much '' -- this with more laughter , -- `` I stay in the house when it rains .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 11]: Some people do n't know enough to , they say !
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 14]: You 've heard that saying , ai n't you , Miss Tabor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 31]: `` Well , I tell YOU , '' she exclaimed , noisily , `` there 's plenty ladies and gen ` lemen in this town that 's like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 12]: Her laughter did not cease ; it became louder and shriller .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 78]: It had been , until now , a mere lubrication of the conversation , helping to make her easier in Miss Tabor 's presence , but as it increased in shrillness , she seemed to be losing control of herself , as if her laughter were getting away with her ; she was not far from hysteria , when it stopped with a gasp , and she sat up straight in her chair , white and rigid .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 4]: `` THERE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 6]: she said , listening intently .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 7]: `` Ai n't that him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 34]: Steps sounded upon the pavement below ; paused for a second at the foot of the stairs ; there was the snap of a match ; then the steps sounded again , retreating .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 8]: She sank back in her chair limply .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 16]: `` It was only some one stoppin ' to light his cigar in the entry .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 11]: It was n't Joe Louden 's step , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: `` You know his step ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 10]: Ariel 's eyes were bent upon the woman wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 20]: `` I 'd know it to-night , '' was the answer , delivered with a sharp and painful giggle .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 8]: `` I got plenty reason to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 5]: Ariel did not respond .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 130]: She leaned a little closer to the roses upon the desk , letting them touch her face , and breathing deeply of their fragrance to neutralize a perfume which pervaded the room ; an odor as heavy and cheap-sweet as the face of the woman who had saturated her handkerchief with it , a scent which went with her perfectly and made her unhappily definite ; suited to her clumsily dyed hair , to her soiled white shoes , to the hot red hat smothered in plumage , to the restless stub-fingered hands , to the fat , plated rings , of which she wore a great quantity , though , surprisingly enough , the large diamonds in her ears were pure , and of a very clear water .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 10]: It was she who broke the silence once more .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 25]: `` Well , '' she drawled , coughing genteelly at the same time , `` better late than never , as the saying is .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 13]: I wonder who it is gits up all them comical sayings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 34]: Apparently she had no genuine desire for light upon this mystery , as she continued , immediately : `` I have a gen ` leman friend that 's always gittin ' 'em off .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 34]: ` Well , ' he says , ` the best of friends must part , ' and , ` Thou strikest me to the heart ' -- all kinds of cracks like that .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 5]: He 's real comical .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 20]: And yet , '' she went on in an altered voice , `` I do n't like him much .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 12]: I 'd be glad if I 'd never seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 50]: The change of tone was so marked that Ariel looked at her keenly , to find herself surprised into pitying this strange client of Joe 's ; for tears had sprung to the woman 's eyes and slid along the lids , where she tried vainly to restrain them .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 50]: Her face had altered too , like her voice , haggard lines suddenly appearing about the eyes and mouth as if they had just been pencilled there : the truth issuing from beneath her pinchbeck simulations , like a tragic mask revealed by the displacement of a tawdry covering .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 43]: `` I expect you think I 'm real foolish , '' she said , `` but I be 'n waitin ' so awful long -- and I got a good deal of worry on my mind till I see Mr. Louden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 20]: `` I am sorry , '' Ariel turned from the roses , and faced her and the heavy perfume .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 9]: `` I hope he will come soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 10]: `` I hope so , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 25]: `` It 's something to do with me that keeps him away , and the longer he is the more it scares me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 8]: She shivered and set her teeth together .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 10]: `` It 's kind of hard , waitin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 11]: I cert ` nly got my share of troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 20]: `` Do n't you think that Mr. Louden will be able to take care of them for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 10]: `` Oh , I HOPE so , Miss Tabor !
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 9]: If he ca n't , nobody can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 14]: She was crying openly now , wiping her eyes with her musk-soaked handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 23]: `` We had to send fer him yesterday afternoon -- '' `` To come to Beaver Beach , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 6]: asked Ariel , leaning forward .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 5]: `` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 15]: It all begun out there , -- least-ways it begun before that with me .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 6]: It was all my fault .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 13]: I deserve all that 's comin ' to me , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 8]: I done wrong -- I done wrong !
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 13]: I 'd ought n't never to of went out there yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 33]: She checked herself sharply , but , after a moment 's pause , continued , encouraged by the grave kindliness of the delicate face in the shadow of the wide white hat .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 13]: `` I 'd ought n't to of went , '' she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 27]: `` Oh , I reckon I 'll never , never learn enough to keep out o ' trouble , even when I see it comin ' !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 103]: But that gentleman friend of mine -- Mr. Nashville Cory 's his name -- he kind o ' coaxed me into it , and he 's right comical when he 's with ladies , and he 's good company -- and he says , ` Claudine , we 'll dance the light fantastic , ' he says , and I kind o ' wanted something cheerful -- I 'd be 'n workin ' steady quite a spell , and it looked like he wanted to show me a good time , so I went , and that 's what started it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 47]: Now that she had begun , she babbled on with her story , at times incoherently ; full of excuses , made to herself more than to Ariel , pitifully endeavoring to convince herself that the responsibility for the muddle she had made was not hers .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 33]: `` Mr. Cory told me my husband was drinkin ' and would n't know about it , and , ` Besides , ' he says , ` what 's the odds ? '
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 32]: Of course I knowed there was trouble between him and Mr. Fear -- that 's my husband -- a good while ago , when Mr. Fear up and laid him out .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 26]: That was before me and Mr. Fear got married ; I had n't even be 'n to Canaan then ; I was on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 19]: I was on the stage quite a while in Chicago before I got acquainted with my husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 8]: `` You were on the stage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 5]: Ariel exclaimed , involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 5]: `` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 26]: Livin ' pitchers at Goldberg 's Rat ` skeller , and amunchoor nights I nearly always done a sketch with a gen ` leman friend .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 37]: That 's the way I met Mr. Fear ; he seemed to be real struck with me right away , and soon as I got through my turn he ast me to order whatever I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 29]: He 's always gen ` lemanlike when he ai n't had too much , and even then he vurry , vurry seldom acks rough unless he 's jealous .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 6]: That was the trouble yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 17]: I never would of gone to the Beach if I 'd dreamed what was comin ' !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 47]: When we got there I saw Mike -- that 's the gen ` leman that runs the Beach -- lookin ' at my company and me kind of anxious , and pretty soon he got me away from Mr. Cory and told me what 's what .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 33]: Seems this Cory only wanted me to go with him to make my husband mad , and he 'd took good care that Mr. Fear heard I 'd be there with him !
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 27]: And he 'd be 'n hangin ' around me , every time he struck town , jest to make Mr. Fear mad -- the fresh thing !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 25]: You see he wanted to make my husband start something again , this Mr. Cory did , and he was fixed for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 10]: `` I do n't understand , '' said Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 25]: `` It 's this way : if Mr. Fear attacted Mr. Cory , why , Mr. Cory could shoot him down and claim self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 43]: You see , it would be easy for Mr. Cory , because Mr Fear nearly killed him when they had their first trouble , and that would give Mr. Cory a good excuse to shoot if Mr. Fear jest only pushed him .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 10]: That 's the way it is with the law .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 14]: Mr. Cory could wipe out their old score and git off scot-free . ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 5]: `` Surely not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 13]: `` Yes , ma'am , that 's the way it would be .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 35]: And when Mike told me that Mr. Cory had got me out there jest to provoke my husband I went straight up to him and begun to give him a piece of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 39]: I did n't talk loud , because I never was one to make a disturbance and start trouble the way SOME do ; and right while I was talkin ' we both see my husband pass the window .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 23]: Mr. Cory give a kind of yelling laugh and put his arm round me jest as Mr. Fear come in the door .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 18]: And then it all happened so quick that you could hardly tell what WAS goin ' on .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 50]: Mr. Fear , we found afterwards , had promised Mr. Louden that he would n't come out there , but he took too much -- you could see that by the look of him -- and fergot his promise ; fergot everything but me and Cory , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 46]: `` He come right up to us , where I was tryin ' to git away from Cory 's arm -- it was the left one he had around me , and the other behind his back -- and neither of 'em said a word .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 19]: Cory kept on laughin ' loud as he could , and Mr. Fear struck him in the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 47]: He 's little , but he can hit awful hard , and Mr. Cory let out a screech , and I see his gun go off -- right in Mr. Fear 's face , I thought , but it was n't ; it only scorched him .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 30]: Most of the other gen ` lemen had run , but Mike made a dive and managed to knock the gun to one side , jest barely in time .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 27]: Then Mike and three or four others that come out from behind things separated 'em -- both of 'em fightin ' to git at each other .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 22]: They locked Mr. Cory up in Mike 's room , and took Mr. Fear over to where they hitch the horses .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 65]: Then Mike sent fer Mr. Louden to come out to talk to my husband and take care of him -- he 's the only one can do anything with him when he 's like that -- but before Mr. Louden could git there , Mr. Fear broke loose and run through a corn-field and got away ; at least they could n't find him .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 23]: And Mr. Cory jumped through a window and slid down into one of Mike 's boats , so they 'd both gone .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 27]: When Mr. Louden come , he only stayed long enough to hear what had happened and started out to find Happy -- that 's my husband .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 23]: He 's bound to keep them apart , but he has n't found Mr. Fear yet or he 'd be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 8]: Ariel had sunk back in her chair .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 8]: `` Why should your husband hide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 8]: she asked , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 16]: `` Waitin ' fer his chance at Cory , '' the woman answered , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 36]: `` I expect he 's afraid the cops are after him , too , on account of the trouble , and he does n't want to git locked up till he 's met Cory again .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 13]: They ai n't after him , but he may not know it .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 19]: They have n't heard of the trouble , I reckon , or they 'd of run Cory in .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 29]: HE 'S around town to-day , drinkin ' heavy , and I guess he 's lookin ' fer Mr. Fear about as hard as Mr. Louden is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 16]: She rose to her feet , lifted her coarse hands , and dropped them despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 8]: `` Oh , I 'm scared ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 12]: `` Mr. Fear 's be 'n mighty good to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 34]: A slow and tired footstep was heard upon the stairs , and Joe 's dog ran into the room droopingly , wagged his tail with no energy , and crept under the desk .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 34]: Mrs. Fear wheeled toward the door and stood , rigid , her hands clenched tight , her whole body still , except her breast , which rose and fell with her tumultuous breathing .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 12]: She could not wait till the laggard step reached the landing .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 5]: `` MR. LOUDEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 5]: she called , suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 8]: Joe 's voice came from the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 8]: `` It 's all right , Claudine .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 6]: It 's all fixed up .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 5]: Do n't worry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 20]: Mrs. Fear gave a thick cry of relief and sank back in her chair as Joe entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 40]: He came in shamblingly , with his hand over his eyes as if they were very tired and the light hurt them , so that , for a moment or two , he did not perceive the second visitor .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 15]: Then he let his hand fall , revealing a face very white and worn .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 12]: `` It 's all right , Claudine , '' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 7]: `` It 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 67]: He was moving to lay his hat on the desk when his eye caught first the roses , then fell upon Ariel , and he stopped stock-still with one arm outstretched , remaining for perhaps ten seconds in that attitude , while she , her lips parted , her eyes lustrous , returned his gaze with a look that was as inscrutable as it was kind .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' she said , as if in answer to a question , `` I have come here twice to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 7]: She nodded slightly toward Mrs. Fear .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 5]: `` I can wait .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 10]: I am very glad you bring good news . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 7]: Joe turned dazedly toward the other .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 16]: `` Claudine , '' he said , `` you 've been telling Miss Tabor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: `` I cert ` nly have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 12]: Mrs. Fear 's expression had cleared and her tone was cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 10]: `` I do n't see no harm in that !
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 15]: I 'm sure she 's a good friend of YOURS , Mr. Louden . ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 18]: Joe glanced at Ariel with a faint , troubled smile , and turned again to Mrs. Fear .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 11]: `` I 've had a long talk with Happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 6]: `` I 'm awful glad .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 8]: Is he ready to listen to reason ?
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 7]: she asked , with a titter .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 8]: `` He 's waiting for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 4]: She rose quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 9]: `` Stop , '' said Joe , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 25]: `` You must be very careful with him -- '' `` Do n't you s ` pose I 'm goin ' to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 10]: she interrupted , with a catch in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 14]: `` Do n't you s ` pose I 've had trouble enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 16]: `` No , '' said Joe , deliberately and impersonally , `` I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 41]: Unless you keep remembering to be careful all the time , you 'll follow the first impulse you have , as you did yesterday , and your excuse will be that you never thought any harm would come of it .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 31]: He 's in a queer mood ; but he will forgive you if you ask him -- '' `` Well , ai n't that what I WANT to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 29]: `` I know , I know , '' he said , dropping into the desk-chair and passing his hand over his eyes with a gesture of infinite weariness .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 8]: `` But you must be very careful .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 12]: I hunted for him most of the night and all day .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 26]: He was trying to keep out of my way because he did n't want me to find him until he had met this fellow Nashville .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 31]: Happy is a hard man to come at when he does n't care to be found , and he kept shifting from place to place until I ran him down .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 28]: Then I got him in a corner and told him that you had n't meant any harm -- which is always true of you , poor woman !
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 23]: -- and I did n't leave him till he had promised me to forgive you if you would come and ask him .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 28]: And you must keep him out of Cory 's way until I can arrange to have him -- Cory , I mean -- sent out of town .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 4]: Will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 13]: `` Why , cert ` nly , '' she answered , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 20]: `` That Nashville 's the vurry last person I ever want to see again -- the fresh thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 27]: Mrs. Fear 's burden had fallen ; her relief was perfect and she beamed vapidly ; but Joe marked her renewed irresponsibility with an anxious eye .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: `` You must n't make any mistakes , '' he said , rising stiffly with fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 4]: `` Not ME !
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 17]: _ I _ do n't take no more chances , '' she responded , tittering happily .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 5]: `` Not after yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 2]: MY !
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 9]: but it 's a load off my shoulders !
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 17]: I do hate it to have gen ` lemen quarrelling over me , especially Mr. Fear .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 29]: I never DID like to START anything ; I like to see people laugh and be friendly , and I 'm mighty glad it 's all blown over .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 11]: I kind o ' thought it would , all along .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 3]: PSHO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 8]: She burst into genuine , noisy laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 24]: `` I do n't expect either of 'em meant no real harm to each other , after they got cooled off a little !
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 12]: If they 'd met to-day , they 'd probably both run !
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 10]: Now , Mr. Louden , where 's Happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 8]: Joe went to the door with her .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 30]: He waited a moment , perplexed , then his brow cleared and he said in a low voice : `` You know the alley beyond Vent Miller 's pool-room ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 12]: Go down the alley till you come to the second gate .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 20]: Go in , and you 'll see a basement door opening into a little room under Miller 's bar .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 16]: The door wo n't be locked , and Happy 's in there waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 20]: But remember -- '' `` Oh , do n't you worry , '' she cut him off , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 5]: `` I know HIM !
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 14]: Inside of an hour I 'll have him LAUGHIN ' over all this .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 5]: You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 15]: When she had gone , he stood upon the landing looking thoughtfully after her .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 22]: `` Perhaps , after all , that is the best mood to let her meet him in , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 10]: Then , with a deep breath , he turned .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 24]: The heavy perfume had gone ; the air was clear and sweet , and Ariel was pressing her face into the roses again .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 38]: As he saw how like them she was , he was shaken with a profound and mysterious sigh , like that which moves in the breast of one who listens in the dark to his dearest music .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 26]: XV HAPPY FEAR GIVES HIMSELF UP `` I know how tired you are , '' said Ariel , as he came back into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 9]: `` I shall not keep you long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 7]: `` Ah , please do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 21]: he returned , quickly , beginning to fumble with the shade of a student-lamp at one end of the desk .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 10]: `` Let me do that , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 5]: `` Sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 25]: He obeyed at once , and watched her as she lit the lamp , and , stretching upon tiptoe , turned out the gas .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 44]: `` No , '' she continued , seated again and looking across the desk at him , `` I wanted to see you at the first possible opportunity , but what I have to say -- '' `` Wait , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 13]: `` Let me tell you why I did not come yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 7]: `` You need not tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 4]: I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 13]: She glanced at the chair which had been occupied by Mrs. Fear .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 13]: `` I knew last night that they had sent for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 5]: `` You did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 6]: `` Ah , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 8]: Sam Warden must have told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 18]: `` It was he ; and I have been wondering ever since how he heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 36]: He knew last night , but there was nothing in the papers this morning ; and until I came here I heard no one else speak of it ; yet Canaan is not large . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 3]: Joe laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 16]: `` It would n't seem strange if you lived with the Canaan that I do .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 26]: Sam had been down-town during the afternoon and had met friends ; the colored people are a good deal like a freemasonry , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 28]: A great many knew last night all about what had happened , and had their theories about what might happen to-day in case the two men met .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 18]: Still , you see , those who knew , also knew just what people not to tell .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 32]: The Tocsin is the only newspaper worth the name here ; but even if the Tocsin had known of the trouble , it would n't have been likely to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 10]: That 's a thing I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 10]: He frowned and rubbed the back of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 7]: `` There 's something underneath it .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 14]: For more than a year the Tocsin has n't spoken of Beaver Beach .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 8]: I 'd like to know why . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 15]: `` Joe , '' she said , slowly , `` tell me something truly .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 13]: A man said to me yesterday that he found life here insufferable .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 7]: Do you find it so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 6]: `` Why , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 5]: he answered , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 7]: `` Do you hate Canaan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 5]: `` Certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 13]: `` You do n't find it dull , provincial , unsympathetic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 4]: He laughed cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 20]: `` Well , there 's this , '' he explained : `` I have an advantage over your friend .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 10]: I see a more interesting side of things probably .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 39]: The people I live among are pretty thorough cosmopolites in a way , and the life I lead -- '' `` I think I begin to understand a little about the life you lead , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 10]: `` Then you do n't complain of Canaan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 6]: `` Of course not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 24]: She threw him a quick , bright , happy look , then glanced again at the chair in which Mrs. Fear had sat .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 24]: `` Joe , '' she said , `` last night I heard the people singing in the houses , the old Sunday-evening way .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: It ` took me back so ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 6]: `` Yes , it would .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 21]: And something else : there 's one hymn they sing more than any other ; it 's Canaan 's favorite .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 8]: Do you know what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 10]: `` Is it ` Rescue the Perishing ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 7]: ` Rescue the Perishing ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 26]: he cried , and repeating the words again , gave forth a peal of laughter so hearty that it brought tears to his eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 7]: ` RESCUE THE PERISHING ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 31]: At first she did not understand his laughter , but , after a moment , she did , and joined her own to it , though with a certain tremulousness .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 10]: `` It IS funny , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 10]: said Joe , wiping the moisture from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 8]: Then all trace of mirth left him .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 16]: `` Is it really YOU , sitting here and laughing with me , Ariel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 15]: `` It seems to be , '' she answered , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: `` I 'm not at all sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 84]: `` You did n't think , yesterday afternoon , '' he began , almost in a whisper , -- `` you did n't think that I had failed to come because I -- '' He grew very red , and shifted the sentence awkwardly : `` I was afraid you might think that I was -- that I did n't come because I might have been the same way again that I was when -- when I met you at the station ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 5]: she answered , gently .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 5]: I knew better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 17]: `` And do you know , '' he faltered , `` that that is all over ?
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 8]: That it can never happen again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 13]: `` Yes , I know it , '' she returned , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 13]: `` Then you know a little of what I owe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: `` You 've made that change in me already .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 25]: It was n't hard -- it wo n't be -- though it might have been if -- if you had n't come soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 9]: `` Tell me something , '' she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 24]: `` If these people had not sent for you yesterday , would you have come to Judge Pike 's house to see me ?
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 7]: You said you would try . ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 11]: She laughed a little , and looked away from him .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 12]: `` I want to know if you would have come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 22]: There was a silence , and in spite of her averted glance she knew that he was looking at her steadily .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: Finally , `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 8]: She shook her head and blushed faintly .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 7]: `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 15]: She looked up and met his eyes , and thereupon both became very grave .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 10]: `` Yes , I do , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 6]: `` You would have come .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 15]: When you left me at the gate and went away , you were afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 7]: But you would have come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 9]: `` Yes , -- I 'd have come .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 4]: You are right .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 31]: I was afraid at first ; but I knew , '' he went on , rapidly , `` that you would have come to the gate to meet me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 6]: `` You understood that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 12]: she cried , her eyes sparkling and her face flushing happily .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 42]: I knew that you would n't have asked me to come , '' he said , with a catch in his voice which was half chuckle , half groan , `` if you had n't meant to take care of me !
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 15]: And it came to me that you would know how to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 27]: She leaned back in her chair , and again they laughed together , but only for a moment , becoming serious and very quiet almost instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 14]: `` I have n't thanked you for the roses , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , you did .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 8]: When you first looked at them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 9]: `` So I did , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 7]: `` I 'm glad you saw .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 28]: To find them here took my breath away -- and to find you with them -- '' `` I brought them this morning , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 16]: `` Would you have come if you had not understood why I failed yesterday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 22]: `` Oh yes , I think so , '' she returned , the fine edge of a smile upon her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 27]: `` For a time last evening , before I heard what had happened , I thought you were too frightened a friend to bother about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 12]: He made a little ejaculation , partly joyful , partly sad .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 45]: `` And yet , '' she went on , `` I think that I should have come this morning , after all , even if you had a poorer excuse for your absence , because , you see , I came on business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 5]: `` You did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 9]: `` That 's why I 've come again .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 15]: That makes it respectable for me to be here now , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 15]: -- for me to have come out alone after dark without their knowing it ?
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 10]: I 'm here as your client , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 55]: She did not answer at once , but picked up a pen from beneath her hand on the desk , and turning it , meditatively felt its point with her forefinger before she said slowly , `` Are most men careful of other people 's -- well , of other people 's money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 7]: `` You mean Martin Pike ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 14]: I want you to take charge of everything I have for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 9]: He bent a frowning regard upon the lamp-shade .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 14]: `` You ought to look after your own property , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 9]: `` You surely have plenty of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 13]: `` You mean -- you mean you wo n't help me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 7]: she returned , with intentional pathos .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 4]: `` Ariel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 23]: he laughed , shortly , in answer ; then asked , `` What makes you think Judge Pike is n't trustworthy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 30]: `` Nothing very definite perhaps , unless it was his look when I told him that I meant to ask you to take charge of things for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 17]: `` He 's been rather hard pressed this year , I think , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 14]: `` You might be right -- if he could have found a way .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 7]: I hope he has n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 22]: `` I 'm afraid , '' she began , gayly , `` that I know very little of my own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 21]: He sent me a draft every three months , with receipts and other things to sign and return to him .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 31]: I have n't the faintest notion of what I own -- except the old house and some money from the income that I had n't used and brought with me .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 10]: Judge Pike has all the papers -- everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 4]: Joe looked troubled .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 15]: `` And Roger Tabor , did he -- '' `` The dear man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 7]: `` He was just the same .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 30]: To him poor Uncle Jonas 's money seemed to come from heaven through the hands of Judge Pike -- '' `` And there 's a handsome roundabout way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 6]: `` Was n't it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 5]: she agreed , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 8]: `` And he trusted the Judge absolutely .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 8]: I do n't , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 9]: He gave her a thoughtful look and nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 43]: `` No , he is n't a good man , '' he said , `` not even according to his lights ; but I doubt if he could have managed to get away with anything of consequence after he became the administrator .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 22]: He would n't have tried it , probably , unless he was more desperately pushed than I think he has been .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 7]: It would have been too dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 13]: Suppose you wait a week or so and think it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 17]: `` But there 's something I want you to do for me immediately , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 10]: `` I want the old house put in order .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: I 'm going to live there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 4]: `` Alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 30]: `` I 'm almost twenty-seven , and that 's being enough of an old maid for me to risk Canaan 's thinking me eccentric , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 12]: `` It will think anything you do is all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 18]: `` And once , '' she cried , `` it thought everything I did all wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 6]: That 's the difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 14]: `` You mean it will commend me because I 'm thought rich ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 17]: `` No , no , '' he said , meditatively , `` it is n't that .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 12]: It 's because everybody will be in love with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 5]: `` Quite everybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 7]: `` Certainly , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 10]: `` Anybody who did n't would be absurd . ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 6]: `` Ah , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 15]: `` You always were the nicest boy in the world , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 20]: At that he turned toward her with a sudden movement and his lips parted , but not to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 59]: She had rested one arm upon the desk , and her cheek upon her hand ; the pen she had picked up , still absently held in her fingers , touching her lips ; and it was given to him to know that he would always keep that pen , though he would never write with it again .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 28]: The soft lamplight fell across the lower part of her face , leaving her eyes , which were lowered thoughtfully , in the shadow of her hat .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 10]: The room was blotted out in darkness behind her .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 38]: Like the background of an antique portrait , the office , with its dusty corners and shelves and hideous safe , had vanished , leaving the charming and thoughtful face revealed against an even , spacious brownness .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 108]: Only Ariel and the roses and the lamp were clear ; and a strange , small pain moved from Joe 's heart to his throat , as he thought that this ugly office , always before so harsh and grim and lonely -- loneliest for him when it had been most crowded , -- was now transfigured into something very , very different from an office ; that this place where he sat , with a lamp and flowers on a desk between him and a woman who called him `` my dear , '' must be like -- like something that people called `` home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 37]: And then he leaned across the desk toward her , as he said again what he had said a little while before , -- and his voice trembled : `` Ariel , it IS you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 7]: She looked at him and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 11]: `` You 'll be here always , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 10]: You 're not going away from Canaan again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 12]: For a moment it seemed that she had not heard him .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 10]: Then her bright glance at him wavered and fell .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 25]: She rose , turning slightly away from him , but not so far that he could not see the sudden agitation in her face .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 34]: he cried , rising too , `` I do n't want you to think I do n't understand , or that I meant _ I _ should ever ask you to stay here !
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 16]: I could n't mean that ; you know I could n't , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 18]: You know I understand that it 's all just your beautiful friendliness , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 17]: `` It is n't beautiful ; it 's just ME , Joe , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 10]: `` It could n't be any other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 27]: `` It 's enough that you should be here now , '' he went on , bravely , his voice steady , though his hand shook .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 12]: `` Nothing so wonderful as your staying could ever actually happen .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 14]: It 's just a light coming into a dark room and out again .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 30]: One day , long ago -- I never forgot it -- some apple-blossoms blew by me as I passed an orchard ; and it 's like that , too .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 23]: But , oh , my dear , when you go you 'll leave a fragrance in my heart that will last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 13]: She turned toward him , her face suffused with a rosy light .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 18]: `` You 'd rather have died than have said that to me once , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 14]: `` I 'm glad you 're weak enough now to confess it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 16]: He sank down again into his chair and his arms fell heavily on the desk .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 5]: `` Confess it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 5]: he cried , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 18]: `` And you do n't deny that you 're going away again -- so it 's true !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 10]: I wish I had n't realized it so soon .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 17]: I think I 'd rather have tried to fool myself about it a little longer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 22]: `` Joe , '' she cried , in a voice of great pain , `` you must n't feel like that !
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 10]: How do you know I 'm going away again ?
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 16]: Why should I want the old house put in order unless I mean to stay ?
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 37]: And if I went , you know that I could never change ; you know how I 've always cared for you -- '' `` Yes , '' he said , `` I do know how .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 16]: It was always the same and it always will be , wo n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 12]: `` I 've shown that , '' she returned , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 15]: You say I know how you 've cared for me -- and I do .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 4]: I know HOW .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 25]: It 's just in one certain way -- Jonathan and David -- '' `` Is n't that a pretty good way , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: `` Never fear that I do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 12]: He got to his feet again and looked at her steadily .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 8]: She wiped sudden tears from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 13]: `` Do n't you be sorry for me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 19]: `` Do you think that ` passing the love of women ' is n't enough for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 9]: `` No , '' she answered , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 17]: `` I 'll have people at work on the old house to-morrow , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 15]: `` And for the -- '' `` I 've kept you so long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 15]: she interrupted , helped to a meek sort of gayety by his matter-of-fact tone .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 6]: She gave him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 11]: `` I do n't want you to come with me .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 11]: It is n't very late and this is Canaan . ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 19]: `` I want to come with you , however , '' he said , picking up his hat .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 8]: `` You ca n't go alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 14]: `` But you are so tired , you -- '' She was interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 34]: There were muffled , flying footsteps on the stairs , and a shabby little man ran furtively into the room , shut the door behind him , and set his back against it .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 18]: His face was mottled like a colored map , thick lines of perspiration shining across the splotches .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 30]: `` Joe , '' he panted , `` I 've got Nashville good , and he 's got me good , too ; -- I got to clear out .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 9]: He 's fixed me good , damn him !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 18]: but he wo n't trouble nobody -- '' Joe was across the room like a flying shadow .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 4]: `` QUIET ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 21]: His voice rang like a shot , and on the instant his hand fell sharply across the speaker 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 7]: `` In THERE , Happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 21]: He threw an arm across the little man 's shoulders and swung him toward the door of the other room .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 39]: Happy Fear looked up from beneath the down-bent brim of his black slouch hat ; his eyes followed an imperious gesture toward Ariel , gave her a brief , ghastly stare , and stumbled into the inner chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 8]: Joe said , cavalierly , to Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 12]: He went in quickly after Mr. Fear and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 29]: This was Joseph Louden , Attorney-at-Law ; and to Ariel it was like a new face seen in a flash-light -- not at all the face of Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 16]: The sense of his strangeness , his unfamiliarity in this electrical aspect , overcame her .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 16]: She was possessed by astonishment : Did she know him so well , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 44]: The strange client had burst in , shaken beyond belief with some passion unknown to her , but Joe , alert , and masterful beyond denial , had controlled him instantly ; had swept him into the other room as with a broom .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 15]: Could it be that Joe sometimes did other things in the same sweeping fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 39]: She heard a match struck in the next room , and the voices of the two men : Joe 's , then the other 's , the latter at first broken and protestive , but soon rising shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 6]: She could hear only fragments .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 14]: Once she heard the client cry , almost scream : `` By God !
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 15]: Joe , I thought Claudine had chased him around there to DO me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 17]: And , instantly , followed Louden 's voice : `` STEADY , HAPPY , STEADY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 40]: The name `` Claudine '' startled her ; and although she had had no comprehension of the argot of Happy Fear , the sense of a mysterious catastrophe oppressed her ; she was sure that something horrible had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 20]: She went to the window ; touched the shade , which disappeared upward immediately , and lifted the sash .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 28]: The front of a square building in the Court-house Square was bright with lights ; and figures were passing in and out of the Main Street doors .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: She remembered that this was the jail .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 4]: `` Claudine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 17]: The voice of the husband of Claudine was like the voice of one lamenting over Jerusalem .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 8]: `` STEADY , HAPPY , STEADY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 15]: `` But , Joe , if they git me , what 'll she do ?
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 35]: She ca n't hold her job no longer -- not after this ... '' The door opened , and the two men came out , Joe with his hand on the other 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 17]: The splotches had gone from Happy 's face , leaving it an even , deathly white .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 27]: He did not glance toward Ariel ; he gazed far beyond all that was about him ; and suddenly she was aware of a great tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 36]: The little man 's chin trembled and he swallowed painfully ; nevertheless he bore himself upright and dauntlessly as the two walked slowly to the door , like men taking part in some fateful ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 24]: Joe stopped upon the landing at the head of the stairs , but Happy Fear went on , clumping heavily down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 12]: `` It 's all right , Happy , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 10]: `` It 's better for you to go alone .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 5]: Do n't you worry .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 6]: I 'll see you through .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 7]: It will be all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 29]: `` Just as YOU say , Joe , '' a breaking voice came back from the foot of the steps , -- `` just as YOU say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 15]: The lawyer turned from the landing and went rapidly to the window beside Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 37]: Together they watched the shabby little figure cross the street below ; and she felt an infinite pathos gathering about it as it paused for a moment , hesitating , underneath the arc-lamp at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 32]: They saw the white face lifted as Happy Fear gave one last look about him ; then he set his shoulders sturdily , and steadfastly entered the door of the jail .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 6]: Joe took a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 10]: `` Now we 'll go , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 7]: `` I must be quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 11]: she asked , tremulously , as they reached the street .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 7]: `` Can you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 9]: `` Nothing -- just an old story . ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 28]: He had not offered her his arm , but walked on hurriedly , a pace ahead of her , though she came as rapidly as she could .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 23]: She put her hand rather timidly on his sleeve , and without need of more words from her he understood her insistence .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 18]: `` That was the husband of the woman who told you her story , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 23]: `` Perhaps it would shock you less if I tell you now than if you heard it to-morrow , as you will .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 9]: He 's just shot the other man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 5]: `` Killed him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 14]: `` He wanted to run away , but I would n't let him .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 19]: He has my word that I 'll clear him , and I made him give himself up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 83]: XVI THE TWO CANAANS When Joe left Ariel at Judge Pike 's gate she lingered there , her elbows upon the uppermost cross-bar , like a village girl at twilight , watching his thin figure vanish into the heavy shadow of the maples , then emerge momentarily , ghost-gray and rapid , at the lighted crossing down the street , to disappear again under the trees beyond , followed a second later by a brownish streak as the mongrel heeled after him .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 41]: When they had passed the second corner she could no longer be certain of them , although the street was straight , with flat , draughtsmanlike Western directness : both figures and Joe 's quick footsteps merging with the night .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 23]: Still she did not turn to go ; did not alter her position , nor cease to gaze down the dim street .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 66]: Few lights shone ; almost all the windows of the houses were darkened , and , save for the summer murmurs , the faint creak of upper branches , and the infinitesimal voices of insects in the grass , there was silence : the pleasant and somnolent hush , swathed in which that part of Canaan crosses to the far side of the eleventh hour .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 71]: But Ariel , not soothed by this balm , sought beyond it , to see that unquiet Canaan whither her old friend bent his steps and found his labor and his dwelling : that other Canaan where peace did not fall comfortably with the coming of night ; a place as alien in habit , in thought , and almost in speech as if it had been upon another continent .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 19]: And yet -- so strange is the duality of towns -- it lay but a few blocks distant .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 137]: Here , about Ariel , as she stood at the gate of the Pike Mansion , the houses of the good -LRB- secure of salvation and daily bread -RRB- were closed and quiet , as safely shut and sound asleep as the churches ; but deeper in the town there was light and life and merry , evil industry , -- screened , but strong to last until morning ; there were haunts of haggard merriment in plenty : surreptitious chambers where roulette-wheels swam beneath dizzied eyes ; ill-favored bars , reached by devious ways , where quavering voices offered song and were harshly checked ; and through the burdened air of this Canaan wandered heavy smells of musk like that upon Happy Fear 's wife , who must now be so pale beneath her rouge .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 54]: And above all this , and for all this , and because of all this , was that one resort to which Joe now made his way ; that haven whose lights burn all night long , whose doors are never closed , but are open from dawn until dawn -- the jail .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 20]: There , in that desolate refuge , lay Happy Fear , surrendered sturdily by himself at Joe 's word .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 50]: The picture of the little man was clear and fresh in Ariel 's eyes , and though she had seen him when he was newly come from a thing so terrible that she could not realize it as a fact , she felt only an overwhelming pity for him .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 11]: She was not even horror-stricken , though she had shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 18]: The pathos of the shabby little figure crossing the street toward the lighted doors had touched her .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 26]: Something about him had appealed to her , for he had not seemed wicked ; his face was not cruel , though it was desperate .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 12]: Perhaps it was partly his very desperation which had moved her .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 34]: She had understood Joe , when he told her , that this man was his friend ; and comprehended his great fear when he said : `` I 've got to clear him !
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 5]: I promised him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 15]: Over and over Joe had reiterated : `` I 've got to save him !
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 6]: I 've got to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 18]: She had answered gently , `` Yes , Joe , '' hurrying to keep up with him .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 11]: `` He 's a good man , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 11]: `` I 've known few better , given his chances .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 15]: And none of this would have happened except for his old-time friendship for me .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 13]: It was his loyalty -- oh , the rarest and absurdest loyalty !
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 14]: -- that made the first trouble between him and the man he shot .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 8]: I 've got to clear him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 7]: `` Will it be hard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 7]: `` They may make it so .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 9]: I can only see part of it surely .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 14]: When his wife left the office , she met Cory on the street .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 17]: You saw what a pitiful kind of fool she was , irresponsible and helpless and feather-brained .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 53]: There are thousands of women like that everywhere -- some of them are ` Court Beauties , ' I dare say -- and they always mix things up ; but they are most dangerous when they 're like Claudine , because then they live among men of action like Cory and Fear .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 46]: Cory was artful : he spent the day about town telling people that he had always liked Happy ; that his ill feeling of yesterday was all gone ; he wanted to find him and shake his hand , bury past troubles and be friends .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 21]: I think he told Claudine the same thing when they met , and convinced the tiny brainlet of his sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 41]: Cory was a man who ` had a way with him , ' and I can see Claudine flattered at the idea of being peace-maker between ` two such nice gen ` lemen as Mr. Cory and Mr. Fear . '
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 26]: Her commonest asseveration -- quite genuine , too -- is that she does n't like to have the gen ` lemen making trouble about her !
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 13]: So the poor imbecile led him to where her husband was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 12]: All that Happy knew of this was in her cry afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 25]: He was sitting alone , when Cory threw open the door and said , ` I 've got you this time , Happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 8]: His pistol was raised but never fired .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 24]: He waited too long , meaning to establish his case of ` self-defence , ' and Fear is the quickest man I know .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 7]: Cory fell just inside the door .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 44]: Claudine stumbled upon him as she came running after him , crying out to her husband that she ` never meant no trouble , ' that Cory had sworn to her that he only wanted to shake hands and ` make up . '
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 35]: Other people heard the shot and broke into the room , but they did not try to stop Fear ; he warned them off and walked out without hindrance , and came to me .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 8]: I 've got to clear him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 80]: Ariel knew what he meant : she realized the actual thing as it was , and , though possessed by a strange feeling that it must all be medieval and not possibly of to-day , understood that he would have to fight to keep his friend from being killed ; that the unhappy creature who had run into the office out of the dark stood in high danger of having his neck broken , unless Joe could help him .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 63]: He made it clear to her that the State would kill Happy if it could ; that it would be a point of pride with certain deliberate men holding office to take the life of the little man ; that if they did secure his death it would be set down to their efficiency , and was even competent as campaign material .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 52]: `` I wish to point out , '' Joe had heard a candidate for re-election vehemently orate , `` that in addition to the other successful convictions I have named , I and my assistants have achieved the sending of three men to the gallows during my term of office ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 14]: `` I ca n't tell yet , '' said Joe , at parting .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 6]: `` It may be hard .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 9]: I 'm so sorry you saw all this .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 8]: I -- '' `` Oh NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 7]: `` I want to UNDERSTAND ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 80]: She was still there , at the gate , her elbows resting upon the cross-bar , when , a long time after Joe had gone , there came from the alley behind the big back yard the minor chordings of a quartette of those dark strollers who never seem to go to bed , who play by night and playfully pretend to work by day : `` You know my soul is a-full o ' them-a-trub-bils , Ev-ry mawn !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 8]: I cain ' a-walk withouten I stum-bils !
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 12]: Then le ` ss go on -- Keep walkin ' on !
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 22]: These times is sow ` owful , an ' I am pow ` owful Sick an ' fo ` lawn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 22]: She heard a step upon the path behind her , and , turning , saw a white-wrapped figure coming toward her .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 4]: `` Mamie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 3]: she called .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 6]: Mamie lifted a warning hand .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 10]: `` The windows are open , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 7]: `` They might hear you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 10]: `` Why have n't you gone to bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 9]: `` Oh , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 17]: Mamie answered , in deep distress , -- `` I 've been sitting up for you .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 48]: We all thought you were writing letters in your room , but after papa and mamma had gone to bed I went in to tell you good night , and you were n't there , nor anywhere else ; so I knew you must have gone out .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 38]: I 've been sitting by the front window , waiting to let you in , but I went to sleep until a little while ago , when the telephone-bell rang and he got up and answered it .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 25]: He kept talking a long time ; it was something about the Tocsin , and I 'm afraid there 's been a murder down-town .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 19]: When he went back to bed I fell asleep again , and then those darkies woke me up .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 10]: How on earth did you expect to get in ?
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 12]: Do n't you know he always locks up the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 10]: `` I could have rung , '' said Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 6]: `` Oh -- oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 25]: gasped Miss Pike ; and , after she had recovered somewhat , asked : `` Do you mind telling me where you 've been ?
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 11]: I wo n't tell him -- nor mamma , either .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 16]: I think , after all , I was wrong yesterday to follow Eugene 's advice .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 16]: He meant for the best , but I -- '' `` Do n't think that .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 6]: You were n't wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 10]: Ariel put her arm round the other 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 13]: `` I went to talk over some things with Mr. Louden . ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 42]: `` I think , '' whispered Mamie , trembling , `` that you are the bravest girl I ever knew -- and -- and -- I could almost believe there 's some good in him , since you like him so .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 5]: I know there is .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 12]: And I -- I think he 's had a hard time .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 13]: I want you to know I wo n't even tell Eugene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 17]: `` You can tell everybody in the world , '' said Ariel , and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 49]: XVII MR. SHEEHAN 'S HINTS `` Never , '' said the Tocsin on the morrow , `` has this community been stirred to deeper indignation than by the cold-blooded and unmitigated brutality of the deliberate murder committed almost under the very shadow of the Court-house cupola last night .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 51]: The victim was not a man of good repute , it is true , but at the moment of his death he was in the act of performing a noble and generous action which showed that he might have become , if he lived , a good and law-fearing citizen .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 24]: In brief , he went to forgive his enemy and was stretching forth the hand of fellowship when that enemy shot him down .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 46]: Not half an hour before his death , Cory had repeated within the hearing of a dozen men what he had been saying all day , as many can testify : ' I want to find my old friend Fear and shake hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 27]: I want to tell him that I forgive him and that I am ashamed of whatever has been my part in the trouble between us . '
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 9]: He went with that intention to his death .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 29]: The wife of the murderer has confessed that this was the substance of what he said to her , and that she was convinced of his peaceful intentions .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 17]: When they reached the room where her husband was waiting for her , Cory entered first .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 22]: The woman claims now that as they neared the vicinity he hastened forward at a pace which she could not equal .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 14]: Naturally , her testimony on all points favoring her husband is practically worthless .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 40]: She followed and heard the murdered man speak , though what his words were she declares she does not know , and of course the murderer , after consultation with his lawyer , claims that their nature was threatening .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 14]: Such a statement , in determining the truth , is worse than valueless .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 47]: It is known and readily proved that Fear repeatedly threatened the deceased 's life yesterday , and there is no question in the mind of any man , woman , or child , who reads these words , of the cold blooded nature of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 31]: The slayer , who had formerly made a murderous attack upon his victim , lately quarrelled with him and uttered threats , as we have stated , upon his life .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 17]: The dead man came to him with protestations of friendship and was struck down a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 31]: It is understood that the defence will in desperation set up the theory of self-defence , based on an unsubstantiated claim that Cory entered the room with a drawn pistol .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 8]: No pistol was found in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 28]: The weapon with which the deed was accomplished was found upon the person of the murderer when he was seized by the police , one chamber discharged .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 22]: Another revolver was discovered upon the person of the woman , when she was arrested on the scene of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 32]: This , upon being strictly interrogated , she said she had picked up from the floor in the confusion , thinking it was her husband 's and hoping to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 25]: The chambers were full and undischarged , and we have heard it surmised that the defence means to claim that it was Cory 's .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 28]: Cory doubtless went on his errand of forgiveness unarmed , and beyond doubt the second weapon belonged to the woman herself , who has an unenviable record .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 47]: `` The point of it all is plainly this : here is an unquestionable murder in the first degree , and the people of this city and county are outraged and incensed that such a crime should have been committed in their law-abiding and respectable community .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 7]: With whom does the fault lie ?
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 7]: On whose head is this murder ?
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 12]: Not with the authorities , for they do not countenance crime .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 34]: Has it come to the pass that , counting on juggleries of the law , criminals believe that they may kill , maim , burn , and slay as they list without punishment ?
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 29]: Is this to be another instance of the law 's delays and immunity for a hideous crime , compassed by a cunning and cynical trickster of legal technicalities ?
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 24]: The people of Canaan cry out for a speedy trial , speedy conviction , and speedy punishment of this cold-blooded and murderous monster .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 28]: If he is not dealt with quickly according to his deserts , the climax is upon us and the limit of Canaan 's patience has been reached .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 28]: `` One last word , and we shall be glad to have its significance noted : J. Louden , Esq. , has been retained for the defence !
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 28]: The murderer , before being apprehended by the authorities , WENT STRAIGHT FROM THE SCENE OF HIS CRIME TO PLACE HIS RETAINER IN HIS ATTORNEY 'S POCKET !
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 8]: HOW LONG IS THIS TO LAST ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 45]: The Tocsin was quoted on street corners that morning , in shop and store and office , wherever people talked of the Cory murder ; and that was everywhere , for the people of Canaan and of the country roundabout talked of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 86]: Women chattered of it in parlor and kitchen ; men gathered in small groups on the street and shook their heads ominously over it ; farmers , meeting on the road , halted their teams and loudly damned the little man in the Canaan jail ; milkmen lingered on back porches over their cans to agree with cooks that it was an awful thing , and that if ever any man deserved hanging , that there Fear deserved it -- his lawyer along with him !
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 49]: Tipsy men hammered bars with fists and beer-glasses , inquiring if there was no rope to be had in the town ; and Joe Louden , returning to his office from the little restaurant where he sometimes ate his breakfast , heard hisses following him along Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 36]: A clerk , a fat-shouldered , blue-aproned , pimple-cheeked youth , stood in the open doors of a grocery , and as he passed , stared him in the face and said `` Yah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 4]: with supreme disgust .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 3]: Joe stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 5]: he asked , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 14]: The clerk put two fingers in his mouth and whistled shrilly in derision .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 13]: `` You 'd ort to be run out o ' town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 17]: `` I believe , '' said Joe , `` that we have never met before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 8]: `` Go on , you shyster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 6]: Joe looked at him gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 23]: `` My dear sir , '' he returned , `` you speak to me with the familiarity of an old friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 21]: The clerk did not recover so far as to be capable of repartee until Joe had entered his own stairway .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 31]: Then , with a bitter sneer , he seized a bad potato from an open barrel and threw it at the mongrel , who had paused to examine the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 21]: The missile failed , and Respectability , after bestowing a slightly injured look upon the clerk , followed his master .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 9]: In the office the red-bearded man sat waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 47]: Not so red-bearded as of yore , however , was Mr. Sheehan , but grizzled and gray , and , this morning , gray of face , too , as he sat , perspiring and anxious , wiping a troubled brow with a black silk handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 26]: `` Here 's the devil and all to pay at last , Joe , '' he said , uneasily , on the other 's entrance .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 26]: `` This is the worst I ever knew ; and I hate to say it , but I doubt yer pullin ' it off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 9]: `` I 've got to , Mike . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 13]: `` I hope on my soul there 's a chanst of it !
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 9]: I like the little man , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 14]: `` So do I. '' `` I know ye do , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 32]: But here 's this Tocsin kickin ' up the public sentiment ; and if there ever was a follerin ' sheep on earth , it 's that same public sentiment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 26]: `` If it were n't for that '' -- Joe flung himself heavily in a chair -- `` there 'd not be so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 8]: It 's a clear enough case . ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 22]: `` But do n't ye see , '' interrupted Sheehan , `` the Tocsin 's tried it and convicted him aforehand ?
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 32]: And that if things keep goin ' the way they 've started to-day , the gran ' jury 's bound to indict him , and the trial jury to convict him ?
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 7]: They would n't dare not to !
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 9]: What 's more , they 'll want to !
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 23]: And they 'll rush the trial , summer or no summer , and -- '' `` I know , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 46]: `` I 'll tell ye one thing , '' said the other , wiping his forehead with the black handkerchief , `` and that 's this , my boy : last night 's business has just about put the cap on the Beach fer me .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 12]: I 'm sick of it and I 'm tired of it !
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 9]: I 'm ready to quit , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 6]: Joe looked at him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 20]: `` Do n't you think my old notion of what might be done could be made to pay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 3]: Sheehan laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 3]: `` Whoo !
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 7]: You and yer hints , Joe !
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 12]: How long past have ye come around me with 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 33]: I b ` lieve ye c 'd make more money , Mike ' -- that 's the way ye 'd put it , -- ` if ye altered the Beach a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 35]: Make a little country-side restaurant of it , ' ye 'd say , ` and have good cookin ' , and keep the boys and girls from raisin ' so much hell out there .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 13]: Soon ye 'd have other people comin ' beside the regular crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 29]: Make a little garden on the shore , and let 'em eat at tables under trees an ' grape-arbors -- ' '' `` Well , why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 3]: asked Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 15]: `` Have n't I been tellin ' ye I 'm thinkin ' of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 56]: It 's only yer way of hintin ' that 's funny to me , -- yer way of sayin ' I 'd make more money , because ye 're afraid of preachin ' at any of us : partly because ye know the little good it 'd be , and partly because ye have humor .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 12]: Well , I 'm thinkin ' ye 'll git yer way .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 14]: I 'M willin ' to go into the missionary business with ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 4]: `` Mike ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 32]: said Joe , angrily , but he grew very red and failed to meet the other 's eye , `` I 'm not -- '' `` Yes , ye are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 3]: cried Sheehan .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 36]: It 's a thing ye prob ` ly have n't had the nerve to say to yerself since a boy , but that 's yer notion inside : ye 're little better than a missionary !
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 19]: It took me a long while to understand what was drivin ' ye , but I do now .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 46]: And ye 've gone the right way about it , because we know ye 'll stand fer us when we 're in trouble and fight fer us till we git a square deal , as ye 're goin ' to fight for Happy now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 5]: Joe looked deeply troubled .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 15]: `` Never mind , '' he said , crossly , and with visible embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 20]: `` You think you could n't make more at the Beach if you ran it on my plan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 13]: `` I 'm game to try , '' said Sheehan , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 35]: `` I 'm too old to hold 'em down out there the way I yoosta could , and I 'm sick of it -- sick of it into the very bones of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 5]: He wiped his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 6]: `` Where 's Claudine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 7]: `` Held as a witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 9]: `` I 'm not sorry fer HER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 7]: said the red-bearded man , emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 18]: `` Women o ' that kind are so light-headed it 's a wonder they do n't float .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 20]: Think of her pickin ' up Cory 's gun from the floor and hidin ' it in her clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 20]: Took it fer granted it was Happy 's , and thought she 'd help him by hidin ' it !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 18]: There 's a hard point fer ye , Joe : to prove the gun belonged to Cory .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 10]: There 's nobody about here could swear to it .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 18]: I could n't myself , though I forced him to stick it back in his pocket yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 42]: He was a wanderer , too ; and ye 'll have to send a keen one to trace him , I 'm thinkin ' , to find where he got it , so 's ye can show it in court . ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 6]: `` I 'm going myself .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 12]: I 've found out that he came here from Denver . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 8]: `` And from where before that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 20]: `` I do n't know , but I 'll keep on travelling till I get what I want . ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 35]: `` That 's right , my boy , '' exclaimed the other , heartily , `` It may be a long trip , but ye 're all the little man has to depend on .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 19]: Did ye notice the Tocsin did n't even give him the credit fer givin ' himself up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: `` It 's part of their game . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 44]: `` Did it strike ye now , '' Mr. Sheehan asked , earnestly , leaning forward in his chair , -- `` did it strike ye that the Tocsin was aimin ' more to do Happy harm because of you than himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 8]: Joe looked sadly out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 28]: `` I 've thought that over , and it seemed possible that I might do Happy more good by giving his case to some other lawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 6]: `` No , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 9]: exclaimed the proprietor of Beaver Beach , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 30]: `` They 've begun their attack ; they 're bound to keep it up , and they 'd manage to turn it to the discredit of both of ye .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 28]: Besides , Happy would n't have no other lawyer ; he 'd ruther be hung with you fightin ' fer him than be cleared by anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 13]: I b ` lieve it , -- on my soul I do !
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 44]: But look here , '' he went on , leaning still farther forward ; `` I want to know if it struck ye that this morning the Tocsin attacked ye in a way that was somehow vi ` lenter than ever before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied Joe , `` because it was aimed to strike where it would most count . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 14]: `` It ai n't only that , '' said the other , excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 7]: `` It ai n't only that !
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 6]: I want ye to listen .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 24]: Now see here : the Tocsin is Pike , and the town is Pike -- I mean the town ye naturally belonged to .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 5]: Ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 11]: `` In a way , I suppose -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: `` In a way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 6]: echoed the other , scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 6]: `` Ye know it is !
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 17]: Even as a boy Pike disliked ye and hated the kind of a boy ye was .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 8]: Ye was n't respectable and he was !
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 8]: Ye was n't rich and he was !
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 17]: Ye had a grin on yer face when ye 'd meet him on the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 20]: The red-bearded man broke off at a gesture from Joe and exclaimed sharply : `` Do n't deny it !
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 9]: _ I _ know what ye was like !
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 17]: Ye was n't impudent , but ye looked at him as if ye saw through him .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 9]: Now listen and I 'll lead ye somewhere !
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 31]: Ye run with riffraff , naggers , and even '' -- Mr. Sheehan lifted a forefinger solemnly and shook it at his auditor -- `` and even with the Irish !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 57]: Now I ask ye this : ye 've had one part of Canaan with ye from the start , MY part , that is ; but the other 's against ye ; that part 's PIKE , and it 's the rulin ' part -- '' `` Yes , Mike , '' said Joe , wearily .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: `` In the spirit of things .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 4]: I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 10]: `` No , sir , '' cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 11]: `` That 's the trouble : ye do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 10]: There 's more in Canaan than ye 've understood .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 17]: Listen to this : Why was the Tocsin 's attack harder this morning than ever before ?
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 14]: On yer soul did n't it sound so bitter that it sounded desprit ?
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 3]: Now why ?
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 20]: It looked to me as if it had started to ruin ye , this time fer good and all !
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 11]: What have ye had to do with Martin Pike lately ?
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 10]: Has the old wolf GOT to injure ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 13]: Mr. Sheehan 's voice rose and his eyes gleamed under bushy brows .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 7]: `` Think , '' he finished .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 13]: `` What 's happened lately to make him bite so hard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 22]: There were some faded roses on the desk , and as Joe 's haggard eyes fell upon them the answer came .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 12]: `` What makes you think Judge Pike is n't trustworthy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 40]: he had asked Ariel , and her reply had been : `` Nothing very definite , unless it was his look when I told him that I meant to ask you to take charge of things for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 9]: He got slowly and amazedly to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 7]: `` You 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: `` Ye see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 12]: cried Mike Sheehan , slapping his thigh with a big hand .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 9]: `` On my soul I have the penetration !
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 29]: Ye do n't need to tell me one thing except this : I told ye I 'd lead ye somewhere ; have n't I kept me word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 8]: `` But I have the penetration ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Sheehan .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 27]: `` Should I miss my guess if I said that ye think Pike may be scared ye 'll stumble on his track in some queer performances ?
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 6]: Should I miss it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 8]: `` You would n't miss it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 7]: `` Just one thing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 14]: The red-bearded man rose , mopping the inner band of his straw hat .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 32]: `` In the matter of yer runnin ' fer Mayor , now -- '' Joe , who had begun to pace up and down the room , made an impatient gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 4]: `` Pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 16]: he interrupted ; but his friend stopped him with a hand laid on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 17]: `` Do n't be treatin ' it as clean out of all possibility , Joe Louden .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 27]: If ye do , it shows ye have n't sense to know that nobody can say what way the wind 's blowin ' week after next .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 18]: All the boys want ye ; Louie Farbach wants ye , and Louie has a big say .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 10]: Who is it that does n't want ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 7]: `` Canaan , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 4]: `` Hold up !
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 8]: It 's Pike 's Canaan ye mean .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 16]: If ye git the nomination , ye 'd be elected , would n't ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 8]: `` I could n't be nominated . ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 31]: `` I ai n't claimin ' ye 'd git Martin Pike 's vote , '' returned Mr. Sheehan , sharply , `` though I do n't say it 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 11]: Ye 've got to beat him , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 28]: Ye 've got to do to him what he 's done to YOU , and what he 's tryin ' to do now worse than ever before .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 41]: Well -- there may be ways to do it ; and if he tempts me enough , I may fergit my troth and honor as a noble gentleman and help ye with a word ye 'd never guess yerself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 15]: `` You 've hinted at such mysteries before , Mike , '' Joe smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 19]: `` I 'd be glad to know what you mean , if there 's anything in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 16]: `` It may come to that , '' said the other , with some embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 44]: `` It may come to that some day , if the old wolf presses me too hard in the matter o ' tryin ' to git the little man across the street hanged by the neck and yerself mobbed fer helpin ' him !
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 9]: But to-day I 'll say no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 7]: `` Very well , Mike . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 7]: Joe turned wearily to his desk .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 12]: `` I do n't want you to break any promises . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 21]: Mr. Sheehan had gone to the door , but he paused on the threshold , and wiped his forehead again .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 56]: `` And I do n't want to break any , '' he said , `` but if ever the time should come when I could n't help it '' -- he lowered his voice to a hoarse but piercing whisper -- `` that will be the devourin ' angel 's day fer Martin Pike ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 29]: XVIII IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY It was a morning of the warmest week of mid-July , and Canaan lay inert and helpless beneath a broiling sun .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 44]: The few people who moved about the streets went languidly , keeping close to the wall on the shady side ; the women in thin white fabrics ; the men , often coatless , carrying palm-leaf fans , and replacing collars with handkerchiefs .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 56]: In the Court-house yard the maple leaves , gray with blown dust and grown to great breadth , drooped heavily , depressing the long , motionless branches with their weight , so low that the four or five shabby idlers , upon the benches beneath , now and then flicked them sleepily with whittled sprigs .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 72]: The doors and windows of the stores stood open , displaying limp wares of trade , but few tokens of life ; the clerks hanging over dim counters as far as possible from the glare in front , gossiping fragmentarily , usually about the Cory murder , and , anon , upon a subject suggested by the sight of an occasional pedestrian passing perspiring by with scrooged eyelids and purpling skin .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 44]: From street and sidewalk , transparent hot waves swam up and danced themselves into nothing ; while from the river bank , a half-mile away , came a sound hotter than even the locust 's midsummer rasp : the drone of a planing-mill .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 31]: A chance boy , lying prone in the grass of the Court-house yard , was annoyed by the relentless chant and lifted his head to mock it : `` AWR-EER-AWR-EER !
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 8]: SHUT UP , CA N'T YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 16]: The effort was exhausting : he relapsed and suffered with increasing malice but in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 38]: Abruptly there was a violent outbreak on the `` National House '' corner , as when a quiet farmhouse is startled by some one 's inadvertently bringing down all the tin from a shelf in the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 26]: The loafers on the benches turned hopefully , saw what it was , then closed their eyes , and slumped back into their former positions .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 27]: The outbreak subsided as suddenly as it had arisen : Colonel Flitcroft pulled Mr. Arp down into his chair again , and it was all over .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 22]: Greater heat than that of these blazing days could not have kept one of the sages from attending the conclave now .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 30]: For the battle was on in Canaan : and here , upon the National House corner , under the shadow of the west wall , it waxed even keener .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 44]: Perhaps we may find full justification for calling what was happening a battle in so far as we restrict the figure to apply to this one spot ; else where , in the Canaan of the Tocsin , the conflict was too one-sided .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 25]: The Tocsin had indeed tried the case of Happy Fear in advance , had convicted and condemned , and every day grew more bitter .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 11]: Nor was the urgent vigor of its attack without effect .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 51]: Sleepy as Main Street seemed in the heat , the town was incensed and roused to a tensity of feeling it had not known since the civil war , when , on occasion , it had set out to hang half a dozen `` Knights of the Golden Circle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 18]: Joe had been hissed on the street many times since the inimical clerk had whistled at him .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 34]: Probably demonstrations of that sort would have continued had he remained in Canaan ; but for almost a month he had been absent and his office closed , its threshold gray with dust .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 36]: There were people who believed that he had run away again , this time never to return ; among those who held to this opinion being Mrs. Louden and her sister , Joe 's step-aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 39]: Upon only one point was everybody agreed : that twelve men could not be found in the county who could be so far persuaded and befuddled by Louden that they would dare to allow Happy Fear to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 66]: The women of Canaan , incensed by the terrible circumstance of the case , as the Tocsin colored it -- a man shot down in the act of begging his enemy 's forgiveness -- clamored as loudly as the men : there was only the difference that the latter vociferated for the hanging of Happy ; their good ladies used the word `` punishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 34]: And yet , while the place rang with condemnation of the little man in the jail and his attorney , there were voices , here and there , uplifted on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 12]: People existed , it astonishingly appeared , who LIKED Happy Fear .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 65]: These were for the greater part obscure and even darkling in their lives , yet quite demonstrably human beings , able to smile , suffer , leap , run , and to entertain fancies ; even to have , according to their degree , a certain rudimentary sense of right and wrong , in spite of which they strongly favored the prisoner 's acquittal .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 28]: Precisely on that account , it was argued , an acquittal would outrage Canaan and lay it open to untold danger : such people needed a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 67]: The Tocsin interviewed the town 's great ones , printing their opinions of the heinousness of the crime and the character of the defendant 's lawyer ... `` The Hon. P. J. Parrott , who so ably represented this county in the Legislature some fourteen years ago , could scarcely restrain himself when approached by a reporter as to his sentiments anent the repulsive deed . '
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 25]: I should like to know how long Canaan is going to put up with this sort of business , ' were his words . '
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 53]: I am a law-abiding citizen , and I have served faithfully , and with my full endeavor and ability , to enact the laws and statutes of my State , but there is a point in my patience , I would state , which lawbreakers and their lawyers may not safely pass .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 44]: Of what use are our most solemn enactments , I may even ask of what use is the Legislature itself , chosen by the will of the people , if they are to ruthlessly be set aside by criminals and their shifty protectors ?
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 39]: The blame should be put upon the lawyers who by tricks enable such rascals to escape the rigors of the carefully enacted laws , the fruits of the Solon 's labor , more than upon the criminals themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 74]: In this case , if there is any miscarriage of justice , I will say here and now that in my opinion the people of this county will be sorely tempted ; and while I do not believe in lynch-law , yet if that should be the result it is my unalterable conviction that the vigilantes may well turn their attention to the lawyers -- OR LAWYER -- who bring about such miscarriage .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 8]: I am sick of it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 73]: The Tocsin did not print the interview it obtained from Louie Farbach -- the same Louie Farbach who long ago had owned a beer-saloon with a little room behind the bar , where a shabby boy sometimes played dominoes and `` seven-up '' with loafers : not quite the same Louie Farbach , however , in outward circumstance : for he was now the brewer of Farbach Beer and making Canaan famous .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 29]: His rise had been Teutonic and sure ; and he contributed one-twentieth of his income to the German Orphan Asylum and one-tenth to his party 's campaign fund .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 19]: The twentieth saved the orphans from the county , while the tithe gave the county to his party .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 50]: He occupied a kitchen chair , enjoying the society of some chickens in a wired enclosure behind the new Italian villa he had erected in that part of Canaan where he would be most uncomfortable , and he looked woodenly at the reporter when the latter put his question .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 10]: `` Hef you any aguaintunce off Mitster Fear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 22]: he inquired , in return , with no expression decipherable either upon his Gargantuan face or in his heavily enfolded eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 12]: `` No , sir , '' replied the reporter , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 8]: `` I never ran across him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 18]: `` Dot iss a goot t ` ing fer you , '' said Mr. Farbach , stonily .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 13]: `` He iss not a man peobles bedder try to run across .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 6]: It iss what Gory tried .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 6]: Now Gory iss dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 10]: The reporter , slightly puzzled , lit a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 62]: `` See here , Mr. Farbach , '' he urged , `` I only want a word or two about this thing ; and you might give me a brief expression concerning that man Louden besides : just a hint of what you think of his influence here , you know , and of the kind of sharp work he practises .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 5]: Something like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 11]: `` I see , '' said the brewer , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 12]: `` Happy Fear I hef knowt for a goot many years .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 9]: He iss a goot frient of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 21]: `` Choe Louten iss a bedder one , '' continued Mr. Farbach , turning again to stare at his chickens .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 5]: `` Git owit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 20]: `` Git owit , '' repeated the other , without passion , without anger , without any expression whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 5]: `` Git owit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 13]: The reporter 's prejudice against the German nation dated from that moment .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 16]: There were others , here and there , who were less self-contained than the brewer .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 49]: A farm-hand struck a fellow laborer in the harvest-field for speaking ill of Joe ; and the unravelling of a strange street fight , one day , disclosed as its cause a like resentment , on the part of a blind broom-maker , engendered by a like offence .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 44]: The broom-maker 's companion , reading the Tocsin as the two walked together , had begun the quarrel by remarking that Happy Fear ought to be hanged once for his own sake and twice more `` to show up that shyster Louden . ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 66]: Warm words followed , leading to extremely material conflict , in which , in spite of his blindness , the broom-maker had so much the best of it that he was removed from the triumphant attitude he had assumed toward the person of his adversary , which was an admirable imitation of the dismounted St. George and the Dragon , and conveyed to the jail .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 25]: Keenest investigation failed to reveal anything oblique in the man 's record ; to the astonishment of Canaan , there was nothing against him .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 34]: He was blind and moderately poor ; but a respectable , hard-working artisan , and a pride to the church in which he was what has been called an `` active worker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 43]: It was discovered that his sensitiveness to his companion 's attack on Joseph Louden arose from the fact that Joe had obtained the acquittal of an imbecile sister of the blind man , a two-thirds-witted woman who had been charged with bigamy .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 26]: The Tocsin made what it could of this , and so dexterously that the wrath of Canaan was one farther jot increased against the shyster .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 11]: Ay , the town was hot , inside and out .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 6]: Let us consider the Forum .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 15]: Was there ever before such a summer for the `` National House '' corner ?
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 24]: How voices first thundered there , then cracked and piped , is not to be rendered in all the tales of the fathers .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 41]: One who would make vivid the great doings must indeed `` dip his brush in earthquake and eclipse '' ; even then he could but picture the credible , and must despair of this : the silence of Eskew Arp .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 17]: Not that Eskew held his tongue , not that he was chary of speech -- no !
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 6]: O tempora , O mores !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 2]: NO !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 72]: But that he refused the subject in hand , that he eschewed expression upon it and resolutely drove the argument in other directions , that he achieved such superbly un-Arplike inconsistency ; and with such rich material for his sardonic humors , not at arm 's length , not even so far as his finger-tips , but beneath his very palms , he rejected it : this was the impossible fact .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 15]: Eskew -- there is no option but to declare -- was no longer Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 39]: It is the truth ; since the morning when Ariel Tabor came down from Joe 's office , leaving her offering of white roses in that dingy , dusty , shady place , Eskew had not been himself .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 54]: His comrades observed it somewhat in a physical difference , one of those alterations which may come upon men of his years suddenly , like a `` sea change '' : his face was whiter , his walk slower , his voice filed thinner ; he creaked louder when he rose or sat .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 20]: Old always , from his boyhood , he had , in the turn of a hand , become aged .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 42]: But such things come and such things go : after eighty there are ups and downs ; people fading away one week , bloom out pleasantly the next , and resiliency is not at all a patent belonging to youth alone .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 14]: The material change in Mr. Arp might have been thought little worth remarking .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 40]: What caused Peter Bradbury , Squire Buckalew , and the Colonel to shake their heads secretly to one another and wonder if their good old friend 's mind had not `` begun to go '' was something very different .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 74]: To come straight down to it : he not only abstained from all argument upon the `` Cory Murder '' and the case of Happy Fear , refusing to discuss either in any terms or under any circumstances , but he also declined to speak of Ariel Tabor or of Joseph Louden ; or of their affairs , singular or plural , masculine , feminine , or neuter , or in any declension .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 8]: Not a word , committal or non-committal .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 2]: None !
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 16]: And his face , when he was silent , fell into sorrowful and troubled lines .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 6]: At first they merely marvelled .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 8]: Then Squire Buckalew dared to tempt him .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 22]: Eskew 's faded eyes showed a blue gleam , but he withstood , speaking of Babylon to the disparagement of Chicago .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 35]: They sought to lead him into what he evidently would not , employing many devices ; but the old man was wily and often carried them far afield by secret ways of his own .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 37]: This hot morning he had done that thing : they were close upon him , pressing him hard , when he roused that outburst which had stirred the idlers on the benches in the Court-house yard .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 23]: Squire Buckalew -LRB- sidelong at the others but squarely at Eskew -RRB- had volunteered the information that Cory was a reformed priest .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 34]: Stung by the mystery of Eskew 's silence , the Squire 's imagination had become magically gymnastic ; and if anything under heaven could have lifted the veil , this was the thing .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 8]: Mr. Arp 's reply may be reverenced .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 35]: `` I consider , '' he said , deliberately , `` that James G. Blaine 's furrin policy was childish , and , what 's more , I never thought much of HIM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 18]: This outdefied Ajax , and every trace of the matter in hand went to the four winds .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 38]: Eskew , like Rome , was saved by a cackle , in which he joined , and a few moments later , as the bench loafers saw , was pulled down into his seat by the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 37]: The voices of the fathers fell to the pitch of ordinary discourse ; the drowsy town was quiet again ; the whine of the planing-mill boring its way through the sizzling air to every wakening ear .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 38]: Far away , on a quiet street , it sounded faintly , like the hum of a bee across a creek , and was drowned in the noise of men at work on the old Tabor house .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 51]: It seemed the only busy place in Canaan that day : the shade of the big beech-trees which surrounded it affording some shelter from the destroying sun to the dripping laborers who were sawing , hammering , painting , plumbing , papering , and ripping open old and new packing-boxes .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 42]: There were many changes in the old house pleasantly in keeping with its simple character : airy enlargements now almost completed so that some of the rooms were already finished , and stood , furnished and immaculate , ready for tenancy .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 14]: In that which had been Roger Tabor 's studio sat Ariel , alone .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 34]: She had caused some chests and cases , stored there , to be opened , and had taken out of them a few of Roger 's canvases and set them along the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 59]: Tears filled her eyes as she looked at them , seeing the tragedy of labor the old man had expended upon them ; but she felt the recompense : hard , tight , literal as they were , he had had his moment of joy in each of them before he saw them coldly and knew the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 24]: And he had been given his years of Paris at last : and had seen `` how the other fellows did it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 38]: A heavy foot strode through the hall , coming abruptly to a halt in the doorway , and turning , she discovered Martin Pike , his big Henry-the-Eighth face flushed more with anger than with the heat .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 37]: His hat was upon his head , and remained there , nor did he offer any token or word of greeting whatever , but demanded to know when the work upon the house had been begun .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: `` The second morning after my return , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 27]: `` I want to know , '' he pursued , `` why it was kept secret from me , and I want to know quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 4]: `` Secret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 19]: she echoed , with a wave of her hand to indicate the noise which the workmen were making .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 9]: `` Upon whose authority was it begun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 3]: `` Mine .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 7]: Who else could give it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 21]: `` Look here , '' he said , advancing toward her , `` do n't you try to fool me !
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 9]: You have n't done all this by yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 6]: Who hired these workmen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 17]: Remembering her first interview with him , she rose quickly before he could come near her .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 23]: `` Mr. Louden made most of the arrangements for me , '' she replied , quietly , `` before he went away .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 10]: He will take charge of everything when he returns .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 19]: You have n't forgotten that I told you I intended to place my affairs in his hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 16]: He had started forward , but at this he stopped and stared at her inarticulately .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 5]: `` You remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 14]: she said , her hands resting negligently upon the back of the chair .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 6]: `` Surely you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 16]: She was not in the least afraid of him , but coolly watchful of him .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 11]: This had been her habit with him since her return .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 91]: She had seen little of him , except at table , when he was usually grimly laconic , though now and then she would hear him joking heavily with Sam Warden in the yard , or , with evidently humorous intent , groaning at Mamie over Eugene 's health ; but it had not escaped Ariel that he was , on his part , watchful of herself , and upon his guard with a wariness in which she was sometimes surprised to believe that she saw an almost haggard apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 43]: He did not answer her question , and it seemed to her , as she continued steadily to meet his hot eyes , that he was trying to hold himself under some measure of control ; and a vain effort it proved .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 9]: `` You go back to my house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 7]: he burst out , shouting hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 6]: `` You get back there !
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 5]: You stay there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 14]: `` No , '' she said , moving between him and the door .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 11]: `` Mamie and I are going for a drive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 9]: `` You go back to my house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 11]: He followed her , waving an arm fiercely at her .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 13]: `` Do n't you come around here trying to run over me !
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 8]: You talk about your ` affairs ' !
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 32]: All you 've got on earth is this two-for-a-nickel old shack over your head and a bushel-basket of distillery stock that you can sell by the pound for old paper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 17]: He threw the words in her face , the bull-bass voice seamed and cracked with falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 15]: `` Old paper , old rags , old iron , bottles , old clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 6]: You talk about your affairs !
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 4]: Who are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 2]: Rothschild ?
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 8]: You have n't GOT any affairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 59]: Not a look , not a word , not a motion of his escaped her in all the fury of sound and gesture in which he seemed fairly to envelop himself ; least of all did that shaking of his -- the quivering of jaw and temple , the tumultuous agitation of his hands -- evade her watchfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 9]: `` When did you find this out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 6]: she said , very quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 7]: `` After you became administrator ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 18]: He struck the back of the chair she had vacated a vicious blow with his open hand .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 6]: `` No , you spendthrift !
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 22]: All there was TO your grandfather when you buried him was a basket full of distillery stock , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 3]: Old paper !
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 6]: Ca n't you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 40]: Old paper , old rags -- '' `` You have sent me the same income , '' she lifted her voice to interrupt ; `` you have made the same quarterly payments since his death that you made before .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 11]: If you knew , why did you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 69]: He had been shouting at her with the frantic and incredulous exasperation of an intolerant man utterly unused to opposition ; his face empurpled , his forehead dripping , and his hands ruthlessly pounding the back of the chair ; but this straight question stripped him suddenly of gesture and left him standing limp and still before her , pale splotches beginning to show on his hot cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 12]: `` If you knew , why did you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 38]: `` You wrote me that my income was from dividends , and I knew and thought nothing about it ; but if the stock which came to me was worthless , how could it pay dividends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 11]: `` It did not , '' he answered , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 19]: `` That distillery stock , I tell you , is n't worth the matches to burn it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 17]: `` But there has been no difference in my income , '' she persisted , steadily .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 8]: Can you explain that to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 33]: `` Yes , I can , '' he replied , and it seemed to her that he spoke with a pallid and bitter desperation , like a man driven to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 12]: `` I can if you think you want to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 6]: `` I sent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 19]: `` Do you mean from you own -- '' `` I mean it was my own money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 30]: She had not taken her eyes from his , which met hers straightly and angrily ; and at this she leaned forward , gazing at him with profound scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 8]: `` Why did you send it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 11]: `` Charity , '' he answered , after palpable hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 19]: Her eyes widened and she leaned back against the lintel of the door , staring at him incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 4]: `` Charity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 7]: she echoed , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 42]: Perhaps he mistook her amazement at his performance for dismay caused by the sense of her own position , for , as she seemed to weaken before him , the strength of his own habit of dominance came back to him .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 6]: `` Charity , madam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 7]: he broke out , shouting intolerably .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 6]: `` Charity , d'ye hear ?
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 28]: I was a friend of the man that made the money you and your grandfather squandered ; I was a friend of Jonas Tabor , I say !
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 26]: That 's why I was willing to support you for a year and over , rather than let a niece of his suffer . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 5]: ` Suffer ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 4]: she cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 4]: ` Support ' !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 9]: You sent me a hundred thousand francs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 22]: The white splotches which had mottled Martin Pike 's face disappeared as if they had been suddenly splashed with hot red .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 12]: `` You go back to my house , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 17]: `` What I sent you only shows the extent of my -- '' `` Effrontery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 28]: The word rang through the whole house , so loudly and clearly did she strike it , rang in his ears till it stung like a castigation .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 11]: It was ominous , portentous of justice and of disaster .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 14]: There was more than doubt of him in it : there was conviction .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 19]: He fell back from this word ; and when he again advanced , Ariel had left the house .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 65]: She had turned the next corner before he came out of the gate ; and as he passed his own home on his way down-town , he saw her white dress mingling with his daughter 's near the horse-block beside the fire , where the two , with their arms about each other , stood waiting for Sam Warden and the open summer carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 17]: Judge Pike walked on , the white splotches reappearing like a pale rash upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 13]: A yellow butterfly zigzagged before him , knee-high , across the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 10]: He raised his foot and half kicked at it .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 57]: XIX ESKEW ARP As the Judge continued his walk down Main Street , he wished profoundly that the butterfly -LRB- which exhibited no annoyance -RRB- had been of greater bulk and more approachable ; and it was the evil fortune of Joe 's mongrel to encounter him in the sinister humor of such a wish unfulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 36]: Respectability dwelt at Beaver Beach under the care of Mr. Sheehan until his master should return ; and Sheehan was kind ; but the small dog found the world lonely and time long without Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 52]: He had grown more and more restless , and at last , this hot morning , having managed to evade the eye of all concerned in his keeping , made off unobtrusively , partly by swimming , and reaching the road , cantered into town , his ears erect with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 31]: Bent upon reaching the familiar office , he passed the grocery from the doorway of which the pimply cheeked clerk had thrown a bad potato at him a month before .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 72]: The same clerk had just laid down the Tocsin as Respectability went by , and , inspired to great deeds in behalf of justice and his native city , he rushed to the door , lavishly seized , this time , a perfectly good potato , and hurled it with a result which ecstasized him , for it took the mongrel fairly aside the head , which it matched in size .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 24]: The luckless Respectability 's purpose to reach Joe 's stairway had been entirely definite , but upon this violence he forgot it momentarily .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 35]: It is not easy to keep things in mind when one is violently smitten on mouth , nose , cheek , eye , and ear by a missile large enough to strike them simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 12]: Yelping and half blinded , he deflected to cross Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 22]: Judge Pike had elected to cross in the opposite direction , and the two met in the middle of the street .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 37]: The encounter was miraculously fitted to the Judge 's need : here was no butterfly , but a solid body , light withal , a wet , muddy , and dusty yellow dog , eminently kickable .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 32]: The man was heavily built about the legs , and the vigor of what he did may have been additionally inspired by his recognition of the mongrel as Joe Louden 's .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 22]: The impact of his toe upon the little runner 's side was momentous , and the latter rose into the air .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 19]: The Judge hopped , as one hops who , unshod in the night , discovers an unexpected chair .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 27]: Let us be reconciled to his pain and not reproach the gods with it , -- for two of his unintending adversary 's ribs were cracked .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 47]: The dog , thus again deflected , retraced his tracks , shrieking distractedly , and , by one of those ironical twists which Karma reserves for the tails of the fated , dived for blind safety into the store commanded by the ecstatic and inimical clerk .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 95]: There were shouts ; the sleepy Square beginning to wake up : the boy who had mocked the planing-mill got to his feet , calling upon his fellows ; the bench loafers strolled to the street ; the aged men stirred and rose from their chairs ; faces appeared in the open windows of offices ; sales ladies and gentlemen came to the doorways of the trading-places ; so that when Respectability emerged from the grocery he had a notable audience for the scene he enacted with a brass dinner-bell tied to his tail .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 21]: Another potato , flung by the pimpled , uproarious , prodigal clerk , added to the impetus of his flight .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 35]: A shower of pebbles from the hands of exhilarated boys dented the soft asphalt about him ; the hideous clamor of the pursuing bell increased as he turned the next corner , running distractedly .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 106]: The dead town had come to life , and its inhabitants gladly risked the dangerous heat in the interests of sport , whereby it was a merry chase the little dog led around the block , For thus some destructive instinct drove him ; he could not stop with the unappeasable Terror clanging at his heels and the increasing crowd yelling in pursuit ; but he turned to the left at each corner , and thus came back to pass Joe 's stairway again , unable to pause there or anywhere , unable to do anything except to continue his hapless flight , poor meteor .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 30]: Round the block he went once more , and still no chance at that empty stairway where , perhaps , he thought , there might be succor and safety .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 24]: Blood was upon his side where Martin Pike 's boot had crashed , foam and blood hung upon his jaws and lolling tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 25]: He ran desperately , keeping to the middle of the street , and , not howling , set himself despairingly to outstrip the Terror .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 30]: The mob , disdaining the sun superbly , pursued as closely as it could , throwing bricks and rocks at him , striking at him with clubs and sticks .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 64]: Happy Fear , playing `` tic-tac-toe , '' right hand against left , in his cell , heard the uproar , made out something of what was happening , and , though unaware that it was a friend whose life was sought , discovered a similarity to his own case , and prayed to his dim gods that the quarry might get away .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 5]: `` MAD DOG ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 3]: they yelled .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 5]: `` MAD DOG ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 14]: And there were some who cried , `` JOE LOUDEN 'S DOG ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 8]: that being equally as exciting and explanatory .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 13]: Three times round , and still the little fugitive maintained a lead .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 13]: A gray-helmeted policeman , a big fellow , had joined the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 38]: He had children at home who might be playing in the street , and the thought of what might happen to them if the mad dog should head that way resolved him to be cool and steady .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 20]: He was falling behind , so he stopped on the corner , trusting that Respectability would come round again .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 23]: He was right , and the flying brownish thing streaked along Main Street , passing the beloved stairway for the fourth time .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 45]: The policeman lifted his revolver , fired twice , missed once , but caught him with the second shot in a forepaw , clipping off a fifth toe , one of the small claws that grow above the foot and are always in trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 48]: This did not stop him ; but the policeman , afraid to risk another shot because of the crowd , waited for him to come again ; and many others , seeing the hopeless circuit the mongrel followed , did likewise , armed with bricks and clubs .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 20]: Among them was the pimply clerk , who had been inspired to commandeer a pitchfork from a hardware store .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 12]: When the fifth round came , Respectability 's race was run .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 39]: He turned into Main Street at a broken speed , limping , parched , voiceless , flecked with blood and foam , snapping feebly at the showering rocks , but still indomitably a little ahead of the hunt .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 44]: There was no yelp left in him -- he was too thoroughly winded for that , -- but in his brilliant and despairing eyes shone the agony of a cry louder than the tongue of a dog could utter : `` O master !
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 7]: O all the god I know !
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 9]: Where are you in my mortal need ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 27]: Now indeed he had a gauntlet to run ; for the street was lined with those who awaited him , while the pursuit grew closer behind .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 33]: A number of the hardiest stood squarely in his path , and he hesitated for a second , which gave the opportunity for a surer aim , and many missiles struck him .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 24]: `` Let him have it now , officer , '' said Eugene Bantry , standing with Judge Pike at the policeman 's elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 7]: `` There 's your chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 23]: But before the revolver could be discharged , Respectability had begun to run again , hobbling on three legs and dodging feebly .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 32]: A heavy stone struck him on the shoulder and he turned across the street , making for the `` National House '' corner , where the joyful clerk brandished his pitchfork .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 46]: Going slowly , he almost touched the pimply one as he passed , and the clerk , already rehearsing in his mind the honors which should follow the brave stroke , raised the tines above the little dog 's head for the coup de grace .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 20]: They did not descend , and the daring youth failed of fame as the laurel almost embraced his brows .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 30]: A hickory walking-stick was thrust between his legs ; and he , expecting to strike , received a blow upon the temple sufficient for his present undoing and bedazzlement .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 37]: He went over backwards , and the pitchfork -LRB- not the thing to hold poised on high when one is knocked down -RRB- fell with the force he had intended for Respectability upon his own shin .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 38]: A train had pulled into the station , and a tired , travel-worn young man , descending from a sleeper , walked rapidly up the street to learn the occasion of what appeared to be a riot .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 56]: When he was close enough to understand its nature , he dropped his bag and came on at top speed , shouting loudly to the battered mongrel , who tried with his remaining strength to leap toward him through a cordon of kicking legs , while Eugene Bantry again called to the policeman to fire .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 14]: `` If he does , damn you , I 'll kill him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 53]: Joe saw the revolver raised ; and then , Eugene being in his way , he ran full-tilt into his stepbrother with all his force , sending him to earth , and went on literally over him as he lay prone upon the asphalt , that being the shortest way to Respectability .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 17]: The next instant the mongrel was in his master 's arms and weakly licking his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 32]: But it was Eskew Arp who had saved the little dog ; for it was his stick which had tripped the clerk , and his hand which had struck him down .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 20]: All his bodily strength had departed in that effort , but he staggered out into the street toward Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 5]: `` Joe Louden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 9]: called the veteran , in a loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 5]: `` Joe Louden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 4]: and suddenly reeled .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 31]: The Colonel and Squire Buckalew were making their way toward him , but Joe , holding the dog to his breast with one arm , threw the other about Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 39]: `` It 's a town -- it 's a town '' -- the old fellow flung himself free from the supporting arm -- `` it 's a town you could n't even trust a yellow dog to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 10]: He sank back upon Joe 's shoulder , speechless .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 65]: An open carriage had driven through the crowd , the colored driver urged by two ladies upon the back seat , and Martin Pike saw it stop by the group in the middle of the street where Joe stood , the wounded dog held to his breast by one arm , the old man , white and half fainting , supported by the other .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 57]: Martin Pike saw this and more ; he saw Ariel Tabor and his own daughter leaning from the carriage , the arms of both pityingly extended to Joe Louden and his two burdens , while the stunned and silly crowd stood round them staring , clouds of dust settling down upon them through the hot air .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 80]: XX THREE ARE ENLISTED Now in that blazing noon Canaan looked upon a strange sight : an open carriage whirling through Main Street behind two galloping bays ; upon the back seat a ghostly white old man with closed eyes , supported by two pale ladies , his head upon the shoulder of the taller ; while beside the driver , a young man whose coat and hands were bloody , worked over the hurts of an injured dog .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 35]: Sam Warden 's whip sang across the horses ; lather gathered on their flanks , and Ariel 's voice steadily urged on the pace : `` Quicker , Sam , if you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 13]: For there was little breath left in the body of Eskew Arp .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 62]: Mamie , almost as white as the old man , was silent ; but she had not hesitated in her daring , now that she had been taught to dare ; she had not come to be Ariel 's friend and honest follower for nothing ; and it was Mamie who had cried to Joe to lift Eskew into the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 10]: `` You must come too , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 7]: `` We will need you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 29]: And so it came to pass that under the eyes of Canaan Joe Louden rode in Judge Pike 's carriage at the bidding of Judge Pike 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 68]: Toward Ariel 's own house they sped with the stricken octogenarian , for he was `` alone in the world , '' and she would not take him to the cottage where he had lived for many years by himself , a bleak little house , a derelict of the `` early days '' left stranded far down in the town between a woollen-mill and the water-works .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 42]: The workmen were beginning their dinners under the big trees , but as Sam Warden drew in the lathered horses at the gate , they set down their tin buckets hastily and ran to help Joe lift the old man out .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 20]: Carefully they bore him into the house and laid him upon a bed in one of the finished rooms .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 25]: He did not speak or move and the workmen uncovered their heads as they went out , but Joe knew that they were mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 24]: `` It 's all right , Mr. Arp , '' he said , as Ariel knelt by the bed with water and restoratives .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 6]: `` It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 6]: Do n't you worry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 36]: Then the veteran 's lips twitched , and though his eyes remained closed , Joe saw that Eskew understood , for he gasped , feebly : `` Pos-i-tive-ly -- no -- free -- seats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 91]: To Mrs. Louden , sewing at an up-stairs window , the sight of her stepson descending from Judge Pike 's carriage was sufficiently startling , but when she saw Mamie Pike take Respectability from his master 's arms and carry him tenderly indoors , while Joe and Ariel occupied themselves with Mr. Arp , the good lady sprang to her feet as if she had been stung , regardlessly sending her work-basket and its contents scattering over the floor , and ran down the stairs three steps at a time .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 20]: At the front door she met her husband , entering for his dinner , and she leaped at him .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 4]: Had he seen ?
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 4]: What had happened ?
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 62]: Mr. Louden rubbed his chin-beard , indulging himself in a pause which was like to prove fatal to his companion , finally vouchsafing the information that the doctor 's buggy was just turning the corner ; Eskew Arp had suffered a `` stroke , '' it was said , and , in Louden 's opinion , was a mighty sick man .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 42]: His spouse replied in no uncertain terms that she had seen quite that much for herself , urging him to continue , which he did with a deliberation that caused her to recall their wedding-day with a gust of passionate self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 70]: Presently he managed to interrupt , reminding her that her dining-room windows commanded as comprehensive a view of the next house as did the front steps , and after a time her housewifely duty so far prevailed over her indignation at the man 's unwholesome stolidity that she followed him down the hall to preside over the meal , not , however , to partake largely of it herself .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 45]: Mr. Louden had no information of Eugene 's mishap , nor had Mrs. Louden any suspicion that all was not well with the young man , and , hearing him enter the front door , she called to him that his dinner was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 20]: Eugene , however , made no reply and went up-stairs to his own apartment without coming into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 71]: A small crowd , neighboring children , servants , and negroes , had gathered about Ariel 's gate , and Mrs. Louden watched the working-men disperse this assembly , gather up their tools , and depart ; then Mamie came out of the house , and , bowing sadly to three old men who were entering the gate as she left it , stepped into her carriage and drove away .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 40]: The new-comers , Colonel Flitcroft , Squire Buckalew , and Peter Bradbury , glanced at the doctor 's buggy , shook their heads at one another , and slowly went up to the porch , where Joe met them .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 16]: Mrs. Louden uttered a sharp exclamation , for the Colonel shook hands with her stepson .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 45]: Perhaps Flitcroft himself was surprised ; he had offered his hand almost unconsciously , and the greeting was embarrassed and perfunctory ; but his two companions , each in turn , gravely followed his lead , and Joe 's set face flushed a little .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 21]: It was the first time in many years that men of their kind in Canaan had offered him this salutation .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 15]: `` He would n't let me send for you , '' he told them .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 14]: `` He said he knew you 'd be here soon without that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 10]: And he led the way to Eskew 's bedside .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 56]: Joe and the doctor had undressed the old man , and had put him into night-gear of Roger Tabor 's , taken from an antique chest ; it was soft and yellow and much more like color than the face above it , for the white hair on the pillow was not whiter than that .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 55]: Yet there was a strange youthfulness in the eyes of Eskew ; an eerie , inexplicable , luminous , LIVE look ; the thin cheeks seemed fuller than they had been for years ; and though the heavier lines of age and sorrow could be seen , they appeared to have been half erased .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 31]: He lay not in sunshine , but in clear light ; the windows were open , the curtains restrained , for he had asked them not to darken the room .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 29]: The doctor was whispering in a doctor 's way to Ariel at the end of the room opposite the bed , when the three old fellows came in .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 61]: None of them spoke immediately , and though all three cleared their throats with what they meant for casual cheerfulness , to indicate that the situation was not at all extraordinary or depressing , it was to be seen that the Colonel 's chin trembled under his mustache , and his comrades showed similar small and unwilling signs of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 4]: Eskew spoke first .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 6]: `` Well , boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 6]: he said , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 52]: That seemed to make it more difficult for the others ; the three white heads bent silently over the fourth upon the pillow ; and Ariel saw waveringly , for her eyes suddenly filled , that the Colonel laid his unsteady hand upon Eskew 's , which was outside the coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 32]: `` It 's -- it 's not , '' said the old soldier , gently -- `` it 's not on -- on both sides , is it , Eskew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 9]: Mr. Arp moved his hand slightly in answer .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 10]: `` It ai n't paralysis , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 17]: `` They call it ` shock and exhaustion ' ; but it 's more than that .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 6]: It 's just my time .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 6]: I 've heard the call .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 27]: We 've all been slidin ' on thin ice this long time -- and it 's broke under me -- '' `` Eskew , Eskew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 4]: remonstrated Peter Bradbury .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 9]: `` You 'd ought n't to talk that-a-way !
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 45]: You only kind of overdone a little -- heat o ' the day , too , and -- '' `` Peter , '' interrupted the sick man , with feeble asperity , `` did you ever manage to fool me in your life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 6]: `` No , Eskew . ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 12]: `` Well , you 're not doin ' it now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 34]: Two tears suddenly loosed themselves from Squire Buckalew 's eyelids , despite his hard endeavor to wink them away , and he turned from the bed too late to conceal what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 14]: `` There ai n't any call to feel bad , '' said Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 40]: `` It might have happened any time -- in the night , maybe -- at my house -- and all alone -- but here 's Airie Tabor brought me to her own home and takin ' care of me .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 14]: I could n't ask any better way to go , could I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 30]: `` I do n't know what we 'll do , '' stammered the Colonel , `` if you -- you talk about goin ' away from us , Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 52]: We -- we could n't get along -- '' `` Well , sir , I 'm almost kind of glad to think , '' Mr. Arp murmured , between short struggles for breath , `` that it 'll be -- quieter -- on the -- `` National House '' corner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 14]: A moment later he called the doctor faintly and asked for a restorative .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 28]: `` There , '' he said , in a stronger voice and with a gleam of satisfaction in the vindication of his belief that he was dying .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 7]: `` I was almost gone then .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 6]: _ I _ know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 15]: He lay panting for a moment , then spoke the name of Joe Louden .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 7]: Joe came quickly to the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 16]: `` I want you to shake hands with the Colonel and Peter and Buckalew . ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 14]: `` We did , '' answered the Colonel , infinitely surprised and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 11]: `` We shook hands outside before we came in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 9]: `` Do it again , '' said Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 8]: `` I want to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 33]: And Joe , making shift to smile , was suddenly blinded , so that he could not see the wrinkled hands extended to him , and was fain to grope for them .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 19]: `` God knows why we did n't all take his hand long ago , '' said Eskew Arp .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 9]: `` I did n't because I was stubborn .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 11]: I hated to admit that the argument was against me .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 20]: I acknowledge it now before him and before you -- and I want the word of it CARRIED ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 15]: `` It 's all right , Mr. Arp , '' began Joe , tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 44]: `` You must n't -- '' `` Hark to me '' -- the old man 's voice lifted higher : `` If you 'd ever whimpered , or give back-talk , or broke out the wrong way , it would of been different .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 5]: But you never did .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 58]: I 've watched you and I know ; and you 've just gone your own way alone , with the town against you because you got a bad name as a boy , and once we 'd given you that , everything you did or did n't do , we had to give you a blacker one .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 10]: Now it 's time some one stood by you !
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 12]: Airie Tabor 'll do that with all her soul and body .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 12]: She told me once I thought a good deal of you .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 3]: She knew !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 15]: But I want these three old friends of mine to do it , too .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 14]: I was boys with them and they 'll do it , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 42]: They 've even stood up fer you against me , sometimes , but mostly fer the sake of the argument , I reckon ; but now they must do it when there 's more to stand against than just my talk .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 13]: They saw it all to-day -- the meanest thing I ever knew !
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 10]: I could of stood it all except that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 24]: Before they could prevent him he had struggled half upright in bed , lifting a clinched fist at the town beyond the windows .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 6]: `` But , by God !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 58]: when they got so low down they tried to kill your dog -- '' He fell back , choking , in Joe 's arms , and the physician bent over him , but Eskew was not gone , and Ariel , upon the other side of the room , could hear him whispering again for the restorative .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 19]: She brought it , and when he had taken it , went quickly out-of-doors to the side yard .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 31]: She sat upon a workman 's bench under the big trees , hidden from the street shrubbery , and breathing deeply of the shaded air , began to cry quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 24]: Through the windows came the quavering voice of the old man , lifted again , insistent , a little querulous , but determined .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 82]: Responses sounded , intermittently , from the Colonel , from Peter , and from Buckalew , and now and then a sorrowful , yet almost humorous , protest from Joe ; and so she made out that the veteran swore his three comrades to friendship with Joseph Louden , to lend him their countenance in all matters , to stand by him in weal and woe , to speak only good of him and defend him in the town of Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 14]: Thus did Eskew Arp on the verge of parting this life render justice .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 13]: The gate clicked , and Ariel saw Eugene approaching through the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 34]: One of his hands was bandaged , a thin strip of court-plaster crossed his forehead from his left eyebrow to his hair , and his thin and agitated face showed several light scratches .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 11]: `` I saw you come out , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 11]: `` I 've been waiting to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 18]: `` The doctor told us to let him have his way in whatever he might ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 5]: Ariel wiped her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 23]: `` I 'm afraid that means -- '' `` I did n't come to talk about Eskew Arp , '' interrupted Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 11]: `` I 'm not laboring under any anxiety about him .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 18]: You need n't be afraid ; he 's too sour to accept his conge so readily . ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 52]: `` Please lower your voice , '' she said , rising quickly and moving away from him toward the house ; but , as he followed , insisting sharply that he must speak with her , she walked out of ear-shot of the windows , and stopping , turned toward him .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 8]: `` Very well , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 9]: `` Is it a message from Mamie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 8]: At this he faltered and hung fire .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 9]: `` Have you been to see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 3]: she continued .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 21]: `` I am anxious to know if her goodness and bravery caused her any -- any discomfort at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 15]: `` You may set your mind at rest about that , '' returned Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 12]: `` I was there when the Judge came home to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 19]: I suppose you fear he may have been rough with her for taking my step-brother into the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 4]: He was not .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 19]: On the contrary , he spoke very quietly to her , and went on out toward the stables .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 16]: But I have n't come to you to talk of Judge Pike , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 16]: `` I do n't care particularly to hear of him , but of Mamie . ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 8]: `` Nor of her , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 4]: he broke out .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 9]: `` I want to talk of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 25]: There was not mistaking him ; no possibility of misunderstanding the real passion that shook him , and her startled eyes betrayed her comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 14]: `` Yes , I see you understand , '' he cried , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 12]: `` That 's because you 've seen others the same way .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 32]: God help me , '' he went on , striking his forehead with his open hand , `` that young fool of a Bradbury told me you refused him only yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 9]: He was proud of even rejection from you !
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 22]: And there 's Norbert -- and half a dozen others , perhaps , already , since you 've been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 11]: He flung out his arms in ludicrous , savage despair .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 36]: `` And here am I -- '' `` Ah yes , '' she cut him off , `` it is of yourself that you want to speak , after all -- not of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 18]: `` Look here , '' he vociferated ; `` are you going to marry that Joe Louden ?
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 10]: I want to know whether you are or not .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 10]: He gave me this -- and this to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 9]: He touched his bandaged hand and plastered forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 42]: `` He ran into me -- over me -- for nothing , when I was not on my guard ; struck me down -- stamped on me -- '' She turned upon him , cheeks aflame , eyes sparkling and dry .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 15]: `` Mr. Bantry , '' she cried , `` he did a good thing !
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 9]: And now I want you to go home .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 31]: I want you to go home and try if you can discover anything in yourself that is worthy of Mamie and of what she showed herself to be this morning !
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: If you can , you will have found something that I could like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 27]: She went rapidly toward the house , and he was senseless enough to follow , babbling : `` What do you think I 'm made of ?
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 9]: You trample on me -- as he did !
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 25]: I ca n't bear everything ; I tell you -- '' But she lifted her hand with such imperious will that he stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 41]: Then , through the window of the sick-room came clearly the querulous voice : `` I tell you it was ; I heard him speak just now -- out there in the yard , that no-account step-brother of Joe 's !
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 11]: What if he IS a hired hand on the Tocsin ?
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 26]: He 'd better give up his job and quit , than do what he 's done to help make the town think hard of Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 5]: And what IS he ?
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 8]: Why , he 's worse than Cory .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 18]: When that Claudine Fear first came here , ` Gene Bantry was hangin ' around her himself .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 13]: Joe knew it and he 'd never tell , but I will .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 17]: I saw 'em buggy-ridin ' out near Beaver Beach and she slapped his face fer him .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 7]: It ought to be TOLD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 12]: `` I did n't know that Joe knew -- that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 4]: Eugene stammered huskily .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 50]: `` It was -- it was -- a long time ago -- '' `` If you understood Joe , '' she said , in a low voice , `` you would know that before these men leave this house , he will have their promise never to tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 32]: His eyes fell miserably , then lifted again ; but in her clear and unbearable gaze there shone such a flame of scorn as he could not endure to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 27]: For the first time in his life he saw a true light upon himself , and though the vision was darkling , the revelation was complete .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 6]: `` Heaven pity you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 14]: Eugene found himself alone , and stumbled away , his glance not lifted .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 21]: He passed his own home without looking up , and did not see his mother beckoning frantically from a window .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 9]: She ran to the door and called him .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 19]: He did not hear her , but went on toward the Tocsin office with his head still bent .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 84]: XXI NORBERT WAITS FOR JOE There was meat for gossip a plenty in Canaan that afternoon and evening ; there were rumors that ran from kitchen to parlor , and rumors that ran from parlor to kitchen ; speculations that detained housewives in talk across front gates ; wonderings that held cooks in converse over shadeless back fences in spite of the heat ; and canards that brought Main Street clerks running to the shop doors to stare up and down the sidewalks .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 24]: Out of the confusion of report , the judicious were able by evenfall to extract a fair history of this day of revolution .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 45]: There remained no doubt that Joe Louden was in attendance at the death-bed of Eskew Arp , and somehow it came to be known that Colonel Flitcroft , Squire Buckalew , and Peter Bradbury had shaken hands with Joe and declared themselves his friends .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 64]: There were those -LRB- particularly among the relatives of the hoary trio -RRB- who expressed the opinion that the Colonel and his comrades were too old to be responsible and a commission ought to sit on them ; nevertheless , some echoes of Eskew 's last `` argument '' to the conclave had sounded in the town and were not wholly without effect .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 42]: Everywhere there was a nipping curiosity to learn how Judge Pike had `` taken '' the strange performance of his daughter , and the eager were much disappointed when it was truthfully reported that he had done and said very little .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 48]: He had merely discharged both Sam Warden and Sam 's wife from his service , the mild manner of the dismissal almost unnerving Mr. Warden , although he was fully prepared for bird-shot ; and the couple had found immediate employment in the service of Ariel Tabor .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 36]: Those who humanly felt the Judge 's behavior to be a trifle flat and unsensational were recompensed late in the afternoon when it became known that Eugene Bantry had resigned his position on the Tocsin .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 36]: His reason for severing his connection was dumfounding ; he had written a formal letter to the Judge and repeated the gist of it to his associates in the office and acquaintances upon the street .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 43]: He declared that he no longer sympathized with the attitude of the Tocsin toward his step-brother , and regretted that he had previously assisted in emphasizing the paper 's hostility to Joe , particularly in the matter of the approaching murder trial .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 31]: This being the case , he felt that his effectiveness in the service of the paper had ceased , and he must , in justice to the owner , resign .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 8]: `` Well , I 'm damned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 24]: was the simple comment of the elder Louden when his step-son sought him out at the factory and repeated this statement to him .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 14]: `` So am I , I think , '' said Eugene , wanly .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 3]: `` Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 19]: I 'm going now to see mother , but I 'll be gone before you come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 5]: `` Gone where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 4]: `` Just away .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 13]: I do n't know where , '' Eugene answered from the door .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 9]: `` I could n't live here any longer .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 16]: I -- '' `` You 've been drinking , '' said Mr. Louden , inspired .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 12]: `` You 'd better not let Mamie Pike see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 4]: Eugene laughed desolately .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 7]: `` I do n't mean to .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 6]: I shall write to her .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 27]: Good-bye , '' he said , and was gone before Mr. Louden could restore enough order out of the chaos in his mind to stop him .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 27]: Thus Mrs. Louden 's long wait at the window was tragically rewarded , and she became an unhappy actor in Canaan 's drama of that day .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 39]: Other ladies attended at other windows , or near their front doors , throughout the afternoon : the families of the three patriarchs awaiting their return , as the time drew on , with something akin to frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 83]: Mrs. Flitcroft -LRB- a lady of temper -RRB- , whose rheumatism confined her to a chair , had her grandson wheel her out upon the porch , and , as the dusk fell and she finally saw her husband coming at a laggard pace , leaning upon his cane , his chin sunk on his breast , she frankly told Norbert that although she had lived with that man more than fifty-seven years , she would never be able to understand him .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 39]: She repeated this with genuine symptoms of hysteria when she discovered that the Colonel had not come straight from the Tabor house , but had stopped two hours at Peter Bradbury 's to `` talk it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 21]: One item of his recital , while sufficiently startling to his wife , had a remarkable effect upon his grandson .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 13]: This was the information that Ariel Tabor 's fortune no longer existed .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 8]: cried Norbert , starting to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 8]: `` What are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 12]: `` It 's true , '' said the Colonel , deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 7]: `` She told me so herself .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 72]: Eskew had dropped off into a sort of doze -- more like a stupor , perhaps , -- and we all went into Roger 's old studio , except Louden and the doctor , and while we were there , talkin ' , one of Pike 's clerks came with a basket full of tin boxes and packages of papers and talked to Miss Tabor at the door and went away .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 30]: Then old Peter blundered out and asked her point-blank what it was , and she said it was her estate , almost everything she had , except the house .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 59]: Buckalew , tryin ' to make a joke , said he 'd be willin ' to swap HIS house and lot for the basket , and she laughed and told him she thought he 'd be sorry ; that all there was , to speak of , was a pile of distillery stock -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 5]: repeated Norbert , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 12]: It was the truth , '' said the Colonel , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 25]: `` I saw it myself : blocks and blocks of stock in that distillery trust that went up higher 'n a kite last year .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 17]: Roger had put all of Jonas 's good money -- '' `` Not into that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 6]: shouted Norbert , uncontrollably excited .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 6]: `` Yes , he did .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 8]: I tell you I saw it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 8]: `` I tell you he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 13]: He owned Granger Gas , worth more to-day than it ever was !
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 16]: Pike was Roger 's attorney-in-fact and bought it for him before the old man died .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 7]: The check went through my hands .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 27]: You do n't think I 'd forget as big a check as that , do you , even if it was more than a year ago ?
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 11]: Or how it was signed and who made out to ?
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 11]: It was Martin Pike that got caught with distillery stock .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 7]: He speculated once too often ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 12]: `` No , you 're wrong , '' persisted the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 10]: `` I tell you I saw it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 50]: `` Then you 're blind , '' returned his grandson , disrespectfully ; `` you 're blind or else -- or else -- '' He paused , open-mouthed , a look of wonder struggling its way to expression upon him , gradually conquering every knobby outpost of his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 7]: He struck his fat hands together .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 7]: `` Where 's Joe Louden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 5]: he asked , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 7]: `` I want to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 10]: Did you leave him at Miss Tabor 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 11]: `` He 's goin ' to sit up with Eskew .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 8]: What do you want of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 10]: `` I should say you better ask that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 6]: Mrs. Flitcroft began , shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 31]: `` It 's enough , I guess , for one of this family to go runnin ' after him and shakin ' hands with him and Heaven knows what not !
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 4]: NORBERT FLITCROFT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 36]: But Norbert jumped from the porch , ruthlessly crossed his grandmother 's geranium-bed , and , making off at as sharp a pace as his architecture permitted , within ten minutes opened Ariel 's gate .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 8]: Sam Warden came forward to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 13]: `` Do n't ring , please , suh , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 23]: `` Dey sot me out heah to tell inquirin ' frien 's dat po ' ole Mist ' Arp mighty low . ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 12]: `` I want to see Mr. Louden , '' returned Norbert .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 9]: `` I want to see him immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 20]: `` I don ' reckon he kin come out yit , '' Sam said , in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 12]: `` But I kin go in an ' ast 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 18]: He stepped softly within , leaving Norbert waiting , and went to the door of the sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 23]: The door was open , the room brightly lighted , as Eskew had commanded when , a little earlier , he awoke .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 31]: Joe and Ariel were alone with him , leaning toward him with such white anxiety that the colored man needed no warning to make him remain silent in the hallway .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 19]: The veteran was speaking and his voice was very weak , seeming to come from a great distance .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 20]: `` It 's mighty funny , but I feel like I used to when I was a little boy .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 11]: I reckon I 'm kind of scared -- after all .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 10]: Airie Tabor , -- are you -- here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Arp . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 18]: `` I thought -- so -- but I -- I do n't see very well -- lately .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 19]: I -- wanted -- to -- know -- to know -- '' `` Yes -- to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 6]: She knelt close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 12]: `` It 's kind of -- foolish , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 13]: `` I just -- wanted to know if you was still here .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 13]: It -- do n't seem so lonesome now that I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 17]: She put her arm lightly about him and he smiled and was silent for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 16]: Then he struggled to rise upon his elbow , and they lifted him a little .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 13]: `` It 's hard to breathe , '' gasped the old man .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 10]: `` I 'm pretty near -- the big road .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 8]: Joe Louden -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 34]: `` You 'd have been -- willing -- willing to change places with me -- just now -- when Airie -- '' Joe laid his hand on his , and Eskew smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 5]: `` I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 9]: And , Joe -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 16]: `` You always -- always had the -- the best of that joke between us .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 13]: Do you -- you suppose they charge admission -- up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 5]: His eyes were lifted .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 19]: `` Do you suppose you 've got to -- to show your good deeds to git in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 13]: The answering whisper was almost as faint as the old man 's .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 11]: `` No , '' panted Eskew , `` nobody knows .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 15]: But I hope -- I do hope -- they 'll have some free seats .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 21]: It 's a -- mighty poor show -- we 'll -- all have -- if they -- do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 26]: He sighed peacefully , his head grew heavier on Joe 's arm ; and the young man set his hand gently upon the unseeing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 25]: Ariel did not rise from where she knelt , but looked up at him when , a little later , he lifted his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Joe , `` you can cry now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 22]: XXII MR. SHEEHAN SPEAKS Joe helped to carry what was mortal of Eskew from Ariel 's house to its final abiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 44]: With him , in that task , were Buckalew , Bradbury , the Colonel , and the grandsons of the two latter , and Mrs. Louden drew in her skirts grimly as her step-son passed her in the mournful procession through the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 27]: Her eyes were red with weeping -LRB- not for Eskew -RRB- , but not so red as those of Mamie Pike , who stood beside her .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 58]: On the way to the cemetery , Joe and Ariel were together in a carriage with Buckalew and the minister who had read the service , a dark , pleasant-eyed young man ; -- and the Squire , after being almost overcome during the ceremony , experienced a natural reaction , talking cheerfully throughout the long drive .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 53]: He recounted many anecdotes of Eskew , chuckling over most of them , though filled with wonder by a coincidence which he and Flitcroft had discovered ; the Colonel had recently been made the custodian of his old friend 's will , and it had been opened the day before the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 19]: Eskew had left everything he possessed -- with the regret that it was so little -- to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 30]: `` But the queer thing about it , '' said the Squire , addressing himself to Ariel , `` was the date of it , the seventeenth of June .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 71]: The Colonel and I got to talkin ' it over , out on his porch , last night , tryin ' to rec ` lect what was goin ' on about then , and we figgered it out that it was the Monday after you come back , the very day he got so upset when he saw you goin ' up to Louden 's law-office with your roses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 6]: Joe looked quickly at Ariel .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 39]: She did not meet his glance , but , turning instead to Ladew , the clergyman , began , with a barely perceptible blush , to talk of something he had said in a sermon two weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 24]: The two fell into a thoughtful and amiable discussion , during which there stole into Joe 's heart a strange and unreasonable pain .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 82]: The young minister had lived in Canaan only a few months , and Joe had never seen him until that morning ; but he liked the short , honest talk he had made ; liked his cadenceless voice and keen , dark face ; and , recalling what he had heard Martin Pike vociferating in his brougham one Sunday , perceived that Ladew was the fellow who had `` got to go '' because his sermons did not please the Judge .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 16]: Yet Ariel remembered for more than a fortnight a passage from one of these sermons .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 22]: And as Joe looked at the manly and intelligent face opposite him , it did not seem strange that she should .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 37]: He resolutely turned his eyes to the open window and saw that they had entered the cemetery , were near the green knoll where Eskew was to lie beside a brother who had died long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 43]: He let the minister help Ariel out , going quickly forward himself with Buckalew ; and then -- after the little while that the restoration of dust to dust mercifully needs -- he returned to the carriage only to get his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 12]: Ariel and Ladew and the Squire were already seated and waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 12]: `` Are n't you going to ride home with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 5]: she asked , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 12]: `` No , '' he explained , not looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 9]: `` I have to talk with Norbert Flitcroft .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 7]: I 'm going back with him .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 44]: His excuse was the mere truth , his conversation with Norbert , in the carriage which they managed to secure to themselves , continuing earnestly until Joe spoke to the driver and alighted at a corner , near Mr. Farbach 's Italian possessions .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 32]: `` Do n't forget , '' he said , as he closed the carriage door , `` I 've got to have both ends of the string in my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 4]: `` Forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 18]: Norbert looked at the cupola of the Pike Mansion , rising above the maples down the street .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 10]: `` It is n't likely I 'll forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 51]: When Joe entered the `` Louis Quinze room '' which some decorator , drunk with power , had mingled into the brewer 's villa , he found the owner and Mr. Sheehan , with five other men , engaged in a meritorious attempt to tone down the apartment with smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 68]: Two of the five others were prosperous owners of saloons ; two were known to the public -LRB- whose notion of what it meant when it used the term was something of the vaguest -RRB- as politicians ; the fifth was Mr. Farbach 's closest friend , one who -LRB- Joe had heard -RRB- was to be the next chairman of the city committee of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 38]: They were seated about a table , enveloped in blue clouds , and hushed to a grave and pertinent silence which clarified immediately the circumstance that whatever debate had preceded his arrival , it was now settled .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 34]: Their greeting of him , however , though exceedingly quiet , indicated a certain expectancy , as he accepted the chair which had been left for him at the head of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 54]: He looked thinner and paler than usual , which is saying a great deal ; but presently , finding that the fateful hush which his entrance had broken was immediately resumed , a twinkle came into his eye , one of his eyebrows went up and a corner of his mouth went down .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 6]: `` Well , gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 103]: The smokers continued to smoke and to do nothing else ; the exception being Mr. Sheehan , who , though he spoke not , exhibited tokens of agitation and excitement which he curbed with difficulty ; shifting about in his chair , gnawing his cigar , crossing and uncrossing his knees , rubbing and slapping his hands together , clearing his throat with violence , his eyes fixed all the while , as were those of his companions , upon Mr. Farbach ; so that Joe was given to perceive that it had been agreed that the brewer should be the spokesman .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 21]: Mr. Farbach was deliberate , that was all , which added to the effect of what he finally did say .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 19]: `` Choe , '' he remarked , placidly , `` you are der next Mayor off Canaan . ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: `` Why do you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 7]: asked the young man , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 50]: `` Bickoss us here , '' he answered , interlocking the tips of his fingers over his waistcoat , that being as near folding his hands as lay within his power , -- `` bickoss us here shall try to fix it so , und so hef ditcided . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 6]: Joe took a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 8]: `` Why do you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 17]: `` Dot , '' replied the brewer , `` iss someding I shall tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 7]: He paused to contemplate his cigar .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 15]: `` We want you bickoss you are der best man fer dot positsion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 19]: `` Louie , you must n't make a mistake at the beginning , '' Joe said , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 14]: `` I may not be the kind of man you 're looking for .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 11]: If I went in -- '' He hesitated , stammering .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 35]: `` It seems an ungrateful thing to say , but -- but there would n't be any slackness -- I could n't be bound to anybody -- '' `` Holt up your hosses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 20]: Mr. Farbach , once in his life , was so ready to reply that he was able to interrupt .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 9]: `` Who hef you heert speak off bounding ?
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 6]: Hef I speakt off favors ?
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 14]: Dit I say der shoult be slackness in der city gofer ` ment ?
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 7]: Litsen to me , Choe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 27]: He renewed his contemplation of his cigar , then proceeded : `` I hef been t ` inkin ' it ofer , now a couple years .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 7]: I hef mate up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 23]: If some peobles are gombelt to keep der laws and oders are not , dot 's a great atwantitch to der oders .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 16]: Dot iss what iss ruining der gountry und der peobles iss commencement to take notice .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 26]: Efer ` veres in oder towns der iss housecleaning ; dey are reforming und indieding , und pooty soon dot mofement comes here -- shoo-er !
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 38]: If we intent to holt der parsly in power , we shoult be a leetle ahead off dot mofement so , when it shoult be here , we hef a goot ` minadstration to fall beck on .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 17]: Now , dere iss anoder brewery opened und trying to gombete mit me here in Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 29]: If dot brewery owns der Mayor , all der tsaloons buying my bier must shut up at ` leven o'glock und Sundays , but der oders keep open .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 15]: If I own der Mayor , I make der same against dot oder brewery .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 15]: Now I am pooty sick off dot ways off bitsness und fighting all times .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 36]: Also , '' Mr. Farbach added , with magnificent calmness , `` my trade iss larchly owitside off Canaan , und it iss bedder dot here der laws shoult be enforced der same fer all .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 12]: Litsen , Choe ; all us here beliefs der same way .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 4]: You are square .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 17]: Der whole tsaloon element knows dot , und knows dot all voult be treated der same .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 10]: Mit you it voult be fairness fer each one .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 25]: Foolish peobles hef sait you are a law-tricker , but we know dot you hef only mate der laws brotect as well as bunish .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 20]: Und at such times as dey het been broken , you hef made dem as mertsiful as you coult .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 5]: You are no tricker .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 12]: We are willing to help you make it a glean town .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 34]: Odervise der fightin ' voult go on until der mofement strikes here und all der granks vake up und we git a fool reformer fer Mayor und der town goes to der dogs .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 37]: If I try to put in a man dot I own , der oder brewery iss goin ' to fight like hell , but if I work fer you it will not fight so hart . ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 34]: `` But the other people , '' Joe objected , `` those outside of what is called the saloon element -- do you understand how many of them will be against me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 22]: `` It iss der tsaloon element , '' Mr. Farbach returned , peacefully , `` dot does der fightin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 21]: `` And you have considered my standing with that part of Canaan which considers itself the most respectable section ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 29]: He rose to his feet , standing straight and quiet , facing the table , upon which , it chanced , there lay a copy of the Tocsin .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 23]: `` Und yet , '' observed Mr. Farbach , with mildness , `` we got some pooty risbecdable men right here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 17]: `` Except me , '' broke in Mr. Sheehan , grimly , `` you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 8]: `` Have you thought of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 11]: Joe leaned forward and touched the paper upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 9]: `` We hef , '' replied Mr. Farbach .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 5]: `` All of us .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 6]: You shall beat it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 17]: There was a strong chorus of confirmation from the others , and Joe 's eyes flashed .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 50]: `` Have you considered , '' he continued , rapidly , while a warm color began to conquer his pallor , -- `` have you considered the powerful influence which will be against me , and more against me now , I should tell you , than ever before ?
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 28]: That influence , I mean , which is striving so hard to discredit me that lynch-law has been hinted for poor Fear if I should clear him !
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 6]: Have you thought of that ?
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 15]: Have you thought -- '' `` Have we thought o ' Martin Pike ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 15]: exclaimed Mr. Sheehan , springing to his feet , face aflame and beard bristling .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 30]: `` Ay , we 've thought o ' Martin Pike , and our thinkin ' of him is where he begins to git what 's comin ' to him !
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 9]: What d'ye stand there pickin ' straws fer ?
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 8]: What 's the matter with ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 25]: he demanded , angrily , his violence tenfold increased by the long repression he had put upon himself during the brewer 's deliberate utterances .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 26]: `` If Louie Farbach and his crowd says they 're fer ye , I guess ye 've got a chanst , have n't ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 7]: `` Wait , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 16]: `` I think you underestimate Pike 's influence -- '' `` Underestimate the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 7]: shouted Mr. Sheehan , uncontrollably excited .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 6]: `` You talk about influence !
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 28]: He 's been the worst influence this town 's ever had -- and his tracks covered up in the dark wherever he set his ugly foot down .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 31]: These men know it , and you know some , but not the worst of it , because none of ye live as deep down in it as I do !
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 54]: Ye want to make a clean town of it , ye want to make a little heaven of the Beach -- '' `` And in the eyes of Judge Pike , '' Joe cut him off , `` and of all who take their opinions from him , I REPRESENT Beaver Beach ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 7]: Mike Sheehan gave a wild shout .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 3]: `` Whooroo !
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 4]: It 's come !
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 5]: I knowed it would !
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 30]: The day I could n't hold my tongue , though I passed my word I would when the coward showed the deed he did n't dare to git recorded !
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 3]: Waugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 8]: He shouted again , with bitter laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 4]: `` Ye do !
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 23]: In the eyes o ' them as follow Martin Pike ye stand fer the Beach and all its wickedness , do ye ?
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 2]: Whooroo !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 4]: It 's come !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 26]: Ye 're an offence in the eyes o ' Martin Pike and all his kind because ye stand fer the Beach , are ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 6]: `` You know it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 5]: Joe answered , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 22]: `` If they could wipe the Beach off the map and me with it -- '' `` Martin Pike would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 14]: shouted Mr. Sheehan , while the others , open-mouthed , stared at him .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 6]: `` Martin Pike would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 14]: `` I do n't need to tell you that , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 16]: Mr. Sheehan 's big fist rose high over the table and descended crashing upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 8]: `` It 's a damn lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 8]: `` Martin Pike owns Beaver Beach ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 52]: XXIII JOE WALKS ACROSS THE COURT-HOUSE YARD From within the glossy old walnut bar that ran from wall to wall , the eyes of the lawyers and reporters wandered often to Ariel as she sat in the packed court-room watching Louden 's fight for the life and liberty of Happy Fear .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 31]: She had always three escorts , and though she did not miss a session , and the same three never failed to attend her , no whisper of scandal arose .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 36]: But not upon them did the glances of the members of the bar and the journalists with tender frequency linger ; nor were the younger members of these two professions all who gazed that way .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 33]: Joe had fought out the selection of the jury with the prosecutor at great length and with infinite pains ; it was not a young jury , and IT stared at her .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 67]: The `` Court '' wore a gray beard with which a flock of sparrows might have villaged a grove , and yet , in spite of the vital necessity for watchfulness over this fighting case , IT once needed to be stirred from a trancelike gaze in Miss Tabor 's direction and aroused to the realization that It was there to Sit and not to dream .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 95]: The August air was warm outside the windows , inviting to the open country , to swimmin ' - hole , to orchard reveries , or shaded pool wherein to drop a meditative line ; you would have thought no one could willingly coop himself in this hot room for three hours , twice a day , while lawyers wrangled , often unintelligibly , over the life of a dingy little creature like Happy Fear , yet the struggle to swelter there was almost like a riot , and the bailiffs were busy men .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 84]: It was a fighting case throughout , fought to a finish on each tiny point as it came up , dragging , in the mere matter of time , interminably , yet the people of Canaan -LRB- not only those who succeeded in penetrating to the court-room , but the others who hung about the corridors , or outside the building , and the great mass of stay-at-homes who read the story in the Tocsin -RRB- found each moment of it enthralling enough .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 79]: The State 's attorney , fearful of losing so notorious a case , and not underestimating his opponent , had modestly summoned others to his aid ; and the attorney for the defence , single-handed , faced `` an array of legal talent such as seldom indeed had hollered at this bar '' ; faced it good-naturedly , an eyebrow crooked up and his head on one side , most of the time , yet faced it indomitably .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 133]: He had a certain careless and disarming smile when he lost a point , which carried off the defeat as of only humorous account and not at all part of the serious business in hand ; and in his treatment of witnesses , he was plausible , kindly , knowing that in this case he had no intending perjurer to entrap ; brought into play the rare and delicate art of which he was a master , employing in his questions subtle suggestions and shadings of tone and manner , and avoiding words of debatable and dangerous meanings ; -- a fine craft , often attempted by blunderers to their own undoing , but which , practised by Joseph Louden , made inarticulate witnesses articulate to the precise effects which he desired .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 24]: This he accomplished as much by the help of the continuous fire of objections from the other side as in spite of them .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 35]: He was infinitely careful , asking never an ill-advised question for the other side to use to his hurt , and , though exhibiting only a pleasant easiness of manner , was electrically alert .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 102]: A hundred things had shown Ariel that the feeling of the place , influenced by `` public sentiment '' without , was subtly and profoundly hostile to Joe and his client ; she read this in the spectators , in the jury , even in the Judge ; but it seemed to her that day by day the inimical spirit gradually failed , inside the railing , and also in those spectators who , like herself , were enabled by special favor to be present throughout the trial , and that now and then a kindlier sentiment began to be manifested .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 31]: She was unaware how strongly she contributed to effect this herself , not only through the glow of visible sympathy which radiated from her , but by a particular action .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 66]: Claudine was called by the State , and told as much of her story as the law permitted her to tell , interlarding her replies with fervent protestations -LRB- too quick to be prevented -RRB- that she `` never meant to bring no trouble to Mr. Fear '' and that she `` did hate to have gen ` lemen starting things on her account . ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 42]: When the defence took this perturbed witness , her interpolations became less frequent , and she described straightforwardly how she had found the pistol on the floor near the prostrate figure of Cory , and hidden it in her own dress .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 48]: The attorneys for the State listened with a somewhat cynical amusement to this portion of her testimony , believing it of no account , uncorroborated , and that if necessary the State could impeach the witness on the ground that it had been indispensable to produce her .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 46]: She came down weeping from the stand ; and , the next witness not being immediately called , the eyes of the jurymen naturally followed her as she passed to her seat , and they saw Ariel Tabor bow gravely to her across the railing .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 59]: Now , a thousand things not set forth by legislatures , law-men and judges affect a jury , and the slight salutation caused the members of this one to glance at one another ; for it seemed to imply that the exquisite lady in white not only knew Claudine , but knew that she had spoken the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 22]: It was after this , that a feeling favorable to the defence now and then noticeably manifested itself in the courtroom .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 46]: Still , when the evidence for the State was all in , the life of Happy Fear seemed to rest in a balance precarious indeed , and the little man , swallowing pitifully , looked at his attorney with the eyes of a sick dog .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 52]: Then Joe gave the prosecutors an illuminating and stunning surprise , and , having offered in evidence the revolver found upon Claudine , produced as his first witness a pawnbroker of Denver , who identified the weapon as one he had sold to Cory , whom he had known very well .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 60]: The second witness , also a stranger , had been even more intimately acquainted with the dead man , and there began to be an uneasy comprehension of what Joe had accomplished during that prolonged absence of his which had so nearly cost the life of the little mongrel , who was at present -LRB- most blissful Respectability ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 9]: a lively convalescent in Ariel 's back yard .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 78]: The second witness also identified the revolver , testifying that he had borrowed it from Cory in St. Louis to settle a question of marksmanship , and that on his returning it to the owner , the latter , then working his way eastward , had confided to him his intention of stopping in Canaan for the purpose of exercising its melancholy functions upon a man who had once `` done him good '' in that city .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 29]: By the time the witness had reached this point , the Prosecutor and his assistants were on their feet , excitedly shouting objections , which were promptly overruled .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 31]: Taken unawares , they fought for time ; thunder was loosed , forensic bellowings ; everybody lost his temper -- except Joe ; and the examination of the witness proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 36]: Cory , with that singular inspiration to confide in some one , which is the characteristic and the undoing of his kind , had outlined his plan of operations to the witness with perfect clarity .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 35]: He would first attempt , so he had declared , to incite an attack upon himself by playing upon the jealousy of his victim , having already made a tentative effort in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 85]: Failing in this , he would fall back upon one of a dozen schemes -LRB- for he was ready in such matters , he bragged -RRB- , the most likely of which would be to play the peacemaker ; he would talk of his good intentions toward his enemy , speaking publicly of him in friendly and gentle ways ; then , getting at him secretly , destroy him in such a fashion as to leave open for himself the kind gate of self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 53]: In brief , here was the whole tally of what had actually occurred , with the exception of the last account in the sequence which had proved that demise for which Cory had not arranged and it fell from the lips of a witness whom the prosecution had no means of impeaching .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 37]: When he left the stand , unshaken and undiscredited , after a frantic cross-examination , Joe , turning to resume his seat , let his hand fall lightly for a second upon his client 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 53]: That was the occasion of a demonstration which indicated a sentiment favorable to the defence -LRB- on the part of at least three of the spectators -RRB- ; and it was in the nature of such a hammering of canes upon the bare wooden floor as effectually stopped all other proceedings instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 47]: The indignant Judge fixed the Colonel , Peter Bradbury , and Squire Buckalew with his glittering eye , yet the hammering continued unabated ; and the offenders surely would have been conducted forth in ignominy , had not gallantry prevailed , even in that formal place .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 51]: The Judge , reluctantly realizing that some latitude must be allowed to these aged enthusiasts , since they somehow seemed to belong to Miss Tabor , made his remarks general , with the time-worn threat to clear the room , whereupon the loyal survivors of Eskew relapsed into unabashed silence .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 13]: It was now , as Joe had said , a clear-enough case .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 41]: Only the case itself , however , was clear , for , as he and his friends feared , the verdict might possibly be neither in accordance with the law , the facts , nor the convictions of the jury .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 12]: Eugene 's defection had not altered the tone of the Tocsin .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 37]: All day long a crowd of men and boys hung about the corridors of the Court-house , about the Square and the neighboring streets , and from these rose sombre murmurs , more and more ominous .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 25]: The public sentiment of a community like Canaan can make itself felt inside a court-room ; and it was strongly exerted against Happy Fear .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 80]: The Tocsin had always been a powerful agent ; Judge Pike had increased its strength with a staff which was thoroughly efficient , alert , and always able to strike centre with the paper 's readers ; and in town and country it had absorbed the circulation of the other local journals , which resisted feebly at times , but in the matter of the Cory murder had not dared to do anything except follow the Tocsin 's lead .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 25]: The Tocsin , having lit the fire , fed it -- fed it saltpetre and sulphur -- for now Martin Pike was fighting hard .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 22]: The farmers and people of the less urban parts of the country were accustomed to found their opinions upon the Tocsin .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 17]: They regarded it as the single immutable rock of journalistic righteousness and wisdom in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 63]: Consequently , stirred by the outbursts of the paper , they came into Canaan in great numbers , and though the pressure from the town itself was so strong that only a few of them managed to crowd into the court-room , the others joined their voices to those sombre murmurs outdoors , which increased in loudness as the trial went on .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 37]: The Tocsin , however , was not having everything its own way ; the volume of outcry against Happy Fear and his lawyer had diminished , it was noticed , in `` very respectable quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 57]: The information imparted by Mike Sheehan to the politicians at Mr. Farbach 's had been slowly seeping through the various social strata of the town , and though at first incredulously rejected , it began to find acceptance ; Upper Main Street cooling appreciably in its acceptance of the Tocsin as the law and the prophets .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 70]: There were even a few who dared to wonder in their hearts if there had not been a mistake about Joe Louden ; and although Mrs. Flitcroft weakened not , the relatives of Squire Buckalew and of Peter Bradbury began to hold up their heads a little , after having made home horrible for those gentlemen and reproached them with their conversion as the last word of senile shame .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 69]: In addition , the Colonel 's grandson and Mr. Bradbury 's grandson had both mystifyingly lent countenance to Joe , consorting with him openly ; the former for his own purposes -- the latter because he had cunningly discovered that it was a way to Miss Tabor 's regard , which , since her gentle rejection of him , he had grown to believe -LRB- good youth ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 12]: might be the pleasantest thing that could ever come to him .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 24]: In short , the question had begun to thrive : Was it possible that Eskew Arp had not been insane , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 84]: The best of those who gathered ominously about the Court-house and its purlieus were the young farmers and field-hands , artisans and clerks ; one of the latter being a pimply faced young man -LRB- lately from the doctor 's hands -RRB- , who limped , and would limp for the rest of his life , he who , of all men , held the memory of Eskew Arp in least respect , and was burningly desirous to revenge himself upon the living .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 232]: The worst were of that mystifying , embryonic , semi-rowdy type , the American voyou , in the production of which Canaan and her sister towns everywhere over the country are prolific ; the young man , youth , boy perhaps , creature of nameless age , whose clothes are like those of a brakeman out of work , but who is not a brakeman in or out of work ; wearing the black , soft hat tilted forward to shelter -- as a counter does the contempt of a clerk -- that expression which the face does not dare wear quite in the open , asserting the possession of supreme capacity in wit , strength , dexterity , and amours ; the dirty handkerchief under the collar ; the short black coat always double-breasted ; the eyelids sooty ; one cheek always bulged ; the forehead speckled ; the lips cracked ; horrible teeth ; and the affectation of possessing secret information upon all matters of the universe ; above all , the instinct of finding the shortest way to any scene of official interest to the policeman , fireman , or ambulance surgeon , -- a singular being , not professionally criminal ; tough histrionically rather than really ; full of its own argot of brag ; hysterical when crossed , timid through great ignorance , and therefore dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 24]: It furnishes not the leaders but the mass of mobs ; and it springs up at times of crisis from Heaven knows where .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 50]: You might have driven through all the streets of Canaan , a week before the trial , and have seen four or five such fellows ; but from the day of its beginning the Square was full of them , dingy shuttlecocks batted up into view by the Tocsin .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 9]: They kept the air whirring with their noise .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 73]: The news of that sitting which had caused the Squire , Flitcroft , and Peter Bradbury to risk the Court 's displeasure , was greeted outside with loud and vehement disfavor ; and when , at noon , the jurymen were marshalled out to cross the yard to the `` National House '' for dinner , a large crowd followed and surrounded them , until they reached the doors of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 10]: `` Do n't let Lawyer Louden bamboozle you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 5]: `` Hang him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 14]: `` Tar and feathers fer ye ef ye do n't hang him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 46]: These were the mildest threats , and Joe Louden , watching from an upper window of the Court-house , observed with a troubled eye how certain of the jury shrank from the pressure of the throng , how the cheeks of others showed sudden pallor .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 39]: Sometimes `` public sentiment '' has done evil things to those who have not shared it ; and Joe knew how rare a thing is a jury which dares to stand square against a town like Canaan aroused .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 34]: The end of that afternoon 's session saw another point marked for the defence ; Joe had put the defendant on the stand , and the little man had proved an excellent witness .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 33]: During his life he had been many things -- many things disreputable ; high standards were not brightly illumined for him in the beginning of the night-march which his life had been .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 43]: He had been a tramp , afterward a petty gambler ; but his great motive had finally come to be the intention to do what Joe told him to do : that , and to keep Claudine as straight as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 37]: In a measure , these were the two things that had brought him to the pass in which he now stood , his loyalty to Joe and his resentment of whatever tampered with Claudine 's straightness .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 12]: He was submissive to the consequences : he was still loyal .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 20]: And now Joe asked him to tell `` just what happened , '' and Happy obeyed with crystal clearness .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 86]: Throughout the long , tricky cross-examination he continued to tell `` just what happened '' with a plaintive truthfulness not to be imitated , and throughout it Joe guarded him from pitfalls -LRB- for lawyers in their search after truth are compelled by the exigencies of their profession to make pitfalls even for the honest -RRB- , and gave him , by various devices , time to remember , though not to think , and made the words `` come right '' in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 41]: So that before the sitting was over , a disquieting rumor ran through the waiting crowd in the corridors , across the Square , and over the town , that the case was surely going `` Louden 's way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 44]: This was also the opinion of a looker-on in Canaan -- a ferret-faced counsellor of corporations who , called to consultation with the eminent Buckalew -LRB- nephew of the Squire -RRB- , had afterward spent an hour in his company at the trial .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 16]: `` It 's going that young fellow Louden 's way , '' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 30]: `` You say he 's a shyster , but -- '' `` Well , '' admitted Buckalew , with some reluctance , `` I do n't mean that exactly .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 18]: I 've got an old uncle who seems lately to think he 's a great man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 18]: `` I 'll take your uncle 's word for it , '' returned the other , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 10]: `` I think he 'll go pretty far . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 37]: They had come to the flight of steps which descended to the yard , -- and the visitor , looking down upon the angry crowd , added , `` If they do n't kill him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 9]: Joe himself was anxious concerning no such matter .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 48]: He shook hands with Happy at the end of the sitting , bidding him be of good cheer , and , when the little man had marched away , under a strong guard , began to gather and sort his papers at a desk inside the bar .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 48]: This took him perhaps five minutes , and when he had finished there were only three people left in the room : a clerk , a negro janitor with a broom , and the darky friend who always hopefully accompanies a colored man holding high public office .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 35]: These two approvingly greeted the young lawyer , the janitor handing him a note from Norbert Flitcroft , and the friend mechanically `` borrowing '' a quarter from him as he opened the envelope .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 31]: `` I 'll be roun ' yo ' way to git a box o ' SE-gahs , '' laughed the friend , `` soon ez de campaign open up good .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 31]: Dey all goin ' vote yo ' way , down on the levee bank , but dey sho ' expecks to git to smoke a little ` fo ' leckshun-day !
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 9]: We knows who 's OW frien ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 56]: Norbert 's missive was lengthy and absorbing ; Joe went on his way , perusing it with profound attention ; but as he descended the stairway to the floor below , a loud burst of angry shouting , outside the building , caused him to hasten toward the big front doors which faced Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 28]: The doors opened upon an imposing vestibule , from which a handsome flight of stone steps , protected by a marble balustrade , led to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 23]: Standing at the top of these steps and leaning over the balustrade , he had a clear view of half the yard .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 72]: No one was near him ; everybody was running in the opposite direction , toward that corner of the yard occupied by the jail , the crowd centring upon an agitated whirlpool of men which moved slowly toward a door in the high wall that enclosed the building ; and Joe saw that Happy Fear 's guards , conducting the prisoner back to his cell , were being jostled and rushed .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 21]: The distance they had made was short , but as they reached the door the pressure upon them increased dangerously .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 20]: Clubs rose in the air , hats flew , the whirlpool heaved tumultuously , and the steel door clanged .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 29]: Happy Fear was safe inside , but the jostlers were outside -- baffled , ugly , and stirred with the passion that changes a crowd into a mob .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 29]: Then some of them caught sight of Joe as he stood alone at the top of the steps , and a great shout of rage and exultation arose .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 12]: For a moment or two he did not see his danger .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 57]: At the clang of the door , his eyes , caught by the gleam of a wide white hat , had turned toward the street , and he was somewhat fixedly watching Mr. Ladew extricate Ariel -LRB- and her aged and indignant escorts -RRB- from an overflow of the crowd in which they had been caught .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 21]: But a voice warned him : the wild piping of a newsboy who had climbed into a tree near by .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 5]: `` JOE LOUDEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 3]: he screamed .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 5]: `` LOOK OUT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 17]: With a muffled roar the crowd surged back from the jail and turned toward the steps .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 7]: `` Tar and feather him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 13]: `` Take him over to the river and throw him in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 5]: `` Drown him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 5]: `` Hang him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 19]: Then a thing happened which was dramatic enough in its inception , but almost ludicrous in its effect .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 37]: Joe walked quietly down the steps and toward the advancing mob with his head cocked to one side , one eyebrow lifted , and one corner of his mouth drawn down in a faintly distorted smile .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 41]: He went straight toward the yelling forerunners , with only a small bundle of papers in his hands , and then -- while the non-partisan spectators held their breath , expecting the shock of contact -- straight on through them .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 22]: A number of the bulge-cheeked formed the scattering van of these forerunners , charging with hoarse and cruel shrieks of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 35]: The first , apparently about to tear Joseph Louden to pieces , changed countenance at arm 's - length , swerved violently , and with the loud cry , `` HEAD HIM OFF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 7]: dashed on up the stone steps .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 75]: The man next behind him followed his lead , with the same shout , strategy , and haste ; then the others of this advance attack , finding themselves confronting the quiet man , who kept his even pace and showed no intention of turning aside for them , turned suddenly aside for HIM , and , taking the cue from the first , pursued their way , bellowing : `` HEAD HIM OFF !
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 5]: HEAD HIM OFF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 46]: until there were a dozen and more rowdyish men and youths upon the steps , their eyes blazing with fury , menacing Louden 's back with frightful gestures across the marble balustrade , as they hysterically bleated the chorus , `` HEAD HIM OFF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 32]: Whether or not Joe could have walked through the entire mob as he had walked through these is a matter for speculation ; it was believed in Canaan that he could .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 55]: Already a gust of mirth began to sweep over the sterner spirits as they paused to marvel no less at the disconcerting advance of the lawyer than at the spectacle presented by the intrepid dare-devils upon the steps ; a kind of lane actually opening before the young man as he walked steadily on .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 49]: And when Mr. Sheehan , leading half a dozen huge men from the Farbach brewery , unceremoniously shouldered a way through the mob to Joe 's side , reaching him where the press was thickest , it is a question if the services of his detachment were needed .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 4]: The laughter increased .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 4]: It became voluminous .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 6]: Homeric salvos shook the air .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 28]: And never one of the fire-eaters upon the steps lived long enough to live down the hateful cry of that day , `` HEAD HIM OFF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 67]: which was to become a catch-word on the streets , a taunt more stinging than any devised by deliberate invention , an insult bitterer than the ancestral doubt , a fighting-word , and the great historical joke of Canaan , never omitted in after-days when the tale was told how Joe Louden took that short walk across the Court-house yard which made him Mayor of Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 39]: XXIV MARTIN PIKE KEEPS AN ENGAGEMENT An hour later , Martin Pike , looking forth from the Mansion , saw a man open the gate , and , passing between the unemotional deer , rapidly approach the house .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 52]: He was a thin young fellow , very well dressed in dark gray , his hair prematurely somewhat silvered , his face prematurely somewhat lined , and his hat covered a scar such as might have been caused by a blow from a blunt instrument in the nature of a poker .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 36]: He did not reach the door , nor was there necessity for him to ring , for , before he had set foot on the lowest step , the Judge had hastened to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 39]: Not , however , with any fulsomely hospitable intent ; his hand and arm were raised to execute one of his Olympian gestures , of the kind which had obliterated the young man upon a certain by-gone morning .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 12]: Louden looked up calmly at the big figure towering above him .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 67]: `` It wo n't do , Judge , '' he said ; that was all , but there was a significance in his manner and a certainty in his voice which caused the uplifted hand to drop limply ; while the look of apprehension which of late had grown more and more to be Martin Pike 's habitual expression deepened into something close upon mortal anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 13]: `` Have you any business to set foot upon my property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' answered Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 8]: `` That 's why I came . ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 10]: `` What business have you got with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 9]: `` Enough to satisfy you , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 44]: But there 's one thing I do n't want to do '' -- Joe glanced at the open door -- `` and that is to talk about it here -- for your own sake and because I think Miss Tabor should be present .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 16]: I called to ask you to come to her house at eight o'clock to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 5]: `` You did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 36]: Martin Pike spoke angrily , but not in the bull-bass of yore ; and he kept his voice down , glancing about him nervously as though he feared that his wife or Mamie might hear .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 15]: `` My accounts with her estate are closed , '' he said , harshly .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 12]: `` If she wants anything , let her come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 5]: Joe shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 9]: You must be there at eight o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 11]: The Judge 's choler got the better of his uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 13]: `` You 're a pretty one to come ordering me around ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 4]: he broke out .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 67]: `` You slanderer , do you suppose I have n't heard how you 're going about traducing me , undermining my character in this community , spreading scandals that I am the real owner of Beaver Beach -- '' `` It can easily be proved , Judge , '' Joe interrupted , quietly , `` though you 're wrong : I have n't been telling people .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 12]: I have n't needed to -- even if I 'd wished .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 15]: Once a thing like that gets out you ca n't stop it -- ever !
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 36]: That is n't all : to my knowledge you own other property worse than the Beach ; I know that you own half of the worst dens in the town : profitable investments , too .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 29]: You bought them very gradually and craftily , only showing the deeds to those in charge -- as you did to Mike Sheehan , and not recording them .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 41]: Sheehan 's betrayal of you gave me the key ; I know most of the poor creatures who are your tenants , too , you see , and that gave me an advantage because they have some confidence in me .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 14]: My investigations have been almost as quiet and careful as your purchases . ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 6]: `` You damned blackmailer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 24]: The Judge bent upon him a fierce , inquiring scrutiny in which , oddly enough , there was a kind of haggard hopefulness .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 29]: `` And out of such stories , '' he sneered , `` you are going to try to make political capital against the Tocsin , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 28]: `` It was necessary in the interests of my client for me to know pretty thoroughly just what property you own , and I think I do .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 13]: These pieces I 've mentioned are about all you have not mortgaged .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 32]: You could n't do that without exposure , and you 've kept a controlling interest in the Tocsin clear , too -- for the sake of its influence , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 25]: Now , do you want to hear any more , or will you agree to meet me at Miss Tabor 's this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 35]: Whatever the look of hopefulness had signified , it fled from Pike 's face during this speech , but he asked with some show of contempt , `` Do you think it likely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 18]: `` Very well , '' said Joe , `` if you want me to speak here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 9]: And he came a little closer to him .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 22]: `` You bought a big block of Granger Gas for Roger Tabor , '' he began , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 53]: `` Before his death you sold everything he had , except the old house , put it all into cash for him , and bought that stock ; you signed the check as his attorney-in-fact , and it came back to you through the Washington National , where Norbert Flitcroft handled it .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 30]: He has a good memory , and when he told me what he knew , I had him to do some tracing ; did a little myself , also .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 16]: Judge Pike , I must tell you that you stand in danger of the law .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 49]: You were the custodian of that stock for Roger Tabor ; it was transferred in blank ; though I think you meant to be ` legal ' at that time , and that was merely for convenience in case Roger had wished you to sell it for him .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 21]: But just after his death you found yourself saddled with distillery stock , which was going bad on your hands .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 46]: Other speculations of yours were failing at the same time ; you had to have money -- you filed your report as administrator , crediting Miss Tabor with your own stock which you knew was going to the wall , and transferred hers to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 10]: Then you sold it because you needed ready money .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 14]: You used her fortune to save yourself -- but you were horribly afraid !
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 31]: No matter how rotten your transactions had been , you had always kept inside the law ; and now that you had gone outside of it , you were frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 34]: You did n't dare come flat out to Miss Tabor with the statement that her fortune had gone ; it had been in your charge all the time and things might look ugly .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 12]: So you put it off , perhaps from day to day .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 27]: You did n't dare tell her until you were forced to , and to avoid the confession you sent her the income which was rightfully hers .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 7]: That was your great weakness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 54]: Joe had spoken with great rapidity , though keeping his voice low , and he lowered it again , as he continued : `` Judge Pike , what chance have you to be believed in court when you swear that you sent her twenty thousand dollars out of the goodness of your heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: Do you think SHE believed you ?
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 13]: It was the very proof to her that you had robbed her .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 5]: For she knew you !
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 8]: Do you want to hear more now ?
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 11]: Do you think this is a good place for it ?
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 36]: Do you wish me to go over the details of each step I have taken against you , to land you at the bar where this poor fellow your paper is hounding stands to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 10]: The Judge essayed to answer , and could not .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 18]: He lifted his hand uncertainly and dropped it , while a thick dew gathered on his temples .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 8]: Inarticulate sounds came from between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: `` You will come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 23]: Martin Pike bent his head dazedly ; and at that the other turned quickly from him and went away without looking back .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 21]: Ariel was in the studio , half an hour later , when Joe was announced by the smiling Mr. Warden .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 37]: Ladew was with her , though upon the point of taking his leave , and Joe marked -LRB- with a sinking heart -RRB- that the young minister 's cheeks were flushed and his eyes very bright .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 39]: `` It was a magnificent thing you did , Mr. Louden , '' he said , offering his hand heartily ; `` I saw it , and it was even finer in one way than it was plucky .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 25]: It somehow straightened things out with such perfect good nature ; it made those people feel that what they were doing was ridiculous . ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 9]: `` So it was , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 16]: `` Few , under the circumstances , could have acted as if they thought so !
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 15]: And I hope you 'll let me call upon you , Mr. Louden . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 34]: `` I hope you will , '' he answered ; and then , when the minister had departed , stood looking after him with sad eyes , in which there dwelt obscure meditations .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 57]: Ladew 's word of farewell had covered a deep look at Ariel , which was not to be mistaken by Joseph Louden for anything other than what it was : the clergyman 's secret was an open one , and Joe saw that he was as frank and manly in love as in all other things .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 15]: `` He 's a good fellow , '' he said at last , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 6]: `` A good man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 3]: Ariel agreed .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 14]: `` And he said more to me than he did to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 13]: `` Yes , I think it probable , '' Joe smiled sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 8]: `` About YOU , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 31]: He had time to fear that her look admitted confusion before she proceeded : `` He said he had never seen anything so fine as your coming down those steps .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 6]: Ah , he was right !
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 22]: But it was harder for me to watch you , I think , than for you to do it , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 40]: I was so horribly afraid -- and the crowd between us -- if we could have got near you -- but we could n't -- we -- '' She faltered , and pressed her hand close upon her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 4]: `` We ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 5]: asked Joe , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 9]: `` You mean you and Mr. Ladew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 100]: `` Yes , he was there ; but I mean '' -- her voice ran into a little laugh with a beatific quaver in it -- `` I mean Colonel Flitcroft and Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Buckalew , too -- we were hemmed in together when Mr. Ladew found us -- and , oh , Joe , when that cowardly rush started toward you , those three -- I 've heard wonderful things in Paris and Naples , cabmen quarrelling and disappointed beggars -- but never anything like them to-day -- '' `` You mean they were profane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 10]: `` Oh , magnificently -- and with such inventiveness !
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 7]: All three begged my pardon afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 11]: I did n't grant it -- I blessed them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 10]: `` Did they beg Mr. Ladew 's pardon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 6]: `` Ah , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 4]: she reproached him .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 7]: `` He is n't a prig .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 17]: And he 's had to fight some things that you of all men ought to understand .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 24]: He 's only been here a few months , but he told me that Judge Pike has been against him from the start .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 12]: It seems that Mr. Ladew is too liberal in his views .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 46]: And he told me that if it were not for Judge Pike 's losing influence in the church on account of the Beaver Beach story , the Judge would probably have been able to force him to resign ; but now he will stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 11]: `` He wishes to stay , does n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 7]: `` Very much , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 20]: And , Joe , '' she continued , thoughtfully , `` I want you to do something for me .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 13]: I want you to go to church with me next Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 7]: `` To hear Mr. Ladew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 9]: I would n't ask except for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 12]: `` Very well , '' he consented , with averted eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 6]: `` I 'll go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 11]: Her face was radiant with the smile she gave him .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 12]: `` It will make me very happy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 16]: He bent his head and fumbled over some papers he had taken from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 8]: `` Will you listen to these memoranda ?
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 13]: We have a great deal to go over before eight o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 21]: Judge Pike stood for a long while where Joe had left him , staring out at the street , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 5]: Really he saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 41]: Undoubtedly an image of blurring foliage , cast-iron , cement , and turf , with sunshine smeared over all , flickered upon the retinas of his eyes ; but the brain did not accept the picture from the optic nerve .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 8]: Martin Pike was busy with other visions .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 25]: Joe Louden had followed him back to his hidden deeds and had read them aloud to him as Gabriel would read them on Judgment-day .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 6]: Perhaps THIS was the Judgment-day .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 22]: Pike had taken charge of Roger Tabor 's affairs because the commissions as agent were not too inconsiderable to be neglected .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 30]: To make the task simpler , he had sold , as time went on , the various properties of the estate , gradually converting all of them into cash .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 48]: Then , the opportunity offering , he bought a stock which paid excellent dividends , had it transferred in blank , because if it should prove to Roger 's advantage to sell it , his agent could do so without any formal delays between Paris and Canaan .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 51]: At least , that is what the Judge had told himself at the time , though it may be that some lurking whisperer in his soul had hinted that it might be well to preserve the great amount of cash in hand , and Roger 's stock was practically that .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 6]: Then came the evil days .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 116]: Laboriously , he had built up a name for conservatism which most of the town accepted , but secretly he had always been a gambler : Wall Street was his goal ; to adventure there , as one of the great single-eyed Cyclopean man-eaters , his fond ambition ; and he had conceived the distillery trust as a means to attain it ; but the structure tumbled about his ears ; other edifices of his crumbled at the same time ; he found himself beset , his solvency endangered , and there was the Tabor stock , quite as good as gold ; Roger had just died , and it was enough to save him .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 3]: -- Save ?
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 29]: That was a strange way to be remembering it to-day , when Fate grinned at him out of a dreadful mask contorted like the face of Norbert Flitcroft .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 8]: Martin Pike knew himself for a fool .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 35]: What chance had he , though he destroyed the check a thousand times over , to escape the records by which the coil of modern trade duplicates and quadruplicates each slip of scribbled paper ?
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 10]: What chance had he against the memories of men ?
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 20]: Would the man of whom he had bought , forget that the check was signed by Roger 's agent ?
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 5]: Had the bank-clerk forgotten ?
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 34]: Thrice fool , Martin Pike , to dream that in a town like Canaan , Norbert or any of his kind could touch an order for so great a sum and forget it !
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 12]: But Martin Pike had not dreamed that ; had dreamed nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 25]: When failure confronted him his mind refused to consider anything but his vital need at the time , and he had supplied that need .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 49]: And now he grew busy with the future : he saw first the civil suit for restitution , pressed with the ferocity and cunning of one who intended to satisfy a grudge of years ; then , perhaps , a criminal prosecution ... But he would fight it !
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 17]: Did they think that such a man was to be overthrown by a breath of air ?
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 12]: By a girl , a bank-clerk , and a shyster lawyer ?
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 11]: They would find their case difficult to prove in court .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 9]: He did not believe they COULD prove it .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 66]: They would be discredited for the attempt upon him and he would win clear ; these Beaver Beach scandals would die of inertia presently ; there would be a lucky trick in wheat , and Martin Pike would be Martin Pike once more ; reinstated , dictator of church , politics , business ; all those things which were the breath of his life restored .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 13]: He would show this pitiful pack what manner of man they hounded !
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 17]: Norbert Flitcroft ... The Judge put his big hand up to his eyes and rubbed them .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 17]: Curious mechanisms the eyes ... That deer in line with the vision -- not a zebra ?
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: A zebra after all these years ?
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 10]: And yet ... curious , indeed , the eyes !
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 13]: ... a zebra ... Who ever heard of a deer with stripes ?
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 20]: The big hand rose from the eyes and ran through the hair which he had always worn rather long .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 18]: It would seem strange to have it cut very short ... Did they use clippers , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 25]: ... He started suddenly and realized that his next-door neighbor had passed along the sidewalk with head averted , pretending not to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 24]: A few weeks ago the man would not have missed the chance of looking in to bow -- with proper deference , too !
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 4]: Did he know ?
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 6]: He could not know THIS !
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 8]: It must be the Beaver Beach scandal .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 4]: It must be .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 9]: It could not be THIS -- not yet !
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 5]: But it MIGHT be .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 4]: How many knew ?
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 9]: Louden , Norbert , Ariel -- who else ?
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 11]: And again the deer took on the strange zebra look .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 67]: The Judge walked slowly down to the gate ; spoke to the man he had employed in Sam Warden 's place , a Scotchman who had begun to refresh the lawn with a garden hose ; bowed affably in response to the salutation of the elder Louden , who was passing , bound homeward from the factory , and returned to the house with thoughtful steps .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 28]: In the hall he encountered his wife ; stopped to speak with her upon various household matters ; then entered the library , which was his workroom .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 13]: He locked the door ; tried it , and shook the handle .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 41]: After satisfying himself of its security , he pulled down the window-shades carefully , and , lighting a gas drop-lamp upon his desk , began to fumble with various documents , which he took from a small safe near by .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 27]: But his hands were not steady ; he dropped the papers , scattering them over the floor , and had great difficulty in picking them up .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 20]: He perspired heavily : whatever he touched became damp , and he continually mopped his forehead with his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 28]: After a time he gave up the attempt to sort the packets of papers ; sank into a chair despairingly , leaving most of them in disorder .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 8]: A light tap sounded on the door .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 8]: `` Martin , it 's supper-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 16]: With a great effort he made shift to answer : `` Yes , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 6]: You and Mamie go ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 6]: I 'm too busy to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 7]: I do n't want anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 85]: A moment before , he had been a pitiful figure , face distraught , hands incoherent , the whole body incoordinate , but if eyes might have rested upon him as he answered his wife they would have seen a strange thing ; he sat , apparently steady and collected , his expression cool , his body quiet , poised exactly to the quality of his reply , for the same strange reason that a young girl smiles archly and coquettes to a telephone .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 13]: `` But , Martin , you ought n't to work so hard .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 18]: You 'll break down -- '' `` No fear of that , '' he replied , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 12]: `` You can leave something on the sideboard for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 16]: After another fluttering remonstrance , she went away , and the room was silent again .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 16]: His arms rested upon the desk , and his head slowly sank between his elbows .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 14]: When he lifted it again the clock on the mantel-piece had tinkled once .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 5]: It was half-past seven .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 44]: He took a sheet of note-paper from a box before him and began to write , but when he had finished the words , `` My dear wife and Mamie , '' his fingers shook so violently that he could go no further .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 35]: He placed his left hand over the back of his right to steady it , but found the device unavailing : the pen left mere zigzags on the page , and he dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 36]: He opened a lower drawer of the desk and took out of it a pistol ; rose , went to the door , tried it once more , and again was satisfied of his seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 36]: Then he took the weapon in both hands , the handle against his fingers , one thumb against the trigger , and , shaking with nausea , lifted it to the level of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 30]: His will betrayed him ; he could not contract his thumb upon the trigger , and , with a convulsive shiver , he dropped the revolver upon the desk .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 20]: He locked the door of the room behind him , crept down the stairs and out of the front-door .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 35]: He walked shamblingly , when he reached the street , keeping close to the fences as he went on , now and then touching the pickets with his hands like a feeble old man .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 56]: He had always been prompt ; it was one of the things of which he had been proud : in all his life he had never failed to keep a business engagement precisely upon the appointed time , and the Court-house bell clanged eight when Sam Warden opened the door for his old employer to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 35]: The two young people looked up gravely from the script-laden table before them as Martin Pike came into the strong lamplight out of the dimness of the hall , where only a taper burned .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 15]: He shambled a few limp steps into the room and came to a halt .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 57]: Big as he was , his clothes hung upon him loosely , like coverlets upon a collapsed bed ; and he seemed but a distorted image of himself , as if -LRB- save for the dull and reddened eyes -RRB- he had been made of yellowish wax and had been left too long in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 46]: Abject , hopeless , his attitude a confession of ruin and shame , he stood before his judges in such wretchedness that , in comparison , the figure of Happy Fear , facing the court-room through his darkest hour , was one to be envied .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 18]: `` Well , '' he said , brokenly , `` what are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 12]: Joe Louden looked at him with great intentness for several moments .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 7]: Then he rose and came forward .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 10]: `` Sit down , Judge , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 6]: `` It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 5]: Do n't worry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 38]: XXV THE JURY COMES IN Mrs. Flitcroft , at breakfast on the following morning , continued a disquisition which had ceased , the previous night , only because of a provoking human incapacity to exist without sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 64]: Her theme was one which had exclusively occupied her since the passing of Eskew , and , her rheumatism having improved so that she could leave her chair , she had become a sort of walking serial ; Norbert and his grandfather being well assured that , whenever they left the house , the same story was to be continued upon their reappearance .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 40]: The Tocsin had been her great comfort : she was but one helpless woman against two strong men ; therefore she sorely needed assistance in her attack upon them , and the invaluable newspaper gave it in generous measure .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 27]: `` Yes , young man , '' she said , as she lifted her first spoonful of oatmeal , `` you BETTER read the Tocsin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 18]: `` I AM reading it , '' responded Norbert , who was almost concealed by the paper .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 9]: `` And your grandfather better read it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 5]: she continued , severely .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 12]: `` I already have , '' said the Colonel , promptly .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 5]: `` Have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 12]: `` No , but you can be sure I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 11]: The good lady gave the effect of tossing her head .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 16]: `` And you better take what it says to heart , you and some others .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 28]: It 's a wonder to me that you and Buckalew and old Peter do n't go and hold that Happy Fear 's hand durin ' the trial !
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 26]: And as for Joe Louden , his step-mother 's own sister , Jane , says to me only yesterday afternoon , ` Why , law !
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 47]: Mrs. Flitcroft , ' she says , ` it 's a wonder to me , ' she says , ` that your husband and those two other old fools do n't lay down in the gutter and let that Joe Louden walk over 'em . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 14]: `` Did Jane Quimby say ` those two other old fools ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 21]: inquired the Colonel , in a manner which indicated that he might see Mr. Quimby in regard to the slander .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 28]: `` I ca n't say as I remember just precisely her exact words , '' admitted Mrs. Flitcroft , `` but that was the sense of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 15]: You 've made yourselves the laughin ' - stock of the whole town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 7]: `` Oh , we have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 31]: `` And I 'd like to know '' -- her voice became shrill and goading -- `` I 'd like to know what Judge Pike thinks of you and Norbert !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 17]: I should think you 'd be ashamed to have him pass you in the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 25]: `` I 've quit speaking to him , '' said Norbert , coldly , `` ever since I heard he owned Beaver Beach . ''
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 9]: `` That story ai n't proved yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 8]: returned his grandmother , with much irascibility .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 14]: `` Well , it will be ; but that 's not all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 5]: Norbert wagged his head .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 14]: `` You may be a little surprised within the next few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 11]: `` I 've been surprised for the PAST few ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 17]: she replied , with a bitterness which overrode her satisfaction in the effectiveness of the retort .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 3]: `` Surprised !
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 21]: I 'd like to know who would n't be surprised when half the town acts like it 's gone crazy .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 25]: People PRAISIN ' that fellow , that nobody in their sober minds and senses never in their lives had a good word for before !
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 24]: Why , there was more talk yesterday about his doin 's at the Court-house -- you 'd of thought he was Phil Sheridan !
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 36]: It 's ` Joe Louden ' here and ` Joe Louden ' there , and ` Joe Louden ' this and ` Joe Louden ' that , till I 'm sick of the name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 11]: `` Then why do n't you quit saying it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 6]: asked the Colonel , reasonably .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 10]: `` Because it 'd OUGHT to be said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 7]: she exclaimed , with great heat .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 16]: `` Because he 'd ought to be held up to the community to be despised .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 43]: You let me have that paper a minute , '' she pursued , vehemently ; `` you just let me have the Tocsin and I 'll read you out some things about him that 'll show him in his true light ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 14]: `` All right , '' said Norbert , suddenly handing her the paper .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 5]: `` Go ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 16]: And after the exchange of a single glance the two gentlemen composed themselves to listen .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Flitcroft .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: `` Here it is in head-lines on the first page .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 7]: ` Defence Scores Again and Again .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 7]: Ridiculous Behavior of a Would-Be Mob .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 59]: Louden 's -- ' '' She paused , removed her spectacles , examined them dubiously , restored them to place , and continued : '' ` Louden 's Masterly Conduct and Well-Deserved -- ' '' she paused again , incredulous -- '' ` Well-Deserved Triumph -- ' '' `` Go on , '' said the Colonel , softly .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 6]: `` Indeed I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 5]: the old lady replied .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 14]: `` Do you think I do n't know sarcasm when I see it ?
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 5]: Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 6]: She laughed with great heartiness .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 8]: `` I reckon I WILL go on !
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 11]: You listen and try to LEARN something from it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 35]: She resumed the reading : '' ` It is generally admitted that after yesterday 's sitting of the court , the prosecution in the Fear-Cory murder trial has not a leg to stand on .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 61]: Louden 's fight for his client has been , it must be confessed , of a most splendid and talented order , and the bottom has fallen out of the case for the State , while a verdict of Not Guilty , it is now conceded , is the general wish of those who have attended and followed the trial .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 30]: But the most interesting event of the day took place after the session , when some miscreants undertook to mob the attorney for the defence in the Court-house yard .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 24]: He met the attack with a coolness and nerve which have won him a popularity that -- ' '' Mrs. Flitcroft again faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 9]: `` Go on , '' repeated the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 9]: `` There 's a great deal more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 10]: `` Look at the editorials , '' suggested Norbert .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 10]: `` There 's one on the same subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 17]: Mrs. Flitcroft , her theory of the Tocsin 's sarcasm somewhat shaken , turned the page .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 51]: `` We Confess a Mistake '' was the rubric above the leader , and she uttered a cry of triumph , for she thought the mistake was what she had just been reading , and that the editorial would apologize for the incomprehensible journalistic error upon the first page . ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 22]: ` The best of us make mistakes , and it is well to have a change of heart sometimes . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 16]: -LRB- Thus Eugene 's successor had written , and so Mrs. Flitcroft read . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 10]: ` An open confession is good for the soul .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 21]: The Tocsin has changed its mind in regard to certain matters , and means to say so freely and frankly .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 56]: After yesterday 's events in connection with the murder trial before our public , the evidence being now all presented , for we understand that neither side has more to offer , it is generally conceded that all good citizens are hopeful of a verdict of acquittal ; and the Tocsin is a good citizen .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 65]: No good citizen would willingly see an innocent man punished , and that our city is not to be disgraced by such a miscarriage of justice is due to the efforts of the attorney for the defendant , who has gained credit not only by his masterly management of this case , but by his splendid conduct in the face of danger yesterday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 50]: He has distinguished himself so greatly that we frankly assert that our citizens may point with pride to -- ' '' Mrs. Flitcroft 's voice , at the beginning pitched to a high exultation , had gradually lowered in key and dropped down the scale till it disappeared altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 28]: `` It 's a wonder to me , '' the Colonel began , `` that the Tocsin does n't go and hold Joe Louden 's hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 23]: `` I 'll read the rest of it for you , '' said Norbert , his heavy face lighting up with cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 9]: `` Let 's see -- where were you ?
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 9]: Oh yes -- ` point with pride ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 37]: ` Our citizens may point with pride to ... ' '' Let us not linger to observe the unmanly behavior of an aged man and his grandson left alone at the breakfast-table by a defenceless woman .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 25]: The Tocsin 's right-about-face undermined others besides Mrs. Flitcroft that morning , and rejoiced greater -LRB- though not better -RRB- men than the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 17]: Mr. Farbach and his lieutenants smiled , yet stared , amazed , wondering what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 18]: That was a thing which only three people even certainly knew ; yet it was very simple .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 10]: The Tocsin was part of the Judge 's restitution .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 56]: `` The controlling interest in the paper , together with the other property I have listed , '' Joe had said , studying his memoranda under the lamp in Roger 's old studio , while Martin Pike listened with his head in his hands , `` make up what Miss Tabor is willing to accept .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 26]: As I estimate it , their total value is between a third and a half of that of the stock which belonged to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 29]: `` But this boy -- this Flitcroft , '' said Pike , feebly ; `` he might -- '' `` He will do nothing , '' interrupted Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 40]: `` The case is ` settled out of court , ' and even if he were disposed to harass you , he could hardly hope to succeed , since Miss Tabor declines either to sue or to prosecute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 8]: The Judge winced at the last word .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 18]: `` Yes -- yes , I know ; but he might -- he might -- tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 10]: `` I think Miss Tabor 's influence will prevent .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 37]: If it should not -- well , you 're not in a desperate case by any means ; you 're involved , but far from stripped ; in time you may be as sound as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 19]: And if Norbert tells , there 's nothing for you to do but to live it down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 19]: A faint smile played upon Joe 's lips as he lifted his head and looked at the other .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 10]: `` It can be done , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 61]: It was then that Ariel , complaining of the warmth of the evening , thought it possible that Joe might find her fan upon the porch , and as he departed , whispered hurriedly : `` Judge Pike , I 'm not technically in control of the Tocsin , but have n't I the right to control its policy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: `` I understand , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 22]: `` You mean about Louden -- about this trial -- '' `` That is why I have taken the paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 11]: `` You want all that changed , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 4]: She nodded decisively .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 5]: `` From this instant .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 4]: Before morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 16]: `` Oh , well , I 'll go down there and give the word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 9]: He rubbed his eyes wearily with big thumbs .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 6]: `` I 'm through fighting .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 4]: I 'm done .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 7]: Besides , what 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 8]: There 's nothing more to fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 32]: `` Now , Judge , '' Joe said , as he came in briskly , `` we 'll go over the list of that unencumbered property , if you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 22]: This unencumbered property consisted of Beaver Beach and those other belongings of the Judge which he had not dared to mortgage .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 22]: Joe had somehow explained their nature to Ariel , and these with the Tocsin she had elected to accept in restitution .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 20]: `` You told me once that I ought to look after my own property , and now I will .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 6]: Do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 7]: she cried to Joe , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 7]: `` It 's my work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 22]: She resolutely set aside every other proposition ; and this was the quality of mercy which Martin Pike found that night .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 31]: There was a great crowd to hear Joe 's summing-up at the trial , and those who succeeded in getting into the court-room declared that it was worth the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 51]: He did not orate , he did not `` thunder at the jury , '' nor did he slyly flatter them ; he did not overdo the confidential , nor seem so secure of understanding beforehand what their verdict would be that they felt an instinctive desire to fool him .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 61]: He talked colloquially but clearly , without appeal to the pathetic and without garnitures , not mentioning sunsets , birds , oceans , homes , the glorious old State , or the happiness of liberty ; but he made everybody in the room quite sure that Happy Fear had fired the shot which killed Cory to save his own life .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 20]: And that , as Mr. Bradbury remarked to the Colonel , was `` what Joe was THERE for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 41]: Ariel 's escort was increased to four that day : Mr. Ladew sat beside her , and there were times when Joe kept his mind entirely to the work in hand only by an effort , but he always succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 23]: The sight of the pale and worshipping face of Happy Fear from the corner of his eye was enough to insure that .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 24]: And people who could not get near the doors , asking those who could , `` What 's he doin ' now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 20]: were answered by variations of the one formula , `` Oh , jest walkin ' away with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 21]: Once the court-room was disturbed and set in an uproar which even the Judge 's customary threat failed to subdue .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 35]: Joe had been talking very rapidly , and having turned the point he was making with perfect dexterity , the jury listening eagerly , stopped for a moment to take a swallow of water .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 27]: A voice rose over the low hum of the crowd in a delirious chuckle : `` Why do n't somebody ` HEAD HIM OFF ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 42]: The room instantly rocked with laughter , under cover of which the identity of the sacrilegious chuckler was not discovered , but the voice was the voice of Buckalew , who was incredibly surprised to find that he had spoken aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 30]: The jury were `` out , '' after the case had been given to them , seventeen minutes and thirty seconds by the watch Claudine held in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 39]: The little man , whose fate was now on the knees of the gods , looked pathetically at the foreman and then at the face of his lawyer and began to shake violently , but not with fright .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 40]: He had gone to the jail on Joe 's word , as a good dog goes where his master bids , trustfully ; and yet Happy had not been able to keep his mind from considering the horrible chances .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 10]: `` Do n't worry , '' Joe had said .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 6]: `` It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 7]: I 'll see you through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 7]: And he had kept his word .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 6]: The little man was cleared .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 49]: It took Happy a long time to get through what he had to say to his attorney in the anteroom , and even then , of course , he did not manage to put it in words , for he had `` broken down '' with sheer gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 26]: `` Why , damn ME , Joe , '' he sobbed , `` if ever I -- if ever you -- well , by God !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 17]: if you ever -- '' This was the substance of his lingual accomplishment under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 14]: But Claudine threw her arms around poor Joe 's neck and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 13]: Many people were waiting to shake hands with Joe and congratulate him .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 39]: The trio , taking advantage of seats near the rail , had already done that -LRB- somewhat uproariously -RRB- before he had followed Happy , and so had Ariel and Ladew , both , necessarily , rather hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 57]: But in the corridors he found , when he came out of the anteroom , clients , acquaintances , friends : old friends , new friends , and friends he had never seen before -- everybody beaming upon him and wringing his hand , as if they had been sure of it all from the start .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 5]: `` KNOW him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 5]: said one to another .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 13]: `` Why , I 've knowed him sence he was that high !
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 9]: SMART little feller he was , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 6]: This was a total stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 39]: `` I said , years ago '' -- thus Mr. Brown , the `` National House '' clerk , proving his prophetic vision -- `` that he 'd turn out to be a big man some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 27]: They gathered round him if he stopped for an instant , and crowded after him admiringly when he went on again , making his progress slow .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 42]: When he finally came out of the big doors into the sunshine , there were as many people in the yard as there had been when he stood in the same place and watched the mob rushing his client 's guards .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 49]: But to-day their temper was different , and as he paused a moment , looking down on the upturned , laughing faces , with a hundred jocular and congratulatory salutations shouted up at him , somebody started a cheer , and it was taken up with thunderous good-will .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 29]: There followed the interrogation customary in such emergencies , and the anxious inquirer was informed by four or five hundred people simultaneously that Joe Louden was all right .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 6]: `` HEAD HIM OFF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 10]: bellowed Mike Sheehan , suddenly darting up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 34]: The shout increased , and with good reason , for he stepped quickly back within the doors ; and , retreating through the building , made good his escape by a basement door .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 31]: He struck off into a long detour , but though he managed to evade the crowd , he had to stop and shake hands with every third person he met .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 14]: As he came out upon Main Street again , he encountered his father .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 7]: `` Howdy do , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 10]: said this laconic person , and offered his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 5]: They shook , briefly .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 17]: `` Well , '' he continued , rubbing his beard , `` how are ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 10]: `` All right , father , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: `` Satisfied with the verdict ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 17]: `` I 'd be pretty hard to please if I were n't , '' Joe laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 7]: Mr. Louden rubbed his beard again .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 12]: `` I was there , '' he said , without emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 9]: `` At the trial , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 12]: He offered his hand once more , and again they shook .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 13]: `` Well , come around and see us , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 4]: I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 14]: `` Well , '' said Mr. Louden , `` good-day , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 6]: `` Good-day , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 12]: The young man stood looking after him with a curious smile .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 7]: Then he gave a slight start .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 34]: Far up the street he saw two figures , one a lady 's , in white , with a wide white hat ; the other a man 's , wearing recognizably clerical black .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 8]: They seemed to be walking very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 25]: It had been a day of triumph for Joe ; but in all his life he never slept worse than he did that night .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 63]: XXVI ANCIENT OF DAYS He woke to the chiming of bells , and , as his eyes slowly opened , the sorrowful people of a dream , who seemed to be bending over him , weeping , swam back into the darkness of the night whence they had come , and returned to the imperceptible , leaving their shadows in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 52]: Slowly he rose , stumbled into the outer room , and released the fluttering shade ; but the sunshine , springing like a golden lover through the open window , only dazzled him , and found no answering gladness to greet it , nor joy in the royal day it heralded .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 30]: And yet , to the newly cleaned boys on their way to midsummer morning Sunday-school , the breath of that cool August day was as sweet as stolen apples .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 33]: No doubt the stir of far , green thickets and the twinkle of silver-slippered creeks shimmered in the longing vision of their minds ' eyes ; even so , they were merry .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 36]: But Joseph Louden , sighing as he descended his narrow stairs , with the bitterness still upon his lips of the frightful coffee he had made , heard the echo of their laughter with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 57]: It would be an hour at least before time to start to church , when Ariel expected him ; he stared absently up the street , then down , and , after that , began slowly to walk in the latter direction , with no very active consciousness , or care , of where he went .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 72]: He had fallen into a profound reverie , so deep that when he had crossed the bridge and turned into a dusty road which ran along the river-bank , he stopped mechanically beside the trunk of a fallen sycamore , and , lifting his head , for the first time since he had set out , looked about him with a melancholy perplexity , a little surprised to find himself there .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 24]: For this was the spot where he had first seen the new Ariel , and on that fallen sycamore they had sat together .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 11]: `` REMEMBER , ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 22]: And Joe 's cheeks burned , as he recalled why he had not understood the clear voice that had haunted him .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 22]: But that shame had fallen from him ; she had changed all that , as she had changed so many things .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 37]: He sank down in the long grass , with his back against the log , and stared out over the fields of tall corn , shaking in a steady wind all the way to the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 7]: `` Changed so many things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 6]: he said , half aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 4]: `` Everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 21]: Ah , yes , she had changed the whole world for Joseph Louden -- at his first sight of her !
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 22]: And now it seemed to him that he was to lose her , but not in the way he had thought .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 26]: Almost from the very first , he had the feeling that nothing so beautiful as that she should stay in Canaan could happen to him .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 27]: He was sure that she was but for the little while , that her coming was like the flying petals of which he had told her .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 14]: He had lain upon the earth ; and she had lifted him up .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 28]: For a moment he had felt the beatific wings enfolding him with gentle protection , and then saw them lifted to bear the angel beyond his sight .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 31]: For it was incredible that the gods so loved Joe Louden that they would make greater gifts to him than this little time with her which they had granted him .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 7]: `` Changed so many things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 31]: The bars that had been between him and half of his world were down , shattered , never more to be replaced ; and the ban of Canaan was lifted .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 9]: Could this have been , save for her ?
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 25]: And upon that thought he got to his feet , uttering an exclamation of bitter self-reproach , asking himself angrily what he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 15]: He knew how much she gave him , what full measure of her affection !
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 5]: Was not that enough ?
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 7]: -- Out upon you , Louden !
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 35]: Are you to sulk in your tent , dour in the gloom , or to play a man 's part , and if she be happy , turn a cheery face upon her joy ?
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 34]: And thus this pilgrim recrossed the bridge , emerging to the street with his head up , smiling , and his shoulders thrown back so that none might see the burden he carried .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 9]: Ariel was waiting on the porch for him .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 37]: She wore the same dress she had worn that Sunday of their tryst ; that exquisite dress , with the faint lavender overtint , like the tender colors of the beautiful day he made his own .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 66]: She had not worn it since , and he was far distant when he caught the first flickering glimpse of her through the lower branches of the maples , but he remembered ... And again , as on that day , he heard a far-away , ineffable music , the Elf-land horns , sounding the mysterious reveille which had wakened his soul to her coming .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 30]: She came to the gate to meet him , and gave him her hand in greeting , without a word -- or the need of one -- from either .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 33]: Then together they set forth over the sun-flecked pavement , the maples swishing above them , heavier branches crooning in the strong breeze , under a sky like a Della Robbia background .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 29]: And up against the glorious blue of it , some laughing , invisible god was blowing small , rounded clouds of pure cotton , as children blow thistledown .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 34]: When he opened her parasol , as they came out into the broad sunshine beyond Upper Main Street , there was the faintest mingling of wild roses and cinnamon loosed on the air .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 14]: `` Joe , '' she said , `` I 'm very happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 11]: `` That 's right , '' he returned , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 9]: `` I think you always will be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 5]: `` But , oh !
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 25]: I wish , '' she went on , `` that Mr. Arp could have lived to see you come down the Court-house steps . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 6]: `` God bless him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 10]: `` I can hear the ` argument ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 15]: `` Those dear old men have been so loyal to you , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 13]: `` No , '' he returned ; `` loyal to Eskew . ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 9]: `` To you both , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 24]: `` I 'm afraid the old circle is broken up ; they have n't met on the National House corner since he died .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 14]: The Colonel told me he could n't bear to go there again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 15]: `` I do n't believe any of them ever will , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 19]: `` And yet I never pass the place that I do n't see Eskew in his old chair .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 10]: I went there last night to commune with him .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 40]: I could n't sleep , and I got up , and went over there ; they 'd left the chairs out ; the town was asleep , and it was beautiful moonlight -- '' `` To commune with him ?
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 4]: What about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 4]: `` You . ''
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 6]: she asked , plainly mystified .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 37]: `` I stood in need of good counsel , '' he answered , cheerfully , `` or a friendly word , perhaps , and -- as I sat there -- after a while it came . ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 24]: `` To forget that I was sodden with selfishness ; to pretend not to be as full of meanness as I really was !
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 12]: Does n't that seem to be Eskew 's own voice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 11]: `` Were n't you happy last night , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 14]: `` Oh , it was all right , '' he said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 7]: `` Do n't you worry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 20]: And at this old speech of his she broke into a little laugh of which he had no comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 25]: `` Mamie came to see me early this morning , '' she said , after they had walked on in silence for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 18]: `` Everything is all right with her again ; that is , I think it will be .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 5]: Eugene is coming home .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 25]: And , '' she added , thoughtfully , `` it will be best for him to have his old place on the Tocsin again .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 11]: She showed me his letter , and I liked it .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 16]: I think he 's been through the fire -- '' Joe 's distorted smile appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 8]: `` And has come out gold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 12]: `` No , '' she laughed ; `` but nearer it !
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 14]: And I think he 'll try to be more worth her caring for .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 17]: She has always thought that his leaving the Tocsin in the way he did was heroic .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 7]: That was her word for it .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 11]: And it WAS the finest thing he ever did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 9]: `` I ca n't figure Eugene out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 5]: Joe shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 15]: `` There 's something behind his going away that I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 63]: This was altogether the truth ; nor was there ever to come a time when either he or Mamie would understand what things had determined the departure of Eugene Bantry ; though Mamie never questioned , as Joe did , the reasons for it , or doubted those Eugene had given her , which were the same he had given her father .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 8]: For she was content with his return .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 11]: Again the bells across the Square rang out their chime .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 33]: The paths were decorously enlivened with family and neighborhood groups , bound churchward ; and the rumble of the organ , playing the people into their pews , shook on the air .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 30]: And Joe knew that he must speak quickly , if he was to say what he had planned to say , before he and Ariel went into the church .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 4]: `` Ariel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 25]: He tried to compel his voice to a casual cheerfulness , but it would do nothing for him , except betray a desperate embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 11]: She looked at him quickly , and as quickly away .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 34]: `` I wanted to say something to you , and I 'd better do it now , I think -- before I go to church for the first time in two years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 38]: He managed to laugh , though with some ruefulness , and continued stammeringly : `` I want to tell you how much I like him -- how much I admire him -- '' `` Admire whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 11]: she asked , a little coldly , for she knew .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 5]: `` Mr. Ladew . ''
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 13]: `` So do I , '' she answered , looking straight ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 16]: `` That is one reason why I wanted you to come with me to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 7]: `` It is n't only that .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 18]: I want to tell you -- to tell you -- '' He broke off for a second .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 14]: `` You remember that night in my office before Fear came in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 7]: `` Yes ; I remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 34]: `` And that I -- that something I said troubled you because it -- it sounded as if I cared too much for you -- '' `` No ; not too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 6]: She still looked straight ahead .
