Parsing [sent. 1 len. 49]: Barnaby Rudge A Tale of the Riots of ` Eighty by Charles Dickens PREFACE The late Mr Waterton having , some time ago , expressed his opinion that ravens are gradually becoming extinct in England , I offered the few following words about my experience of these birds .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 26]: The raven in this story is a compound of two great originals , of whom I was , at different times , the proud possessor .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 32]: The first was in the bloom of his youth , when he was discovered in a modest retirement in London , by a friend of mine , and given to me .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 33]: He had from the first , as Sir Hugh Evans says of Anne Page , ` good gifts ' , which he improved by study and attention in a most exemplary manner .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 50]: He slept in a stable -- generally on horseback -- and so terrified a Newfoundland dog by his preternatural sagacity , that he has been known , by the mere superiority of his genius , to walk off unmolested with the dog 's dinner , from before his face .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 22]: He was rapidly rising in acquirements and virtues , when , in an evil hour , his stable was newly painted .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 22]: He observed the workmen closely , saw that they were careful of the paint , and immediately burned to possess it .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 33]: On their going to dinner , he ate up all they had left behind , consisting of a pound or two of white lead ; and this youthful indiscretion terminated in death .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 46]: While I was yet inconsolable for his loss , another friend of mine in Yorkshire discovered an older and more gifted raven at a village public-house , which he prevailed upon the landlord to part with for a consideration , and sent up to me .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 51]: The first act of this Sage , was , to administer to the effects of his predecessor , by disinterring all the cheese and halfpence he had buried in the garden -- a work of immense labour and research , to which he devoted all the energies of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 44]: When he had achieved this task , he applied himself to the acquisition of stable language , in which he soon became such an adept , that he would perch outside my window and drive imaginary horses with great skill , all day .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 63]: Perhaps even I never saw him at his best , for his former master sent his duty with him , ` and if I wished the bird to come out very strong , would I be so good as to show him a drunken man ' -- which I never did , having -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- none but sober people at hand .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 20]: But I could hardly have respected him more , whatever the stimulating influences of this sight might have been .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 44]: He had not the least respect , I am sorry to say , for me in return , or for anybody but the cook ; to whom he was attached -- but only , I fear , as a Policeman might have been .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 38]: Once , I met him unexpectedly , about half-a-mile from my house , walking down the middle of a public street , attended by a pretty large crowd , and spontaneously exhibiting the whole of his accomplishments .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 37]: His gravity under those trying circumstances , I can never forget , nor the extraordinary gallantry with which , refusing to be brought home , he defended himself behind a pump , until overpowered by numbers .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 113]: It may have been that he was too bright a genius to live long , or it may have been that he took some pernicious substance into his bill , and thence into his maw -- which is not improbable , seeing that he new-pointed the greater part of the garden-wall by digging out the mortar , broke countless squares of glass by scraping away the putty all round the frames , and tore up and swallowed , in splinters , the greater part of a wooden staircase of six steps and a landing -- but after some three years he too was taken ill , and died before the kitchen fire .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 17]: He kept his eye to the last upon the meat as it roasted , and suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 14]: turned over on his back with a sepulchral cry of ` Cuckoo ! '
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 7]: Since then I have been ravenless .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 36]: No account of the Gordon Riots having been to my knowledge introduced into any Work of Fiction , and the subject presenting very extraordinary and remarkable features , I was led to project this Tale .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 39]: It is unnecessary to say , that those shameful tumults , while they reflect indelible disgrace upon the time in which they occurred , and all who had act or part in them , teach a good lesson .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 60]: That what we falsely call a religious cry is easily raised by men who have no religion , and who in their daily practice set at nought the commonest principles of right and wrong ; that it is begotten of intolerance and persecution ; that it is senseless , besotted , inveterate and unmerciful ; all History teaches us .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 34]: But perhaps we do not know it in our hearts too well , to profit by even so humble an example as the ` No Popery ' riots of Seventeen Hundred and Eighty .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 46]: However imperfectly those disturbances are set forth in the following pages , they are impartially painted by one who has no sympathy with the Romish Church , though he acknowledges , as most men do , some esteemed friends among the followers of its creed .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 45]: In the description of the principal outrages , reference has been had to the best authorities of that time , such as they are ; the account given in this Tale , of all the main features of the Riots , is substantially correct .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 29]: Mr Dennis 's allusions to the flourishing condition of his trade in those days , have their foundation in Truth , and not in the Author 's fancy .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 21]: Any file of old Newspapers , or odd volume of the Annual Register , will prove this with terrible ease .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 24]: Even the case of Mary Jones , dwelt upon with so much pleasure by the same character , is no effort of invention .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 18]: The facts were stated , exactly as they are stated here , in the House of Commons .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 33]: Whether they afforded as much entertainment to the merry gentlemen assembled there , as some other most affecting circumstances of a similar nature mentioned by Sir Samuel Romilly , is not recorded .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 40]: That the case of Mary Jones may speak the more emphatically for itself , I subjoin it , as related by SIR WILLIAM MEREDITH in a speech in Parliament , ` on Frequent Executions ' , made in 1777 .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 42]: ` Under this act , ' the Shop-lifting Act , ` one Mary Jones was executed , whose case I shall just mention ; it was at the time when press warrants were issued , on the alarm about Falkland Islands .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 30]: The woman 's husband was pressed , their goods seized for some debts of his , and she , with two small children , turned into the streets a-begging .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 24]: It is a circumstance not to be forgotten , that she was very young -LRB- under nineteen -RRB- , and most remarkably handsome .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 40]: She went to a linen-draper 's shop , took some coarse linen off the counter , and slipped it under her cloak ; the shopman saw her , and she laid it down : for this she was hanged .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 81]: Her defence was -LRB- I have the trial in my pocket -RRB- , `` that she had lived in credit , and wanted for nothing , till a press-gang came and stole her husband from her ; but since then , she had no bed to lie on ; nothing to give her children to eat ; and they were almost naked ; and perhaps she might have done something wrong , for she hardly knew what she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 47]: The parish officers testified the truth of this story ; but it seems , there had been a good deal of shop-lifting about Ludgate ; an example was thought necessary ; and this woman was hanged for the comfort and satisfaction of shopkeepers in Ludgate Street .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 43]: When brought to receive sentence , she behaved in such a frantic manner , as proved her mind to he in a distracted and desponding state ; and the child was sucking at her breast when she set out for Tyburn . '
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 147]: Chapter 1 In the year 1775 , there stood upon the borders of Epping Forest , at a distance of about twelve miles from London -- measuring from the Standard in Cornhill , ' or rather from the spot on or near to which the Standard used to be in days of yore -- a house of public entertainment called the Maypole ; which fact was demonstrated to all such travellers as could neither read nor write -LRB- and at that time a vast number both of travellers and stay-at-homes were in this condition -RRB- by the emblem reared on the roadside over against the house , which , if not of those goodly proportions that Maypoles were wont to present in olden times , was a fair young ash , thirty feet in height , and straight as any arrow that ever English yeoman drew .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 86]: The Maypole -- by which term from henceforth is meant the house , and not its sign -- the Maypole was an old building , with more gable ends than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day ; huge zig-zag chimneys , out of which it seemed as though even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes , imparted to it in its tortuous progress ; and vast stables , gloomy , ruinous , and empty .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 93]: The place was said to have been built in the days of King Henry the Eighth ; and there was a legend , not only that Queen Elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion , to wit , in a certain oak-panelled room with a deep bay window , but that next morning , while standing on a mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup , the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 96]: The matter-of-fact and doubtful folks , of whom there were a few among the Maypole customers , as unluckily there always are in every little community , were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal ; but , whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence , and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day , the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority , and all true believers exulted as in a victory .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 62]: Whether these , and many other stories of the like nature , were true or untrue , the Maypole was really an old house , a very old house , perhaps as old as it claimed to be , and perhaps older , which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain , as with ladies of a certain , age .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 29]: Its windows were old diamond-pane lattices , its floors were sunken and uneven , its ceilings blackened by the hand of time , and heavy with massive beams .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 63]: Over the doorway was an ancient porch , quaintly and grotesquely carved ; and here on summer evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank -- ay , and sang many a good song too , sometimes -- reposing on two grim-looking high-backed settles , which , like the twin dragons of some fairy tale , guarded the entrance to the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 37]: In the chimneys of the disused rooms , swallows had built their nests for many a long year , and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 19]: There were more pigeons about the dreary stable-yard and out-buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 61]: The wheeling and circling flights of runts , fantails , tumblers , and pouters , were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober character of the building , but the monotonous cooing , which never ceased to be raised by some among them all day long , suited it exactly , and seemed to lull it to rest .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 34]: With its overhanging stories , drowsy little panes of glass , and front bulging out and projecting over the pathway , the old house looked as if it were nodding in its sleep .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 19]: Indeed , it needed no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 64]: The bricks of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red , but had grown yellow and discoloured like an old man 's skin ; the sturdy timbers had decayed like teeth ; and here and there the ivy , like a warm garment to comfort it in its age , wrapt its green leaves closely round the time-worn walls .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 64]: It was a hale and hearty age though , still : and in the summer or autumn evenings , when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest , the old house , partaking of its lustre , seemed their fit companion , and to have many good years of life in him yet .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 113]: The evening with which we have to do , was neither a summer nor an autumn one , but the twilight of a day in March , when the wind howled dismally among the bare branches of the trees , and rumbling in the wide chimneys and driving the rain against the windows of the Maypole Inn , gave such of its frequenters as chanced to be there at the moment an undeniable reason for prolonging their stay , and caused the landlord to prophesy that the night would certainly clear at eleven o'clock precisely , -- which by a remarkable coincidence was the hour at which he always closed his house .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 46]: The name of him upon whom the spirit of prophecy thus descended was John Willet , a burly , large-headed man with a fat face , which betokened profound obstinacy and slowness of apprehension , combined with a very strong reliance upon his own merits .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 110]: It was John Willet 's ordinary boast in his more placid moods that if he were slow he was sure ; which assertion could , in one sense at least , be by no means gainsaid , seeing that he was in everything unquestionably the reverse of fast , and withal one of the most dogged and positive fellows in existence -- always sure that what he thought or said or did was right , and holding it as a thing quite settled and ordained by the laws of nature and Providence , that anybody who said or did or thought otherwise must be inevitably and of necessity wrong .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 40]: Mr Willet walked slowly up to the window , flattened his fat nose against the cold glass , and shading his eyes that his sight might not be affected by the ruddy glow of the fire , looked abroad .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 59]: Then he walked slowly back to his old seat in the chimney-corner , and , composing himself in it with a slight shiver , such as a man might give way to and so acquire an additional relish for the warm blaze , said , looking round upon his guests : ` It 'll clear at eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 6]: No sooner and no later .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 7]: Not before and not arterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 9]: ` How do you make out that ? '
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: said a little man in the opposite corner .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 15]: ` The moon is past the full , and she rises at nine . '
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 55]: John looked sedately and solemnly at his questioner until he had brought his mind to bear upon the whole of his observation , and then made answer , in a tone which seemed to imply that the moon was peculiarly his business and nobody else 's : ` Never you mind about the moon .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 8]: Do n't you trouble yourself about her .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 14]: You let the moon alone , and I 'll let you alone . '
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 7]: ` No offence I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 5]: said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 103]: Again John waited leisurely until the observation had thoroughly penetrated to his brain , and then replying , ` No offence as YET , ' applied a light to his pipe and smoked in placid silence ; now and then casting a sidelong look at a man wrapped in a loose riding-coat with huge cuffs ornamented with tarnished silver lace and large metal buttons , who sat apart from the regular frequenters of the house , and wearing a hat flapped over his face , which was still further shaded by the hand on which his forehead rested , looked unsociable enough .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 59]: There was another guest , who sat , booted and spurred , at some distance from the fire also , and whose thoughts -- to judge from his folded arms and knitted brows , and from the untasted liquor before him -- were occupied with other matters than the topics under discussion or the persons who discussed them .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 27]: This was a young man of about eight-and-twenty , rather above the middle height , and though of somewhat slight figure , gracefully and strongly made .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 50]: He wore his own dark hair , and was accoutred in a riding dress , which together with his large boots -LRB- resembling in shape and fashion those worn by our Life Guardsmen at the present day -RRB- , showed indisputable traces of the bad condition of the roads .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 23]: But travel-stained though he was , he was well and even richly attired , and without being overdressed looked a gallant gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 40]: Lying upon the table beside him , as he had carelessly thrown them down , were a heavy riding-whip and a slouched hat , the latter worn no doubt as being best suited to the inclemency of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 18]: There , too , were a pair of pistols in a holster-case , and a short riding-cloak .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 52]: Little of his face was visible , except the long dark lashes which concealed his downcast eyes , but an air of careless ease and natural gracefulness of demeanour pervaded the figure , and seemed to comprehend even those slight accessories , which were all handsome , and in good keeping .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 28]: Towards this young gentleman the eyes of Mr Willet wandered but once , and then as if in mute inquiry whether he had observed his silent neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 14]: It was plain that John and the young gentleman had often met before .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 94]: Finding that his look was not returned , or indeed observed by the person to whom it was addressed , John gradually concentrated the whole power of his eyes into one focus , and brought it to bear upon the man in the flapped hat , at whom he came to stare in course of time with an intensity so remarkable , that it affected his fireside cronies , who all , as with one accord , took their pipes from their lips , and stared with open mouths at the stranger likewise .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 136]: The sturdy landlord had a large pair of dull fish-like eyes , and the little man who had hazarded the remark about the moon -LRB- and who was the parish-clerk and bell-ringer of Chigwell , a village hard by -RRB- had little round black shiny eyes like beads ; moreover this little man wore at the knees of his rusty black breeches , and on his rusty black coat , and all down his long flapped waistcoat , little queer buttons like nothing except his eyes ; but so like them , that as they twinkled and glistened in the light of the fire , which shone too in his bright shoe-buckles , he seemed all eyes from head to foot , and to be gazing with every one of them at the unknown customer .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 62]: No wonder that a man should grow restless under such an inspection as this , to say nothing of the eyes belonging to short Tom Cobb the general chandler and post-office keeper , and long Phil Parkes the ranger , both of whom , infected by the example of their companions , regarded him of the flapped hat no less attentively .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 67]: The stranger became restless ; perhaps from being exposed to this raking fire of eyes , perhaps from the nature of his previous meditations -- most probably from the latter cause , for as he changed his position and looked hastily round , he started to find himself the object of such keen regard , and darted an angry and suspicious glance at the fireside group .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 60]: It had the effect of immediately diverting all eyes to the chimney , except those of John Willet , who finding himself as it were , caught in the fact , and not being -LRB- as has been already observed -RRB- of a very ready nature , remained staring at his guest in a particularly awkward and disconcerted manner .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 4]: said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 7]: There was not much in well .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 8]: It was not a long speech . '
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 23]: I thought you gave an order , ' said the landlord , after a pause of two or three minutes for consideration .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 70]: The stranger took off his hat , and disclosed the hard features of a man of sixty or thereabouts , much weatherbeaten and worn by time , and the naturally harsh expression of which was not improved by a dark handkerchief which was bound tightly round his head , and , while it served the purpose of a wig , shaded his forehead , and almost hid his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 53]: If it were intended to conceal or divert attention from a deep gash , now healed into an ugly seam , which when it was first inflicted must have laid bare his cheekbone , the object was but indifferently attained , for it could scarcely fail to be noted at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 22]: His complexion was of a cadaverous hue , and he had a grizzly jagged beard of some three weeks ' date .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 48]: Such was the figure -LRB- very meanly and poorly clad -RRB- that now rose from the seat , and stalking across the room sat down in a corner of the chimney , which the politeness or fears of the little clerk very readily assigned to him . '
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 4]: A highwayman ! '
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 8]: whispered Tom Cobb to Parkes the ranger .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 13]: ` Do you suppose highwaymen do n't dress handsomer than that ? '
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 3]: replied Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 31]: ` It 's a better business than you think for , Tom , and highwaymen do n't need or use to be shabby , take my word for it . '
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 55]: Meanwhile the subject of their speculations had done due honour to the house by calling for some drink , which was promptly supplied by the landlord 's son Joe , a broad-shouldered strapping young fellow of twenty , whom it pleased his father still to consider a little boy , and to treat accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 55]: Stretching out his hands to warm them by the blazing fire , the man turned his head towards the company , and after running his eye sharply over them , said in a voice well suited to his appearance : ` What house is that which stands a mile or so from here ? '
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 4]: ` Public-house ? '
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 9]: said the landlord , with his usual deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 6]: ` Public-house , father ! '
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 17]: exclaimed Joe , ` where 's the public-house within a mile or so of the Maypole ?
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 14]: He means the great house -- the Warren -- naturally and of course .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 17]: The old red brick house , sir , that stands in its own grounds -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 8]: ` Aye , ' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 39]: ` And that fifteen or twenty years ago stood in a park five times as broad , which with other and richer property has bit by bit changed hands and dwindled away -- more 's the pity ! '
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 5]: pursued the young man .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 8]: ` Maybe , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 9]: ` But my question related to the owner .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 22]: What it has been I do n't care to know , and what it is I can see for myself . '
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 74]: The heir-apparent to the Maypole pressed his finger on his lips , and glancing at the young gentleman already noticed , who had changed his attitude when the house was first mentioned , replied in a lower tone : ` The owner 's name is Haredale , Mr Geoffrey Haredale , and ' -- again he glanced in the same direction as before -- ` and a worthy gentleman too -- hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 26]: Paying as little regard to this admonitory cough , as to the significant gesture that had preceded it , the stranger pursued his questioning . '
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 18]: I turned out of my way coming here , and took the footpath that crosses the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 12]: Who was the young lady that I saw entering a carriage ?
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 4]: His daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 12]: ` Why , how should I know , honest man ? '
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 39]: replied Joe , contriving in the course of some arrangements about the hearth , to advance close to his questioner and pluck him by the sleeve , ' I did n't see the young lady , you know .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 2]: Whew !
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 16]: There 's the wind again -- AND rain -- well it IS a night ! '
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 5]: Rough weather indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 5]: observed the strange man .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 8]: ` You 're used to it ? '
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 16]: said Joe , catching at anything which seemed to promise a diversion of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 9]: ` Pretty well , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 13]: ` About the young lady -- has Mr Haredale a daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 31]: ` No , no , ' said the young fellow fretfully , ` he 's a single gentleman -- he 's -- be quiet , ca n't you , man ?
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 12]: Do n't you see this talk is not relished yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 27]: Regardless of this whispered remonstrance , and affecting not to hear it , his tormentor provokingly continued : ` Single men have had daughters before now .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 14]: Perhaps she may be his daughter , though he is not married . '
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 29]: said Joe , adding in an undertone as he approached him again , ` You 'll come in for it presently , I know you will ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 21]: I mean no harm ' -- returned the traveller boldly , ` and have said none that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 48]: I ask a few questions -- as any stranger may , and not unnaturally -- about the inmates of a remarkable house in a neighbourhood which is new to me , and you are as aghast and disturbed as if I were talking treason against King George .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 28]: Perhaps you can tell me why , sir , for -LRB- as I say -RRB- I am a stranger , and this is Greek to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 28]: The latter observation was addressed to the obvious cause of Joe Willet 's discomposure , who had risen and was adjusting his riding-cloak preparatory to sallying abroad .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 51]: Briefly replying that he could give him no information , the young man beckoned to Joe , and handing him a piece of money in payment of his reckoning , hurried out attended by young Willet himself , who taking up a candle followed to light him to the house-door .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 45]: While Joe was absent on this errand , the elder Willet and his three companions continued to smoke with profound gravity , and in a deep silence , each having his eyes fixed on a huge copper boiler that was suspended over the fire .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 41]: After some time John Willet slowly shook his head , and thereupon his friends slowly shook theirs ; but no man withdrew his eyes from the boiler , or altered the solemn expression of his countenance in the slightest degree .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 26]: At length Joe returned -- very talkative and conciliatory , as though with a strong presentiment that he was going to be found fault with .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 9]: ` Such a thing as love is ! '
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 16]: he said , drawing a chair near the fire , and looking round for sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 17]: ` He has set off to walk to London , -- all the way to London .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 58]: His nag gone lame in riding out here this blessed afternoon , and comfortably littered down in our stable at this minute ; and he giving up a good hot supper and our best bed , because Miss Haredale has gone to a masquerade up in town , and he has set his heart upon seeing her !
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 43]: I do n't think I could persuade myself to do that , beautiful as she is , -- but then I 'm not in love -LRB- at least I do n't think I am -RRB- and that 's the whole difference . '
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 8]: ` He is in love then ? '
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 4]: said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 7]: ` Rather , ' replied Joe .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 17]: ` He 'll never be more in love , and may very easily be less . '
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 6]: ` Silence , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 4]: cried his father .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 10]: ` What a chap you are , Joe ! '
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 4]: said Long Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 7]: ` Such a inconsiderate lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 4]: murmured Tom Cobb .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 17]: ` Putting himself forward and wringing the very nose off his own father 's face ! '
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 6]: exclaimed the parish-clerk , metaphorically .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 7]: ` What HAVE I done ? '
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 4]: reasoned poor Joe .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 6]: ` Silence , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 40]: returned his father , ` what do you mean by talking , when you see people that are more than two or three times your age , sitting still and silent and not dreaming of saying a word ? '
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 17]: ` Why that 's the proper time for me to talk , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 4]: said Joe rebelliously .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 8]: ` The proper time , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 13]: retorted his father , ` the proper time 's no time . '
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 7]: ` Ah to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 23]: muttered Parkes , nodding gravely to the other two who nodded likewise , observing under their breaths that that was the point .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 31]: ` The proper time 's no time , sir , ' repeated John Willet ; ` when I was your age I never talked , I never wanted to talk .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 12]: I listened and improved myself that 's what I did . '
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 29]: ` And you 'd find your father rather a tough customer in argeyment , Joe , if anybody was to try and tackle him , ' said Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 11]: ` For the matter o ' that , Phil ! '
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 49]: observed Mr Willet , blowing a long , thin , spiral cloud of smoke out of the corner of his mouth , and staring at it abstractedly as it floated away ; ` For the matter o ' that , Phil , argeyment is a gift of Natur .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 86]: If Natur has gifted a man with powers of argeyment , a man has a right to make the best of 'em , and has not a right to stand on false delicacy , and deny that he is so gifted ; for that is a turning of his back on Natur , a flouting of her , a slighting of her precious caskets , and a proving of one 's self to be a swine that is n't worth her scattering pearls before . '
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 48]: The landlord pausing here for a very long time , Mr Parkes naturally concluded that he had brought his discourse to an end ; and therefore , turning to the young man with some austerity , exclaimed : ` You hear what your father says , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 18]: You would n't much like to tackle him in argeyment , I 'm thinking , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 80]: ` IF , ' said John Willet , turning his eyes from the ceiling to the face of his interrupter , and uttering the monosyllable in capitals , to apprise him that he had put in his oar , as the vulgar say , with unbecoming and irreverent haste ; ` IF , sir , Natur has fixed upon me the gift of argeyment , why should I not own to it , and rather glory in the same ?
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 12]: Yes , sir , I AM a tough customer that way .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 6]: You are right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 62]: My toughness has been proved , sir , in this room many and many a time , as I think you know ; and if you do n't know , ' added John , putting his pipe in his mouth again , ` so much the better , for I a n't proud and am not going to tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 43]: A general murmur from his three cronies , and a general shaking of heads at the copper boiler , assured John Willet that they had had good experience of his powers and needed no further evidence to assure them of his superiority .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 13]: John smoked with a little more dignity and surveyed them in silence .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 24]: ` It 's all very fine talking , ' muttered Joe , who had been fidgeting in his chair with divers uneasy gestures .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 24]: ` But if you mean to tell me that I 'm never to open my lips -- ' ` Silence , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 4]: roared his father .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 7]: ` No , you never are .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 10]: When your opinion 's wanted , you give it .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 9]: When you 're spoke to , you speak .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 25]: When your opinion 's not wanted and you 're not spoke to , do n't you give an opinion and do n't you speak .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 13]: The world 's undergone a nice alteration since my time , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 52]: My belief is that there a n't any boys left -- that there is n't such a thing as a boy -- that there 's nothing now between a male baby and a man -- and that all the boys went out with his blessed Majesty King George the Second . '
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 40]: ` That 's a very true observation , always excepting the young princes , ' said the parish-clerk , who , as the representative of church and state in that company , held himself bound to the nicest loyalty .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 37]: ` If it 's godly and righteous for boys , being of the ages of boys , to behave themselves like boys , then the young princes must be boys and can not be otherwise . '
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 12]: ` Did you ever hear tell of mermaids , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 4]: said Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 10]: ` Certainly I have , ' replied the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 9]: ` Very good , ' said Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 23]: ` According to the constitution of mermaids , so much of a mermaid as is not a woman must be a fish .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 31]: According to the constitution of young princes , so much of a young prince -LRB- if anything -RRB- as is not actually an angel , must be godly and righteous .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 44]: Therefore if it 's becoming and godly and righteous in the young princes -LRB- as it is at their ages -RRB- that they should be boys , they are and must be boys , and can not by possibility be anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 77]: This elucidation of a knotty point being received with such marks of approval as to put John Willet into a good humour , he contented himself with repeating to his son his command of silence , and addressing the stranger , said : ` If you had asked your questions of a grown-up person -- of me or any of these gentlemen -- you 'd have had some satisfaction , and would n't have wasted breath .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 10]: Miss Haredale is Mr Geoffrey Haredale 's niece . '
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 7]: ` Is her father alive ? '
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 6]: said the man , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 26]: ` No , ' rejoined the landlord , ` he is not alive , and he is not dead -- ' ` Not dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 15]: ` Not dead in a common sort of way , ' said the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 56]: The cronies nodded to each other , and Mr Parkes remarked in an undertone , shaking his head meanwhile as who should say , ` let no man contradict me , for I wo n't believe him , ' that John Willet was in amazing force to-night , and fit to tackle a Chief Justice .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 21]: The stranger suffered a short pause to elapse , and then asked abruptly , ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 14]: ` More than you think for , friend , ' returned John Willet .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 14]: ` Perhaps there 's more meaning in them words than you suspect . '
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 26]: ` Perhaps there is , ' said the strange man , gruffly ; ` but what the devil do you speak in such mysteries for ?
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 45]: You tell me , first , that a man is not alive , nor yet dead -- then , that he 's not dead in a common sort of way -- then , that you mean a great deal more than I think for .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 25]: To tell you the truth , you may do that easily ; for so far as I can make out , you mean nothing .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 10]: What DO you mean , I ask again ? '
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 36]: ` That , ' returned the landlord , a little brought down from his dignity by the stranger 's surliness , ` is a Maypole story , and has been any time these four-and-twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 8]: That story is Solomon Daisy 's story .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 28]: It belongs to the house ; and nobody but Solomon Daisy has ever told it under this roof , or ever shall -- that 's more . '
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 129]: The man glanced at the parish-clerk , whose air of consciousness and importance plainly betokened him to be the person referred to , and , observing that he had taken his pipe from his lips , after a very long whiff to keep it alight , and was evidently about to tell his story without further solicitation , gathered his large coat about him , and shrinking further back was almost lost in the gloom of the spacious chimney-corner , except when the flame , struggling from under a great faggot , whose weight almost crushed it for the time , shot upward with a strong and sudden glare , and illumining his figure for a moment , seemed afterwards to cast it into deeper obscurity than before .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 122]: By this flickering light , which made the old room , with its heavy timbers and panelled walls , look as if it were built of polished ebony -- the wind roaring and howling without , now rattling the latch and creaking the hinges of the stout oaken door , and now driving at the casement as though it would beat it in -- by this light , and under circumstances so auspicious , Solomon Daisy began his tale : ` It was Mr Reuben Haredale , Mr Geoffrey 's elder brother -- ' Here he came to a dead stop , and made so long a pause that even John Willet grew impatient and asked why he did not proceed .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 28]: ` Cobb , ' said Solomon Daisy , dropping his voice and appealing to the post-office keeper ; ` what day of the month is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 5]: ` The nineteenth . '
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 24]: ` Of March , ' said the clerk , bending forward , ` the nineteenth of March ; that 's very strange . '
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 92]: In a low voice they all acquiesced , and Solomon went on : ` It was Mr Reuben Haredale , Mr Geoffrey 's elder brother , that twenty-two years ago was the owner of the Warren , which , as Joe has said -- not that you remember it , Joe , for a boy like you ca n't do that , but because you have often heard me say so -- was then a much larger and better place , and a much more valuable property than it is now .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 32]: His lady was lately dead , and he was left with one child -- the Miss Haredale you have been inquiring about -- who was then scarcely a year old . '
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 55]: Although the speaker addressed himself to the man who had shown so much curiosity about this same family , and made a pause here as if expecting some exclamation of surprise or encouragement , the latter made no remark , nor gave any indication that he heard or was interested in what was said .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 46]: Solomon therefore turned to his old companions , whose noses were brightly illuminated by the deep red glow from the bowls of their pipes ; assured , by long experience , of their attention , and resolved to show his sense of such indecent behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 95]: ` Mr Haredale , ' said Solomon , turning his back upon the strange man , ` left this place when his lady died , feeling it lonely like , and went up to London , where he stopped some months ; but finding that place as lonely as this -- as I suppose and have always heard say -- he suddenly came back again with his little girl to the Warren , bringing with him besides , that day , only two women servants , and his steward , and a gardener . '
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 64]: Mr Daisy stopped to take a whiff at his pipe , which was going out , and then proceeded -- at first in a snuffling tone , occasioned by keen enjoyment of the tobacco and strong pulling at the pipe , and afterwards with increasing distinctness : ' -- Bringing with him two women servants , and his steward , and a gardener .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 15]: The rest stopped behind up in London , and were to follow next day .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 44]: It happened that that night , an old gentleman who lived at Chigwell Row , and had long been poorly , deceased , and an order came to me at half after twelve o'clock at night to go and toll the passing-bell . '
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 37]: There was a movement in the little group of listeners , sufficiently indicative of the strong repugnance any one of them would have felt to have turned out at such a time upon such an errand .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 13]: The clerk felt and understood it , and pursued his theme accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 59]: ` It WAS a dreary thing , especially as the grave-digger was laid up in his bed , from long working in a damp soil and sitting down to take his dinner on cold tombstones , and I was consequently under obligation to go alone , for it was too late to hope to get any other companion .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 49]: However , I was n't unprepared for it ; as the old gentleman had often made it a request that the bell should be tolled as soon as possible after the breath was out of his body , and he had been expected to go for some days .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 44]: I put as good a face upon it as I could , and muffling myself up -LRB- for it was mortal cold -RRB- , started out with a lighted lantern in one hand and the key of the church in the other . '
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 25]: At this point of the narrative , the dress of the strange man rustled as if he had turned himself to hear more distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 23]: Slightly pointing over his shoulder , Solomon elevated his eyebrows and nodded a silent inquiry to Joe whether this was the case .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 25]: Joe shaded his eyes with his hand and peered into the corner , but could make out nothing , and so shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 71]: ` It was just such a night as this ; blowing a hurricane , raining heavily , and very dark -- I often think now , darker than I ever saw it before or since ; that may be my fancy , but the houses were all close shut and the folks in doors , and perhaps there is only one other man who knows how dark it really was .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 62]: I got into the church , chained the door back so that it should keep ajar -- for , to tell the truth , I did n't like to be shut in there alone -- and putting my lantern on the stone seat in the little corner where the bell-rope is , sat down beside it to trim the candle . '
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 30]: I sat down to trim the candle , and when I had done so I could not persuade myself to get up again , and go about my work .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 61]: I do n't know how it was , but I thought of all the ghost stories I had ever heard , even those that I had heard when I was a boy at school , and had forgotten long ago ; and they did n't come into my mind one after another , but all crowding at once , like .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 53]: I recollected one story there was in the village , how that on a certain night in the year -LRB- it might be that very night for anything I knew -RRB- , all the dead people came out of the ground and sat at the heads of their own graves till morning .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 46]: This made me think how many people I had known , were buried between the church-door and the churchyard gate , and what a dreadful thing it would be to have to pass among them and know them again , so earthy and unlike themselves .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 50]: I had known all the niches and arches in the church from a child ; still , I could n't persuade myself that those were their natural shadows which I saw on the pavement , but felt sure there were some ugly figures hiding among 'em and peeping out .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 56]: Thinking on in this way , I began to think of the old gentleman who was just dead , and I could have sworn , as I looked up the dark chancel , that I saw him in his usual place , wrapping his shroud about him and shivering as if he felt it cold .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 15]: All this time I sat listening and listening , and hardly dared to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 13]: At length I started up and took the bell-rope in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 22]: At that minute there rang -- not that bell , for I had hardly touched the rope -- but another ! '
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 16]: I heard the ringing of another bell , and a deep bell too , plainly .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 22]: It was only for an instant , and even then the wind carried the sound away , but I heard it .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 13]: I listened for a long time , but it rang no more .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 29]: I had heard of corpse candles , and at last I persuaded myself that this must be a corpse bell tolling of itself at midnight for the dead .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 31]: I tolled my bell -- how , or how long , I do n't know -- and ran home to bed as fast as I could touch the ground . '
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 19]: I was up early next morning after a restless night , and told the story to my neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 19]: Some were serious and some made light of it ; I do n't think anybody believed it real .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 55]: But , that morning , Mr Reuben Haredale was found murdered in his bedchamber ; and in his hand was a piece of the cord attached to an alarm-bell outside the roof , which hung in his room and had been cut asunder , no doubt by the murderer , when he seized it .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 9]: ` That was the bell I heard . '
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 33]: A bureau was found opened , and a cash-box , which Mr Haredale had brought down that day , and was supposed to contain a large sum of money , was gone .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 27]: The steward and gardener were both missing and both suspected for a long time , but they were never found , though hunted far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 66]: And far enough they might have looked for poor Mr Rudge the steward , whose body -- scarcely to be recognised by his clothes and the watch and ring he wore -- was found , months afterwards , at the bottom of a piece of water in the grounds , with a deep gash in the breast where he had been stabbed with a knife .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 41]: He was only partly dressed ; and people all agreed that he had been sitting up reading in his own room , where there were many traces of blood , and was suddenly fallen upon and killed before his master .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 33]: Everybody now knew that the gardener must be the murderer , and though he has never been heard of from that day to this , he will be , mark my words .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 22]: The crime was committed this day two-and-twenty years -- on the nineteenth of March , one thousand seven hundred and fifty-three .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 67]: On the nineteenth of March in some year -- no matter when -- I know it , I am sure of it , for we have always , in some strange way or other , been brought back to the subject on that day ever since -- on the nineteenth of March in some year , sooner or later , that man will be discovered . '
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 8]: Chapter 2 ' A strange story ! '
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 12]: said the man who had been the cause of the narration .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 12]: -- ` Stranger still if it comes about as you predict .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 5]: Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 12]: A question so unexpected , nettled Solomon Daisy not a little .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 51]: By dint of relating the story very often , and ornamenting it -LRB- according to village report -RRB- with a few flourishes suggested by the various hearers from time to time , he had come by degrees to tell it with great effect ; and ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 12]: after the climax , was not what he was accustomed to .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 12]: he repeated , ` yes , that 's all , sir .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 9]: And enough too , I think . ' '
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 5]: I think so too .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 6]: My horse , young man !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 22]: He is but a hack hired from a roadside posting house , but he must carry me to London to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 4]: ` To-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 8]: ` To-night , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 7]: ` What do you stare at ?
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 20]: This tavern would seem to be a house of call for all the gaping idlers of the neighbourhood ! '
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 41]: At this remark , which evidently had reference to the scrutiny he had undergone , as mentioned in the foregoing chapter , the eyes of John Willet and his friends were diverted with marvellous rapidity to the copper boiler again .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 42]: Not so with Joe , who , being a mettlesome fellow , returned the stranger 's angry glance with a steady look , and rejoined : ` It is not a very bold thing to wonder at your going on to-night .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 21]: Surely you have been asked such a harmless question in an inn before , and in better weather than this .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 18]: I thought you might n't know the way , as you seem strange to this part . '
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 11]: ` The way -- ' repeated the other , irritably .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 6]: DO you know it ? '
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 6]: ` I 'll -- humph !
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 20]: -- I 'll find it , ' replied the nian , waving his hand and turning on his heel .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 9]: ` Landlord , take the reckoning here . '
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 71]: John Willet did as he was desired ; for on that point he was seldom slow , except in the particulars of giving change , and testing the goodness of any piece of coin that was proffered to him , by the application of his teeth or his tongue , or some other test , or in doubtful cases , by a long series of tests terminating in its rejection .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 37]: The guest then wrapped his garments about him so as to shelter himself as effectually as he could from the rough weather , and without any word or sign of farewell betook himself to the stableyard .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 34]: Here Joe -LRB- who had left the room on the conclusion of their short dialogue -RRB- was protecting himself and the horse from the rain under the shelter of an old penthouse roof .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 20]: ` He 's pretty much of my opinion , ' said Joe , patting the horse upon the neck .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 20]: ` I 'll wager that your stopping here to-night would please him better than it would please me . '
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 27]: ` He and I are of different opinions , as we have been more than once on our way here , ' was the short reply .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 21]: ` So I was thinking before you came out , for he has felt your spurs , poor beast . '
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 14]: The stranger adjusted his coat-collar about his face , and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 30]: ` You 'll know me again , I see , ' he said , marking the young fellow 's earnest gaze , when he had sprung into the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 39]: ` The man 's worth knowing , master , who travels a road he do n't know , mounted on a jaded horse , and leaves good quarters to do it on such a night as this . '
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 14]: ` You have sharp eyes and a sharp tongue , I find . '
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 19]: ` Both I hope by nature , but the last grows rusty sometimes for want of using . '
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 22]: ` Use the first less too , and keep their sharpness for your sweethearts , boy , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 85]: So saying he shook his hand from the bridle , struck him roughly on the head with the butt end of his whip , and galloped away ; dashing through the mud and darkness with a headlong speed , which few badly mounted horsemen would have cared to venture , even had they been thoroughly acquainted with the country ; and which , to one who knew nothing of the way he rode , was attended at every step with great hazard and danger .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 25]: The roads , even within twelve miles of London , were at that time ill paved , seldom repaired , and very badly made .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 35]: The way this rider traversed had been ploughed up by the wheels of heavy waggons , and rendered rotten by the frosts and thaws of the preceding winter , or possibly of many winters .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 61]: Great holes and gaps had been worn into the soil , which , being now filled with water from the late rains , were not easily distinguishable even by day ; and a plunge into any one of them might have brought down a surer-footed horse than the poor beast now urged forward to the utmost extent of his powers .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 35]: Sharp flints and stones rolled from under his hoofs continually ; the rider could scarcely see beyond the animal 's head , or farther on either side than his own arm would have extended .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 52]: At that time , too , all the roads in the neighbourhood of the metropolis were infested by footpads or highwaymen , and it was a night , of all others , in which any evil-disposed person of this class might have pursued his unlawful calling with little fear of detection .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 42]: Still , the traveller dashed forward at the same reckless pace , regardless alike of the dirt and wet which flew about his head , the profound darkness of the night , and the probability of encountering some desperate characters abroad .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 50]: At every turn and angle , even where a deviation from the direct course might have been least expected , and could not possibly be seen until he was close upon it , he guided the bridle with an unerring hand , and kept the middle of the road .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 39]: Thus he sped onward , raising himself in the stirrups , leaning his body forward until it almost touched the horse 's neck , and flourishing his heavy whip above his head with the fervour of a madman .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 49]: There are times when , the elements being in unusual commotion , those who are bent on daring enterprises , or agitated by great thoughts , whether of good or evil , feel a mysterious sympathy with the tumult of nature , and are roused into corresponding violence .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 36]: In the midst of thunder , lightning , and storm , many tremendous deeds have been committed ; men , self-possessed before , have given a sudden loose to passions they could no longer control .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 48]: The demons of wrath and despair have striven to emulate those who ride the whirlwind and direct the storm ; and man , lashed into madness with the roaring winds and boiling waters , has become for the time as wild and merciless as the elements themselves .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 114]: Whether the traveller was possessed by thoughts which the fury of the night had heated and stimulated into a quicker current , or was merely impelled by some strong motive to reach his journey 's end , on he swept more like a hunted phantom than a man , nor checked his pace until , arriving at some cross roads , one of which led by a longer route to the place whence he had lately started , he bore down so suddenly upon a vehicle which was coming towards him , that in the effort to avoid it he well-nigh pulled his horse upon his haunches , and narrowly escaped being thrown .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 4]: ` Yoho ! '
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 7]: cried the voice of a man .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 5]: ` What 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 6]: Who goes there ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 4]: A friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 5]: replied the traveller . '
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 4]: A friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 4]: repeated the voice .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 45]: ` Who calls himself a friend and rides like that , abusing Heaven 's gifts in the shape of horseflesh , and endangering , not only his own neck -LRB- which might be no great matter -RRB- but the necks of other people ? '
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 24]: ` You have a lantern there , I see , ' said the traveller dismounting , ` lend it me for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 16]: You have wounded my horse , I think , with your shaft or wheel . '
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 5]: ` Wounded him ! '
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 19]: cried the other , ` if I have n't killed him , it 's no fault of yours .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 17]: What do you mean by galloping along the king 's highway like that , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 36]: ` Give me the light , ' returned the traveller , snatching it from his hand , ` and do n't ask idle questions of a man who is in no mood for talking . '
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 30]: ` If you had said you were in no mood for talking before , I should perhaps have been in no mood for lighting , ' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 38]: ` Hows ` ever as it 's the poor horse that 's damaged and not you , one of you is welcome to the light at all events -- but it 's not the crusty one . '
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 28]: The traveller returned no answer to this speech , but holding the light near to his panting and reeking beast , examined him in limb and carcass .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 37]: Meanwhile , the other man sat very composedly in his vehicle , which was a kind of chaise with a depository for a large bag of tools , and watched his proceedings with a careful eye .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 34]: The looker-on was a round , red-faced , sturdy yeoman , with a double chin , and a voice husky with good living , good sleeping , good humour , and good health .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 63]: He was past the prime of life , but Father Time is not always a hard parent , and , though he tarries for none of his children , often lays his hand lightly upon those who have used him well ; making them old men and women inexorably enough , but leaving their hearts and spirits young and in full vigour .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 37]: With such people the grey head is but the impression of the old fellow 's hand in giving them his blessing , and every wrinkle but a notch in the quiet calendar of a well-spent life .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 43]: The person whom the traveller had so abruptly encountered was of this kind : bluff , hale , hearty , and in a green old age : at peace with himself , and evidently disposed to be so with all the world .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 81]: Although muffled up in divers coats and handkerchiefs -- one of which , passed over his crown , and tied in a convenient crease of his double chin , secured his three-cornered hat and bob-wig from blowing off his head -- there was no disguising his plump and comfortable figure ; neither did certain dirty finger-marks upon his face give it any other than an odd and comical expression , through which its natural good humour shone with undiminished lustre .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 21]: ` He is not hurt , ' said the traveller at length , raising his head and the lantern together .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 13]: ` You have found that out at last , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 5]: rejoined the old man .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 19]: ` My eyes have seen more light than yours , but I would n't change with you . '
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 3]: ` Mean !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 14]: I could have told you he was n't hurt , five minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 19]: Give me the light , friend ; ride forward at a gentler pace ; and good night . '
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 19]: In handing up the lantern , the man necessarily cast its rays full on the speaker 's face .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 7]: Their eyes met at the instant .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 11]: He suddenly dropped it and crushed it with his foot .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 22]: ` Did you never see a locksmith before , that you start as if you had come upon a ghost ? '
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 38]: cried the old man in the chaise , ` or is this , ' he added hastily , thrusting his hand into the tool basket and drawing out a hammer , ' a scheme for robbing me ?
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 7]: I know these roads , friend .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 22]: When I travel them , I carry nothing but a few shillings , and not a crown 's worth of them .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 47]: I tell you plainly , to save us both trouble , that there 's nothing to be got from me but a pretty stout arm considering my years , and this tool , which , mayhap from long acquaintance with , I can use pretty briskly .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 21]: You shall not have it all your own way , I promise you , if you play at that game .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 10]: With these words he stood upon the defensive . '
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 17]: I am not what you take me for , Gabriel Varden , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 9]: ` Then what and who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 4]: returned the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 9]: ` You know my name , it seems .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 7]: Let me know yours . ' '
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 32]: I have not gained the information from any confidence of yours , but from the inscription on your cart which tells it to all the town , ' replied the traveller .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 31]: ` You have better eyes for that than you had for your horse , then , ' said Varden , descending nimbly from his chaise ; ` who are you ?
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 7]: Let me see your face . '
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 40]: While the locksmith alighted , the traveller had regained his saddle , from which he now confronted the old man , who , moving as the horse moved in chafing under the tightened rein , kept close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 11]: ` Let me see your face , I say . '
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 5]: ` Stand off ! '
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 32]: ` No masquerading tricks , ' said the locksmith , ` and tales at the club to-morrow , how Gabriel Varden was frightened by a surly voice and a dark night .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 9]: Stand -- let me see your face . '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 38]: Finding that further resistance would only involve him in a personal struggle with an antagonist by no means to be despised , the traveller threw back his coat , and stooping down looked steadily at the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: Perhaps two men more powerfully contrasted , never opposed each other face to face .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 57]: The ruddy features of the locksmith so set off and heightened the excessive paleness of the man on horseback , that he looked like a bloodless ghost , while the moisture , which hard riding had brought out upon his skin , hung there in dark and heavy drops , like dews of agony and death .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 44]: The countenance of the old locksmith lighted up with the smile of one expecting to detect in this unpromising stranger some latent roguery of eye or lip , which should reveal a familiar person in that arch disguise , and spoil his jest .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 65]: The face of the other , sullen and fierce , but shrinking too , was that of a man who stood at bay ; while his firmly closed jaws , his puckered mouth , and more than all a certain stealthy motion of the hand within his breast , seemed to announce a desperate purpose very foreign to acting , or child 's play .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 12]: Thus they regarded each other for some time , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 17]: he said when he had scanned his features ; ' I do n't know you . '
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 7]: ` Do n't desire to ? '
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 11]: -- returned the other , muffling himself as before . '
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 30]: I do n't , ' said Gabriel ; ` to be plain with you , friend , you do n't carry in your countenance a letter of recommendation . '
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 12]: ` It 's not my wish , ' said the traveller .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 9]: ` My humour is to be avoided . '
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 20]: ` Well , ' said the locksmith bluntly , ' I think you 'll have your humour . ' '
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 12]: I will , at any cost , ' rejoined the traveller .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 54]: ` In proof of it , lay this to heart -- that you were never in such peril of your life as you have been within these few moments ; when you are within five minutes of breathing your last , you will not be nearer death than you have been to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 5]: said the sturdy locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 6]: and a violent death . '
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 6]: ` From whose hand ? '
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 9]: ` From mine , ' replied the traveller .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 69]: With that he put spurs to his horse , and rode away ; at first plashing heavily through the mire at a smart trot , but gradually increasing in speed until the last sound of his horse 's hoofs died away upon the wind ; when he was again hurrying on at the same furious gallop , which had been his pace when the locksmith first encountered him .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 63]: Gabriel Varden remained standing in the road with the broken lantern in his hand , listening in stupefied silence until no sound reached his ear but the moaning of the wind , and the fast-falling rain ; when he struck himself one or two smart blows in the breast by way of rousing himself , and broke into an exclamation of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 12]: ` What in the name of wonder can this fellow be !
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 3]: a madman ?
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 3]: a highwayman ?
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 3]: a cut-throat ?
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 32]: If he had not scoured off so fast , we 'd have seen who was in most danger , he or I. I never nearer death than I have been to-night !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 31]: I hope I may be no nearer to it for a score of years to come -- if so , I 'll be content to be no farther from it .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 3]: My stars !
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 15]: -- a pretty brag this to a stout man -- pooh , pooh ! '
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 34]: Gabriel resumed his seat , and looked wistfully up the road by which the traveller had come ; murmuring in a half whisper : ` The Maypole -- two miles to the Maypole .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 43]: I came the other road from the Warren after a long day 's work at locks and bells , on purpose that I should not come by the Maypole and break my promise to Martha by looking in -- there 's resolution !
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 46]: It would be dangerous to go on to London without a light ; and it 's four miles , and a good half mile besides , to the Halfway-House ; and between this and that is the very place where one needs a light most .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 6]: Two miles to the Maypole !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 23]: I told Martha I would n't ; I said I would n't , and I did n't -- there 's resolution ! '
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 55]: Repeating these two last words very often , as if to compensate for the little resolution he was going to show by piquing himself on the great resolution he had shown , Gabriel Varden quietly turned back , determining to get a light at the Maypole , and to take nothing but a light .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 138]: When he got to the Maypole , however , and Joe , responding to his well-known hail , came running out to the horse 's head , leaving the door open behind him , and disclosing a delicious perspective of warmth and brightness -- when the ruddy gleam of the fire , streaming through the old red curtains of the common room , seemed to bring with it , as part of itself , a pleasant hum of voices , and a fragrant odour of steaming grog and rare tobacco , all steeped as it were in the cheerful glow -- when the shadows , flitting across the curtain , showed that those inside had risen from their snug seats , and were making room in the snuggest corner -LRB- how well he knew that corner ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 94]: for the honest locksmith , and a broad glare , suddenly streaming up , bespoke the goodness of the crackling log from which a brilliant train of sparks was doubtless at that moment whirling up the chimney in honour of his coming -- when , superadded to these enticements , there stole upon him from the distant kitchen a gentle sound of frying , with a musical clatter of plates and dishes , and a savoury smell that made even the boisterous wind a perfume -- Gabriel felt his firmness oozing rapidly away .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 20]: He tried to look stoically at the tavern , but his features would relax into a look of fondness .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 30]: He turned his head the other way , and the cold black country seemed to frown him off , and drive him for a refuge into its hospitable arms .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 19]: ` The merciful man , Joe , ' said the locksmith , ` is merciful to his beast .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 10]: I 'll get out for a little while . '
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 9]: And how natural it was to get out !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 100]: And how unnatural it seemed for a sober man to be plodding wearily along through miry roads , encountering the rude buffets of the wind and pelting of the rain , when there was a clean floor covered with crisp white sand , a well swept hearth , a blazing fire , a table decorated with white cloth , bright pewter flagons , and other tempting preparations for a well-cooked meal -- when there were these things , and company disposed to make the most of them , all ready to his hand , and entreating him to enjoyment !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 82]: Chapter 3 Such were the locksmith 's thoughts when first seated in the snug corner , and slowly recovering from a pleasant defect of vision -- pleasant , because occasioned by the wind blowing in his eyes -- which made it a matter of sound policy and duty to himself , that he should take refuge from the weather , and tempted him , for the same reason , to aggravate a slight cough , and declare he felt but poorly .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 58]: Such were still his thoughts more than a full hour afterwards , when , supper over , he still sat with shining jovial face in the same warm nook , listening to the cricket-like chirrup of little Solomon Daisy , and bearing no unimportant or slightly respected part in the social gossip round the Maypole fire . '
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 56]: I wish he may be an honest man , that 's all , ' said Solomon , winding up a variety of speculations relative to the stranger , concerning whom Gabriel had compared notes with the company , and so raised a grave discussion ; ' I wish he may be an honest man . '
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 14]: ` So we all do , I suppose , do n't we ? '
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 5]: observed the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 8]: I do n't , ' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 3]: cried Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 34]: He struck me with his whip , the coward , when he was mounted and I afoot , and I should be better pleased that he turned out what I think him . '
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 10]: ` And what may that be , Joe ? '
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 7]: ` No good , Mr Varden .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 45]: You may shake your head , father , but I say no good , and will say no good , and I would say no good a hundred times over , if that would bring him back to have the drubbing he deserves . '
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 13]: ` Hold your tongue , sir , ' said John Willet . '
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 6]: I wo n't , father .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 15]: It 's all along of you that he ventured to do what he did .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 43]: Seeing me treated like a child , and put down like a fool , HE plucks up a heart and has a fling at a fellow that he thinks -- and may well think too -- has n't a grain of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 23]: But he 's mistaken , as I 'll show him , and as I 'll show all of you before long . '
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 13]: ` Does the boy know what he 's a saying of ! '
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 6]: cried the astonished John Willet .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 27]: ` Father , ' returned Joe , ' I know what I say and mean , well -- better than you do when you hear me .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 31]: I can bear with you , but I can not bear the contempt that your treating me in the way you do , brings upon me from others every day .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 9]: Look at other young men of my age .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 13]: Have they no liberty , no will , no right to speak ?
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 22]: Are they obliged to sit mumchance , and to be ordered about till they are the laughing-stock of young and old ?
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 78]: I am a bye-word all over Chigwell , and I say -- and it 's fairer my saying so now , than waiting till you are dead , and I have got your money -- I say , that before long I shall be driven to break such bounds , and that when I do , it wo n't be me that you 'll have to blame , but your own self , and no other . '
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 49]: John Willet was so amazed by the exasperation and boldness of his hopeful son , that he sat as one bewildered , staring in a ludicrous manner at the boiler , and endeavouring , but quite ineffectually , to collect his tardy thoughts , and invent an answer .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 45]: The guests , scarcely less disturbed , were equally at a loss ; and at length , with a variety of muttered , half-expressed condolences , and pieces of advice , rose to depart ; being at the same time slightly muddled with liquor .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 70]: The honest locksmith alone addressed a few words of coherent and sensible advice to both parties , urging John Willet to remember that Joe was nearly arrived at man 's estate , and should not be ruled with too tight a hand , and exhorting Joe himself to bear with his father 's caprices , and rather endeavour to turn them aside by temperate remonstrance than by ill-timed rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 10]: This advice was received as such advice usually is .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 53]: On John Willet it made almost as much impression as on the sign outside the door , while Joe , who took it in the best part , avowed himself more obliged than he could well express , but politely intimated his intention nevertheless of taking his own course uninfluenced by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 68]: ` You have always been a very good friend to me , Mr Varden , ' he said , as they stood without , in the porch , and the locksmith was equipping himself for his journey home ; ' I take it very kind of you to say all this , but the time 's nearly come when the Maypole and I must part company . '
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 13]: ` Roving stones gather no moss , Joe , ' said Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 9]: ` Nor milestones much , ' replied Joe .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 18]: ` I 'm little better than one here , and see as much of the world . '
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 11]: ` Then , what would you do , Joe ? '
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 9]: pursued the locksmith , stroking his chin reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 6]: ` What could you be ?
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 10]: Where could you go , you see ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 11]: I must trust to chance , Mr Varden . ' '
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 9]: A bad thing to trust to , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 45]: I always tell my girl when we talk about a husband for her , never to trust to chance , but to make sure beforehand that she has a good man and true , and then chance will neither make her nor break her .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 9]: What are you fidgeting about there , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 10]: Nothing gone in the harness , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 32]: ` No no , ' said Joe -- finding , however , something very engrossing to do in the way of strapping and buckling -- ` Miss Dolly quite well ? '
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 5]: ` Hearty , thankye .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 13]: She looks pretty enough to be well , and good too . '
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 19]: ` She 's always both , sir ' -- ` So she is , thank God ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 52]: I hope , ' said Joe after some hesitation , ` that you wo n't tell this story against me -- this of my having been beat like the boy they 'd make of me -- at all events , till I have met this man again and settled the account .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 9]: It 'll be a better story then . '
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 10]: ` Why who should I tell it to ? '
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 3]: returned Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 23]: ` They know it here , and I 'm not likely to come across anybody else who would care about it . '
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 16]: ` That 's true enough , ' said the young fellow with a sigh . '
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 5]: I quite forgot that .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 7]: Yes , that 's true ! '
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 53]: So saying , he raised his face , which was very red , -- no doubt from the exertion of strapping and buckling as aforesaid , -- and giving the reins to the old man , who had by this time taken his seat , sighed again and bade him good night .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 3]: cried Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 25]: ` Now think better of what we have just been speaking of ; and do n't be rash , there 's a good fellow !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 16]: I have an interest in you , and would n't have you cast yourself away .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 35]: Returning his cheery farewell with cordial goodwill , Joe Willet lingered until the sound of wheels ceased to vibrate in his ears , and then , shaking his head mournfully , re-entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 51]: Gabriel Varden went his way towards London , thinking of a great many things , and most of all of flaming terms in which to relate his adventure , and so account satisfactorily to Mrs Varden for visiting the Maypole , despite certain solemn covenants between himself and that lady .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 24]: Thinking begets , not only thought , but drowsiness occasionally , and the more the locksmith thought , the more sleepy he became .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 90]: A man may be very sober -- or at least firmly set upon his legs on that neutral ground which lies between the confines of perfect sobriety and slight tipsiness -- and yet feel a strong tendency to mingle up present circumstances with others which have no manner of connection with them ; to confound all consideration of persons , things , times , and places ; and to jumble his disjointed thoughts together in a kind of mental kaleidoscope , producing combinations as unexpected as they are transitory .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 44]: This was Gabriel Varden 's state , as , nodding in his dog sleep , and leaving his horse to pursue a road with which he was well acquainted , he got over the ground unconsciously , and drew nearer and nearer home .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 27]: He had roused himself once , when the horse stopped until the turnpike gate was opened , and had cried a lusty ` good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 46]: to the toll-keeper ; but then he awoke out of a dream about picking a lock in the stomach of the Great Mogul , and even when he did wake , mixed up the turnpike man with his mother-in-law who had been dead twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 23]: It is not surprising , therefore , that he soon relapsed , and jogged heavily along , quite insensible to his progress .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 49]: And , now , he approached the great city , which lay outstretched before him like a dark shadow on the ground , reddening the sluggish air with a deep dull light , that told of labyrinths of public ways and shops , and swarms of busy people .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 23]: Approaching nearer and nearer yet , this halo began to fade , and the causes which produced it slowly to develop themselves .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 75]: Long lines of poorly lighted streets might be faintly traced , with here and there a lighter spot , where lamps were clustered round a square or market , or round some great building ; after a time these grew more distinct , and the lamps themselves were visible ; slight yellow specks , that seemed to be rapidly snuffed out , one by one , as intervening obstacles hid them from the sight .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 90]: Then , sounds arose -- the striking of church clocks , the distant bark of dogs , the hum of traffic in the streets ; then outlines might be traced -- tall steeples looming in the air , and piles of unequal roofs oppressed by chimneys ; then , the noise swelled into a louder sound , and forms grew more distinct and numerous still , and London -- visible in the darkness by its own faint light , and not by that of Heaven -- was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 38]: The locksmith , however , all unconscious of its near vicinity , still jogged on , half sleeping and half waking , when a loud cry at no great distance ahead , roused him with a start .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 69]: For a moment or two he looked about him like a man who had been transported to some strange country in his sleep , but soon recognising familiar objects , rubbed his eyes lazily and might have relapsed again , but that the cry was repeated -- not once or twice or thrice , but many times , and each time , if possible , with increased vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 34]: Thoroughly aroused , Gabriel , who was a bold man and not easily daunted , made straight to the spot , urging on his stout little horse as if for life or death .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 77]: The matter indeed looked sufficiently serious , for , coming to the place whence the cries had proceeded , he descried the figure of a man extended in an apparently lifeless state upon the pathway , and , hovering round him , another person with a torch in his hand , which he waved in the air with a wild impatience , redoubling meanwhile those cries for help which had brought the locksmith to the spot .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 8]: ` What 's here to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 7]: said the old man , alighting .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 10]: ` How 's this -- what -- Barnaby ? '
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 38]: The bearer of the torch shook his long loose hair back from his eyes , and thrusting his face eagerly into that of the locksmith , fixed upon him a look which told his history at once .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 8]: ` You know me , Barnaby ? '
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 3]: said Varden .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 63]: He nodded -- not once or twice , but a score of times , and that with a fantastic exaggeration which would have kept his head in motion for an hour , but that the locksmith held up his finger , and fixing his eye sternly upon him caused him to desist ; then pointed to the body with an inquiring look .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 14]: ` There 's blood upon him , ' said Barnaby with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 7]: ` It makes me sick ! '
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 7]: ` How came it there ? '
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 3]: demanded Varden .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 8]: ` Steel , steel , steel ! '
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 14]: he replied fiercely , imitating with his hand the thrust of a sword .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 6]: ` Is he robbed ? '
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 4]: said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 19]: Barnaby caught him by the arm , and nodded ` Yes ; ' then pointed towards the city .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 31]: said the old man , bending over the body and looking round as he spoke into Barnaby 's pale face , strangely lighted up by something that was NOT intellect .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 11]: ` The robber made off that way , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 10]: Well , well , never mind that just now .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 13]: Hold your torch this way -- a little farther off -- so .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 15]: Now stand quiet , while I try to see what harm is done . '
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 55]: With these words , he applied himself to a closer examination of the prostrate form , while Barnaby , holding the torch as he had been directed , looked on in silence , fascinated by interest or curiosity , but repelled nevertheless by some strong and secret horror which convulsed him in every nerve .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 43]: As he stood , at that moment , half shrinking back and half bending forward , both his face and figure were full in the strong glare of the link , and as distinctly revealed as though it had been broad day .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 20]: He was about three-and-twenty years old , and though rather spare , of a fair height and strong make .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 52]: His hair , of which he had a great profusion , was red , and hanging in disorder about his face and shoulders , gave to his restless looks an expression quite unearthly -- enhanced by the paleness of his complexion , and the glassy lustre of his large protruding eyes .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 24]: Startling as his aspect was , the features were good , and there was something even plaintive in his wan and haggard aspect .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 32]: But , the absence of the soul is far more terrible in a living man than in a dead one ; and in this unfortunate being its noblest powers were wanting .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 41]: His dress was of green , clumsily trimmed here and there -- apparently by his own hands -- with gaudy lace ; brightest where the cloth was most worn and soiled , and poorest where it was at the best .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 17]: A pair of tawdry ruffles dangled at his wrists , while his throat was nearly bare .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 28]: He had ornamented his hat with a cluster of peacock 's feathers , but they were limp and broken , and now trailed negligently down his back .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 35]: Girt to his side was the steel hilt of an old sword without blade or scabbard ; and some particoloured ends of ribands and poor glass toys completed the ornamental portion of his attire .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 52]: The fluttered and confused disposition of all the motley scraps that formed his dress , bespoke , in a scarcely less degree than his eager and unsettled manner , the disorder of his mind , and by a grotesque contrast set off and heightened the more impressive wildness of his face .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 39]: ` Barnaby , ' said the locksmith , after a hasty but careful inspection , ` this man is not dead , but he has a wound in his side , and is in a fainting-fit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 9]: I know him , I know him ! '
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 7]: cried Barnaby , clapping his hands .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 5]: ` Know him ? '
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 4]: repeated the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 10]: said Barnaby , laying his fingers upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 8]: ` He went out to-day a wooing .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 47]: I would n't for a light guinea that he should never go a wooing again , for , if he did , some eyes would grow dim that are now as bright as -- see , when I talk of eyes , the stars come out !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 5]: Whose eyes are they ?
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 29]: If they are angels ' eyes , why do they look down here and see good men hurt , and only wink and sparkle all the night ? '
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 21]: ` Now Heaven help this silly fellow , ' murmured the perplexed locksmith ; ` can he know this gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 22]: His mother 's house is not far off ; I had better see if she can tell me who he is .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 23]: Barnaby , my man , help me to put him in the chaise , and we 'll ride home together . ' '
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 7]: I ca n't touch him ! '
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 19]: cried the idiot falling back , and shuddering as with a strong spasm ; he 's bloody ! '
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 29]: ` It 's in his nature , I know , ' muttered the locksmith , ` it 's cruel to ask him , but I must have help .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 39]: Barnaby -- good Barnaby -- dear Barnaby -- if you know this gentleman , for the sake of his life and everybody 's life that loves him , help me to raise him and lay him down . '
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 23]: ` Cover him then , wrap him close -- do n't let me see it -- smell it -- hear the word .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 10]: Do n't speak the word -- do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 9]: ` No , no , I 'll not .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 9]: There , you see he 's covered now .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 2]: Gently .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: Well done , well done ! '
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 40]: They placed him in the carriage with great ease , for Barnaby was strong and active , but all the time they were so occupied he shivered from head to foot , and evidently experienced an ecstasy of terror .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 74]: This accomplished , and the wounded man being covered with Varden 's own greatcoat which he took off for the purpose , they proceeded onward at a brisk pace : Barnaby gaily counting the stars upon his fingers , and Gabriel inwardly congratulating himself upon having an adventure now , which would silence Mrs Varden on the subject of the Maypole , for that night , or there was no faith in woman .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 136]: Chapter 4 In the venerable suburb -- it was a suburb once -- of Clerkenwell , towards that part of its confines which is nearest to the Charter House , and in one of those cool , shady Streets , of which a few , widely scattered and dispersed , yet remain in such old parts of the metropolis , -- each tenement quietly vegetating like an ancient citizen who long ago retired from business , and dozing on in its infirmity until in course of time it tumbles down , and is replaced by some extravagant young heir , flaunting in stucco and ornamental work , and all the vanities of modern days , -- in this quarter , and in a street of this description , the business of the present chapter lies .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 27]: At the time of which it treats , though only six-and-sixty years ago , a very large part of what is London now had no existence .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 40]: Even in the brains of the wildest speculators , there had sprung up no long rows of streets connecting Highgate with Whitechapel , no assemblages of palaces in the swampy levels , nor little cities in the open fields .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 26]: Although this part of town was then , as now , parcelled out in streets , and plentifully peopled , it wore a different aspect .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 36]: There were gardens to many of the houses , and trees by the pavement side ; with an air of freshness breathing up and down , which in these days would be sought in vain .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 27]: Fields were nigh at hand , through which the New River took its winding course , and where there was merry haymaking in the summer time .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 87]: Nature was not so far removed , or hard to get at , as in these days ; and although there were busy trades in Clerkenwell , and working jewellers by scores , it was a purer place , with farm-houses nearer to it than many modern Londoners would readily believe , and lovers ' walks at no great distance , which turned into squalid courts , long before the lovers of this age were born , or , as the phrase goes , thought of .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 54]: In one of these streets , the cleanest of them all , and on the shady side of the way -- for good housewives know that sunlight damages their cherished furniture , and so choose the shade rather than its intrusive glare -- there stood the house with which we have to deal .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 66]: It was a modest building , not very straight , not large , not tall ; not bold-faced , with great staring windows , but a shy , blinking house , with a conical roof going up into a peak over its garret window of four small panes of glass , like a cocked hat on the head of an elderly gentleman with one eye .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 49]: It was not built of brick or lofty stone , but of wood and plaster ; it was not planned with a dull and wearisome regard to regularity , for no one window matched the other , or seemed to have the slightest reference to anything besides itself .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 38]: The shop -- for it had a shop -- was , with reference to the first floor , where shops usually are ; and there all resemblance between it and any other shop stopped short and ceased .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 40]: People who went in and out did n't go up a flight of steps to it , or walk easily in upon a level with the street , but dived down three steep stairs , as into a cellar .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 63]: Its floor was paved with stone and brick , as that of any other cellar might be ; and in lieu of window framed and glazed it had a great black wooden flap or shutter , nearly breast high from the ground , which turned back in the day-time , admitting as much cold air as light , and very often more .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 31]: Behind this shop was a wainscoted parlour , looking first into a paved yard , and beyond that again into a little terrace garden , raised some feet above it .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 157]: Any stranger would have supposed that this wainscoted parlour , saving for the door of communication by which he had entered , was cut off and detached from all the world ; and indeed most strangers on their first entrance were observed to grow extremely thoughtful , as weighing and pondering in their minds whether the upper rooms were only approachable by ladders from without ; never suspecting that two of the most unassuming and unlikely doors in existence , which the most ingenious mechanician on earth must of necessity have supposed to be the doors of closets , opened out of this room -- each without the smallest preparation , or so much as a quarter of an inch of passage -- upon two dark winding flights of stairs , the one upward , the other downward , which were the sole means of communication between that chamber and the other portions of the house .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 31]: With all these oddities , there was not a neater , more scrupulously tidy , or more punctiliously ordered house , in Clerkenwell , in London , in all England .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 44]: There were not cleaner windows , or whiter floors , or brighter Stoves , or more highly shining articles of furniture in old mahogany ; there was not more rubbing , scrubbing , burnishing and polishing , in the whole street put together .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 56]: Nor was this excellence attained without some cost and trouble and great expenditure of voice , as the neighbours were frequently reminded when the good lady of the house overlooked and assisted in its being put to rights on cleaning days -- which were usually from Monday morning till Saturday night , both days inclusive .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 72]: Leaning against the door-post of this , his dwelling , the locksmith stood early on the morning after he had met with the wounded man , gazing disconsolately at a great wooden emblem of a key , painted in vivid yellow to resemble gold , which dangled from the house-front , and swung to and fro with a mournful creaking noise , as if complaining that it had nothing to unlock .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 99]: Sometimes , he looked over his shoulder into the shop , which was so dark and dingy with numerous tokens of his trade , and so blackened by the smoke of a little forge , near which his ` prentice was at work , that it would have been difficult for one unused to such espials to have distinguished anything but various tools of uncouth make and shape , great bunches of rusty keys , fragments of iron , half-finished locks , and such like things , which garnished the walls and hung in clusters from the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 32]: After a long and patient contemplation of the golden key , and many such backward glances , Gabriel stepped into the road , and stole a look at the upper windows .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 62]: One of them chanced to be thrown open at the moment , and a roguish face met his ; a face lighted up by the loveliest pair of sparkling eyes that ever locksmith looked upon ; the face of a pretty , laughing , girl ; dimpled and fresh , and healthful -- the very impersonation of good-humour and blooming beauty .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 13]: she whispered , bending forward and pointing archly to the window underneath .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 7]: ` Mother is still asleep . '
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 15]: ` Still , my dear , ' returned the locksmith in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 21]: ` You talk as if she had been asleep all night , instead of little more than half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 6]: But I 'm very thankful .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 11]: Sleep 's a blessing -- no doubt about it . '
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 9]: The last few words he muttered to himself .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 28]: ` How cruel of you to keep us up so late this morning , and never tell us where you were , or send us word ! '
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 7]: ` Ah Dolly , Dolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 22]: returned the locksmith , shaking his head , and smiling , ` how cruel of you to run upstairs to bed !
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 19]: Come down to breakfast , madcap , and come down lightly , or you 'll wake your mother .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 13]: She must be tired , I am sure -- I am . '
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 76]: Keeping these latter words to himself , and returning his daughter 's nod , he was passing into the workshop , with the smile she had awakened still beaming on his face , when he just caught sight of his ` prentice 's brown paper cap ducking down to avoid observation , and shrinking from the window back to its former place , which the wearer no sooner reached than he began to hammer lustily .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 7]: ` Listening again , Simon ! '
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 5]: said Gabriel to himself .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 5]: ` That 's bad .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 31]: What in the name of wonder does he expect the girl to say , that I always catch him listening when SHE speaks , and never at any other time !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 12]: A bad habit , Sim , a sneaking , underhanded way .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 26]: you may hammer , but you wo n't beat that out of me , if you work at it till your time 's up ! '
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 22]: So saying , and shaking his head gravely , he re-entered the workshop , and confronted the subject of these remarks .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 14]: ` There 's enough of that just now , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 12]: ` You need n't make any more of that confounded clatter .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 5]: Breakfast 's ready . '
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 34]: ` Sir , ' said Sim , looking up with amazing politeness , and a peculiar little bow cut short off at the neck , ' I shall attend you immediately . ' '
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 46]: I suppose , ' muttered Gabriel , ` that 's out of the ` Prentice 's Garland or the ` Prentice 's Delight , or the ` Prentice 's Warbler , or the Prentice 's Guide to the Gallows , or some such improving textbook .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 15]: Now he 's going to beautify himself -- here 's a precious locksmith ! '
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 82]: Quite unconscious that his master was looking on from the dark corner by the parlour door , Sim threw off the paper cap , sprang from his seat , and in two extraordinary steps , something between skating and minuet dancing , bounded to a washing place at the other end of the shop , and there removed from his face and hands all traces of his previous work -- practising the same step all the time with the utmost gravity .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 36]: This done , he drew from some concealed place a little scrap of looking-glass , and with its assistance arranged his hair , and ascertained the exact state of a little carbuncle on his nose .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 45]: Having now completed his toilet , he placed the fragment of mirror on a low bench , and looked over his shoulder at so much of his legs as could be reflected in that small compass , with the greatest possible complacency and satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 87]: Sim , as he was called in the locksmith 's family , or Mr Simon Tappertit , as he called himself , and required all men to style him out of doors , on holidays , and Sundays out , -- was an old-fashioned , thin-faced , sleek-haired , sharp-nosed , small-eyed little fellow , very little more than five feet high , and thoroughly convinced in his own mind that he was above the middle size ; rather tall , in fact , than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 48]: Of his figure , which was well enough formed , though somewhat of the leanest , he entertained the highest admiration ; and with his legs , which , in knee-breeches , were perfect curiosities of littleness , he was enraptured to a degree amounting to enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 27]: He also had some majestic , shadowy ideas , which had never been quite fathomed by his intimate friends , concerning the power of his eye .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 90]: Indeed he had been known to go so far as to boast that he could utterly quell and subdue the haughtiest beauty by a simple process , which he termed ` eyeing her over ; ' but it must be added , that neither of this faculty , nor of the power he claimed to have , through the same gift , of vanquishing and heaving down dumb animals , even in a rabid state , had he ever furnished evidence which could be deemed quite satisfactory and conclusive .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 26]: It may be inferred from these premises , that in the small body of Mr Tappertit there was locked up an ambitious and aspiring soul .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 67]: As certain liquors , confined in casks too cramped in their dimensions , will ferment , and fret , and chafe in their imprisonment , so the spiritual essence or soul of Mr Tappertit would sometimes fume within that precious cask , his body , until , with great foam and froth and splutter , it would force a vent , and carry all before it .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 53]: It was his custom to remark , in reference to any one of these occasions , that his soul had got into his head ; and in this novel kind of intoxication many scrapes and mishaps befell him , which he had frequently concealed with no small difficulty from his worthy master .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 77]: Sim Tappertit , among the other fancies upon which his before-mentioned soul was for ever feasting and regaling itself -LRB- and which fancies , like the liver of Prometheus , grew as they were fed upon -RRB- , had a mighty notion of his order ; and had been heard by the servant-maid openly expressing his regret that the ` prentices no longer carried clubs wherewith to mace the citizens : that was his strong expression .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 71]: He was likewise reported to have said that in former times a stigma had been cast upon the body by the execution of George Barnwell , to which they should not have basely submitted , but should have demanded him of the legislature -- temperately at first ; then by an appeal to arms , if necessary -- to be dealt with as they in their wisdom might think fit .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 79]: These thoughts always led him to consider what a glorious engine the ` prentices might yet become if they had but a master spirit at their head ; and then he would darkly , and to the terror of his hearers , hint at certain reckless fellows that he knew of , and at a certain Lion Heart ready to become their captain , who , once afoot , would make the Lord Mayor tremble on his throne .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 20]: In respect of dress and personal decoration , Sim Tappertit was no less of an adventurous and enterprising character .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 81]: He had been seen , beyond dispute , to pull off ruffles of the finest quality at the corner of the street on Sunday nights , and to put them carefully in his pocket before returning home ; and it was quite notorious that on all great holiday occasions it was his habit to exchange his plain steel knee-buckles for a pair of glittering paste , under cover of a friendly post , planted most conveniently in that same spot .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 124]: Add to this that he was in years just twenty , in his looks much older , and in conceit at least two hundred ; that he had no objection to be jested with , touching his admiration of his master 's daughter ; and had even , when called upon at a certain obscure tavern to pledge the lady whom he honoured with his love , toasted , with many winks and leers , a fair creature whose Christian name , he said , began with a D -- ; -- and as much is known of Sim Tappertit , who has by this time followed the locksmith in to breakfast , as is necessary to be known in making his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 53]: It was a substantial meal ; for , over and above the ordinary tea equipage , the board creaked beneath the weight of a jolly round of beef , a ham of the first magnitude , and sundry towers of buttered Yorkshire cake , piled slice upon slice in most alluring order .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 52]: There was also a goodly jug of well-browned clay , fashioned into the form of an old gentleman , not by any means unlike the locksmith , atop of whose bald head was a fine white froth answering to his wig , indicative , beyond dispute , of sparkling home-brewed ale .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 61]: But , better far than fair home-brewed , or Yorkshire cake , or ham , or beef , or anything to eat or drink that earth or air or water can supply , there sat , presiding over all , the locksmith 's rosy daughter , before whose dark eyes even beef grew insignificant , and malt became as nothing .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 12]: Fathers should never kiss their daughters when young men are by .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 5]: It 's too much .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: There are bounds to human endurance .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 30]: So thought Sim Tappertit when Gabriel drew those rosy lips to his -- those lips within Sim 's reach from day to day , and yet so far off .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 18]: He had a respect for his master , but he wished the Yorkshire cake might choke him .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 35]: ` Father , ' said the locksmith 's daughter , when this salute was over , and they took their seats at table , ` what is this I hear about last night ? '
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 15]: ` All true , my dear ; true as the Gospel , Doll . '
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 19]: ` Young Mr Chester robbed , and lying wounded in the road , when you came up ! '
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 6]: ` Ay -- Mr Edward .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 14]: And beside him , Barnaby , calling for help with all his might .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 58]: It was well it happened as it did ; for the road 's a lonely one , the hour was late , and , the night being cold , and poor Barnaby even less sensible than usual from surprise and fright , the young gentleman might have met his death in a very short time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 8]: I dread to think of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 7]: cried his daughter with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 8]: ` How did you know him ? '
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 5]: ` Know him ! '
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 5]: returned the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 10]: I did n't know him -- how could I ?
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 16]: I had never seen him , often as I had heard and spoken of him .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 21]: I took him to Mrs Rudge 's ; and she no sooner saw him than the truth came out . '
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 28]: ` Miss Emma , father -- If this news should reach her , enlarged upon as it is sure to be , she will go distracted . '
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 20]: ` Why , lookye there again , how a man suffers for being good-natured , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 33]: ` Miss Emma was with her uncle at the masquerade at Carlisle House , where she had gone , as the people at the Warren told me , sorely against her will .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 49]: What does your blockhead father when he and Mrs Rudge have laid their heads together , but goes there when he ought to be abed , makes interest with his friend the doorkeeper , slips him on a mask and domino , and mixes with the masquers . '
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 9]: ` And like himself to do so ! '
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 20]: cried the girl , putting her fair arm round his neck , and giving him a most enthusiastic kiss .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 5]: ` Like himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 22]: repeated Gabriel , affecting to grumble , but evidently delighted with the part he had taken , and with her praise .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 10]: ` Very like himself -- so your mother said .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 32]: However , he mingled with the crowd , and prettily worried and badgered he was , I warrant you , with people squeaking , `` Do n't you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 19]: and `` I 've found you out , '' and all that kind of nonsense in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 41]: He might have wandered on till now , but in a little room there was a young lady who had taken off her mask , on account of the place being very warm , and was sitting there alone . '
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 7]: ` And that was she ? '
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 5]: said his daughter hastily .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 54]: ` And that was she , ' replied the locksmith ; ` and I no sooner whispered to her what the matter was -- as softly , Doll , and with nearly as much art as you could have used yourself -- than she gives a kind of scream and faints away . '
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 11]: ` What did you do -- what happened next ? '
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 4]: asked his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 36]: ` Why , the masks came flocking round , with a general noise and hubbub , and I thought myself in luck to get clear off , that 's all , ' rejoined the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 18]: ` What happened when I reached home you may guess , if you did n't hear it .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 11]: Well , it 's a poor heart that never rejoices .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 10]: -- Put Toby this way , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 14]: This Toby was the brown jug of which previous mention has been made .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 73]: Applying his lips to the worthy old gentleman 's benevolent forehead , the locksmith , who had all this time been ravaging among the eatables , kept them there so long , at the same time raising the vessel slowly in the air , that at length Toby stood on his head upon his nose , when he smacked his lips , and set him on the table again with fond reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 45]: Although Sim Tappertit had taken no share in this conversation , no part of it being addressed to him , he had not been wanting in such silent manifestations of astonishment , as he deemed most compatible with the favourable display of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 77]: Regarding the pause which now ensued , as a particularly advantageous opportunity for doing great execution with them upon the locksmith 's daughter -LRB- who he had no doubt was looking at him in mute admiration -RRB- , he began to screw and twist his face , and especially those features , into such extraordinary , hideous , and unparalleled contortions , that Gabriel , who happened to look towards him , was stricken with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 14]: ` Why , what the devil 's the matter with the lad ? '
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 4]: cried the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 6]: ` Is he choking ? '
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 4]: ` Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 7]: demanded Sim , with some disdain .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 3]: ` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 9]: Why , you , ' returned his master .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 15]: ` What do you mean by making those horrible faces over your breakfast ? '
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 30]: ` Faces are matters of taste , sir , ' said Mr Tappertit , rather discomfited ; not the less so because he saw the locksmith 's daughter smiling .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 10]: ` Sim , ' rejoined Gabriel , laughing heartily .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 17]: ` Do n't be a fool , for I 'd rather see you in your senses .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 22]: These young fellows , ' he added , turning to his daughter , ` are always committing some folly or another .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 24]: There was a quarrel between Joe Willet and old John last night though I ca n't say Joe was much in fault either .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 23]: He 'll be missing one of these mornings , and will have gone away upon some wild-goose errand , seeking his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 10]: -- Why , what 's the matter , Doll ?
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 6]: YOU are making faces now .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 12]: The girls are as bad as the boys every bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 35]: ` It 's the tea , ' said Dolly , turning alternately very red and very white , which is no doubt the effect of a slight scald -- ` so very hot . '
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 17]: Mr Tappertit looked immensely big at a quartern loaf on the table , and breathed hard .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 4]: returned the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 8]: ` Put some more milk in it .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 27]: -- Yes , I am sorry for Joe , because he is a likely young fellow , and gains upon one every time one sees him .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 10]: But he 'll start off , you 'll find .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 9]: Indeed he told me as much himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 7]: cried Dolly in a faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 4]: ` In-deed ! '
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 13]: ` Is the tea tickling your throat still , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 4]: said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 44]: But , before his daughter could make him any answer , she was taken with a troublesome cough , and it was such a very unpleasant cough , that , when she left off , the tears were starting in her bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 97]: The good-natured locksmith was still patting her on the back and applying such gentle restoratives , when a message arrived from Mrs Varden , making known to all whom it might concern , that she felt too much indisposed to rise after her great agitation and anxiety of the previous night ; and therefore desired to be immediately accommodated with the little black teapot of strong mixed tea , a couple of rounds of buttered toast , a middling-sized dish of beef and ham cut thin , and the Protestant Manual in two volumes post octavo .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 22]: Like some other ladies who in remote ages flourished upon this globe , Mrs Varden was most devout when most ill-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 19]: Whenever she and her husband were at unusual variance , then the Protestant Manual was in high feather .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 61]: Knowing from experience what these requests portended , the triumvirate broke up ; Dolly , to see the orders executed with all despatch ; Gabriel , to some out-of-door work in his little chaise ; and Sim , to his daily duty in the workshop , to which retreat he carried the big look , although the loaf remained behind .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 20]: Indeed the big look increased immensely , and when he had tied his apron on , became quite gigantic .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 44]: It was not until he had several times walked up and down with folded arms , and the longest strides be could take , and had kicked a great many small articles out of his way , that his lip began to curl .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 27]: At length , a gloomy derision came upon his features , and he smiled ; uttering meanwhile with supreme contempt the monosyllable ` Joe ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 29]: I eyed her over , while he talked about the fellow , ' he said , ` and that was of course the reason of her being confused .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 3]: Joe ! '
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 44]: He walked up and down again much quicker than before , and if possible with longer strides ; sometimes stopping to take a glance at his legs , and sometimes to jerk out , and cast from him , another ` Joe ! '
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 22]: In the course of a quarter of an hour or so he again assumed the paper cap and tried to work .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 6]: It could not be done .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 21]: ` I 'll do nothing to-day , ' said Mr Tappertit , dashing it down again , ` but grind .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: I 'll grind up all the tools .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 8]: Grinding will suit my present humour well .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 3]: Joe ! '
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 2]: Whirr-r-r-r .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 15]: The grindstone was soon in motion ; the sparks were flying off in showers .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 9]: This was the occupation for his heated spirit .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 2]: Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 8]: ` Something will come of this ! '
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 19]: said Mr Tappertit , pausing as if in triumph , and wiping his heated face upon his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 7]: ` Something will come of this .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 10]: I hope it may n't be human gore ! '
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 2]: Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 33]: Chapter 5 As soon as the business of the day was over , the locksmith sallied forth , alone , to visit the wounded gentleman and ascertain the progress of his recovery .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 45]: The house where he had left him was in a by-street in Southwark , not far from London Bridge ; and thither he hied with all speed , bent upon returning with as little delay as might be , and getting to bed betimes .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 14]: The evening was boisterous -- scarcely better than the previous night had been .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 72]: It was not easy for a stout man like Gabriel to keep his legs at the street corners , or to make head against the high wind , which often fairly got the better of him , and drove him back some paces , or , in defiance of all his energy , forced him to take shelter in an arch or doorway until the fury of the gust was spent .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 73]: Occasionally a hat or wig , or both , came spinning and trundling past him , like a mad thing ; while the more serious spectacle of falling tiles and slates , or of masses of brick and mortar or fragments of stone-coping rattling upon the pavement near at hand , and splitting into fragments , did not increase the pleasure of the journey , or make the way less dreary . '
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 13]: A trying night for a man like me to walk in ! '
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 14]: said the locksmith , as he knocked softly at the widow 's door .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 14]: ` I 'd rather be in old John 's chimney-corner , faith ! '
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 6]: ` Who 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 8]: demanded a woman 's voice from within .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 18]: Being answered , it added a hasty word of welcome , and the door was quickly opened .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 26]: She was about forty -- perhaps two or three years older -- with a cheerful aspect , and a face that had once been pretty .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 22]: It bore traces of affliction and care , but they were of an old date , and Time had smoothed them .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 52]: Any one who had bestowed but a casual glance on Barnaby might have known that this was his mother , from the strong resemblance between them ; but where in his face there was wildness and vacancy , in hers there was the patient composure of long effort and quiet resignation .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 11]: One thing about this face was very strange and startling .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 23]: You could not look upon it in its most cheerful mood without feeling that it had some extraordinary capacity of expressing terror .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 7]: It was not on the surface .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 10]: It was in no one feature that it lingered .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 31]: You could not take the eyes or mouth , or lines upon the cheek , and say , if this or that were otherwise , it would not be so .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 23]: Yet there it always lurked -- something for ever dimly seen , but ever there , and never absent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 61]: It was the faintest , palest shadow of some look , to which an instant of intense and most unutterable horror only could have given birth ; but indistinct and feeble as it was , it did suggest what that look must have been , and fixed it in the mind as if it had had existence in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 29]: More faintly imaged , and wanting force and purpose , as it were , because of his darkened intellect , there was this same stamp upon the son .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 25]: Seen in a picture , it must have had some legend with it , and would have haunted those who looked upon the canvas .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 29]: They who knew the Maypole story , and could remember what the widow was , before her husband 's and his master 's murder , understood it well .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 45]: They recollected how the change had come , and could call to mind that when her son was born , upon the very day the deed was known , he bore upon his wrist what seemed a smear of blood but half washed out .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 8]: ` God save you , neighbour ! '
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 28]: said the locksmith , as he followed her , with the air of an old friend , into a little parlour where a cheerful fire was burning .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 9]: ` And you , ' she answered smiling .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: ` Your kind heart has brought you here again .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 26]: Nothing will keep you at home , I know of old , if there are friends to serve or comfort , out of doors . '
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 17]: ` Tut , tut , ' returned the locksmith , rubbing his hands and warming them .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 7]: ` You women are such talkers .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 8]: What of the patient , neighbour ? '
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 6]: ` He is sleeping now .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 16]: He was very restless towards daylight , and for some hours tossed and tumbled sadly .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 16]: But the fever has left him , and the doctor says he will soon mend .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 9]: He must not be removed until to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 10]: ` He has had visitors to-day -- humph ? '
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 5]: said Gabriel , slyly .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 25]: Old Mr Chester has been here ever since we sent for him , and had not been gone many minutes when you knocked . '
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 5]: ` No ladies ? '
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: said Gabriel , elevating his eyebrows and looking disappointed . '
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 8]: A letter , ' replied the widow .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 3]: ` Come .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 7]: That 's better than nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 4]: replied the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: ` Who was the bearer ? '
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 7]: ` Barnaby , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 7]: ` Barnaby 's a jewel ! '
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 26]: said Varden ; ` and comes and goes with ease where we who think ourselves much wiser would make but a poor hand of it .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 12]: He is not out wandering , again , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 26]: ` Thank Heaven he is in his bed ; having been up all night , as you know , and on his feet all day .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 6]: He was quite tired out .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 46]: Ah , neighbour , if I could but see him oftener so -- if I could but tame down that terrible restlessness -- ' ` In good time , ' said the locksmith , kindly , ` in good time -- do n't be down-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 10]: To my mind he grows wiser every day . '
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 6]: The widow shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 36]: And yet , though she knew the locksmith sought to cheer her , and spoke from no conviction of his own , she was glad to hear even this praise of her poor benighted son .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 15]: ` He will be a ` cute man yet , ' resumed the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 25]: ` Take care , when we are growing old and foolish , Barnaby does n't put us to the blush , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 35]: But our other friend , ' he added , looking under the table and about the floor -- ` sharpest and cunningest of all the sharp and cunning ones -- where 's he ? '
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 16]: ` In Barnaby 's room , ' rejoined the widow , with a faint smile .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 7]: He 's a knowing blade ! '
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 8]: said Varden , shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 10]: I should be sorry to talk secrets before him .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 6]: He 's a deep customer .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 18]: I 've no doubt he can read , and write , and cast accounts if he chooses .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 4]: What was that ?
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 7]: Him tapping at the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 8]: ` No , ' returned the widow .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 10]: ` It was in the street , I think .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 3]: There again !
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 10]: 'T is some one knocking softly at the shutter .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 6]: Who can it be ! '
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 38]: They had been speaking in a low tone , for the invalid lay overhead , and the walls and ceilings being thin and poorly built , the sound of their voices might otherwise have disturbed his slumber .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 45]: The party without , whoever it was , could have stood close to the shutter without hearing anything spoken ; and , seeing the light through the chinks and finding all so quiet , might have been persuaded that only one person was there .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 12]: ` Some thief or ruffian maybe , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 7]: ` Give me the light . '
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' she returned hastily .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 11]: ` Such visitors have never come to this poor dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 5]: Do you stay here .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 9]: You 're within call , at the worst .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 9]: I would rather go myself -- alone . '
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 16]: said the locksmith , unwillingly relinquishing the candle he had caught up from the table .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 22]: ` Because -- I do n't know why -- because the wish is so strong upon me , ' she rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 15]: ` There again -- do not detain me , I beg of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 27]: Gabriel looked at her , in great surprise to see one who was usually so mild and quiet thus agitated , and with so little cause .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 11]: She left the room and closed the door behind her .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 16]: She stood for a moment as if hesitating , with her hand upon the lock .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 39]: In this short interval the knocking came again , and a voice close to the window -- a voice the locksmith seemed to recollect , and to have some disagreeable association with -- whispered ` Make haste . '
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 27]: The words were uttered in that low distinct voice which finds its way so readily to sleepers ' ears , and wakes them in a fright .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 20]: For a moment it startled even the locksmith ; who involuntarily drew back from the window , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 81]: The wind rumbling in the chimney made it difficult to hear what passed , but he could tell that the door was opened , that there was the tread of a man upon the creaking boards , and then a moment 's silence -- broken by a suppressed something which was not a shriek , or groan , or cry for help , and yet might have been either or all three ; and the words ` My God ! '
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 10]: uttered in a voice it chilled him to hear .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 7]: He rushed out upon the instant .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 30]: There , at last , was that dreadful look -- the very one he seemed to know so well and yet had never seen before -- upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 37]: There she stood , frozen to the ground , gazing with starting eyes , and livid cheeks , and every feature fixed and ghastly , upon the man he had encountered in the dark last night .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 8]: His eyes met those of the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 21]: It was but a flash , an instant , a breath upon a polished glass , and he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 36]: The locksmith was upon him -- had the skirts of his streaming garment almost in his grasp -- when his arms were tightly clutched , and the widow flung herself upon the ground before him .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 13]: ` The other way -- the other way , ' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: ` He went the other way .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 5]: Turn -- turn ! '
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 5]: ` The other way !
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 26]: I see him now , ' rejoined the locksmith , pointing -- ` yonder -- there -- there is his shadow passing by that light .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 6]: What -- who is this ?
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 5]: Let me go . '
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 8]: ` Come back , come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 16]: exclaimed the woman , clasping him ; ` Do not touch him on your life .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 7]: I charge you , come back .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 8]: He carries other lives besides his own .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 4]: Come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 7]: ` What does this mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 4]: cried the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 21]: ` No matter what it means , do n't ask , do n't speak , do n't think about it .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 12]: He is not to be followed , checked , or stopped .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 4]: Come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 34]: The old man looked at her in wonder , as she writhed and clung about him ; and , borne down by her passion , suffered her to drag him into the house .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 74]: It was not until she had chained and double-locked the door , fastened every bolt and bar with the heat and fury of a maniac , and drawn him back into the room , that she turned upon him , once again , that stony look of horror , and , sinking down into a chair , covered her face , and shuddered , as though the hand of death were on her .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 53]: Chapter 6 Beyond all measure astonished by the strange occurrences which had passed with so much violence and rapidity , the locksmith gazed upon the shuddering figure in the chair like one half stupefied , and would have gazed much longer , had not his tongue been loosened by compassion and humanity .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 9]: ` You are ill , ' said Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 9]: ` Let me call some neighbour in . '
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 24]: ` Not for the world , ' she rejoined , motioning to him with her trembling hand , and holding her face averted .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 15]: ` It is enough that you have been by , to see this . '
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 14]: ` Nay , more than enough -- or less , ' said Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 9]: ` Be it so , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 5]: ` As you like .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 10]: Ask me no questions , I entreat you . '
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 12]: ` Neighbour , ' said the locksmith , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 13]: ` Is this fair , or reasonable , or just to yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 38]: Is it like you , who have known me so long and sought my advice in all matters -- like you , who from a girl have had a strong mind and a staunch heart ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: I have need of them , ' she replied . '
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 11]: I am growing old , both in years and care .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 18]: Perhaps that , and too much trial , have made them weaker than they used to be .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 7]: Do not speak to me . '
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 16]: ` How can I see what I have seen , and hold my peace ! '
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 4]: returned the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 18]: ` Who was that man , and why has his coming made this change in you ? '
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 21]: She was silent , but held to the chair as though to save herself from falling on the ground . '
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 38]: I take the licence of an old acquaintance , Mary , ' said the locksmith , ` who has ever had a warm regard for you , and maybe has tried to prove it when he could .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 15]: Who is this ill-favoured man , and what has he to do with you ?
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 17]: Who is this ghost , that is only seen in the black nights and bad weather ?
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 40]: How does he know , and why does he haunt , this house , whispering through chinks and crevices , as if there was that between him and you , which neither durst so much as speak aloud of ?
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 5]: Who is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 18]: ` You do well to say he haunts this house , ' returned the widow , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 20]: ` His shadow has been upon it and me , in light and darkness , at noonday and midnight .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 14]: And now , at last , he has come in the body ! '
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 31]: ` But he would n't have gone in the body , ' returned the locksmith with some irritation , ` if you had left my arms and legs at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 6]: What riddle is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 24]: ` It is one , ' she answered , rising as she spoke , ` that must remain for ever as it is .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 9]: I dare not say more than that . '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 5]: ` Dare not ! '
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 5]: repeated the wondering locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 11]: ` Do not press me , ' she replied . '
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 16]: I am sick and faint , and every faculty of life seems dead within me .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 3]: -- No !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 9]: -- Do not touch me , either . '
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 27]: Gabriel , who had stepped forward to render her assistance , fell back as she made this hasty exclamation , and regarded her in silent wonder .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 30]: ` Let me go my way alone , ' she said in a low voice , ` and let the hands of no honest man touch mine to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 34]: When she had tottered to the door , she turned , and added with a stronger effort , ` This is a secret , which , of necessity , I trust to you .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 6]: You are a true man .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 15]: As you have ever been good and kind to me , -- keep it .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 33]: If any noise was heard above , make some excuse -- say anything but what you really saw , and never let a word or look between us , recall this circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 5]: I trust to you .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 7]: Mind , I trust to you .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 11]: How much I trust , you never can conceive . '
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 18]: Casting her eyes upon him for an instant , she withdrew , and left him there alone .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 22]: Gabriel , not knowing what to think , stood staring at the door with a countenance full of surprise and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 21]: The more he pondered on what had passed , the less able he was to give it any favourable interpretation .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 77]: To find this widow woman , whose life for so many years had been supposed to be one of solitude and retirement , and who , in her quiet suffering character , had gained the good opinion and respect of all who knew her -- to find her linked mysteriously with an ill-omened man , alarmed at his appearance , and yet favouring his escape , was a discovery that pained as much as startled him .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 17]: Her reliance on his secrecy , and his tacit acquiescence , increased his distress of mind .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 48]: If he had spoken boldly , persisted in questioning her , detained her when she rose to leave the room , made any kind of protest , instead of silently compromising himself , as he felt he had done , he would have been more at ease .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 20]: ` Why did I let her say it was a secret , and she trusted it to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 25]: said Gabriel , putting his wig on one side to scratch his head with greater ease , and looking ruefully at the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 10]: I have no more readiness than old John himself .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 44]: Why did n't I say firmly , `` You have no right to such secrets , and I demand of you to tell me what this means , '' instead of standing gaping at her , like an old moon-calf as I am !
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 6]: But there 's my weakness .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 24]: I can be obstinate enough with men if need be , but women may twist me round their fingers at their pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 36]: He took his wig off outright as he made this reflection , and , warming his handkerchief at the fire began to rub and polish his bald head with it , until it glistened again .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 26]: ` And yet , ' said the locksmith , softening under this soothing process , and stopping to smile , ` it MAY be nothing .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 21]: Any drunken brawler trying to make his way into the house , would have alarmed a quiet soul like her .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 62]: But then ' -- and here was the vexation -- ` how came it to be that man ; how comes he to have this influence over her ; how came she to favour his getting away from me ; and , more than all , how came she not to say it was a sudden fright , and nothing more ?
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 45]: It 's a sad thing to have , in one minute , reason to mistrust a person I have known so long , and an old sweetheart into the bargain ; but what else can I do , with all this upon my mind !
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 8]: -- Is that Barnaby outside there ? '
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 8]: he cried , looking in and nodding .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 13]: ` Sure enough it 's Barnaby -- how did you guess ? '
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: ` By your shadow , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 4]: ` Oho ! '
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 29]: cried Barnaby , glancing over his shoulder , ` He 's a merry fellow , that shadow , and keeps close to me , though I AM silly .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 17]: We have such pranks , such walks , such runs , such gambols on the grass !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 20]: Sometimes he 'll be half as tall as a church steeple , and sometimes no bigger than a dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 50]: Now , he goes on before , and now behind , and anon he 'll be stealing on , on this side , or on that , stopping whenever I stop , and thinking I ca n't see him , though I have my eye on him sharp enough .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 6]: he 's a merry fellow .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 8]: Tell me -- is he silly too ?
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 6]: I think he is . '
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 3]: asked Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 16]: ` Because be never tires of mocking me , but does it all day long .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: -- Why do n't you come ? '
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 3]: ` Upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 4]: He wants you .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 7]: Stay -- where 's HIS shadow ?
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 2]: Come .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 11]: You 're a wise man ; tell me that . '
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 17]: ` Beside him , Barnaby ; beside him , I suppose , ' returned the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 7]: he replied , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 5]: ` Guess again . '
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 9]: ` Gone out a walking , maybe ? '
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 27]: ` He has changed shadows with a woman , ' the idiot whispered in his ear , and then fell back with a look of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 13]: ` Her shadow 's always with him , and his with her .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 9]: That 's sport I think , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 21]: ` Barnaby , ' said the locksmith , with a grave look ; ` come hither , lad . ' '
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 8]: I know what you want to say .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 4]: I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 8]: he replied , keeping away from him .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 10]: ` But I 'm cunning , I 'm silent .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 13]: I only say so much to you -- are you ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 21]: As he spoke , he caught up the light , and waved it with a wild laugh above his head .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 22]: ` Softly -- gently , ' said the locksmith , exerting all his influence to keep him calm and quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: I thought you had been asleep . '
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 15]: ` So I HAVE been asleep , ' he rejoined , with widely-opened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 62]: ` There have been great faces coming and going -- close to my face , and then a mile away -- low places to creep through , whether I would or no -- high churches to fall down from -- strange creatures crowded up together neck and heels , to sit upon the bed -- that 's sleep , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 12]: ` Dreams , Barnaby , dreams , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 4]: ` Dreams ! '
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 9]: he echoed softly , drawing closer to him .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 7]: ` Those are not dreams . '
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 17]: ` What are , ' replied the locksmith , ` if they are not ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 88]: I dreamed , ' said Barnaby , passing his arm through Varden 's , and peering close into his face as he answered in a whisper , ' I dreamed just now that something -- it was in the shape of a man -- followed me -- came softly after me -- would n't let me be -- but was always hiding and crouching , like a cat in dark corners , waiting till I should pass ; when it crept out and came softly after me .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 9]: -- Did you ever see me run ? '
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 9]: ` Many a time , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 13]: ` You never saw me run as I did in this dream .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 9]: Still it came creeping on to worry me .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 37]: Nearer , nearer , nearer -- I ran faster -- leaped -- sprung out of bed , and to the window -- and there , in the street below -- but he is waiting for us .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: Are you coming ? '
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 10]: ` What in the street below , Barnaby ? '
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 18]: said Varden , imagining that he traced some connection between this vision and what had actually occurred .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 39]: Barnaby looked into his face , muttered incoherently , waved the light above his head again , laughed , and drawing the locksmith 's arm more tightly through his own , led him up the stairs in silence .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 34]: They entered a homely bedchamber , garnished in a scanty way with chairs , whose spindle-shanks bespoke their age , and other furniture of very little worth ; but clean and neatly kept .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 55]: Reclining in an easy-chair before the fire , pale and weak from waste of blood , was Edward Chester , the young gentleman who had been the first to quit the Maypole on the previous night , and who , extending his hand to the locksmith , welcomed him as his preserver and friend .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 16]: ` Say no more , sir , say no more , ' said Gabriel . '
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 27]: I hope I would have done at least as much for any man in such a strait , and most of all for you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 41]: A certain young lady , ' he added , with some hesitation , ` has done us many a kind turn , and we naturally feel -- I hope I give you no offence in saying this , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 22]: The young man smiled and shook his head ; at the same time moving in his chair as if in pain .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 50]: ` It 's no great matter , ' he said , in answer to the locksmith 's sympathising look , ' a mere uneasiness arising at least as much from being cooped up here , as from the slight wound I have , or from the loss of blood .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 7]: Be seated , Mr Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 47]: ` If I may make so bold , Mr Edward , as to lean upon your chair , ' returned the locksmith , accommodating his action to his speech , and bending over him , ` I 'll stand here for the convenience of speaking low .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 20]: Barnaby is not in his quietest humour to-night , and at such times talking never does him good . '
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 40]: They both glanced at the subject of this remark , who had taken a seat on the other side of the fire , and , smiling vacantly , was making puzzles on his fingers with a skein of string .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 25]: ` Pray , tell me , sir , ' said Varden , dropping his voice still lower , ` exactly what happened last night .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 7]: I have my reason for inquiring .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 8]: You left the Maypole , alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 28]: ` And walked homeward alone , until I had nearly reached the place where you found me , when I heard the gallop of a horse . '
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 5]: ` Behind you ? '
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 4]: said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 8]: ` Indeed , yes -- behind me .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 23]: It was a single rider , who soon overtook me , and checking his horse , inquired the way to London . '
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 24]: ` You were on the alert , sir , knowing how many highwaymen there are , scouring the roads in all directions ? '
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 4]: said Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 24]: I was , but I had only a stick , having imprudently left my pistols in their holster-case with the landlord 's son .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 7]: I directed him as he desired .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 27]: Before the words had passed my lips , he rode upon me furiously , as if bent on trampling me down beneath his horse 's hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 9]: In starting aside , I slipped and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 28]: You found me with this stab and an ugly bruise or two , and without my purse -- in which he found little enough for his pains .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 63]: And now , Mr Varden , ' he added , shaking the locksmith by the hand , ` saving the extent of my gratitude to you , you know as much as I. ' ` Except , ' said Gabriel , bending down yet more , and looking cautiously towards their silent neighhour , ` except in respect of the robber himself .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 7]: What like was he , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 7]: Speak low , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 32]: Barnaby means no harm , but I have watched him oftener than you , and I know , little as you would think it , that he 's listening now . '
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 43]: It required a strong confidence in the locksmith 's veracity to lead any one to this belief , for every sense and faculty that Barnahy possessed , seemed to be fixed upon his game , to the exclusion of all other things .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 40]: Something in the young man 's face expressed this opinion , for Gabriel repeated what he had just said , more earnestly than before , and with another glance towards Barnaby , again asked what like the man was .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 31]: ` The night was so dark , ' said Edward , ` the attack so sudden , and he so wrapped and muffled up , that I can hardly say .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 32]: It seems that -- ' ` Do n't mention his name , sir , ' returned the locksmith , following his look towards Barnaby ; ' I know HE saw him .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 9]: I want to know what YOU saw . '
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 23]: ` All I remember is , ' said Edward , ` that as he checked his horse his hat was blown off .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 21]: He caught it , and replaced it on his head , which I observed was bound with a dark handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 53]: A stranger entered the Maypole while I was there , whom I had not seen -- for I had sat apart for reasons of my own -- and when I rose to leave the room and glanced round , he was in the shadow of the chimney and hidden from my sight .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 38]: But , if he and the robber were two different persons , their voices were strangely and most remarkably alike ; for directly the man addressed me in the road , I recognised his speech again . '
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 7]: ` It is as I feared .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 15]: The very man was here to-night , ' thought the locksmith , changing colour .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 8]: ` What dark history is this ! '
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 8]: cried a hoarse voice in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: ` Halloa , halloa , halloa !
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 4]: Bow wow wow .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 6]: What 's the matter here !
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 3]: Hal-loa ! '
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 99]: The speaker -- who made the locksmith start as if he had been some supernatural agent -- was a large raven , who had perched upon the top of the easy-chair , unseen by him and Edward , and listened with a polite attention and a most extraordinary appearance of comprehending every word , to all they had said up to this point ; turning his head from one to the other , as if his office were to judge between them , and it were of the very last importance that he should not lose a word .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 6]: ` Look at him ! '
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 17]: said Varden , divided between admiration of the bird and a kind of fear of him .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 11]: ` Was there ever such a knowing imp as that !
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: Oh he 's a dreadful fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 57]: The raven , with his head very much on one side , and his bright eye shining like a diamond , preserved a thoughtful silence for a few seconds , and then replied in a voice so hoarse and distant , that it seemed to come through his thick feathers rather than out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 7]: ` Halloa , halloa , halloa !
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 6]: What 's the matter here !
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 5]: Keep up your spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 4]: Never say die .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 4]: Bow wow wow .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 15]: I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 3]: Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 18]: -- And then , as if exulting in his infernal character , he began to whistle . '
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 10]: I more than half believe he speaks the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 10]: Upon my word I do , ' said Varden .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 20]: ` Do you see how he looks at me , as if he knew what I was saying ? '
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 62]: To which the bird , balancing himself on tiptoe , as it were , and moving his body up and down in a sort of grave dance , rejoined , ` I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil , ' and flapped his wings against his sides as if he were bursting with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 17]: Barnaby clapped his hands , and fairly rolled upon the ground in an ecstasy of delight .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 23]: ` Strange companions , sir , ' said the locksmith , shaking his head , and looking from one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 9]: ` The bird has all the wit . '
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 5]: ` Strange indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 30]: said Edward , holding out his forefinger to the raven , who , in acknowledgment of the attention , made a dive at it immediately with his iron bill .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 7]: ` Is he old ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 12]: A mere boy , sir , ' replied the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 8]: A hundred and twenty , or thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 10]: Call him down , Barnaby , my man . '
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 5]: ` Call him ! '
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 25]: echoed Barnaby , sitting upright upon the floor , and staring vacantly at Gabriel , as he thrust his hair back from his face .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 8]: ` But who can make him come !
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 12]: He calls me , and makes me go where he will .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 9]: He goes on before , and I follow .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 11]: He 's the master , and I 'm the man .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 8]: Is that the truth , Grip ? '
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 35]: The raven gave a short , comfortable , confidential kind of croak ; -- a most expressive croak , which seemed to say , ` You need n't let these fellows into our secrets .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 5]: We understand each other .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 7]: It 's all right . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 6]: I make HIM come ? '
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 8]: cried Barnaby , pointing to the bird .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 15]: ` Him , who never goes to sleep , or so much as winks !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 23]: -- Why , any time of night , you may see his eyes in my dark room , shining like two sparks .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 42]: And every night , and all night too , he 's broad awake , talking to himself , thinking what he shall do to-morrow , where we shall go , and what he shall steal , and hide , and bury .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: I make HIM come !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 13]: On second thoughts , the bird appeared disposed to come of himself .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 70]: After a short survey of the ground , and a few sidelong looks at the ceiling and at everybody present in turn , he fluttered to the floor , and went to Barnaby -- not in a hop , or walk , or run , but in a pace like that of a very particular gentleman with exceedingly tight boots on , trying to walk fast over loose pebbles .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 54]: Then , stepping into his extended hand , and condescending to be held out at arm 's length , he gave vent to a succession of sounds , not unlike the drawing of some eight or ten dozen of long corks , and again asserted his brimstone birth and parentage with great distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 49]: The locksmith shook his head -- perhaps in some doubt of the creature 's being really nothing but a bird -- perhaps in pity for Bamaby , who by this time had him in his arms , and was rolling about , with him , on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 29]: As he raised his eyes from the poor fellow he encountered those of his mother , who had entered the room , and was looking on in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 27]: She was quite white in the face , even to her lips , but had wholly subdued her emotion , and wore her usual quiet look .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 29]: Varden fancied as he glanced at her that she shrunk from his eye ; and that she busied herself about the wounded gentleman to avoid him the better .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 11]: It was time he went to bed , she said .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 29]: He was to be removed to his own home on the morrow , and he had already exceeded his time for sitting up , by a full hour .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 13]: Acting on this hint , the locksmith prepared to take his leave .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 35]: ` By the bye , ' said Edward , as he shook him by the hand , and looked from him to Mrs Rudge and back again , ` what noise was that below ?
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 26]: I heard your voice in the midst of it , and should have inquired before , but our other conversation drove it from my memory .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 5]: What was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 11]: The locksmith looked towards her , and bit his lip .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 14]: She leant against the chair , and bent her eyes upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 7]: Barnaby too -- he was listening .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 26]: -- ` Some mad or drunken fellow , sir , ' Varden at length made answer , looking steadily at the widow as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 14]: ` He mistook the house , and tried to force an entrance . '
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 10]: She breathed more freely , but stood quite motionless .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 50]: As the locksmith said ` Good night , ' and Barnaby caught up the candle to light him down the stairs , she took it from him , and charged him -- with more haste and earnestness than so slight an occasion appeared to warrant -- not to stir .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 31]: The raven followed them to satisfy himself that all was right below , and when they reached the street-door , stood on the bottom stair drawing corks out of number .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 16]: With a trembling hand she unfastened the chain and bolts , and turned the key .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 53]: As she had her hand upon the latch , the locksmith said in a low voice , ' I have told a lie to-night , for your sake , Mary , and for the sake of bygone times and old acquaintance , when I would scorn to do so for my own .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 14]: I hope I may have done no harm , or led to none .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 28]: I ca n't help the suspicions you have forced upon me , and I am loth , I tell you plainly , to leave Mr Edward here .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 8]: Take care he comes to no hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 17]: I doubt the safety of this roof , and am glad he leaves it so soon .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 7]: Now , let me go . '
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 46]: For a moment she hid her face in her hands and wept ; but resisting the strong impulse which evidently moved her to reply , opened the door -- no wider than was sufficient for the passage of his body -- and motioned him away .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 32]: As the locksmith stood upon the step , it was chained and locked behind him , and the raven , in furtherance of these precautions , barked like a lusty house-dog .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 48]: ` In league with that ill-looking figure that might have fallen from a gibbet -- he listening and hiding here -- Barnaby first upon the spot last night -- can she who has always borne so fair a name be guilty of such crimes in secret ! '
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 6]: said the locksmith , musing .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 35]: ` Heaven forgive me if I am wrong , and send me just thoughts ; but she is poor , the temptation may be great , and we daily hear of things as strange .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 9]: -- Ay , bark away , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 20]: If there 's any wickedness going on , that raven 's in it , I 'll be sworn . '
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 34]: Chapter 7 Mrs Varden was a lady of what is commonly called an uncertain temper -- a phrase which being interpreted signifies a temper tolerably certain to make everybody more or less uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 34]: Thus it generally happened , that when other people were merry , Mrs Varden was dull ; and that when other people were dull , Mrs Varden was disposed to be amazingly cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 105]: Indeed the worthy housewife was of such a capricious nature , that she not only attained a higher pitch of genius than Macbeth , in respect of her ability to be wise , amazed , temperate and furious , loyal and neutral in an instant , but would sometimes ring the changes backwards and forwards on all possible moods and flights in one short quarter of an hour ; performing , as it were , a kind of triple bob major on the peal of instruments in the female belfry , with a skilfulness and rapidity of execution that astonished all who heard her .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 133]: It had been observed in this good lady -LRB- who did not want for personal attractions , being plump and buxom to look at , though like her fair daughter , somewhat short in stature -RRB- that this uncertainty of disposition strengthened and increased with her temporal prosperity ; and divers wise men and matrons , on friendly terms with the locksmith and his family , even went so far as to assert , that a tumble down some half-dozen rounds in the world 's ladder -- such as the breaking of the bank in which her husband kept his money , or some little fall of that kind -- would be the making of her , and could hardly fail to render her one of the most agreeable companions in existence .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 50]: Whether they were right or wrong in this conjecture , certain it is that minds , like bodies , will often fall into a pimpled ill-conditioned state from mere excess of comfort , and like them , are often successfully cured by remedies in themselves very nauseous and unpalatable .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 58]: Mrs Varden 's chief aider and abettor , and at the same time her principal victim and object of wrath , was her single domestic servant , one Miss Miggs ; or as she was called , in conformity with those prejudices of society which lop and top from poor hand-maidens all such genteel excrescences -- Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 40]: This Miggs was a tall young lady , very much addicted to pattens in private life ; slender and shrewish , of a rather uncomfortable figure , and though not absolutely ill-looking , of a sharp and acid visage .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 40]: As a general principle and abstract proposition , Miggs held the male sex to be utterly contemptible and unworthy of notice ; to be fickle , false , base , sottish , inclined to perjury , and wholly undeserving .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 127]: When particularly exasperated against them -LRB- which , scandal said , was when Sim Tappertit slighted her most -RRB- she was accustomed to wish with great emphasis that the whole race of women could but die off , in order that the men might be brought to know the real value of the blessings by which they set so little store ; nay , her feeling for her order ran so high , that she sometimes declared , if she could only have good security for a fair , round number -- say ten thousand -- of young virgins following her example , she would , to spite mankind , hang , drown , stab , or poison herself , with a joy past all expression .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 30]: It was the voice of Miggs that greeted the locksmith , when he knocked at his own house , with a shrill cry of ` Who 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 11]: ` Me , girl , me , ' returned Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 7]: What , already , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 12]: said Miggs , opening the door with a look of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 17]: ` We were just getting on our nightcaps to sit up , -- me and mistress .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 9]: Oh , she has been SO bad ! '
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 46]: Miggs said this with an air of uncommon candour and concern ; but the parlour-door was standing open , and as Gabriel very well knew for whose ears it was designed , he regarded her with anything but an approving look as he passed in .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 19]: ` Master 's come home , mim , ' cried Miggs , running before him into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 12]: ` You was wrong , mim , and I was right .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 17]: I thought he would n't keep us up so late , two nights running , mim .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: Master 's always considerate so far .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 11]: I 'm so glad , mim , on your account .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 35]: I 'm a little ' -- here Miggs simpered -- ' a little sleepy myself ; I 'll own it now , mim , though I said I was n't when you asked me .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 13]: It ai n't of no consequence , mim , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 36]: ` You had better , ' said the locksmith , who most devoutly wished that Barnaby 's raven was at Miggs 's ankles , ` you had better get to bed at once then . '
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 56]: ` Thanking you kindly , sir , ' returned Miggs , ' I could n't take my rest in peace , nor fix my thoughts upon my prayers , otherways than that I knew mistress was comfortable in her bed this night ; by rights she ought to have been there , hours ago . '
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 22]: ` You 're talkative , mistress , ' said Varden , pulling off his greatcoat , and looking at her askew .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 66]: ` Taking the hint , sir , ' cried Miggs , with a flushed face , ` and thanking you for it most kindly , I will make bold to say , that if I give offence by having consideration for my mistress , I do not ask your pardon , but am content to get myself into trouble and to be in suffering . '
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 42]: Here Mrs Varden , who , with her countenance shrouded in a large nightcap , had been all this time intent upon the Protestant Manual , looked round , and acknowledged Miggs 's championship by commanding her to hold her tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 30]: Every little bone in Miggs 's throat and neck developed itself with a spitefulness quite alarming , as she replied , ` Yes , mim , I will . '
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 12]: ` How do you find yourself now , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 29]: said the locksmith , taking a chair near his wife -LRB- who had resumed her book -RRB- , and rubbing his knees hard as he made the inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 13]: ` You 're very anxious to know , a n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 11]: returned Mrs Varden , with her eyes upon the print .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 23]: ` You , that have not been near me all day , and would n't have been if I was dying ! '
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: ` My dear Martha -- ' said Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 43]: Mrs Varden turned over to the next page ; then went back again to the bottom line over leaf to be quite sure of the last words ; and then went on reading with an appearance of the deepest interest and study .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 27]: ` My dear Martha , ' said the locksmith , ` how can you say such things , when you know you do n't mean them ?
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 5]: If you were dying !
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 25]: Why , if there was anything serious the matter with you , Martha , should n't I be in constant attendance upon you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 14]: cried Mrs Varden , bursting into tears , ` yes , you would .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 8]: I do n't doubt it , Varden .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 4]: Certainly you would .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 39]: That 's as much as to tell me that you would be hovering round me like a vulture , waiting till the breath was out of my body , that you might go and marry somebody else . '
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 21]: Miggs groaned in sympathy -- a little short groan , checked in its birth , and changed into a cough .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 12]: It seemed to say , ' I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 15]: It 's wrung from me by the dreadful brutality of that monster master . '
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 30]: ` But you 'll break my heart one of these days , ' added Mrs Varden , with more resignation , ` and then we shall both be happy .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 26]: My only desire is to see Dolly comfortably settled , and when she is , you may settle ME as soon as you like . '
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 7]: cried Miggs -- and coughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 26]: Poor Gabriel twisted his wig about in silence for a long time , and then said mildly , ` Has Dolly gone to bed ? '
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 23]: ` Your master speaks to you , ' said Mrs Varden , looking sternly over her shoulder at Miss Miggs in waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 16]: ` No , my dear , I spoke to you , ' suggested the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 9]: ` Did you hear me , Miggs ? '
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 12]: cried the obdurate lady , stamping her foot upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 12]: ` YOU are beginning to despise me now , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 6]: But this is example ! '
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 56]: At this cruel rebuke , Miggs , whose tears were always ready , for large or small parties , on the shortest notice and the most reasonable terms , fell a crying violently ; holding both her hands tight upon her heart meanwhile , as if nothing less would prevent its splitting into small fragments .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 59]: Mrs Varden , who likewise possessed that faculty in high perfection , wept too , against Miggs ; and with such effect that Miggs gave in after a time , and , except for an occasional sob , which seemed to threaten some remote intention of breaking out again , left her mistress in possession of the field .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 19]: Her superiority being thoroughly asserted , that lady soon desisted likewise , and fell into a quiet melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 59]: The relief was so great , and the fatiguing occurrences of last night so completely overpowered the locksmith , that he nodded in his chair , and would doubtless have slept there all night , but for the voice of Mrs Varden , which , after a pause of some five minutes , awoke him with a start .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 55]: ` If I am ever , ' said Mrs V. -- not scolding , but in a sort of monotonous remonstrance -- ` in spirits , if I am ever cheerful , if I am ever more than usually disposed to be talkative and comfortable , this is the way I am treated . '
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 18]: ` Such spirits as you was in too , mim , but half an hour ago ! '
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 4]: cried Miggs . '
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 7]: I never see such company ! '
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 58]: ` Because , ' said Mrs Varden , ` because I never interfere or interrupt ; because I never question where anybody comes or goes ; because my whole mind and soul is bent on saving where I can save , and labouring in this house ; -- therefore , they try me as they do . '
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 24]: ` Martha , ' urged the locksmith , endeavouring to look as wakeful as possible , ` what is it you complain of ?
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 13]: I really came home with every wish and desire to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 6]: I did , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 8]: ` What do I complain of ! '
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 4]: retorted his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 37]: ` Is it a chilling thing to have one 's husband sulking and falling asleep directly he comes home -- to have him freezing all one 's warm-heartedness , and throwing cold water over the fireside ?
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 52]: Is it natural , when I know he went out upon a matter in which I am as much interested as anybody can be , that I should wish to know all that has happened , or that he should tell me without my begging and praying him to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 11]: Is that natural , or is it not ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 14]: I am very sorry , Martha , ' said the good-natured locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 29]: I was really afraid you were not disposed to talk pleasantly ; I 'll tell you everything ; I shall only be too glad , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 15]: ` No , Varden , ' returned his wife , rising with dignity . '
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 7]: I dare say -- thank you !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 26]: I 'm not a child to be corrected one minute and petted the next -- I 'm a little too old for that , Varden .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 6]: Miggs , carry the light .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 57]: -- YOU can be cheerful , Miggs , at least ' Miggs , who , to this moment , had been in the very depths of compassionate despondency , passed instantly into the liveliest state conceivable , and tossing her head as she glanced towards the locksmith , bore off her mistress and the light together .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 34]: ` Now , who would think , ' thought Varden , shrugging his shoulders and drawing his chair nearer to the fire , ` that that woman could ever be pleasant and agreeable ?
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 6]: And yet she can be .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 11]: Well , well , all of us have our faults .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 8]: I 'll not be hard upon hers .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 12]: We have been man and wife too long for that . '
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 16]: He dozed again -- not the less pleasantly , perhaps , for his hearty temper .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 35]: While his eyes were closed , the door leading to the upper stairs was partially opened ; and a head appeared , which , at sight of him , hastily drew back again . '
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 26]: I wish , ' murmured Gabriel , waking at the noise , and looking round the room , ' I wish somebody would marry Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 5]: But that 's impossible !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 15]: I wonder whether there 's any madman alive , who would marry Miggs ! '
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 24]: This was such a vast speculation that he fell into a doze again , and slept until the fire was quite burnt out .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 28]: At last he roused himself ; and having double-locked the street-door according to custom , and put the key in his pocket , went off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 30]: He had not left the room in darkness many minutes , when the head again appeared , and Sim Tappertit entered , bearing in his hand a little lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 14]: ` What the devil business has he to stop up so late ! '
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 16]: muttered Sim , passing into the workshop , and setting it down upon the forge .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 9]: ` Here 's half the night gone already .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 34]: There 's only one good that has ever come to me , out of this cursed old rusty mechanical trade , and that 's this piece of ironmongery , upon my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 43]: As he spoke , he drew from the right hand , or rather right leg pocket of his smalls , a clumsy large-sized key , which he inserted cautiously in the lock his master had secured , and softly opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 56]: That done , he replaced his piece of secret workmanship in his pocket ; and leaving the lamp burning , and closing the door carefully and without noise , stole out into the street -- as little suspected by the locksmith in his sound deep sleep , as by Barnaby himself in his phantom-haunted dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 59]: Chapter 8 Clear of the locksmith 's house , Sim Tappertit laid aside his cautious manner , and assuming in its stead that of a ruffling , swaggering , roving blade , who would rather kill a man than otherwise , and eat him too if needful , made the best of his way along the darkened streets .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 67]: Half pausing for an instant now and then to smite his pocket and assure himself of the safety of his master key , he hurried on to Barbican , and turning into one of the narrowest of the narrow streets which diverged from that centre , slackened his pace and wiped his heated brow , as if the termination of his walk were near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 30]: It was not a very choice spot for midnight expeditions , being in truth one of more than questionable character , and of an appearance by no means inviting .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 38]: From the main street he had entered , itself little better than an alley , a low-browed doorway led into a blind court , or yard , profoundly dark , unpaved , and reeking with stagnant odours .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 51]: Into this ill-favoured pit , the locksmith 's vagrant ` prentice groped his way ; and stopping at a house from whose defaced and rotten front the rude effigy of a bottle swung to and fro like some gibbeted malefactor , struck thrice upon an iron grating with his foot .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 23]: After listening in vain for some response to his signal , Mr Tappertit became impatient , and struck the grating thrice again .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 13]: A further delay ensued , but it was not of long duration .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 15]: The ground seemed to open at his feet , and a ragged head appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 7]: ` Is that the captain ? '
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 9]: said a voice as ragged as the head .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 21]: ` Yes , ' replied Mr Tappertit haughtily , descending as he spoke , ` who should it be ? '
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 27]: ` It 's so late , we gave you up , ' returned the voice , as its owner stopped to shut and fasten the grating .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 8]: ` You 're late , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 23]: ` Lead on , ' said Mr Tappertit , with a gloomy majesty , ` and make remarks when I require you .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 3]: Forward ! '
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 47]: This latter word of command was perhaps somewhat theatrical and unnecessary , inasmuch as the descent was by a very narrow , steep , and slippery flight of steps , and any rashness or departure from the beaten track must have ended in a yawning water-butt .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 25]: But Mr Tappertit being , like some other great commanders , favourable to strong effects , and personal display , cried ` Forward ! '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 64]: again , in the hoarsest voice he could assume ; and led the way , with folded arms and knitted brows , to the cellar down below , where there was a small copper fixed in one corner , a chair or two , a form and table , a glimmering fire , and a truckle-bed , covered with a ragged patchwork rug .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 7]: ` Welcome , noble captain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 11]: cried a lanky figure , rising as from a nap .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 4]: The captain nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 22]: Then , throwing off his outer coat , he stood composed in all his dignity , and eyed his follower over .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: ` What news to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 12]: he asked , when he had looked into his very soul .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 39]: ` Nothing particular , ' replied the other , stretching himself -- and he was so long already that it was quite alarming to see him do it -- ` how come you to be so late ? '
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 15]: ` No matter , ' was all the captain deigned to say in answer .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 7]: ` Is the room prepared ? '
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 9]: ` It is , ' replied the follower .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 9]: ` The comrade -- is he here ? '
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 12]: And a sprinkling of the others -- you hear 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 5]: ` Playing skittles ! '
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 5]: said the captain moodily .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 5]: ` Light-hearted revellers ! '
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 35]: There was no doubt respecting the particular amusement in which these heedless spirits were indulging , for even in the close and stifling atmosphere of the vault , the noise sounded like distant thunder .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 74]: It certainly appeared , at first sight , a singular spot to choose , for that or any other purpose of relaxation , if the other cellars answered to the one in which this brief colloquy took place ; for the floors were of sodden earth , the walls and roof of damp bare brick tapestried with the tracks of snails and slugs ; the air was sickening , tainted , and offensive .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 58]: It seemed , from one strong flavour which was uppermost among the various odours of the place , that it had , at no very distant period , been used as a storehouse for cheeses ; a circumstance which , while it accounted for the greasy moisture that hung about it , was agreeably suggestive of rats .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 17]: It was naturally damp besides , and little trees of fungus sprung from every mouldering corner .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 59]: The proprietor of this charming retreat , and owner of the ragged head before mentioned -- for he wore an old tie-wig as bare and frowzy as a stunted hearth-broom -- had by this time joined them ; and stood a little apart , rubbing his hands , wagging his hoary bristled chin , and smiling in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 63]: His eyes were closed ; but had they been wide open , it would have been easy to tell , from the attentive expression of the face he turned towards them -- pale and unwholesome as might be expected in one of his underground existence -- and from a certain anxious raising and quivering of the lids , that he was blind .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 18]: ` Even Stagg hath been asleep , ' said the long comrade , nodding towards this person .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 8]: ` Sound , captain , sound ! '
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 21]: cried the blind man ; ` what does my noble captain drink -- is it brandy , rum , usquebaugh ?
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 9]: Is it soaked gunpowder , or blazing oil ?
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 37]: Give it a name , heart of oak , and we 'd get it for you , if it was wine from a bishop 's cellar , or melted gold from King George 's mint . '
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 45]: ` See , ' said Mr Tappertit haughtily , ` that it 's something strong , and comes quick ; and so long as you take care of that , you may bring it from the devil 's cellar , if you like . '
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 8]: ` Boldly said , noble captain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 5]: rejoined the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 9]: ` Spoken like the ` Prentices ' Glory .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 6]: From the devil 's cellar !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 4]: A brave joke !
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 4]: The captain joketh .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 74]: ` I 'll tell you what , my fine feller , ' said Mr Tappertit , eyeing the host over as he walked to a closet , and took out a bottle and glass as carelessly as if he had been in full possession of his sight , ` if you make that row , you 'll find that the captain 's very far from joking , and so I tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 10]: ` He 's got his eyes on me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 21]: cried Stagg , stopping short on his way back , and affecting to screen his face with the bottle . '
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 10]: I feel 'em though I ca n't see 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 7]: Take 'em off , noble captain .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 10]: Remove 'em , for they pierce like gimlets . '
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 53]: Mr Tappertit smiled grimly at his comrade ; and twisting out one more look -- a kind of ocular screw -- under the influence of which the blind man feigned to undergo great anguish and torture , bade him , in a softened tone , approach , and hold his peace . '
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 55]: I obey you , captain , ' cried Stagg , drawing close to him and filling out a bumper without spilling a drop , by reason that he held his little finger at the brim of the glass , and stopped at the instant the liquor touched it , ` drink , noble governor .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 18]: Death to all masters , life to all ` prentices , and love to all fair damsels .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 12]: Drink , brave general , and warm your gallant heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 12]: Mr Tappertit condescended to take the glass from his outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 23]: Stagg then dropped on one knee , and gently smoothed the calves of his legs , with an air of humble admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 8]: ` That I had but eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 12]: he cried , ` to behold my captain 's symmetrical proportions !
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 17]: That I had but eyes , to look upon these twin invaders of domestic peace ! '
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 5]: ` Get out ! '
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 11]: said Mr Tappertit , glancing downward at his favourite limbs .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 10]: ` Go along , will you , Stagg ! '
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 22]: ` When I touch my own afterwards , ' cried the host , smiting them reproachfully , ' I hate 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 22]: Comparatively speaking , they 've no more shape than wooden legs , beside these models of my noble captain 's . '
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 4]: ` Yours ! '
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 8]: ` No , I should think not .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 21]: Do n't talk about those precious old toothpicks in the same breath with mine ; that 's rather too much .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 2]: Here .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 4]: Take the glass .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 2]: Benjamin .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 3]: Lead on .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 4]: To business ! '
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 43]: With these words , he folded his arms again ; and frowning with a sullen majesty , passed with his companion through a little door at the upper end of the cellar , and disappeared ; leaving Stagg to his private meditations .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 68]: The vault they entered , strewn with sawdust and dimly lighted , was between the outer one from which they had just come , and that in which the skittle-players were diverting themselves ; as was manifested by the increased noise and clamour of tongues , which was suddenly stopped , however , and replaced by a dead silence , at a signal from the long comrade .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 99]: Then , this young gentleman , going to a little cupboard , returned with a thigh-bone , which in former times must have been part and parcel of some individual at least as long as himself , and placed the same in the hands of Mr Tappertit ; who , receiving it as a sceptre and staff of authority , cocked his three-cornered hat fiercely on the top of his head , and mounted a large table , whereon a chair of state , cheerfully ornamented with a couple of skulls , was placed ready for his reception .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 54]: He had no sooner assumed this position , than another young gentleman appeared , bearing in his arms a huge clasped book , who made him a profound obeisance , and delivering it to the long comrade , advanced to the table , and turning his back upon it , stood there Atlas-wise .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 64]: Then , the long comrade got upon the table too ; and seating himself in a lower chair than Mr Tappertit 's , with much state and ceremony , placed the large book on the shoulders of their mute companion as deliberately as if he had been a wooden desk , and prepared to make entries therein with a pen of corresponding size .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 33]: When the long comrade had made these preparations , he looked towards Mr Tappertit ; and Mr Tappertit , flourishing the bone , knocked nine times therewith upon one of the skulls .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 27]: At the ninth stroke , a third young gentleman emerged from the door leading to the skittle ground , and bowing low , awaited his commands .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 4]: ` Prentice ! '
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 11]: said the mighty captain , ` who waits without ? '
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 37]: The ` prentice made answer that a stranger was in attendance , who claimed admission into that secret society of ` Prentice Knights , and a free participation in their rights , privileges , and immunities .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 26]: Thereupon Mr Tappertit flourished the bone again , and giving the other skull a prodigious rap on the nose , exclaimed ` Admit him ! '
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 19]: At these dread words the ` prentice bowed once more , and so withdrew as he had come .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 84]: There soon appeared at the same door , two other ` prentices , having between them a third , whose eyes were bandaged , and who was attired in a bag-wig , and a broad-skirted coat , trimmed with tarnished lace ; and who was girded with a sword , in compliance with the laws of the Institution regulating the introduction of candidates , which required them to assume this courtly dress , and kept it constantly in lavender , for their convenience .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 41]: One of the conductors of this novice held a rusty blunderbuss pointed towards his ear , and the other a very ancient sabre , with which he carved imaginary offenders as he came along in a sanguinary and anatomical manner .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 15]: As this silent group advanced , Mr Tappertit fixed his hat upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 14]: The novice then laid his hand upon his breast and bent before him .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 23]: When he had humbled himself sufficiently , the captain ordered the bandage to be removed , and proceeded to eye him over .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: said the captain , thoughtfully , when he had concluded this ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 4]: ` Proceed . '
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 13]: The long comrade read aloud as follows : -- ` Mark Gilbert .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 4]: Age , nineteen .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 12]: Bound to Thomas Curzon , hosier , Golden Fleece , Aldgate .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 5]: Loves Curzon 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 10]: Can not say that Curzon 's daughter loves him .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 5]: Should think it probable .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 9]: Curzon pulled his ears last Tuesday week . '
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 4]: ` How ! '
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: cried the captain , starting .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 15]: ` For looking at his daughter , please you , ' said the novice .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 12]: ` Write Curzon down , Denounced , ' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 12]: ` Put a black cross against the name of Curzon . '
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 36]: ` So please you , ' said the novice , ` that 's not the worst -- he calls his ` prentice idle dog , and stops his beer unless he works to his liking .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 25]: He gives Dutch cheese , too , eating Cheshire , sir , himself ; and Sundays out , are only once a month . '
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 17]: ` This , ' said Mr Tappert ; t gravely , ` is a flagrant case .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 11]: Put two black crosses to the name of Curzon . '
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 109]: ` If the society , ' said the novice , who was an ill-looking , one-sided , shambling lad , with sunken eyes set close together in his head -- ` if the society would burn his house down -- for he 's not insured -- or beat him as he comes home from his club at night , or help me to carry off his daughter , and marry her at the Fleet , whether she gave consent or no -- ' Mr Tappertit waved his grizzly truncheon as an admonition to him not to interrupt , and ordered three black crosses to the name of Curzon .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 18]: ` Which means , ' he said in gracious explanation , ` vengeance , complete and terrible .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 10]: ` Prentice , do you love the Constitution ? '
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 21]: To which the novice -LRB- being to that end instructed by his attendant sponsors -RRB- replied ' I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 16]: ` The Church , the State , and everything established -- but the masters ? '
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 4]: quoth the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 9]: Again the novice said ' I do . '
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 166]: Having said it , he listened meekly to the captain , who in an address prepared for such occasions , told him how that under that same Constitution -LRB- which was kept in a strong box somewhere , but where exactly he could not find out , or he would have endeavoured to procure a copy of it -RRB- , the ` prentices had , in times gone by , had frequent holidays of right , broken people 's heads by scores , defied their masters , nay , even achieved some glorious murders in the streets , which privileges had gradually been wrested from them , and in all which noble aspirations they were now restrained ; how the degrading checks imposed upon them were unquestionably attributable to the innovating spirit of the times , and how they united therefore to resist all change , except such change as would restore those good old English customs , by which they would stand or fall .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 104]: After illustrating the wisdom of going backward , by reference to that sagacious fish , the crab , and the not unfrequent practice of the mule and donkey , he described their general objects ; which were briefly vengeance on their Tyrant Masters -LRB- of whose grievous and insupportable oppression no ` prentice could entertain a moment 's doubt -RRB- and the restoration , as aforesaid , of their ancient rights and holidays ; for neither of which objects were they now quite ripe , being barely twenty strong , but which they pledged themselves to pursue with fire and sword when needful .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 112]: Then he described the oath which every member of that small remnant of a noble body took , and which was of a dreadful and impressive kind ; binding him , at the bidding of his chief , to resist and obstruct the Lord Mayor , sword-bearer , and chaplain ; to despise the authority of the sheriffs ; and to hold the court of aldermen as nought ; but not on any account , in case the fulness of time should bring a general rising of ` prentices , to damage or in any way disfigure Temple Bar , which was strictly constitutional and always to be approached with reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 69]: Having gone over these several heads with great eloquence and force , and having further informed the novice that this society had its origin in his own teeming brain , stimulated by a swelling sense of wrong and outrage , Mr Tappertit demanded whether he had strength of heart to take the mighty pledge required , or whether he would withdraw while retreat was yet in his power .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 83]: To this the novice made rejoinder , that he would take the vow , though it should choke him ; and it was accordingly administered with many impressive circumstances , among which the lighting up of the two skulls with a candle-end inside of each , and a great many flourishes with the bone , were chiefly conspicuous ; not to mention a variety of grave exercises with the blunderbuss and sabre , and some dismal groaning by unseen ` prentices without .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 54]: All these dark and direful ceremonies being at length completed , the table was put aside , the chair of state removed , the sceptre locked up in its usual cupboard , the doors of communication between the three cellars thrown freely open , and the ` Prentice Knights resigned themselves to merriment .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 49]: But Mr Tappertit , who had a soul above the vulgar herd , and who , on account of his greatness , could only afford to be merry now and then , threw himself on a bench with the air of a man who was faint with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 35]: He looked with an indifferent eye , alike on skittles , cards , and dice , thinking only of the locksmith 's daughter , and the base degenerate days on which he had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 24]: ` My noble captain neither games , nor sings , nor dances , ' said his host , taking a seat beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 7]: ` Drink , gallant general ! '
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 54]: Mr Tappertit drained the proffered goblet to the dregs ; then thrust his hands into his pockets , and with a lowering visage walked among the skittles , while his followers -LRB- such is the influence of superior genius -RRB- restrained the ardent ball , and held his little shins in dumb respect .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 45]: ` If I had been born a corsair or a pirate , a brigand , genteel highwayman or patriot -- and they 're the same thing , ' thought Mr Tappertit , musing among the nine-pins , ' I should have been all right .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 15]: But to drag out a ignoble existence unbeknown to mankind in general -- patience !
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 6]: I will be famous yet .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 9]: A voice within me keeps on whispering Greatness .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 21]: I shall burst out one of these days , and when I do , what power can keep me down ?
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 12]: I feel my soul getting into my head at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: More drink there ! '
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 43]: ` The novice , ' pursued Mr Tappertit , not exactly in a voice of thunder , for his tones , to say the truth were rather cracked and shrill -- but very impressively , notwithstanding -- ` where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 7]: ` Here , noble captain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 3]: cried Stagg .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 13]: ` One stands beside me who I feel is a stranger . '
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 47]: ` Have you , ' said Mr Tappertit , letting his gaze fall on the party indicated , who was indeed the new knight , by this time restored to his own apparel ; ` Have you the impression of your street-door key in wax ? '
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 20]: The long comrade anticipated the reply , by producing it from the shelf on which it had been deposited .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 55]: ` Good , ' said Mr Tappertit , scrutinising it attentively , while a breathless silence reigned around ; for he had constructed secret door-keys for the whole society , and perhaps owed something of his influence to that mean and trivial circumstance -- on such slight accidents do even men of mind depend !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 7]: -- ` This is easily made .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 6]: Come hither , friend . '
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 27]: With that , he beckoned the new knight apart , and putting the pattern in his pocket , motioned to him to walk by his side .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 30]: ` And so , ' he said , when they had taken a few turns up and down , you -- you love your master 's daughter ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: I do , ' said the ` prentice .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 4]: ` Honour bright .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 7]: No chaff , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 51]: ` Have you , ' rejoined Mr Tappertit , catching him by the wrist , and giving him a look which would have been expressive of the most deadly malevolence , but for an accidental hiccup that rather interfered with it ; ` have you a -- a rival ? '
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 13]: ` Not as I know on , ' replied the ` prentice .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 18]: ` If you had now -- ' said Mr Tappertit -- ` what would you -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 12]: -- ' The ` prentice looked fierce and clenched his fists .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 17]: ` It is enough , ' cried Mr Tappertit hastily , ` we understand each other .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 4]: We are observed .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 5]: I thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 108]: So saying , he cast him off again ; and calling the long comrade aside after taking a few hasty turns by himself , bade him immediately write and post against the wall , a notice , proscribing one Joseph Willet -LRB- commonly known as Joe -RRB- of Chigwell ; forbidding all ` Prentice Knights to succour , comfort , or hold communion with him ; and requiring them , on pain of excommunication , to molest , hurt , wrong , annoy , and pick quarrels with the said Joseph , whensoever and wheresoever they , or any of them , should happen to encounter him .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 38]: Having relieved his mind by this energetic proceeding , he condescended to approach the festive board , and warming by degrees , at length deigned to preside , and even to enchant the company with a song .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 81]: After this , he rose to such a pitch as to consent to regale the society with a hornpipe , which be actually performed to the music of a fiddle -LRB- played by an ingenious member -RRB- with such surpassing agility and brilliancy of execution , that the spectators could not be sufficiently enthusiastic in their admiration ; and their host protested , with tears in his eyes , that he had never truly felt his blindness until that moment .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 48]: But the host withdrawing -- probably to weep in secret -- soon returned with the information that it wanted little more than an hour of day , and that all the cocks in Barbican had already begun to crow , as if their lives depended on it .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 42]: At this intelligence , the ` Prentice Knights arose in haste , and marshalling into a line , filed off one by one and dispersed with all speed to their several homes , leaving their leader to pass the grating last .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 28]: ` Good night , noble captain , ' whispered the blind man as he held it open for his passage out ; ` Farewell , brave general .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 7]: Bye , bye , illustrious commander .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 18]: Good luck go with you for a -- conceited , bragging , empty-headed , duck-legged idiot . '
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 139]: With which parting words , coolly added as he listened to his receding footsteps and locked the grate upon himself , he descended the steps , and lighting the fire below the little copper , prepared , without any assistance , for his daily occupation ; which was to retail at the area-head above pennyworths of broth and soup , and savoury puddings , compounded of such scraps as were to be bought in the heap for the least money at Fleet Market in the evening time ; and for the sale of which he had need to have depended chiefly on his private connection , for the court had no thoroughfare , and was not that kind of place in which many people were likely to take the air , or to frequent as an agreeable promenade .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 45]: Chapter 9 Chronicler 's are privileged to enter where they list , to come and go through keyholes , to ride upon the wind , to overcome , in their soarings up and down , all obstacles of distance , time , and place .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 39]: Thrice blessed be this last consideration , since it enables us to follow the disdainful Miggs even into the sanctity of her chamber , and to hold her in sweet companionship through the dreary watches of the night !
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 49]: Miss Miggs , having undone her mistress , as she phrased it -LRB- which means , assisted to undress her -RRB- , and having seen her comfortably to bed in the back room on the first floor , withdrew to her own apartment , in the attic story .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 42]: Notwithstanding her declaration in the locksmith 's presence , she was in no mood for sleep ; so , putting her light upon the table and withdrawing the little window curtain , she gazed out pensively at the wild night sky .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 67]: Perhaps she wondered what star was destined for her habitation when she had run her little course below ; perhaps speculated which of those glimmering spheres might be the natal orb of Mr Tappertit ; perhaps marvelled how they could gaze down on that perfidious creature , man , and not sicken and turn green as chemists ' lamps ; perhaps thought of nothing in particular .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 58]: Whatever she thought about , there she sat , until her attention , alive to anything connected with the insinuating ` prentice , was attracted by a noise in the next room to her own -- his room ; the room in which he slept , and dreamed -- it might be , sometimes dreamed of her .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 63]: That he was not dreaming now , unless he was taking a walk in his sleep , was clear , for every now and then there came a shuffling noise , as though he were engaged in polishing the whitewashed wall ; then a gentle creaking of his door ; then the faintest indication of his stealthy footsteps on the landing-place outside .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 30]: Noting this latter circumstance , Miss Miggs turned pale and shuddered , as mistrusting his intentions ; and more than once exclaimed , below her breath , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 13]: what a Providence it is , as I am bolted in ! '
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 38]: -- which , owing doubtless to her alarm , was a confusion of ideas on her part between a bolt and its use ; for though there was one on the door , it was not fastened .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 52]: Miss Miggs 's sense of hearing , however , having as sharp an edge as her temper , and being of the same snappish and suspicious kind , very soon informed her that the footsteps passed her door , and appeared to have some object quite separate and disconnected from herself .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 24]: At this discovery she became more alarmed than ever , and was about to give utterance to those cries of ` Thieves ! '
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 5]: and ` Murder ! '
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 27]: which she had hitherto restrained , when it occurred to her to look softly out , and see that her fears had some good palpable foundation .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 47]: Looking out accordingly , and stretching her neck over the handrail , she descried , to her great amazement , Mr Tappertit completely dressed , stealing downstairs , one step at a time , with his shoes in one hand and a lamp in the other .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 52]: Following him with her eyes , and going down a little way herself to get the better of an intervening angle , she beheld him thrust his head in at the parlour-door , draw it back again with great swiftness , and immediately begin a retreat upstairs with all possible expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 6]: ` Here 's mysteries ! '
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 19]: said the damsel , when she was safe in her own room again , quite out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 10]: ` Oh , gracious , here 's mysteries ! '
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 21]: The prospect of finding anybody out in anything , would have kept Miss Miggs awake under the influence of henbane .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 30]: Presently , she heard the step again , as she would have done if it had been that of a feather endowed with motion and walking down on tiptoe .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 39]: Then gliding out as before , she again beheld the retreating figure of the ` prentice ; again he looked cautiously in at the parlour-door , but this time instead of retreating , he passed in and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 28]: Miggs was back in her room , and had her head out of the window , before an elderly gentleman could have winked and recovered from it .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 33]: Out he came at the street-door , shut it carefully behind him , tried it with his knee , and swaggered off , putting something in his pocket as he went along .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 9]: At this spectacle Miggs cried ` Gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 9]: again , and then ` Goodness gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 8]: and then ` Goodness gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 14]: and then , candle in hand , went downstairs as he had done .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 22]: Coming to the workshop , she saw the lamp burning on the forge , and everything as Sim had left it .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 39]: ` Why I wish I may only have a walking funeral , and never be buried decent with a mourning-coach and feathers , if the boy has n't been and made a key for his own self ! '
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 3]: cried Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 7]: ` Oh the little villain ! '
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 45]: This conclusion was not arrived at without consideration , and much peeping and peering about ; nor was it unassisted by the recollection that she had on several occasions come upon the ` prentice suddenly , and found him busy at some mysterious occupation .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 79]: Lest the fact of Miss Miggs calling him , on whom she stooped to cast a favourable eye , a boy , should create surprise in any breast , it may be observed that she invariably affected to regard all male bipeds under thirty as mere chits and infants ; which phenomenon is not unusual in ladies of Miss Miggs 's temper , and is indeed generally found to be the associate of such indomitable and savage virtue .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 52]: Miss Miggs deliberated within herself for some little time , looking hard at the shop-door while she did so , as though her eyes and thoughts were both upon it ; and then , taking a sheet of paper from a drawer , twisted it into a long thin spiral tube .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 44]: Having filled this instrument with a quantity of small coal-dust from the forge , she approached the door , and dropping on one knee before it , dexterously blew into the keyhole as much of these fine ashes as the lock would hold .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 27]: When she had filled it to the brim in a very workmanlike and skilful manner , she crept upstairs again , and chuckled as she went .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 27]: cried Miggs , rubbing her hands , ` now let 's see whether you wo n't be glad to take some notice of me , mister .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 6]: He , he , he !
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 14]: You 'll have eyes for somebody besides Miss Dolly now , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 13]: A fat-faced puss she is , as ever I come across ! '
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 31]: As she uttered this criticism , she glanced approvingly at her small mirror , as who should say , I thank my stars that ca n't be said of me !
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 35]: -- as it certainly could not ; for Miss Miggs 's style of beauty was of that kind which Mr Tappertit himself had not inaptly termed , in private , ` scraggy . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 10]: I do n't go to bed this night ! '
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 40]: said Miggs , wrapping herself in a shawl , and drawing a couple of chairs near the window , flouncing down upon one , and putting her feet upon the other , 'till you come home , my lad .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 18]: I would n't , ' said Miggs viciously , ` no , not for five-and-forty pound ! '
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 74]: With that , and with an expression of face in which a great number of opposite ingredients , such as mischief , cunning , malice , triumph , and patient expectation , were all mixed up together in a kind of physiognomical punch , Miss Miggs composed herself to wait and listen , like some fair ogress who had set a trap and was watching for a nibble from a plump young traveller .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 11]: She sat there , with perfect composure , all night .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 29]: At length , just upon break of day , there was a footstep in the street , and presently she could hear Mr Tappertit stop at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 170]: Then she could make out that he tried his key -- that he was blowing into it -- that he knocked it on the nearest post to beat the dust out -- that he took it under a lamp to look at it -- that he poked bits of stick into the lock to clear it -- that he peeped into the keyhole , first with one eye , and then with the other -- that he tried the key again -- that he could n't turn it , and what was worse , could n't get it out -- that he bent it -- that then it was much less disposed to come out than before -- that he gave it a mighty twist and a great pull , and then it came out so suddenly that he staggered backwards -- that he kicked the door -- that he shook it -- finally , that he smote his forehead , and sat down on the step in despair .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 40]: When this crisis had arrived , Miss Miggs , affecting to be exhausted with terror , and to cling to the window-sill for support , put out her nightcap , and demanded in a faint voice who was there .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 7]: Mr Tappertit cried ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 17]: and , backing to the road , exhorted her in frenzied pantomime to secrecy and silence .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 10]: ` Tell me one thing , ' said Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 6]: ` Is it thieves ? '
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 8]: ` No -- no -- no ! '
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 4]: cried Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 17]: ` Then , ' said Miggs , more faintly than before , ` it 's fire .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 6]: Where is it , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 9]: It 's near this room , I know .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 19]: I 've a good conscience , sir , and would much rather die than go down a ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 28]: All I wish is , respecting my love to my married sister , Golden Lion Court , number twenty-sivin , second bell-handle on the right-hand door-post . '
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 4]: ` Miggs ! '
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 11]: cried Mr Tappertit , ` do n't you know me ?
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 11]: Sim , you know -- Sim -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 5]: what about him ! '
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 7]: cried Miggs , clasping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 7]: ` Is he in any danger ?
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 10]: Is he in the midst of flames and blazes !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 6]: Oh gracious , gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 11]: ` Why I 'm here , a n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 10]: rejoined Mr Tappertit , knocking himself on the breast .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: ` Do n't you see me ?
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 9]: What a fool you are , Miggs ! '
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 8]: cried Miggs , unmindful of this compliment .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 30]: ` Why -- so it -- Goodness , what is the meaning of -- If you please , mim , here 's -- ' ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 34]: cried Mr Tappertit , standing on tiptoe , as if by that means he , in the street , were any nearer being able to stop the mouth of Miggs in the garret .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 4]: ` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 19]: -- I 've been out without leave , and something or another 's the matter with the lock .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 19]: Come down , and undo the shop window , that I may get in that way . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 23]: I durs n't do it , Simmun , ' cried Miggs -- for that was her pronunciation of his Christian name . '
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 8]: I durs n't do it , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 12]: You know as well as anybody , how particular I am .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 23]: And to come down in the dead of night , when the house is wrapped in slumbers and weiled in obscurity . '
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 17]: And there she stopped and shivered , for her modesty caught cold at the very thought .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 21]: ` But Miggs , ' cried Mr Tappertit , getting under the lamp , that she might see his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 11]: ` My darling Miggs -- ' Miggs screamed slightly . '
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 43]: -- That I love so much , and never can help thinking of , ' and it is impossible to describe the use he made of his eyes when he said this -- ` do -- for my sake , do . '
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 15]: ` Oh Simmun , ' cried Miggs , ` this is worse than all .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 22]: I know if I come down , you 'll go , and -- ' ` And what , my precious ? '
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 27]: ` And try , ' said Miggs , hysterically , ` to kiss me , or some such dreadfulness ; I know you will ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 15]: I swear I wo n't , ' said Mr Tappertit , with remarkable earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 8]: ` Upon my soul I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 13]: It 's getting broad day , and the watchman 's waking up .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 3]: Angelic Miggs !
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 21]: If you 'll only come and let me in , I promise you faithfully and truly I wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 54]: Miss Miggs , whose gentle heart was touched , did not wait for the oath -LRB- knowing how strong the temptation was , and fearing he might forswear himself -RRB- , but tripped lightly down the stairs , and with her own fair hands drew back the rough fastenings of the workshop window .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 19]: Having helped the wayward ` prentice in , she faintly articulated the words ` Simmun is safe ! '
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 13]: and yielding to her woman 's nature , immediately became insensible . '
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 17]: I knew I should quench her , ' said Sim , rather embarrassed by this circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 36]: ` Of course I was certain it would come to this , but there was nothing else to be done -- if I had n't eyed her over , she would n't have come down .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 2]: Here .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: Keep up a minute , Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 7]: What a slippery figure she is !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 8]: There 's no holding her , comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 12]: Do keep up a minute , Miggs , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 109]: As Miggs , however , was deaf to all entreaties , Mr Tappertit leant her against the wall as one might dispose of a walking-stick or umbrella , until he had secured the window , when he took her in his arms again , and , in short stages and with great difficulty -- arising from her being tall and his being short , and perhaps in some degree from that peculiar physical conformation on which he had already remarked -- carried her upstairs , and planting her , in the same umbrella and walking-stick fashion , just inside her own door , left her to her repose .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 48]: ` He may be as cool as he likes , ' said Miss Miggs , recovering as soon as she was left alone ; ` but I 'm in his confidence and he ca n't help himself , nor could n't if he was twenty Simmunses ! '
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 170]: Chapter 10 It was on one of those mornings , common in early spring , when the year , fickle and changeable in its youth like all other created things , is undecided whether to step backward into winter or forward into summer , and in its uncertainty inclines now to the one and now to the other , and now to both at once -- wooing summer in the sunshine , and lingering still with winter in the shade -- it was , in short , on one of those mornings , when it is hot and cold , wet and dry , bright and lowering , sad and cheerful , withering and genial , in the compass of one short hour , that old John Willet , who was dropping asleep over the copper boiler , was roused by the sound of a horse 's feet , and glancing out at window , beheld a traveller of goodly promise , checking his bridle at the Maypole door .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 141]: He was none of your flippant young fellows , who would call for a tankard of mulled ale , and make themselves as much at home as if they had ordered a hogshead of wine ; none of your audacious young swaggerers , who would even penetrate into the bar -- that solemn sanctuary -- and , smiting old John upon the back , inquire if there was never a pretty girl in the house , and where he hid his little chambermaids , with a hundred other impertinences of that nature ; none of your free-and-easy companions , who would scrape their boots upon the firedogs in the common room , and be not at all particular on the subject of spittoons ; none of your unconscionable blades , requiring impossible chops , and taking unheard-of pickles for granted .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 33]: He was a staid , grave , placid gentleman , something past the prime of life , yet upright in his carriage , for all that , and slim as a greyhound .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 41]: He was well-mounted upon a sturdy chestnut cob , and had the graceful seat of an experienced horseman ; while his riding gear , though free from such fopperies as were then in vogue , was handsome and well chosen .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 71]: He wore a riding-coat of a somewhat brighter green than might have been expected to suit the taste of a gentleman of his years , with a short , black velvet cape , and laced pocket-holes and cuffs , all of a jaunty fashion ; his linen , too , was of the finest kind , worked in a rich pattern at the wrists and throat , and scrupulously white .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 37]: Although he seemed , judging from the mud he had picked up on the way , to have come from London , his horse was as smooth and cool as his own iron-grey periwig and pigtail .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 61]: Neither man nor beast had turned a single hair ; and saving for his soiled skirts and spatter-dashes , this gentleman , with his blooming face , white teeth , exactly-ordered dress , and perfect calmness , might have come from making an elaborate and leisurely toilet , to sit for an equestrian portrait at old John Willet 's gate .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 52]: It must not be supposed that John observed these several characteristics by other than very slow degrees , or that he took in more than half a one at a time , or that he even made up his mind upon that , without a great deal of very serious consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 108]: Indeed , if he had been distracted in the first instance by questionings and orders , it would have taken him at the least a fortnight to have noted what is here set down ; but it happened that the gentleman , being struck with the old house , or with the plump pigeons which were skimming and curtseying about it , or with the tall maypole , on the top of which a weathercock , which had been out of order for fifteen years , performed a perpetual walk to the music of its own creaking , sat for some little time looking round in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 52]: Hence John , standing with his hand upon the horse 's bridle , and his great eyes on the rider , and with nothing passing to divert his thoughts , had really got some of these little circumstances into his brain by the time he was called upon to speak . '
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 20]: A quaint place this , ' said the gentleman -- and his voice was as rich as his dress .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 7]: ` Are you the landlord ? '
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 12]: ` At your service , sir , ' replied John Willet .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 62]: ` You can give my horse good stabling , can you , and me an early dinner -LRB- I am not particular what , so that it be cleanly served -RRB- , and a decent room of which there seems to be no lack in this great mansion , ' said the stranger , again running his eyes over the exterior .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 22]: ` You can have , sir , ' returned John with a readiness quite surprising , ` anything you please . '
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 30]: ` It 's well I am easily satisfied , ' returned the other with a smile , ` or that might prove a hardy pledge , my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 21]: And saying so , he dismounted , with the aid of the block before the door , in a twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 4]: ` Halloa there !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 3]: Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 4]: roared John . '
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 53]: I ask your pardon , sir , for keeping you standing in the porch ; but my son has gone to town on business , and the boy being , as I may say , of a kind of use to me , I 'm rather put out when he 's away .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 2]: Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 37]: -- a dreadful idle vagrant fellow , sir , half a gipsy , as I think -- always sleeping in the sun in summer , and in the straw in winter time , sir -- Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 13]: Dear Lord , to keep a gentleman a waiting here through him !
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 3]: -- Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 12]: I wish that chap was dead , I do indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 11]: ` Possibly he is , ' returned the other . '
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 18]: I should think if he were living , he would have heard you by this time . '
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 41]: ` In his fits of laziness , he sleeps so desperate hard , ' said the distracted host , ` that if you were to fire off cannon-balls into his ears , it would n't wake him , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 87]: The guest made no remark upon this novel cure for drowsiness , and recipe for making people lively , but , with his hands clasped behind him , stood in the porch , very much amused to see old John , with the bridle in his hand , wavering between a strong impulse to abandon the animal to his fate , and a half disposition to lead him into the house , and shut him up in the parlour , while he waited on his master .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 12]: ` Pillory the fellow , here he is at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 13]: cried John , in the very height and zenith of his distress .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 11]: ` Did you hear me a calling , villain ? '
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 39]: The figure he addressed made no answer , but putting his hand upon the saddle , sprung into it at a bound , turned the horse 's head towards the stable , and was gone in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 13]: ` Brisk enough when he is awake , ' said the guest .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 7]: ` Brisk enough , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 26]: replied John , looking at the place where the horse had been , as if not yet understanding quite , what had become of him .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 7]: ` He melts , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 8]: He goes like a drop of froth .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 10]: You look at him , and there he is .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 14]: You look at him again , and -- there he is n't . '
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 54]: Having , in the absence of any more words , put this sudden climax to what he had faintly intended should be a long explanation of the whole life and character of his man , the oracular John Willet led the gentleman up his wide dismantled staircase into the Maypole 's best apartment .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 120]: It was spacious enough in all conscience , occupying the whole depth of the house , and having at either end a great bay window , as large as many modern rooms ; in which some few panes of stained glass , emblazoned with fragments of armorial bearings , though cracked , and patched , and shattered , yet remained ; attesting , by their presence , that the former owner had made the very light subservient to his state , and pressed the sun itself into his list of flatterers ; bidding it , when it shone into his chamber , reflect the badges of his ancient family , and take new hues and colours from their pride .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 27]: But those were old days , and now every little ray came and went as it would ; telling the plain , bare , searching truth .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 26]: Although the best room of the inn , it had the melancholy aspect of grandeur in decay , and was much too vast for comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 66]: Rich rustling hangings , waving on the walls ; and , better far , the rustling of youth and beauty 's dress ; the light of women 's eyes , outshining the tapers and their own rich jewels ; the sound of gentle tongues , and music , and the tread of maiden feet , had once been there , and filled it with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 12]: But they were gone , and with them all its gladness .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 68]: It was no longer a home ; children were never born and bred there ; the fireside had become mercenary -- a something to be bought and sold -- a very courtezan : let who would die , or sit beside , or leave it , it was still the same -- it missed nobody , cared for nobody , had equal warmth and smiles for all .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 22]: God help the man whose heart ever changes with the world , as an old mansion when it becomes an inn !
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 45]: No effort had been made to furnish this chilly waste , but before the broad chimney a colony of chairs and tables had been planted on a square of carpet , flanked by a ghostly screen , enriched with figures , grinning and grotesque .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 65]: After lighting with his own hands the faggots which were heaped upon the hearth , old John withdrew to hold grave council with his cook , touching the stranger 's entertainment ; while the guest himself , seeing small comfort in the yet unkindled wood , opened a lattice in the distant window , and basked in a sickly gleam of cold March sun .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 50]: Leaving the window now and then , to rake the crackling logs together , or pace the echoing room from end to end , he closed it when the fire was quite burnt up , and having wheeled the easiest chair into the warmest corner , summoned John Willet .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 7]: ` Sir , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 9]: He wanted pen , ink , and paper .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 16]: There was an old standish on the mantelshelf containing a dusty apology for all three .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 18]: Having set this before him , the landlord was retiring , when he motioned him to stay .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 33]: ` There 's a house not far from here , ' said the guest when he had written a few lines , ` which you call the Warren , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 58]: As this was said in the tone of one who knew the fact , and asked the question as a thing of course , John contented himself with nodding his head in the affirmative ; at the same time taking one hand out of his pockets to cough behind , and then putting it in again . '
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 36]: I want this note ' -- said the guest , glancing on what he had written , and folding it , ` conveyed there without loss of time , and an answer brought back here .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 8]: Have you a messenger at hand ? '
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 14]: John was thoughtful for a minute or thereabouts , and then said Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 11]: ` Let me see him , ' said the guest .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 59]: This was disconcerting ; for Joe being out , and Hugh engaged in rubbing down the chestnut cob , he designed sending on the errand , Barnaby , who had just then arrived in one of his rambles , and who , so that he thought himself employed on a grave and serious business , would go anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 68]: ` Why the truth is , ' said John after a long pause , ` that the person who 'd go quickest , is a sort of natural , as one may say , sir ; and though quick of foot , and as much to be trusted as the post itself , he 's not good at talking , being touched and flighty , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 39]: ` You do n't , ' said the guest , raising his eyes to John 's fat face , ` you do n't mean -- what 's the fellow 's name -- you do n't mean Barnaby ? '
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 19]: ` Yes , I do , ' returned the landlord , his features turning quite expressive with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 9]: ` How comes he to be here ? '
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 39]: inquired the guest , leaning back in his chair ; speaking in the bland , even tone , from which he never varied ; and with the same soft , courteous , never-changing smile upon his face . '
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 9]: I saw him in London last night . '
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 33]: ` He 's , for ever , here one hour , and there the next , ' returned old John , after the usual pause to get the question in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 9]: ` Sometimes he walks , and sometimes runs .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 24]: He 's known along the road by everybody , and sometimes comes here in a cart or chaise , and sometimes riding double .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 21]: He comes and goes , through wind , rain , snow , and hail , and on the darkest nights .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 5]: Nothing hurts HIM . '
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 13]: ` He goes often to the Warren , does he not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 6]: said the guest carelessly . '
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 14]: I seem to remember his mother telling me something to that effect yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 12]: But I was not attending to the good woman much . '
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 16]: ` You 're right , sir , ' John made answer , ` he does .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 12]: His father , sir , was murdered in that house . '
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 25]: ` So I have heard , ' returned the guest , taking a gold toothpick from his pocket with the same sweet smile . '
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 9]: A very disagreeable circumstance for the family . '
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 37]: ` Very , ' said John with a puzzled look , as if it occurred to him , dimly and afar off , that this might by possibility be a cool way of treating the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 51]: ` All the circumstances after a murder , ' said the guest soliloquising , ` must be dreadfully unpleasant -- so much bustle and disturbance -- no repose -- a constant dwelling upon one subject -- and the running in and out , and up and down stairs , intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 20]: I would n't have such a thing happen to anybody I was nearly interested in , on any account .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: ` Twould be enough to wear one 's life out .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 18]: -- You were going to say , friend -- ' he added , turning to John again .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 35]: ` Only that Mrs Rudge lives on a little pension from the family , and that Barnaby 's as free of the house as any cat or dog about it , ' answered John .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 10]: ` Shall he do your errand , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: ` Oh yes , ' replied the guest .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 4]: ` Oh certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 8]: Let him do it by all means .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 14]: Please to bring him here that I may charge him to be quick .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 14]: If he objects to come you may tell him it 's Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 11]: He will remember my name , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 46]: John was so very much astonished to find who his visitor was , that he could express no astonishment at all , by looks or otherwise , but left the room as if he were in the most placid and imperturbable of all possible conditions .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 71]: It has been reported that when he got downstairs , he looked steadily at the boiler for ten minutes by the clock , and all that time never once left off shaking his head ; for which statement there would seem to be some ground of truth and feasibility , inasmuch as that interval of time did certainly elapse , before he returned with Barnaby to the guest 's apartment .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 11]: ` Come hither , lad , ' said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 8]: ` You know Mr Geoffrey Haredale ? '
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 20]: Barnaby laughed , and looked at the landlord as though he would say , ` You hear him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 27]: John , who was greatly shocked at this breach of decorum , clapped his finger to his nose , and shook his head in mute remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 27]: ` He knows him , sir , ' said John , frowning aside at Barnaby , ` as well as you or I do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 17]: I have n't the pleasure of much acquaintance with the gentleman , ' returned his guest .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 5]: ` YOU may have .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 10]: Limit the comparison to yourself , my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 42]: Although this was said with the same easy affability , and the same smile , John felt himself put down , and laying the indignity at Barnaby 's door , determined to kick his raven , on the very first opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 37]: ` Give that , ' said the guest , who had by this time sealed the note , and who beckoned his messenger towards him as he spoke , ` into Mr Haredale 's own hands .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 13]: Wait for an answer , and bring it back to me here .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 24]: If you should find that Mr Haredale is engaged just now , tell him -- can he remember a message , landlord ? '
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 11]: ` When he chooses , sir , ' replied John .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 9]: ` He wo n't forget this one . '
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 9]: ` How are you sure of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 30]: John merely pointed to him as he stood with his head bent forward , and his earnest gaze fixed closely on his questioner 's face ; and nodded sagely .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 45]: ` Tell him then , Barnaby , should he be engaged , ' said Mr Chester , ` that I shall be glad to wait his convenience here , and to see him -LRB- if he will call -RRB- at any time this evening .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 17]: -- At the worst I can have a bed here , Willet , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 86]: Old John , immensely flattered by the personal notoriety implied in this familiar form of address , answered , with something like a knowing look , ' I should believe you could , sir , ' and was turning over in his mind various forms of eulogium , with the view of selecting one appropriate to the qualities of his best bed , when his ideas were put to flight by Mr Chester giving Barnaby the letter , and bidding him make all speed away .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 4]: ` Speed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 14]: said Barnaby , folding the little packet in his breast , ` Speed !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 12]: If you want to see hurry and mystery , come here .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 3]: Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 33]: With that , he put his hand , very much to John Willet 's horror , on the guest 's fine broadcloth sleeve , and led him stealthily to the back window .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 36]: ` Look down there , ' he said softly ; ` do you mark how they whisper in each other 's ears ; then dance and leap , to make believe they are in sport ?
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 42]: Do you see how they stop for a moment , when they think there is no one looking , and mutter among themselves again ; and then how they roll and gambol , delighted with the mischief they 've been plotting ?
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 5]: Look at 'em now .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 7]: See how they whirl and plunge .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 29]: And now they stop again , and whisper , cautiously together -- little thinking , mind , how often I have lain upon the grass and watched them .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 11]: I say what is it that they plot and hatch ?
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 5]: Do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 31]: ` They are only clothes , ' returned the guest , ` such as we wear ; hanging on those lines to dry , and fluttering in the wind . '
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 4]: ` Clothes ! '
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 14]: echoed Barnaby , looking close into his face , and falling quickly back .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 15]: Why , how much better to be silly , than as wise as you !
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 18]: You do n't see shadowy people there , like those that live in sleep -- not you .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 37]: Nor eyes in the knotted panes of glass , nor swift ghosts when it blows hard , nor do you hear voices in the air , nor see men stalking in the sky -- not you !
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 13]: I lead a merrier life than you , with all your cleverness .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 6]: You 're the dull men .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 6]: We 're the bright ones .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 17]: I 'll not change with you , clever as you are , -- not I ! '
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 16]: With that , he waved his hat above his head , and darted off . '
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 9]: A strange creature , upon my word ! '
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 17]: said the guest , pulling out a handsome box , and taking a pinch of snuff .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 26]: ` He wants imagination , ' said Mr Willet , very slowly , and after a long silence ; ` that 's what he wants .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 39]: I 've tried to instil it into him , many and many 's the time ; but ' -- John added this in confidence -- ` he a n't made for it ; that 's the fact . '
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 30]: To record that Mr Chester smiled at John 's remark would be little to the purpose , for he preserved the same conciliatory and pleasant look at all times .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 38]: He drew his chair nearer to the fire though , as a kind of hint that he would prefer to be alone , and John , having no reasonable excuse for remaining , left him to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 50]: Very thoughtful old John Willet was , while the dinner was preparing ; and if his brain were ever less clear at one time than another , it is but reasonable to suppose that he addled it in no slight degree by shaking his head so much that day .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 68]: That Mr Chester , between whom and Mr Haredale , it was notorious to all the neighbourhood , a deep and bitter animosity existed , should come down there for the sole purpose , as it seemed , of seeing him , and should choose the Maypole for their place of meeting , and should send to him express , were stumbling blocks John could not overcome .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 20]: The only resource he had , was to consult the boiler , and wait impatiently for Barnaby 's return .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 7]: But Barnaby delayed beyond all precedent .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 42]: The visitor 's dinner was served , removed , his wine was set , the fire replenished , the hearth clean swept ; the light waned without , it grew dusk , became quite dark , and still no Barnaby appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 53]: Yet , though John Willet was full of wonder and misgiving , his guest sat cross-legged in the easy-chair , to all appearance as little ruffled in his thoughts as in his dress -- the same calm , easy , cool gentleman , without a care or thought beyond his golden toothpick .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 36]: ` Barnaby 's late , ' John ventured to observe , as he placed a pair of tarnished candlesticks , some three feet high , upon the table , and snuffed the lights they held .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 15]: ` He is rather so , ' replied the guest , sipping his wine .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 13]: ` He will not be much longer , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 8]: John coughed and raked the fire together .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 78]: ` As your roads bear no very good character , if I may judge from my son 's mishap , though , ' said Mr Chester , ` and as I have no fancy to be knocked on the head -- which is not only disconcerting at the moment , but places one , besides , in a ridiculous position with respect to the people who chance to pick one up -- I shall stop here to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 12]: I think you said you had a bed to spare . '
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 30]: ` Such a bed , sir , ' returned John Willet ; ` ay , such a bed as few , even of the gentry 's houses , own .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 6]: A fixter here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 14]: I 've heard say that bedstead is nigh two hundred years of age .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 22]: Your noble son -- a fine young gentleman -- slept in it last , sir , half a year ago . '
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: ` Upon my life , a recommendation ! '
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 16]: said the guest , shrugging his shoulders and wheeling his chair nearer to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 22]: ` See that it be well aired , Mr Willet , and let a blazing fire be lighted there at once .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 9]: This house is something damp and chilly . '
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 44]: John raked the faggots up again , more from habit than presence of mind , or any reference to this remark , and was about to withdraw , when a bounding step was heard upon the stair , and Barnaby came panting in .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 21]: ` He 'll have his foot in the stirrup in an hour 's time , ' he cried , advancing .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 37]: ` He has been riding hard all day -- has just come home -- but will be in the saddle again as soon as he has eat and drank , to meet his loving friend . '
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 7]: ` Was that his message ? '
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 22]: asked the visitor , looking up , but without the smallest discomposure -- or at least without the show of any .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 11]: ` All but the last words , ' Barnaby rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 5]: ` He meant those .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 9]: I saw that , in his face . '
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 24]: ` This for your pains , ' said the other , putting money in his hand , and glancing at him steadfastly . '
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 9]: This for your pains , sharp Barnaby . '
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 34]: ` For Grip , and me , and Hugh , to share among us , ' he rejoined , putting it up , and nodding , as he counted it on his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 32]: ` Grip one , me two , Hugh three ; the dog , the goat , the cats -- well , we shall spend it pretty soon , I warn you .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 2]: Stay .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 3]: -- Look .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 11]: Do you wise men see nothing there , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 27]: He bent eagerly down on one knee , and gazed intently at the smoke , which was rolling up the chimney in a thick black cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 31]: John Willet , who appeared to consider himself particularly and chiefly referred to under the term wise men , looked that way likewise , and with great solidity of feature .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 24]: ` Now , where do they go to , when they spring so fast up there , ' asked Barnaby ; ` eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 41]: Why do they tread so closely on each other 's heels , and why are they always in a hurry -- which is what you blame me for , when I only take pattern by these busy folk about me ?
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 4]: More of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 17]: catching to each other 's skirts ; and as fast as they go , others come !
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 7]: What a merry dance it is !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 12]: I would that Grip and I could frisk like that ! '
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: ` What has he in that basket at his back ? '
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 28]: asked the guest after a few moments , during which Barnaby was still bending down to look higher up the chimney , and earnestly watching the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 5]: ` In this ? '
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 25]: he answered , jumping up , before John Willet could reply -- shaking it as he spoke , and stooping his head to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 4]: ` In this !
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 5]: What is there here ?
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 5]: Tell him ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 10]: A devil , a devil , a devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 5]: cried a hoarse voice .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 6]: ` Here 's money ! '
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 18]: said Barnaby , chinking it in his hand , ` money for a treat , Grip ! '
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 3]: ` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 3]: Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 10]: replied the raven , ` keep up your spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 4]: Never say die .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 7]: Bow , wow , wow ! '
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 69]: Mr Willet , who appeared to entertain strong doubts whether a customer in a laced coat and fine linen could be supposed to have any acquaintance even with the existence of such unpolite gentry as the bird claimed to belong to , took Barnaby off at this juncture , with the view of preventing any other improper declarations , and quitted the room with his very best bow .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 97]: Chapter 11 There was great news that night for the regular Maypole customers , to each of whom , as he straggled in to occupy his allotted seat in the chimney-corner , John , with a most impressive slowness of delivery , and in an apoplectic whisper , communicated the fact that Mr Chester was alone in the large room upstairs , and was waiting the arrival of Mr Geoffrey Haredale , to whom he had sent a letter -LRB- doubtless of a threatening nature -RRB- by the hands of Barnaby , then and there present .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 25]: For a little knot of smokers and solemn gossips , who had seldom any new topics of discussion , this was a perfect Godsend .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 32]: Here was a good , dark-looking mystery progressing under that very roof -- brought home to the fireside , as it were , and enjoyable without the smallest pains or trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 24]: It is extraordinary what a zest and relish it gave to the drink , and how it heightened the flavour of the tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 26]: Every man smoked his pipe with a face of grave and serious delight , and looked at his neighbour with a sort of quiet congratulation .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 114]: Nay , it was felt to be such a holiday and special night , that , on the motion of little Solomon Daisy , every man -LRB- including John himself -RRB- put down his sixpence for a can of flip , which grateful beverage was brewed with all despatch , and set down in the midst of them on the brick floor ; both that it might simmer and stew before the fire , and that its fragrant steam , rising up among them , and mixing with the wreaths of vapour from their pipes , might shroud them in a delicious atmosphere of their own , and shut out all the world .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 54]: The very furniture of the room seemed to mellow and deepen in its tone ; the ceiling and walls looked blacker and more highly polished , the curtains of a ruddier red ; the fire burnt clear and high , and the crickets in the hearthstone chirped with a more than wonted satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 17]: There were present two , however , who showed but little interest in the general contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 57]: Of these , one was Barnaby himself , who slept , or , to avoid being beset with questions , feigned to sleep , in the chimney-corner ; the other , Hugh , who , sleeping too , lay stretched upon the bench on the opposite side , in the full glare of the blazing fire .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 19]: The light that fell upon this slumbering form , showed it in all its muscular and handsome proportions .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 42]: It was that of a young man , of a hale athletic figure , and a giant 's strength , whose sunburnt face and swarthy throat , overgrown with jet black hair , might have served a painter for a model .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 46]: Loosely attired , in the coarsest and roughest garb , with scraps of straw and hay -- his usual bed -- clinging here and there , and mingling with his uncombed locks , he had fallen asleep in a posture as careless as his dress .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 61]: The negligence and disorder of the whole man , with something fierce and sullen in his features , gave him a picturesque appearance , that attracted the regards even of the Maypole customers who knew him well , and caused Long Parkes to say that Hugh looked more like a poaching rascal to-night than ever he had seen him yet .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 22]: ` He 's waiting here , I suppose , ' said Solomon , ` to take Mr Haredale 's horse . '
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 12]: ` That 's it , sir , ' replied John Willet .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 12]: ` He 's not often in the house , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 11]: He 's more at his ease among horses than men .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 10]: I look upon him as a animal himself . '
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 49]: Following up this opinion with a shrug that seemed meant to say , ` we ca n't expect everybody to be like us , ' John put his pipe into his mouth again , and smoked like one who felt his superiority over the general run of mankind .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 59]: ` That chap , sir , ' said John , taking it out again after a time , and pointing at him with the stem , ` though he 's got all his faculties about him -- bottled up and corked down , if I may say so , somewheres or another -- ' ` Very good ! '
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 8]: said Parkes , nodding his head . '
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 7]: A very good expression , Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 8]: You 'll be a tackling somebody presently .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 10]: You 're in twig to-night , I see . '
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 45]: ` Take care , ' said Mr Willet , not at all grateful for the compliment , ` that I do n't tackle you , sir , which I shall certainly endeavour to do , if you interrupt me when I 'm making observations .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 36]: -- That chap , I was a saying , though he has all his faculties about him , somewheres or another , bottled up and corked down , has no more imagination than Barnaby has .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 7]: And why has n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 36]: The three friends shook their heads at each other ; saying by that action , without the trouble of opening their lips , ` Do you observe what a philosophical mind our friend has ? '
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 7]: ` Why has n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 12]: said John , gently striking the table with his open hand .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 15]: ` Because they was never drawed out of him when he was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 4]: That 's why .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 20]: What would any of us have been , if our fathers had n't drawed our faculties out of us ?
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 19]: What would my boy Joe have been , if I had n't drawed his faculties out of him ?
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 14]: -- Do you mind what I 'm a saying of , gentlemen ? '
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 8]: we mind you , ' cried Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 10]: ` Go on improving of us , Johnny . '
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 192]: ` Consequently , then , ' said Mr Willet , ` that chap , whose mother was hung when he was a little boy , along with six others , for passing bad notes -- and it 's a blessed thing to think how many people are hung in batches every six weeks for that , and such like offences , as showing how wide awake our government is -- that chap that was then turned loose , and had to mind cows , and frighten birds away , and what not , for a few pence to live on , and so got on by degrees to mind horses , and to sleep in course of time in lofts and litter , instead of under haystacks and hedges , till at last he come to be hostler at the Maypole for his board and lodging and a annual trifle -- that chap that ca n't read nor write , and has never had much to do with anything but animals , and has never lived in any way but like the animals he has lived among , IS a animal .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 21]: And , ' said Mr Willet , arriving at his logical conclusion , ` is to be treated accordingly . '
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 43]: ` Willet , ' said Solomon Daisy , who had exhibited some impatience at the intrusion of so unworthy a subject on their more interesting theme , ` when Mr Chester come this morning , did he order the large room ? '
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 18]: ` He signified , sir , ' said John , ` that he wanted a large apartment .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 3]: Certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 22]: ` Why then , I 'll tell you what , ' said Solomon , speaking softly and with an earnest look .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 15]: ` He and Mr Haredale are going to fight a duel in it . '
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 11]: Everybody looked at Mr Willet , after this alarming suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 27]: Mr Willet looked at the fire , weighing in his own mind the effect which such an occurrence would be likely to have on the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 36]: ` Well , ' said John , ' I do n't know -- I am sure -- I remember that when I went up last , he HAD put the lights upon the mantel-shelf . '
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 51]: ` It 's as plain , ' returned Solomon , ` as the nose on Parkes 's face ' -- Mr Parkes , who had a large nose , rubbed it , and looked as if he considered this a personal allusion -- ` they 'll fight in that room .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 20]: You know by the newspapers what a common thing it is for gentlemen to fight in coffee-houses without seconds .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 14]: One of 'em will be wounded or perhaps killed in this house . '
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 13]: ` That was a challenge that Barnaby took then , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 4]: said John . '
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 27]: -- Inclosing a slip of paper with the measure of his sword upon it , I 'll bet a guinea , ' answered the little man .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 11]: ` We know what sort of gentleman Mr Haredale is .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 16]: You have told us what Barnaby said about his looks , when he came back .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 8]: Depend upon it , I 'm right .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 5]: Now , mind . '
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 9]: The flip had had no flavour till now .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 15]: The tobacco had been of mere English growth , compared with its present taste .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 21]: A duel in that great old rambling room upstairs , and the best bed ordered already for the wounded man !
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 11]: ` Would it be swords or pistols , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 4]: ` Heaven knows .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 7]: Perhaps both , ' returned Solomon .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 21]: ` The gentlemen wear swords , and may easily have pistols in their pockets -- most likely have , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 22]: If they fire at each other without effect , then they 'll draw , and go to work in earnest . '
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 41]: A shade passed over Mr Willet 's face as he thought of broken windows and disabled furniture , but bethinking himself that one of the parties would probably be left alive to pay the damage , he brightened up again .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 31]: ` And then , ' said Solomon , looking from face to face , ` then we shall have one of those stains upon the floor that never come out .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 40]: If Mr Haredale wins , depend upon it , it 'll be a deep one ; or if he loses , it will perhaps be deeper still , for he 'll never give in unless he 's beaten down .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 8]: We know him better , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 5]: ` Better indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 5]: they whispered all together .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 26]: ` As to its ever being got out again , ' said Solomon , ' I tell you it never will , or can be .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 21]: Why , do you know that it has been tried , at a certain house we are acquainted with ? '
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 5]: ` The Warren ! '
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 3]: cried John .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 6]: ` No , sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 7]: ` Yes , sure -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 8]: It 's only known by very few .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 11]: It has been whispered about though , for all that .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 11]: They planed the board away , but there it was .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 9]: They went deep , but it went deeper .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 25]: They put new boards down , but there was one great spot that came through still , and showed itself in the old place .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 62]: And -- harkye -- draw nearer -- Mr Geoffrey made that room his study , and sits there , always , with his foot -LRB- as I have heard -RRB- upon it ; and he believes , through thinking of it long and very much , that it will never fade until he finds the man who did the deed . '
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 23]: As this recital ended , and they all drew closer round the fire , the tramp of a horse was heard without .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 6]: ` The very man ! '
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 6]: cried John , starting up .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 3]: ` Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 3]: Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 12]: The sleeper staggered to his feet , and hurried after him .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 55]: John quickly returned , ushering in with great attention and deference -LRB- for Mr Haredale was his landlord -RRB- the long-expected visitor , who strode into the room clanking his heavy boots upon the floor ; and looking keenly round upon the bowing group , raised his hat in acknowledgment of their profound respect .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 28]: ` You have a stranger here , Willet , who sent to me , ' he said , in a voice which sounded naturally stern and deep .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 6]: ` Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 13]: ` In the great room upstairs , sir , ' answered John .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 5]: ` Show the way .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 8]: Your staircase is dark , I know .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 6]: Gentlemen , good night . '
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 46]: With that , he signed to the landlord to go on before ; and went clanking out , and up the stairs ; old John , in his agitation , ingeniously lighting everything but the way , and making a stumble at every second step .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 10]: he said , when they reached the landing . '
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 5]: I can announce myself .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 5]: Do n't wait . '
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 15]: He laid his hand upon the door , entered , and shut it heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 41]: Mr Willet was by no means disposed to stand there listening by himself , especially as the walls were very thick ; so descended , with much greater alacrity than he had come up , and joined his friends below .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 64]: Chapter 12 There was a brief pause in the state-room of the Maypole , as Mr Haredale tried the lock to satisfy himself that he had shut the door securely , and , striding up the dark chamber to where the screen inclosed a little patch of light and warmth , presented himself , abruptly and in silence , before the smiling guest .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 34]: If the two had no greater sympathy in their inward thoughts than in their outward bearing and appearance , the meeting did not seem likely to prove a very calm or pleasant one .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 34]: With no great disparity between them in point of years , they were , in every other respect , as unlike and far removed from each other as two men could well be .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 46]: The one was soft-spoken , delicately made , precise , and elegant ; the other , a burly square-built man , negligently dressed , rough and abrupt in manner , stern , and , in his present mood , forbidding both in look and speech .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 16]: The one preserved a calm and placid smile ; the other , a distrustful frown .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 29]: The new-comer , indeed , appeared bent on showing by his every tone and gesture his determined opposition and hostility to the man he had come to meet .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 43]: The guest who received him , on the other hand , seemed to feel that the contrast between them was all in his favour , and to derive a quiet exultation from it which put him more at his ease than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 27]: ` Haredale , ' said this gentleman , without the least appearance of embarrassment or reserve , ' I am very glad to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 7]: ` Let us dispense with compliments .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 25]: They are misplaced between us , ' returned the other , waving his hand , ` and say plainly what we have to say .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 8]: You have asked me to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 4]: I am here .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 10]: Why do we stand face to face again ? '
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 13]: ` Still the same frank and sturdy character , I see ! '
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 42]: ` Good or bad , sir , I am , ' returned the other , leaning his arm upon the chimney-piece , and turning a haughty look upon the occupant of the easy-chair , ` the man I used to be .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 22]: I have lost no old likings or dislikings ; my memory has not failed me by a hair 's - breadth .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 9]: You ask me to give you a meeting .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: I say , I am here . '
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 47]: ` Our meeting , Haredale , ' said Mr Chester , tapping his snuff-box , and following with a smile the impatient gesture he had made -- perhaps unconsciously -- towards his sword , ` is one of conference and peace , I hope ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 28]: I have come here , ' returned the other , ` at your desire , holding myself bound to meet you , when and where you would .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 13]: I have not come to bandy pleasant speeches , or hollow professions .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 21]: You are a smooth man of the world , sir , and at such play have me at a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 32]: The very last man on this earth with whom I would enter the lists to combat with gentle compliments and masked faces , is Mr Chester , I do assure you .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 20]: I am not his match at such weapons , and have reason to believe that few men are . '
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 25]: ` You do me a great deal of honour Haredale , ' returned the other , most composedly , ` and I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 19]: I will be frank with you -- ' ' I beg your pardon -- will be what ? '
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 9]: ` Frank -- open -- perfectly candid . '
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 4]: ` Hab ! '
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 8]: cried Mr Haredale , drawing his breath .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 10]: ` But do n't let me interrupt you . '
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 48]: ` So resolved am I to hold this course , ' returned the other , tasting his wine with great deliberation ; ` that I have determined not to quarrel with you , and not to be betrayed into a warm expression or a hasty word . '
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 18]: ` There again , ' said Mr Haredale , ` you have me at a great advantage .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 34]: Your self-command -- ' ` Is not to be disturbed , when it will serve my purpose , you would say ' -- rejoined the other , interrupting him with the same complacency .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 3]: ` Granted .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 4]: I allow it .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 9]: And I have a purpose to serve now .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 4]: So have you .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 9]: I am sure our object is the same .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 17]: Let us attain it like sensible men , who have ceased to be boys some time .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 6]: -- Do you drink ? '
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 10]: ` With my friends , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 17]: ` At least , ' said Mr Chester , ` you will be seated ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 31]: I will stand , ' returned Mr Haredale impatiently , ` on this dismantled , beggared hearth , and not pollute it , fallen as it is , with mockeries .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 4]: Go on . '
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 32]: ` You are wrong , Haredale , ' said the other , crossing his legs , and smiling as he held his glass up in the bright glow of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 7]: ` You are really very wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 48]: The world is a lively place enough , in which we must accommodate ourselves to circumstances , sail with the stream as glibly as we can , be content to take froth for substance , the surface for the depth , the counterfeit for the real coin .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 14]: I wonder no philosopher has ever established that our globe itself is hollow .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 13]: It should be , if Nature is consistent in her works . '
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 10]: ` YOU think it is , perhaps ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 21]: I should say , ' he returned , sipping his wine , ` there could be no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 21]: Well ; we , in trifling with this jingling toy , have had the ill-luck to jostle and fall out .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 38]: We are not what the world calls friends ; but we are as good and true and loving friends for all that , as nine out of every ten of those on whom it bestows the title .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 19]: You have a niece , and I a son -- a fine lad , Haredale , but foolish .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 45]: They fall in love with each other , and form what this same world calls an attachment ; meaning a something fanciful and false like the rest , which , if it took its own free time , would break like any other bubble .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 71]: But it may not have its own free time -- will not , if they are left alone -- and the question is , shall we two , because society calls us enemies , stand aloof , and let them rush into each other 's arms , when , by approaching each other sensibly , as we do now , we can prevent it , and part them ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 15]: I love my niece , ' said Mr Haredale , after a short silence .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 15]: ` It may sound strangely in your ears ; but I love her . '
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 8]: ` Strangely , my good fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 16]: cried Mr Chester , lazily filling his glass again , and pulling out his toothpick .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 5]: ` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 23]: I like Ned too -- or , as you say , love him -- that 's the word among such near relations .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 7]: I 'm very fond of Ned .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 22]: He 's an amazingly good fellow , and a handsome fellow -- foolish and weak as yet ; that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 67]: But the thing is , Haredale -- for I 'll be very frank , as I told you I would at first -- independently of any dislike that you and I might have to being related to each other , and independently of the religious differences between us -- and damn it , that 's important -- I could n't afford a match of this description .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 8]: Ned and I could n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 5]: It 's impossible . '
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 24]: ` Curb your tongue , in God 's name , if this conversation is to last , ' retorted Mr Haredale fiercely . '
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 8]: I have said I love my niece .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 28]: Do you think that , loving her , I would have her fling her heart away on any man who had your blood in his veins ? '
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 24]: ` You see , ' said the other , not at all disturbed , ` the advantage of being so frank and open .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 12]: Just what I was about to add , upon my honour !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 33]: I am amazingly attached to Ned -- quite doat upon him , indeed -- and even if we could afford to throw ourselves away , that very objection would be quite insuperable .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 10]: -- I wish you 'd take some wine ? '
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 22]: ` Mark me , ' said Mr Haredale , striding to the table , and laying his hand upon it heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 57]: ` If any man believes -- presumes to think -- that I , in word or deed , or in the wildest dream , ever entertained remotely the idea of Emma Haredale 's favouring the suit of any one who was akin to you -- in any way -- I care not what -- he lies .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 15]: He lies , and does me grievous wrong , in the mere thought . '
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 46]: ` Haredale , ' returned the other , rocking himself to and fro as in assent , and nodding at the fire , ` it 's extremely manly , and really very generous in you , to meet me in this unreserved and handsome way .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 39]: Upon my word , those are exactly my sentiments , only expressed with much more force and power than I could use -- you know my sluggish nature , and will forgive me , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 51]: ` While I would restrain her from all correspondence with your son , and sever their intercourse here , though it should cause her death , ' said Mr Haredale , who had been pacing to and fro , ' I would do it kindly and tenderly if I can .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 45]: I have a trust to discharge , which my nature is not formed to understand , and , for this reason , the bare fact of there being any love between them comes upon me to-night , almost for the first time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 29]: I am more delighted than I can possibly tell you , ' rejoined Mr Chester with the utmost blandness , ` to find my own impression so confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 9]: You see the advantage of our having met .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 5]: We understand each other .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 4]: We quite agree .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 17]: We have a most complete and thorough explanation , and we know what course to take .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 11]: -- Why do n't you taste your tenant 's wine ?
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 7]: It 's really very good . '
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 18]: ` Pray who , ' said Mr Haredale , ` have aided Emma , or your son ?
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 13]: Who are their go-betweens , and agents -- do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 26]: ` All the good people hereabouts -- the neighbourhood in general , I think , ' returned the other , with his most affable smile .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 15]: ` The messenger I sent to you to-day , foremost among them all . '
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 4]: ` The idiot ?
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 3]: Barnaby ? '
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 5]: ` You are surprised ?
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 13]: I am glad of that , for I was rather so myself .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 49]: I wrung that from his mother -- a very decent sort of woman -- from whom , indeed , I chiefly learnt how serious the matter had become , and so determined to ride out here to-day , and hold a parley with you on this neutral ground .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 19]: -- You 're stouter than you used to be , Haredale , but you look extremely well . '
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 31]: ` Our business , I presume , is nearly at an end , ' said Mr Haredale , with an expression of impatience he was at no pains to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 15]: ` Trust me , Mr Chester , my niece shall change from this time .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 60]: I will appeal , ' he added in a lower tone , ` to her woman 's heart , her dignity , her pride , her duty -- ' ' I shall do the same by Ned , ' said Mr Chester , restoring some errant faggots to their places in the grate with the toe of his boot .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 28]: ` If there is anything real in this world , it is those amazingly fine feelings and those natural obligations which must subsist between father and son .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 15]: I shall put it to him on every ground of moral and religious feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 67]: I shall represent to him that we can not possibly afford it -- that I have always looked forward to his marrying well , for a genteel provision for myself in the autumn of life -- that there are a great many clamorous dogs to pay , whose claims are perfectly just and right , and who must be paid out of his wife 's fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 43]: In short , that the very highest and most honourable feelings of our nature , with every consideration of filial duty and affection , and all that sort of thing , imperatively demand that he should run away with an heiress . '
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 11]: ` And break her heart as speedily as possible ? '
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 9]: said Mr Haredale , drawing on his glove .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 26]: ` There Ned will act exactly as he pleases , ' returned the other , sipping his wine ; ` that 's entirely his affair .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 18]: I would n't for the world interfere with my son , Haredale , beyond a certain point .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 19]: The relationship between father and son , you know , is positively quite a holy kind of bond .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 15]: -- WO N'T you let me persuade you to take one glass of wine ?
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 16]: as you please , as you please , ' he added , helping himself again .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 45]: ` Chester , ' said Mr Haredale , after a short silence , during which he had eyed his smiling face from time to time intently , ` you have the head and heart of an evil spirit in all matters of deception . '
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 5]: ` Your health ! '
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 8]: said the other , with a nod .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 57]: ` But I have interrupted you -- ' ` If now , ' pursued Mr Haredale , ` we should find it difficult to separate these young people , and break off their intercourse -- if , for instance , you find it difficult on your side , what course do you intend to take ? '
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 29]: ` Nothing plainer , my good fellow , nothing easier , ' returned the other , shrugging his shoulders and stretching himself more comfortably before the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 45]: I shall then exert those powers on which you flatter me so highly -- though , upon my word , I do n't deserve your compliments to their full extent -- and resort to a few little trivial subterfuges for rousing jealousy and resentment .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 4]: You see ? '
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 37]: ` In short , justifying the means by the end , we are , as a last resource for tearing them asunder , to resort to treachery and -- and lying , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 5]: ` Oh dear no .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 5]: Fie , fie ! '
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 11]: returned the other , relishing a pinch of snuff extremely .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 4]: ` Not lying .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 21]: Only a little management , a little diplomacy , a little -- intriguing , that 's the word . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 39]: I wish , ' said Mr Haredale , moving to and fro , and stopping , and moving on again , like one who was ill at ease , ` that this could have been foreseen or prevented .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 26]: But as it has gone so far , and it is necessary for us to act , it is of no use shrinking or regretting .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 12]: I shall second your endeavours to the utmost of my power .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 18]: There is one topic in the whole wide range of human thoughts on which we both agree .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 9]: We shall act in concert , but apart .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 16]: There will be no need , I hope , for us to meet again . '
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 6]: ` Are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: said Mr Chester , rising with a graceful indolence .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 10]: ` Let me light you down the stairs . '
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 18]: ` Pray keep your seat , ' returned the other drily , ' I know the way .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 41]: So , waving his hand slightly , and putting on his hat as he turned upon his heel , he went clanking out as he had come , shut the door behind him , and tramped down the echoing stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 3]: ` Pah !
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 8]: A very coarse animal , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 12]: said Mr Chester , composing himself in the easy-chair again . '
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 4]: A rough brute .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: Quite a human badger ! '
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 84]: John Willet and his friends , who had been listening intently for the clash of swords , or firing of pistols in the great room , and had indeed settled the order in which they should rush in when summoned -- in which procession old John had carefully arranged that he should bring up the rear -- were very much astonished to see Mr Haredale come down without a scratch , call for his horse , and ride away thoughtfully at a footpace .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 29]: After some consideration , it was decided that he had left the gentleman above , for dead , and had adopted this stratagem to divert suspicion or pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 57]: As this conclusion involved the necessity of their going upstairs forthwith , they were about to ascend in the order they had agreed upon , when a smart ringing at the guest 's bell , as if he had pulled it vigorously , overthrew all their speculations , and involved them in great uncertainty and doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 40]: At length Mr Willet agreed to go upstairs himself , escorted by Hugh and Barnaby , as the strongest and stoutest fellows on the premises , who were to make their appearance under pretence of clearing away the glasses .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 30]: Under this protection , the brave and broad-faced John boldly entered the room , half a foot in advance , and received an order for a boot-jack without trembling .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 60]: But when it was brought , and he leant his sturdy shoulder to the guest , Mr Willet was observed to look very hard into his boots as he pulled them off , and , by opening his eyes much wider than usual , to appear to express some surprise and disappointment at not finding them full of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 32]: He took occasion , too , to examine the gentleman as closely as he could , expecting to discover sundry loopholes in his person , pierced by his adversary 's sword .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 55]: Finding none , however , and observing in course of time that his guest was as cool and unruffled , both in his dress and temper , as he had been all day , old John at last heaved a deep sigh , and began to think no duel had been fought that night .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 30]: ` And now , Willet , ' said Mr Chester , ` if the room 's well aired , I 'll try the merits of that famous bed . '
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 53]: ` The room , sir , ' returned John , taking up a candle , and nudging Barnaby and Hugh to accompany them , in case the gentleman should unexpectedly drop down faint or dead from some internal wound , ` the room 's as warm as any toast in a tankard .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 13]: Barnaby , take you that other candle , and go on before .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 2]: Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 10]: Follow up , sir , with the easy-chair . '
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 130]: In this order -- and still , in his earnest inspection , holding his candle very close to the guest ; now making him feel extremely warm about the legs , now threatening to set his wig on fire , and constantly begging his pardon with great awkwardness and embarrassment -- John led the party to the best bedroom , which was nearly as large as the chamber from which they had come , and held , drawn out near the fire for warmth , a great old spectral bedstead , hung with faded brocade , and ornamented , at the top of each carved post , with a plume of feathers that had once been white , but with dust and age had now grown hearse-like and funereal .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 41]: ` Good night , my friends , ' said Mr Chester with a sweet smile , seating himself , when he had surveyed the room from end to end , in the easy-chair which his attendants wheeled before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 4]: ` Good night !
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 20]: Barnaby , my good fellow , you say some prayers before you go to bed , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 3]: Barnaby nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 20]: ` He has some nonsense that he calls his prayers , sir , ' returned old John , officiously .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 13]: ` I 'm afraid there a n't much good in em . '
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 5]: ` And Hugh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 8]: said Mr Chester , turning to him .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 9]: ` Not I , ' he answered . '
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 15]: I know his ' -- pointing to Barnaby -- ` they 're well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 8]: He sings 'em sometimes in the straw .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 4]: I listen . '
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 18]: ` He 's quite a animal , sir , ' John whispered in his ear with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 10]: ` You 'll excuse him , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 34]: If he has any soul at all , sir , it must be such a very small one , that it do n't signify what he does or does n't in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 6]: Good night , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 9]: The guest rejoined ` God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 38]: with a fervour that was quite affecting ; and John , beckoning his guards to go before , bowed himself out of the room , and left him to his rest in the Maypole 's ancient bed .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 112]: Chapter 13 If Joseph Willet , the denounced and proscribed of ` prentices , had happened to be at home when his father 's courtly guest presented himself before the Maypole door -- that is , if it had not perversely chanced to be one of the half-dozen days in the whole year on which he was at liberty to absent himself for as many hours without question or reproach -- he would have contrived , by hook or crook , to dive to the very bottom of Mr Chester 's mystery , and to come at his purpose with as much certainty as though he had been his confidential adviser .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 67]: In that fortunate case , the lovers would have had quick warning of the ills that threatened them , and the aid of various timely and wise suggestions to boot ; for all Joe 's readiness of thought and action , and all his sympathies and good wishes , were enlisted in favour of the young people , and were staunch in devotion to their cause .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 162]: Whether this disposition arose out of his old prepossessions in favour of the young lady , whose history had surrounded her in his mind , almost from his cradle , with circumstances of unusual interest ; or from his attachment towards the young gentleman , into whose confidence he had , through his shrewdness and alacrity , and the rendering of sundry important services as a spy and messenger , almost imperceptibly glided ; whether they had their origin in either of these sources , or in the habit natural to youth , or in the constant badgering and worrying of his venerable parent , or in any hidden little love affair of his own which gave him something of a fellow-feeling in the matter , it is needless to inquire -- especially as Joe was out of the way , and had no opportunity on that particular occasion of testifying to his sentiments either on one side or the other .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 39]: It was , in fact , the twenty-fifth of March , which , as most people know to their cost , is , and has been time out of mind , one of those unpleasant epochs termed quarter-days .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 76]: On this twenty-fifth of March , it was John Willet 's pride annually to settle , in hard cash , his account with a certain vintner and distiller in the city of London ; to give into whose hands a canvas bag containing its exact amount , and not a penny more or less , was the end and object of a journey for Joe , so surely as the year and day came round .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 38]: This journey was performed upon an old grey mare , concerning whom John had an indistinct set of ideas hovering about him , to the effect that she could win a plate or cup if she tried .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 42]: She never had tried , and probably never would now , being some fourteen or fifteen years of age , short in wind , long in body , and rather the worse for wear in respect of her mane and tail .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 44]: Notwithstanding these slight defects , John perfectly gloried in the animal ; and when she was brought round to the door by Hugh , actually retired into the bar , and there , in a secret grove of lemons , laughed with pride .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 11]: ` There 's a bit of horseflesh , Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 16]: said John , when he had recovered enough self-command to appear at the door again .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 7]: ` There 's a comely creature !
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 5]: There 's high mettle !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 5]: There 's bone ! '
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 56]: There was bone enough beyond all doubt ; and so Hugh seemed to think , as he sat sideways in the saddle , lazily doubled up with his chin nearly touching his knees ; and heedless of the dangling stirrups and loose bridle-rein , sauntered up and down on the little green before the door .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 35]: ` Mind you take good care of her , sir , ' said John , appealing from this insensible person to his son and heir , who now appeared , fully equipped and ready .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 9]: ` Do n't you ride hard . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 25]: I should be puzzled to do that , I think , father , ' Joe replied , casting a disconsolate look at the animal .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 17]: ` None of your impudence , sir , if you please , ' retorted old John .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 8]: ` What would you ride , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 19]: A wild ass or zebra would be too tame for you , would n't he , eh sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 18]: You 'd like to ride a roaring lion , would n't you , sir , eh sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 7]: Hold your tongue , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 42]: When Mr Willet , in his differences with his son , had exhausted all the questions that occurred to him , and Joe had said nothing at all in answer , he generally wound up by bidding him hold his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 41]: ` And what does the boy mean , ' added Mr Willet , after he had stared at him for a little time , in a species of stupefaction , ` by cocking his hat , to such an extent !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 11]: Are you going to kill the wintner , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 14]: ` No , ' said Joe , tartly ; ` I 'm not .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 10]: Now your mind 's at ease , father . '
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 9]: ` With a milintary air , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 26]: said Mr Willet , surveying him from top to toe ; ` with a swaggering , fire-eating , biling-water drinking sort of way with him !
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 17]: And what do you mean by pulling up the crocuses and snowdrops , eh sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 14]: ` It 's only a little nosegay , ' said Joe , reddening .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 12]: ` There 's no harm in that , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 14]: ` You 're a boy of business , you are , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 18]: said Mr Willet , disdainfully , ` to go supposing that wintners care for nosegays . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 13]: I do n't suppose anything of the kind , ' returned Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 12]: ` Let them keep their red noses for bottles and tankards .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 10]: These are going to Mr Varden 's house . '
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 13]: ` And do you suppose HE minds such things as crocuses ? '
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 4]: demanded John . '
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 20]: I do n't know , and to say the truth , I do n't care , ' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 21]: ` Come , father , give me the money , and in the name of patience let me go . '
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 37]: ` There it is , sir , ' replied John ; ` and take care of it ; and mind you do n't make too much haste back , but give the mare a long rest .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 6]: -- Do you mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 10]: ` Ay , I mind , ' returned Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 10]: ` She 'll need it , Heaven knows . '
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 18]: ` And do n't you score up too much at the Black Lion , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 6]: ` Mind that too . '
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 16]: ` Then why do n't you let me have some money of my own ? '
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 13]: retorted Joe , sorrowfully ; ` why do n't you , father ?
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 48]: What do you send me into London for , giving me only the right to call for my dinner at the Black Lion , which you 're to pay for next time you go , as if I was not to be trusted with a few shillings ?
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 8]: Why do you use me like this ?
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 7]: It 's not right of you .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 12]: You ca n't expect me to be quiet under it . '
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 7]: ` Let him have money ! '
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 8]: cried John , in a drowsy reverie .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 9]: ` What does he call money -- guineas ?
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: Has n't he got money ?
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 14]: Over and above the tolls , has n't he one and sixpence ? '
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 6]: ` One and sixpence ! '
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 5]: repeated his son contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 14]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned John , ` one and sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 18]: When I was your age , I had never seen so much money , in a heap .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 22]: A shilling of it is in case of accidents -- the mare casting a shoe , or the like of that .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 30]: The other sixpence is to spend in the diversions of London ; and the diversion I recommend is going to the top of the Monument , and sitting there .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 26]: There 's no temptation there , sir -- no drink -- no young women -- no bad characters of any sort -- nothing but imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 16]: That 's the way I enjoyed myself when I was your age , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 42]: To this , Joe made no answer , but beckoning Hugh , leaped into the saddle and rode away ; and a very stalwart , manly horseman he looked , deserving a better charger than it was his fortune to bestride .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 57]: John stood staring after him , or rather after the grey mare -LRB- for he had no eyes for her rider -RRB- , until man and beast had been out of sight some twenty minutes , when he began to think they were gone , and slowly re-entering the house , fell into a gentle doze .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 71]: The unfortunate grey mare , who was the agony of Joe 's life , floundered along at her own will and pleasure until the Maypole was no longer visible , and then , contracting her legs into what in a puppet would have been looked upon as a clumsy and awkward imitation of a canter , mended her pace all at once , and did it of her own accord .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 89]: The acquaintance with her rider 's usual mode of proceeding , which suggested this improvement in hers , impelled her likewise to turn up a bye-way , leading -- not to London , but through lanes running parallel with the road they had come , and passing within a few hundred yards of the Maypole , which led finally to an inclosure surrounding a large , old , red-brick mansion -- the same of which mention was made as the Warren in the first chapter of this history .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 32]: Coming to a dead stop in a little copse thereabout , she suffered her rider to dismount with right goodwill , and to tie her to the trunk of a tree .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 27]: ` Stay there , old girl , ' said Joe , ` and let us see whether there 's any little commission for me to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 38]: So saying , he left her to browze upon such stunted grass and weeds as happened to grow within the length of her tether , and passing through a wicket gate , entered the grounds on foot .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 34]: The pathway , after a very few minutes ' walking , brought him close to the house , towards which , and especially towards one particular window , he directed many covert glances .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 27]: It was a dreary , silent building , with echoing courtyards , desolated turret-chambers , and whole suites of rooms shut up and mouldering to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 21]: The terrace-garden , dark with the shade of overhanging trees , had an air of melancholy that was quite oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 46]: Great iron gates , disused for many years , and red with rust , drooping on their hinges and overgrown with long rank grass , seemed as though they tried to sink into the ground , and hide their fallen state among the friendly weeds .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 26]: The fantastic monsters on the walls , green with age and damp , and covered here and there with moss , looked grim and desolate .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 42]: There was a sombre aspect even on that part of the mansion which was inhabited and kept in good repair , that struck the beholder with a sense of sadness ; of something forlorn and failing , whence cheerfulness was banished .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 34]: It would have been difficult to imagine a bright fire blazing in the dull and darkened rooms , or to picture any gaiety of heart or revelry that the frowning walls shut in .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 38]: It seemed a place where such things had been , but could be no more -- the very ghost of a house , haunting the old spot in its old outward form , and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 62]: Much of this decayed and sombre look was attributable , no doubt , to the death of its former master , and the temper of its present occupant ; but remembering the tale connected with the mansion , it seemed the very place for such a deed , and one that might have been its predestined theatre years upon years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 85]: Viewed with reference to this legend , the sheet of water where the steward 's body had been found appeared to wear a black and sullen character , such as no other pool might own ; the bell upon the roof that had told the tale of murder to the midnight wind , became a very phantom whose voice would raise the listener 's hair on end ; and every leafless bough that nodded to another , had its stealthy whispering of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 49]: Joe paced up and down the path , sometimes stopping in affected contemplation of the building or the prospect , sometimes leaning against a tree with an assumed air of idleness and indifference , but always keeping an eye upon the window he had singled out at first .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 55]: After some quarter of an hour 's delay , a small white hand was waved to him for an instant from this casement , and the young man , with a respectful bow , departed ; saying under his breath as he crossed his horse again , ` No errand for me to-day ! '
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 45]: But the air of smartness , the cock of the hat to which John Willet had objected , and the spring nosegay , all betokened some little errand of his own , having a more interesting object than a vintner or even a locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 171]: So , indeed , it turned out ; for when he had settled with the vintner -- whose place of business was down in some deep cellars hard by Thames Street , and who was as purple-faced an old gentleman as if he had all his life supported their arched roof on his head -- when he had settled the account , and taken the receipt , and declined tasting more than three glasses of old sherry , to the unbounded astonishment of the purple-faced vintner , who , gimlet in hand , had projected an attack upon at least a score of dusty casks , and who stood transfixed , or morally gimleted as it were , to his own wall -- when he had done all this , and disposed besides of a frugal dinner at the Black Lion in Whitechapel ; spurning the Monument and John 's advice , he turned his steps towards the locksmith 's house , attracted by the eyes of blooming Dolly Varden .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 46]: Joe was by no means a sheepish fellow , but , for all that , when he got to the corner of the street in which the locksmith lived , he could by no means make up his mind to walk straight to the house .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 56]: First , he resolved to stroll up another street for five minutes , then up another street for five minutes more , and so on until he had lost full half an hour , when he made a bold plunge and found himself with a red face and a beating heart in the smoky workshop .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 9]: ` Joe Willet , or his ghost ? '
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 24]: said Varden , rising from the desk at which he was busy with his books , and looking at him under his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 5]: ` Which is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 7]: Joe in the flesh , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 4]: That 's hearty .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 11]: And how are all the Chigwell company , Joe ? '
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 17]: ` Much as usual , sir -- they and I agree as well as ever . '
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 4]: said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 16]: ` We must be patient , Joe , and bear with old folks ' foibles .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 7]: How 's the mare , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 13]: Does she do the four miles an hour as easily as ever ?
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 5]: Does she , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 13]: -- What have we there , Joe -- a nosegay ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 35]: A very poor one , sir -- I thought Miss Dolly -- ' ` No , no , ' said Gabriel , dropping his voice , and shaking his head , ` not Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 8]: Give 'em to her mother , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 10]: A great deal better give 'em to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 12]: Would you mind giving 'em to Mrs Varden , Joe ? '
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 27]: ` Oh no , sir , ' Joe replied , and endeavouring , but not with the greatest possible success , to hide his disappointment . '
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 11]: I shall be very glad , I 'm sure . '
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 16]: ` That 's right , ' said the locksmith , patting him on the back .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: ` It do n't matter who has 'em , Joe ? '
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 8]: ` Not a bit , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 12]: -- Dear heart , how the words stuck in his throat !
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 9]: ` Come in , ' said Gabriel . '
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 8]: I have just been called to tea .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 7]: She 's in the parlour . '
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 7]: ` She , ' thought Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 12]: ` Which of 'em I wonder -- Mrs or Miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 38]: The locksmith settled the doubt as neatly as if it had been expressed aloud , by leading him to the door , and saying , ` Martha , my dear , here 's young Mr Willet . '
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 72]: Now , Mrs Varden , regarding the Maypole as a sort of human mantrap , or decoy for husbands ; viewing its proprietor , and all who aided and abetted him , in the light of so many poachers among Christian men ; and believing , moreover , that the publicans coupled with sinners in Holy Writ were veritable licensed victuallers ; was far from being favourably disposed towards her visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 36]: Wherefore she was taken faint directly ; and being duly presented with the crocuses and snowdrops , divined on further consideration that they were the occasion of the languor which had seized upon her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 25]: ` I 'm afraid I could n't bear the room another minute , ' said the good lady , ` if they remained here .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 11]: WOULD you excuse my putting them out of window ? '
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 24]: Joe begged she would n't mention it on any account , and smiled feebly as he saw them deposited on the sill outside .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 21]: If anybody could have known the pains he had taken to make up that despised and misused bunch of flowers !
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 23]: -- ' I feel it quite a relief to get rid of them , I assure you , ' said Mrs Varden .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 7]: ` I 'm better already . '
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 12]: And indeed she did appear to have plucked up her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 25]: Joe expressed his gratitude to Providence for this favourable dispensation , and tried to look as if he did n't wonder where Dolly was .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 26]: ` You 're sad people at Chigwell , Mr Joseph , ' said Mrs V. ' I hope not , ma'am , ' returned Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 21]: ` You 're the cruellest and most inconsiderate people in the world , ' said Mrs Varden , bridling . '
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 25]: I wonder old Mr Willet , having been a married man himself , does n't know better than to conduct himself as he does .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: His doing it for profit is no excuse .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 22]: I would rather pay the money twenty times over , and have Varden come home like a respectable and sober tradesman .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 30]: If there is one character , ' said Mrs Varden with great emphasis , ` that offends and disgusts me more than another , it is a sot . '
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 29]: ` Come , Martha , my dear , ' said the locksmith cheerily , ` let us have tea , and do n't let us talk about sots .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 20]: There are none here , and Joe do n't want to hear about them , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 10]: At this crisis , Miggs appeared with toast . '
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 23]: I dare say he does not , ' said Mrs Varden ; ` and I dare say you do not , Varden .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 39]: It 's a very unpleasant subiect , I have no doubt , though I wo n't say it 's personal ' -- Miggs coughed -- ` whatever I may be forced to think ' -- Miggs sneezed expressively .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 44]: ` You never will know , Varden , and nobody at young Mr Willet 's age -- you 'll excuse me , sir -- can be expected to know , what a woman suffers when she is waiting at home under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 32]: If you do n't believe me , as I know you do n't , here 's Miggs , who is only too often a witness of it -- ask her . '
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 17]: she were very bad the other night , sir , indeed she were , said Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 30]: ` If you had n't the sweetness of an angel in you , mim , I do n't think you could abear it , I raly do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 14]: ` Miggs , ' said Mrs Varden , ` you 're profane . '
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 39]: ` Begging your pardon , mim , ' returned Miggs , with shrill rapidity , ` such was not my intentions , and such I hope is not my character , though I am but a servant . '
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 28]: ` Answering me , Miggs , and providing yourself , ' retorted her mistress , looking round with dignity , ` is one and the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 52]: How dare you speak of angels in connection with your sinful fellow-beings -- mere ' -- said Mrs Varden , glancing at herself in a neighbouring mirror , and arranging the ribbon of her cap in a more becoming fashion -- ` mere worms and grovellers as we are ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 49]: I did not intend , mim , if you please , to give offence , ' said Miggs , confident in the strength of her compliment , and developing strongly in the throat as usual , ` and I did not expect it would be took as such .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 26]: I hope I know my own unworthiness , and that I hate and despise myself and all my fellow-creatures as every practicable Christian should . '
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 65]: ` You 'll have the goodness , if you please , ' said Mrs Varden , loftily , ` to step upstairs and see if Dolly has finished dressing , and to tell her that the chair that was ordered for her will be here in a minute , and that if she keeps it waiting , I shall send it away that instant .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 59]: -- I 'm sorry to see that you do n't take your tea , Varden , and that you do n't take yours , Mr Joseph ; though of course it would be foolish of me to expect that anything that can be had at home , and in the company of females , would please YOU . '
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 81]: This pronoun was understood in the plural sense , and included both gentlemen , upon both of whom it was rather hard and undeserved , for Gabriel had applied himself to the meal with a very promising appetite , until it was spoilt by Mrs Varden herself , and Joe had as great a liking for the female society of the locksmith 's house -- or for a part of it at all events -- as man could well entertain .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 30]: But he had no opportunity to say anything in his own defence , for at that moment Dolly herself appeared , and struck him quite dumb with her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 58]: Never had Dolly looked so handsome as she did then , in all the glow and grace of youth , with all her charms increased a hundredfold by a most becoming dress , by a thousand little coquettish ways which nobody could assume with a better grace , and all the sparkling expectation of that accursed party .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 29]: It is impossible to tell how Joe hated that party wherever it was , and all the other people who were going to it , whoever they were .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 14]: And she hardly looked at him -- no , hardly looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 27]: And when the chair was seen through the open door coming blundering into the workshop , she actually clapped her hands and seemed glad to go .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 20]: But Joe gave her his arm -- there was some comfort in that -- and handed her into it .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 60]: To see her seat herself inside , with her laughing eyes brighter than diamonds , and her hand -- surely she had the prettiest hand in the world -- on the ledge of the open window , and her little finger provokingly and pertly tilted up , as if it wondered why Joe did n't squeeze or kiss it !
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 29]: To think how well one or two of the modest snowdrops would have become that delicate bodice , and how they were lying neglected outside the parlour window !
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 63]: To see how Miggs looked on with a face expressive of knowing how all this loveliness was got up , and of being in the secret of every string and pin and hook and eye , and of saying it ai n't half as real as you think , and I could look quite as well myself if I took the pains !
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 42]: To hear that provoking precious little scream when the chair was hoisted on its poles , and to catch that transient but not-to-be-forgotten vision of the happy face within -- what torments and aggravations , and yet what delights were these !
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 14]: The very chairmen seemed favoured rivals as they bore her down the street .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 26]: There never was such an alteration in a small room in a small time as in that parlour when they went back to finish tea .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 10]: So dark , so deserted , so perfectly disenchanted .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 44]: It seemed such sheer nonsense to be sitting tamely there , when she was at a dance with more lovers than man could calculate fluttering about her -- with the whole party doting on and adoring her , and wanting to marry her .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 34]: Miggs was hovering about too ; and the fact of her existence , the mere circumstance of her ever having been born , appeared , after Dolly , such an unaccountable practical joke .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: It was impossible to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 6]: It could n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 32]: He had nothing left for it but to stir his tea round , and round , and round , and ruminate on all the fascinations of the locksmith 's lovely daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 5]: Gabriel was dull too .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 30]: It was a part of the certain uncertainty of Mrs Varden 's temper , that when they were in this condition , she should be gay and sprightly . '
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 36]: I need have a cheerful disposition , I am sure , ' said the smiling housewife , ` to preserve any spirits at all ; and how I do it I can scarcely tell . '
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 26]: ` Ah , mim , ' sighed Miggs , ` begging your pardon for the interruption , there a n't a many like you . '
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 19]: ` Take away , Miggs , ' said Mrs Varden , rising , ` take away , pray .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 29]: I know I 'm a restraint here , and as I wish everybody to enjoy themselves as they best can , I feel I had better go . '
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 12]: ` No , no , Martha , ' cried the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 4]: ` Stop here .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 16]: I 'm sure we shall be very sorry to lose you , eh Joe ! '
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 9]: Joe started , and said ` Certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 22]: ` Thank you , Varden , my dear , ' returned his wife ; ` but I know your wishes better .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 35]: Tobacco and beer , or spirits , have much greater attractions than any I can boast of , and therefore I shall go and sit upstairs and look out of window , my love .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 6]: Good night , Mr Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 24]: I 'm very glad to have seen you , and I only wish I could have provided something more suitable to your taste .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 29]: Remember me very kindly if you please to old Mr Willet , and tell him that whenever he comes here I have a crow to pluck with him .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 25]: Having uttered these words with great sweetness of manner , the good lady dropped a curtsey remarkable for its condescension , and serenely withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 41]: And it was for this Joe had looked forward to the twenty-fifth of March for weeks and weeks , and had gathered the flowers with so much care , and had cocked his hat , and made himself so smart !
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 30]: This was the end of all his bold determination , resolved upon for the hundredth time , to speak out to Dolly and tell her how he loved her !
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 41]: To see her for a minute -- for but a minute -- to find her going out to a party and glad to go ; to be looked upon as a common pipe-smoker , beer-bibber , spirit-guzzler , and tosspot !
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 105]: He bade farewell to his friend the locksmith , and hastened to take horse at the Black Lion , thinking as he turned towards home , as many another Joe has thought before and since , that here was an end to all his hopes -- that the thing was impossible and never could be -- that she did n't care for him -- that he was wretched for life -- and that the only congenial prospect left him , was to go for a soldier or a sailor , and get some obliging enemy to knock his brains out as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 64]: Chapter 14 Joe Willet rode leisurely along in his desponding mood , picturing the locksmith 's daughter going down long country-dances , and poussetting dreadfully with bold strangers -- which was almost too much to bear -- when he heard the tramp of a horse 's feet behind him , and looking back , saw a well-mounted gentleman advancing at a smart canter .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 20]: As this rider passed , he checked his steed , and called him of the Maypole by his name .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 16]: Joe set spurs to the grey mare , and was at his side directly . '
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 17]: I thought it was you , sir , ' he said , touching his hat . '
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 6]: A fair evening , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 10]: Glad to see you out of doors again . '
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: The gentleman smiled and nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 12]: ` What gay doings have been going on to-day , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 7]: Is she as pretty as ever ?
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 9]: Nay , do n't blush , man . '
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 43]: ` If I coloured at all , Mr Edward , ' said Joe , ` which I did n't know I did , it was to think I should have been such a fool as ever to have any hope of her .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 15]: She 's as far out of my reach as -- as Heaven is . '
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 20]: ` Well , Joe , I hope that 's not altogether beyond it , ' said Edward , good-humouredly .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 3]: sighed Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 10]: ` It 's all very fine talking , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 8]: Proverbs are easily made in cold blood .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 7]: But it ca n't be helped .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 10]: Are you bound for our house , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 23]: As I am not quite strong yet , I shall stay there to-night , and ride home coolly in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 52]: ` If you 're in no particular hurry , ' said Joe after a short silence , ` and will bear with the pace of this poor jade , I shall be glad to ride on with you to the Warren , sir , and hold your horse when you dismount .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 16]: It 'll save you having to walk from the Maypole , there and back again .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 16]: I can spare the time well , sir , for I am too soon . '
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 36]: ` And so am I , ' returned Edward , ` though I was unconsciously riding fast just now , in compliment I suppose to the pace of my thoughts , which were travelling post .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 18]: We will keep together , Joe , willingly , and be as good company as may be .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 26]: And cheer up , cheer up , think of the locksmith 's daughter with a stout heart , and you shall win her yet . '
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 77]: Joe shook his head ; but there was something so cheery in the buoyant hopeful manner of this speech , that his spirits rose under its influence , and communicated as it would seem some new impulse even to the grey mare , who , breaking from her sober amble into a gentle trot , emulated the pace of Edward Chester 's horse , and appeared to flatter herself that he was doing his very best .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 37]: It was a fine dry night , and the light of a young moon , which was then just rising , shed around that peace and tranquillity which gives to evening time its most delicious charm .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 46]: The lengthened shadows of the trees , softened as if reflected in still water , threw their carpet on the path the travellers pursued , and the light wind stirred yet more softly than before , as though it were soothing Nature in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 19]: By little and little they ceased talking , and rode on side by side in a pleasant silence .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 35]: ` The Maypole lights are brilliant to-night , ' said Edward , as they rode along the lane from which , while the intervening trees were bare of leaves , that hostelry was visible .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 20]: ` Brilliant indeed , sir , ' returned Joe , rising in his stirrups to get a better view .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 16]: ` Lights in the large room , and a fire glimmering in the best bedchamber ?
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 13]: Why , what company can this be for , I wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 31]: ` Some benighted horseman wending towards London , and deterred from going on to-night by the marvellous tales of my friend the highwayman , I suppose , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 14]: ` He must be a horseman of good quality to have such accommodations .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 8]: Your bed too , sir -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: ` No matter , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 8]: Any other room will do for me .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 8]: But come -- there 's nine striking .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 6]: We may push on . '
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 31]: They cantered forward at as brisk a pace as Joe 's charger could attain , and presently stopped in the little copse where he had left her in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 20]: Edward dismounted , gave his bridle to his companion , and walked with a light step towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 19]: A female servant was waiting at a side gate in the garden-wall , and admitted him without delay .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 43]: He hurried along the terrace-walk , and darted up a flight of broad steps leading into an old and gloomy hall , whose walls were ornamented with rusty suits of armour , antlers , weapons of the chase , and suchlike garniture .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 46]: Here he paused , but not long ; for as he looked round , as if expecting the attendant to have followed , and wondering she had not done so , a lovely girl appeared , whose dark hair next moment rested on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 27]: Almost at the same instant a heavy hand was laid upon her arm , Edward felt himself thrust away , and Mr Haredale stood between them .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 36]: He regarded the young man sternly without removing his hat ; with one hand clasped his niece , and with the other , in which he held his riding-whip , motioned him towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 12]: The young man drew himself up , and returned his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 29]: ` This is well done of you , sir , to corrupt my servants , and enter my house unbidden and in secret , like a thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 4]: said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 12]: ` Leave it , sir , and return no more . '
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 37]: ` Miss Haredale 's presence , ' returned the young man , ` and your relationship to her , give you a licence which , if you are a brave man , you will not abuse .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 18]: You have compelled me to this course , and the fault is yours -- not mine . '
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 60]: ` It is neither generous , nor honourable , nor the act of a true man , sir , ' retorted the other , ` to tamper with the affections of a weak , trusting girl , while you shrink , in your unworthiness , from her guardian and protector , and dare not meet the light of day .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 26]: More than this I will not say to you , save that I forbid you this house , and require you to be gone . '
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 25]: ` It is neither generous , nor honourable , nor the act of a true man to play the spy , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 17]: ` Your words imply dishonour , and I reject them with the scorn they merit . '
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 26]: ` You will find , ' said Mr Haredale , calmly , ` your trusty go-between in waiting at the gate by which you entered .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 10]: I have played no spy 's part , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 12]: I chanced to see you pass the gate , and followed .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 23]: You might have heard me knocking for admission , had you been less swift of foot , or lingered in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 4]: Please to withdraw .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 14]: Your presence here is offensive to me and distressful to my niece . '
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 56]: As he said these words , he passed his arm about the waist of the terrified and weeping girl , and drew her closer to him ; and though the habitual severity of his manner was scarcely changed , there was yet apparent in the action an air of kindness and sympathy for her distress .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 55]: ` Mr Haredale , ' said Edward , ` your arm encircles her on whom I have set my every hope and thought , and to purchase one minute 's happiness for whom I would gladly lay down my life ; this house is the casket that holds the precious jewel of my existence .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 17]: Your niece has plighted her faith to me , and I have plighted mine to her .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 22]: What have I done that you should hold me in this light esteem , and give me these discourteous words ? '
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 19]: ` You have done that , sir , ' answered Mr Haredale , ` which must he undone .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 15]: You have tied a lover ' - knot here which must be cut asunder .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 8]: Take good heed of what I say .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 2]: Must .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 7]: I cancel the bond between ye .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 22]: I reject you , and all of your kith and kin -- all the false , hollow , heartless stock . '
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 12]: ` High words , sir , ' said Edward , scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 17]: ` Words of purpose and meaning , as you will find , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 7]: ` Lay them to heart . '
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 11]: ` Lay you then , these , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 54]: ` Your cold and sullen temper , which chills every breast about you , which turns affection into fear , and changes duty into dread , has forced us on this secret course , repugnant to our nature and our wish , and far more foreign , sir , to us than you .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 42]: I am not a false , a hollow , or a heartless man ; the character is yours , who poorly venture on these injurious terms , against the truth , and under the shelter whereof I reminded you just now .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 9]: You shall not cancel the bond between us .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 7]: I will not abandon this pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 17]: I rely upon your niece 's truth and honour , and set your influence at nought .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 34]: I leave her with a confidence in her pure faith , which you will never weaken , and with no concern but that I do not leave her in some gentler care . '
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 26]: With that , he pressed her cold hand to his lips , and once more encountering and returning Mr Haredale 's steady look , withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 28]: A few words to Joe as he mounted his horse sufficiently explained what had passed , and renewed all that young gentleman 's despondency with tenfold aggravation .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 20]: They rode back to the Maypole without exchanging a syllable , and arrived at the door with heavy hearts .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 48]: Old John , who had peeped from behind the red curtain as they rode up shouting for Hugh , was out directly , and said with great importance as he held the young man 's stirrup , ` He 's comfortable in bed -- the best bed .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 17]: A thorough gentleman ; the smilingest , affablest gentleman I ever had to do with . '
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 6]: ` Who , Willet ? '
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 8]: said Edward carelessly , as he dismounted .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 11]: ` Your worthy father , sir , ' replied John .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 8]: ` Your honourable , venerable father . '
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 7]: ` What does he mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 15]: said Edward , looking with a mixture of alarm and doubt , at Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 7]: ` What DO you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 14]: ` Do n't you see Mr Edward does n't understand , father ? '
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 13]: ` Why , did n't you know of it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 8]: said John , opening his eyes wide .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 5]: ` How very singular !
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 33]: Bless you , he 's been here ever since noon to-day , and Mr Haredale has been having a long talk with him , and has n't been gone an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 7]: ` My father , Willet ! '
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 21]: ` Yes , sir , he told me so -- a handsome , slim , upright gentleman , in green-and-gold .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 9]: In your old room up yonder , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 25]: No doubt you can go in , sir , ' said John , walking backwards into the road and looking up at the window .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 14]: ` He has n't put out his candles yet , I see . '
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 50]: Edward glanced at the window also , and hastily murmuring that he had changed his mind -- forgotten something -- and must return to London , mounted his horse again and rode away ; leaving the Willets , father and son , looking at each other in mute astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 61]: Chapter 15 At noon next day , John Willet 's guest sat lingering over his breakfast in his own home , surrounded by a variety of comforts , which left the Maypole 's highest flight and utmost stretch of accommodation at an infinite distance behind , and suggested comparisons very much to the disadvantage and disfavour of that venerable tavern .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 49]: In the broad old-fashioned window-seat -- as capacious as many modern sofas , and cushioned to serve the purpose of a luxurious settee -- in the broad old-fashioned window-seat of a roomy chamber , Mr Chester lounged , very much at his ease , over a well-furnished breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 75]: He had exchanged his riding-coat for a handsome morning-gown , his boots for slippers ; had been at great pains to atone for the having been obliged to make his toilet when he rose without the aid of dressing-case and tiring equipage ; and , having gradually forgotten through these means the discomforts of an indifferent night and an early ride , was in a state of perfect complacency , indolence , and satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 84]: The situation in which he found himself , indeed , was particularly favourable to the growth of these feelings ; for , not to mention the lazy influence of a late and lonely breakfast , with the additional sedative of a newspaper , there was an air of repose about his place of residence peculiar to itself , and which hangs about it , even in these times , when it is more bustling and busy than it was in days of yore .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 29]: There are , still , worse places than the Temple , on a sultry day , for basking in the sun , or resting idly in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 66]: There is yet a drowsiness in its courts , and a dreamy dulness in its trees and gardens ; those who pace its lanes and squares may yet hear the echoes of their footsteps on the sounding stones , and read upon its gates , in passing from the tumult of the Strand or Fleet Street , ` Who enters here leaves noise behind . '
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 56]: There is still the plash of falling water in fair Fountain Court , and there are yet nooks and corners where dun-haunted students may look down from their dusty garrets , on a vagrant ray of sunlight patching the shade of the tall houses , and seldom troubled to reflect a passing stranger 's form .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 34]: There is yet , in the Temple , something of a clerkly monkish atmosphere , which public offices of law have not disturbed , and even legal firms have failed to scare away .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 67]: In summer time , its pumps suggest to thirsty idlers , springs cooler , and more sparkling , and deeper than other wells ; and as they trace the spillings of full pitchers on the heated ground , they snuff the freshness , and , sighing , cast sad looks towards the Thames , and think of baths and boats , and saunter on , despondent .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 101]: It was in a room in Paper Buildings -- a row of goodly tenements , shaded in front by ancient trees , and looking , at the back , upon the Temple Gardens -- that this , our idler , lounged ; now taking up again the paper he had laid down a hundred times ; now trifling with the fragments of his meal ; now pulling forth his golden toothpick , and glancing leisurely about the room , or out at window into the trim garden walks , where a few early loiterers were already pacing to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 78]: Here a pair of lovers met to quarrel and make up ; there a dark-eyed nursery-maid had better eyes for Templars than her charge ; on this hand an ancient spinster , with her lapdog in a string , regarded both enormities with scornful sidelong looks ; on that a weazen old gentleman , ogling the nursery-maid , looked with like scorn upon the spinster , and wondered she did n't know she was no longer young .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 37]: Apart from all these , on the river 's margin two or three couple of business-talkers walked slowly up and down in earnest conversation ; and one young man sat thoughtfully on a bench , alone .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 7]: ` Ned is amazingly patient ! '
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 25]: said Mr Chester , glancing at this last-named person as he set down his teacup and plied the golden toothpick , ` immensely patient !
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 18]: He was sitting yonder when I began to dress , and has scarcely changed his posture since .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 6]: A most eccentric dog ! '
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 17]: As he spoke , the figure rose , and came towards him with a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 22]: ` Really , as if he had heard me , ' said the father , resuming his newspaper with a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 5]: ` Dear Ned ! '
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 23]: Presently the room-door opened , and the young man entered ; to whom his father gently waved his hand , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 13]: ` Are you at leisure for a little conversation , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 5]: ` Surely , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 6]: I am always at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 5]: You know my constitution .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 6]: -- Have you breakfasted ? '
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 6]: ` Three hours ago . '
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 8]: ` What a very early dog ! '
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 16]: cried his father , contemplating him from behind the toothpick , with a languid smile .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 36]: ` The truth is , ' said Edward , bringing a chair forward , and seating himself near the table , ` that I slept but ill last night , and was glad to rise .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 26]: The cause of my uneasiness can not but be known to you , sir ; and it is upon that I wish to speak . '
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 18]: ` My dear boy , ' returned his father , ` confide in me , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 15]: But you know my constitution -- do n't be prosy , Ned . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 12]: I will be plain , and brief , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 27]: ` Do n't say you will , my good fellow , ' returned his father , crossing his legs , ` or you certainly will not .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 56]: You are going to tell me ' -- ` Plainly this , then , ' said the son , with an air of great concern , ` that I know where you were last night -- from being on the spot , indeed -- and whom you saw , and what your purpose was . '
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 8]: ` You do n't say so ! '
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 5]: cried his father . '
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 7]: I am delighted to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 24]: It saves us the worry , and terrible wear and tear of a long explanation , and is a great relief for both .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 5]: At the very house !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 7]: Why did n't you come up ?
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 11]: I should have been charmed to see you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 31]: I knew that what I had to say would be better said after a night 's reflection , when both of us were cool , ' returned the son . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 18]: Fore Gad , Ned , ' rejoined the father , ' I was cool enough last night .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 4]: That detestable Maypole !
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 18]: By some infernal contrivance of the builder , it holds the wind , and keeps it fresh .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 14]: You remember the sharp east wind that blew so hard five weeks ago ?
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 25]: I give you my honour it was rampant in that old house last night , though out of doors there was a dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 29]: But you were saying ' -- ' I was about to say , Heaven knows how seriously and earnestly , that you have made me wretched , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 10]: Will you hear me gravely for a moment ? '
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 22]: ` My dear Ned , ' said his father , ' I will hear you with the patience of an anchorite .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 8]: Oblige me with the milk . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 75]: I saw Miss Haredale last night , ' Edward resumed , when he had complied with this request ; ` her uncle , in her presence , immediately after your interview , and , as of course I know , in consequence of it , forbade me the house , and , with circumstances of indignity which are of your creation I am sure , commanded me to leave it on the instant . '
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 26]: ` For his manner of doing so , I give you my honour , Ned , I am not accountable , ' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 6]: ` That you must excuse .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 18]: He is a mere boor , a log , a brute , with no address in life .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 8]: -- Positively a fly in the jug .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 9]: The first I have seen this year . '
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 8]: Edward rose , and paced the room .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 7]: His imperturbable parent sipped his tea .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 24]: ` Father , ' said the young man , stopping at length before him , ` we must not trifle in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 10]: We must not deceive each other , or ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 23]: Let me pursue the manly open part I wish to take , and do not repel me by this unkind indifference . '
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 25]: ` Whether I am indifferent or no , ' returned the other , ' I leave you , my dear boy , to judge .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 94]: A ride of twenty-five or thirty miles , through miry roads -- a Maypole dinner -- a tete-a-tete with Haredale , which , vanity apart , was quite a Valentine and Orson business -- a Maypole bed -- a Maypole landlord , and a Maypole retinue of idiots and centaurs ; -- whether the voluntary endurance of these things looks like indifference , dear Ned , or like the excessive anxiety , and devotion , and all that sort of thing , of a parent , you shall determine for yourself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 22]: I wish you to consider , sir , ' said Edward , ` in what a cruel situation I am placed .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 30]: Loving Miss Haredale as I do ' -- ` My dear fellow , ' interrupted his father with a compassionate smile , ` you do nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 8]: You do n't know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 10]: There 's no such thing , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 9]: Now , do take my word for it .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 12]: You have good sense , Ned , -- great good sense .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 11]: I wonder you should be guilty of such amazing absurdities .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 7]: You really surprise me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 15]: I repeat , ' said his son firmly , ` that I love her .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 23]: You have interposed to part us , and have , to the extent I have just now told you of , succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 36]: May I induce you , sir , in time , to think more favourably of our attachment , or is it your intention and your fixed design to hold us asunder if you can ? '
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 31]: ` My dear Ned , ' returned his father , taking a pinch of snuff and pushing his box towards him , ` that is my purpose most undoubtedly . '
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 42]: ` The time that has elapsed , ' rejoined his son , ` since I began to know her worth , has flown in such a dream that until now I have hardly once paused to reflect upon my true position .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 31]: From my childhood I have been accustomed to luxury and idleness , and have been bred as though my fortune were large , and my expectations almost without a limit .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 13]: The idea of wealth has been familiarised to me from my cradle .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 31]: I have been taught to look upon those means , by which men raise themselves to riches and distinction , as being beyond my heeding , and beneath my care .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 18]: I have been , as the phrase is , liberally educated , and am fit for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 18]: I find myself at last wholly dependent upon you , with no resource but in your favour .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 21]: In this momentous question of my life we do not , and it would seem we never can , agree .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 38]: I have shrunk instinctively alike from those to whom you have urged me to pay court , and from the motives of interest and gain which have rendered them in your eyes visible objects for my suit .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 23]: If there never has been thus much plain-speaking between us before , sir , the fault has not been mine , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 43]: If I seem to speak too plainly now , it is , believe me father , in the hope that there may be a franker spirit , a worthier reliance , and a kinder confidence between us in time to come . '
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 17]: ` My good fellow , ' said his smiling father , ` you quite affect me .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 10]: Go on , my dear Edward , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 5]: But remember your promise .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 32]: There is great earnestness , vast candour , a manifest sincerity in all you say , but I fear I observe the faintest indications of a tendency to prose . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 9]: I am very sorry , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 27]: I am very sorry , too , Ned , but you know that I can not fix my mind for any long period upon one subject .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 25]: If you 'll come to the point at once , I 'll imagine all that ought to go before , and conclude it said .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 7]: Oblige me with the milk again .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 8]: Listening , invariably makes me feverish . '
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 16]: ` What I would say then , tends to this , ' said Edward . '
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 14]: I can not bear this absolute dependence , sir , even upon you .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 22]: Time has been lost and opportunity thrown away , but I am yet a young man , and may retrieve it .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 21]: Will you give me the means of devoting such abilities and energies as I possess , to some worthy pursuit ?
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 15]: Will you let me try to make for myself an honourable path in life ?
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 35]: For any term you please to name -- say for five years if you will -- I will pledge myself to move no further in the matter of our difference without your fall concurrence .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 47]: During that period , I will endeavour earnestly and patiently , if ever man did , to open some prospect for myself , and free you from the burden you fear I should become if I married one whose worth and beauty are her chief endowments .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 7]: Will you do this , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 17]: At the expiration of the term we agree upon , let us discuss this subject again .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 19]: Till then , unless it is revived by you , let it never be renewed between us . '
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 67]: ` My dear Ned , ' returned his father , laying down the newspaper at which he had been glancing carelessly , and throwing himself back in the window-seat , ' I believe you know how very much I dislike what are called family affairs , which are only fit for plebeian Christmas days , and have no manner of business with people of our condition .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 50]: But as you are proceeding upon a mistake , Ned -- altogether upon a mistake -- I will conquer my repugnance to entering on such matters , and give you a perfectly plain and candid answer , if you will do me the favour to shut the door . '
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 79]: Edward having obeyed him , he took an elegant little knife from his pocket , and paring his nails , continued : ` You have to thank me , Ned , for being of good family ; for your mother , charming person as she was , and almost broken-hearted , and so forth , as she left me , when she was prematurely compelled to become immortal -- had nothing to boast of in that respect . '
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 16]: ` Her father was at least an eminent lawyer , sir , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 9]: ` Quite right , Ned ; perfectly so .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 67]: He stood high at the bar , had a great name and great wealth , but having risen from nothing -- I have always closed my eyes to the circumstance and steadily resisted its contemplation , but I fear his father dealt in pork , and that his business did once involve cow-heel and sausages -- he wished to marry his daughter into a good family .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 9]: He had his heart 's desire , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 14]: I was a younger son 's younger son , and I married her .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 10]: We each had our object , and gained it .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 31]: She stepped at once into the politest and best circles , and I stepped into a fortune which I assure you was very necessary to my comfort -- quite indispensable .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 16]: Now , my good fellow , that fortune is among the things that have been .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 16]: It is gone , Ned , and has been gone -- how old are you ?
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 5]: I always forget . '
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 6]: ` Seven-and-twenty , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 6]: ` Are you indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 12]: cried his father , raising his eyelids in a languishing surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 4]: ` So much !
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 28]: Then I should say , Ned , that as nearly as I remember , its skirts vanished from human knowledge , about eighteen or nineteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 44]: It was about that time when I came to live in these chambers -LRB- once your grandfather 's , and bequeathed by that extremely respectable person to me -RRB- , and commenced to live upon an inconsiderable annuity and my past reputation . '
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 13]: ` You are jesting with me , sir , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 19]: ` Not in the slightest degree , I assure you , ' returned his father with great composure .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 24]: ` These family topics are so extremely dry , that I am sorry to say they do n't admit of any such relief .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 23]: It is for that reason , and because they have an appearance of business , that I dislike them so very much .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 5]: You know the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 41]: A son , Ned , unless he is old enough to be a companion -- that is to say , unless he is some two or three and twenty -- is not the kind of thing to have about one .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 24]: He is a restraint upon his father , his father is a restraint upon him , and they make each other mutually uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 50]: Therefore , until within the last four years or so -- I have a poor memory for dates , and if I mistake , you will correct me in your own mind -- you pursued your studies at a distance , and picked up a great variety of accomplishments .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 21]: Occasionally we passed a week or two together here , and disconcerted each other as only such near relations can .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 6]: At last you came home .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 33]: I candidly tell you , my dear boy , that if you had been awkward and overgrown , I should have exported you to some distant part of the world . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 15]: I wish with all my soul you had , sir , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 23]: ` No you do n't , Ned , ' said his father coolly ; ` you are mistaken , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 23]: I found you a handsome , prepossessing , elegant fellow , and I threw you into the society I can still command .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 34]: Having done that , my dear fellow , I consider that I have provided for you in life , and rely upon your doing something to provide for me in return . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 10]: I do not understand your meaning , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 73]: ` My meaning , Ned , is obvious -- I observe another fly in the cream-jug , but have the goodness not to take it out as you did the first , for their walk when their legs are milky , is extremely ungraceful and disagreeable -- my meaning is , that you must do as I did ; that you must marry well and make the most of yourself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 5]: A mere fortune-hunter ! '
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 6]: cried the son , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 15]: ` What in the devil 's name , Ned , would you be ! '
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: returned the father .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 10]: ` All men are fortune-hunters , are they not ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 28]: The law , the church , the court , the camp -- see how they are all crowded with fortune-hunters , jostling each other in the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 25]: The stock-exchange , the pulpit , the counting-house , the royal drawing-room , the senate , -- what but fortune-hunters are they filled with ?
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 3]: A fortune-hunter !
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 34]: You ARE one ; and you would be nothing else , my dear Ned , if you were the greatest courtier , lawyer , legislator , prelate , or merchant , in existence .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 30]: If you are squeamish and moral , Ned , console yourself with the reflection that at the very worst your fortune-hunting can make but one person miserable or unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 22]: How many people do you suppose these other kinds of huntsmen crush in following their sport -- hundreds at a step ?
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 4]: Or thousands ? '
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 16]: The young man leant his head upon his hand , and made no answer . '
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 60]: I am quite charmed , ' said the father rising , and walking slowly to and fro -- stopping now and then to glance at himself in the mirror , or survey a picture through his glass , with the air of a connoisseur , ` that we have had this conversation , Ned , unpromising as it was .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 35]: It establishes a confidence between us which is quite delightful , and was certainly necessary , though how you can ever have mistaken our positions and designs , I confess I can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 25]: I conceived , until I found your fancy for this girl , that all these points were tacitly agreed upon between us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 42]: I knew you were embarrassed , sir , ' returned the son , raising his head for a moment , and then falling into his former attitude , ` but I had no idea we were the beggared wretches you describe .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 29]: How could I suppose it , bred as I have been ; witnessing the life you have always led ; and the appearance you have always made ? '
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 50]: ` My dear child , ' said the father -- ` for you really talk so like a child that I must call you one -- you were bred upon a careful principle ; the very manner of your education , I assure you , maintained my credit surprisingly .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 14]: As to the life I lead , I must lead it , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 9]: I must have these little refinements about me .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 16]: I have always been used to them , and I can not exist without them .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 14]: They must surround me , you observe , and therefore they are here .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 19]: With regard to our circumstances , Ned , you may set your mind at rest upon that score .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 4]: They are desperate .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 18]: Your own appearance is by no means despicable , and our joint pocket-money alone devours our income .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 6]: That 's the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 9]: ` Why have I never known this before ?
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 25]: Why have you encouraged me , sir , to an expenditure and mode of life to which we have no right or title ? '
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 35]: ` My good fellow , ' returned his father more compassionately than ever , ` if you made no appearance , how could you possibly succeed in the pursuit for which I destined you ?
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 38]: As to our mode of life , every man has a right to live in the best way he can ; and to make himself as comfortable as he can , or he is an unnatural scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 37]: Our debts , I grant , are very great , and therefore it the more behoves you , as a young man of principle and honour , to pay them off as speedily as possible . '
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 17]: ` The villain 's part , ' muttered Edward , ` that I have unconsciously played !
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 9]: I to win the heart of Emma Haredale !
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 14]: I would , for her sake , I had died first ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 29]: I am glad you see , Ned , ' returned his father , ` how perfectly self-evident it is , that nothing can be done in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 37]: But apart from this , and the necessity of your speedily bestowing yourself on another -LRB- as you know you could to-morrow , if you chose -RRB- , I wish you 'd look upon it pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 26]: In a religious point of view alone , how could you ever think of uniting yourself to a Catholic , unless she was amazingly rich ?
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 18]: You ought to be so very Protestant , coming of such a Protestant family as you do .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 12]: Let us be moral , Ned , or we are nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 22]: Even if one could set that objection aside , which is impossible , we come to another which is quite conclusive .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 15]: The very idea of marrying a girl whose father was killed , like meat !
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 8]: Good God , Ned , how disagreeable !
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 46]: Consider the impossibility of having any respect for your father-in-law under such unpleasant circumstances -- think of his having been `` viewed '' by jurors , and `` sat upon '' by coroners , and of his very doubtful position in the family ever afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 31]: It seems to me such an indelicate sort of thing that I really think the girl ought to have been put to death by the state to prevent its happening .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 6]: But I tease you perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 6]: You would rather be alone ?
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: My dear Ned , most willingly .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 4]: God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 21]: I shall be going out presently , but we shall meet to-night , or if not to-night , certainly to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 14]: Take care of yourself in the mean time , for both our sakes .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 17]: You are a person of great consequence to me , Ned -- of vast consequence indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 5]: God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 36]: With these words , the father , who had been arranging his cravat in the glass , while he uttered them in a disconnected careless manner , withdrew , humming a tune as he went .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 24]: The son , who had appeared so lost in thought as not to hear or understand them , remained quite still and silent .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 20]: After the lapse of half an hour or so , the elder Chester , gaily dressed , went out .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 22]: The younger still sat with his head resting on his hands , in what appeared to be a kind of stupor .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 73]: Chapter 16 A series of pictures representing the streets of London in the night , even at the comparatively recent date of this tale , would present to the eye something so very different in character from the reality which is witnessed in these times , that it would be difficult for the beholder to recognise his most familiar walks in the altered aspect of little more than half a century ago .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 22]: They were , one and all , from the broadest and best to the narrowest and least frequented , very dark .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 66]: The oil and cotton lamps , though regularly trimmed twice or thrice in the long winter nights , burnt feebly at the best ; and at a late hour , when they were unassisted by the lamps and candles in the shops , cast but a narrow track of doubtful light upon the footway , leaving the projecting doors and house-fronts in the deepest gloom .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 36]: Many of the courts and lanes were left in total darkness ; those of the meaner sort , where one glimmering light twinkled for a score of houses , being favoured in no slight degree .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 41]: Even in these places , the inhabitants had often good reason for extinguishing their lamp as soon as it was lighted ; and the watch being utterly inefficient and powerless to prevent them , they did so at their pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 78]: Thus , in the lightest thoroughfares , there was at every turn some obscure and dangerous spot whither a thief might fly or shelter , and few would care to follow ; and the city being belted round by fields , green lanes , waste grounds , and lonely roads , dividing it at that time from the suburbs that have joined it since , escape , even where the pursuit was hot , was rendered easy .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 64]: It is no wonder that with these favouring circumstances in full and constant operation , street robberies , often accompanied by cruel wounds , and not unfrequently by loss of life , should have been of nightly occurrence in the very heart of London , or that quiet folks should have had great dread of traversing its streets after the shops were closed .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 94]: It was not unusual for those who wended home alone at midnight , to keep the middle of the road , the better to guard against surprise from lurking footpads ; few would venture to repair at a late hour to Kentish Town or Hampstead , or even to Kensington or Chelsea , unarmed and unattended ; while he who had been loudest and most valiant at the supper-table or the tavern , and had but a mile or so to go , was glad to fee a link-boy to escort him home .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 26]: There were many other characteristics -- not quite so disagreeable -- about the thoroughfares of London then , with which they had been long familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 64]: Some of the shops , especially those to the eastward of Temple Bar , still adhered to the old practice of hanging out a sign ; and the creaking and swinging of these boards in their iron frames on windy nights , formed a strange and mournfal concert for the ears of those who lay awake in bed or hurried through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 121]: Long stands of hackney-chairs and groups of chairmen , compared with whom the coachmen of our day are gentle and polite , obstructed the way and filled the air with clamour ; night-cellars , indicated by a little stream of light crossing the pavement , and stretching out half-way into the road , and by the stifled roar of voices from below , yawned for the reception and entertainment of the most abandoned of both sexes ; under every shed and bulk small groups of link-boys gamed away the earnings of the day ; or one more weary than the rest , gave way to sleep , and let the fragment of his torch fall hissing on the puddled ground .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 56]: Then there was the watch with staff and lantern crying the hour , and the kind of weather ; and those who woke up at his voice and turned them round in bed , were glad to hear it rained , or snowed , or blew , or froze , for very comfort 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 18]: The solitary passenger was startled by the chairmen 's cry of ` By your leave there ! '
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 26]: as two came trotting past him with their empty vehicle -- carried backwards to show its being disengaged -- and hurried to the nearest stand .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 63]: Many a private chair , too , inclosing some fine lady , monstrously hooped and furbelowed , and preceded by running-footmen bearing flambeaux -- for which extinguishers are yet suspended before the doors of a few houses of the better sort -- made the way gay and light as it danced along , and darker and more dismal when it had passed .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 63]: It was not unusual for these running gentry , who carried it with a very high hand , to quarrel in the servants ' hall while waiting for their masters and mistresses ; and , falling to blows either there or in the street without , to strew the place of skirmish with hair-powder , fragments of bag-wigs , and scattered nosegays .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 57]: Gaming , the vice which ran so high among all classes -LRB- the fashion being of course set by the upper -RRB- , was generally the cause of these disputes ; for cards and dice were as openly used , and worked as much mischief , and yielded as much excitement below stairs , as above .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 113]: While incidents like these , arising out of drums and masquerades and parties at quadrille , were passing at the west end of the town , heavy stagecoaches and scarce heavier waggons were lumbering slowly towards the city , the coachmen , guard , and passengers , armed to the teeth , and the coach -- a day or so perhaps behind its time , but that was nothing -- despoiled by highwaymen ; who made no scruple to attack , alone and single-handed , a whole caravan of goods and men , and sometimes shot a passenger or two , and were sometimes shot themselves , as the case might be .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 73]: On the morrow , rumours of this new act of daring on the road yielded matter for a few hours ' conversation through the town , and a Public Progress of some fine gentleman -LRB- half-drunk -RRB- to Tyburn , dressed in the newest fashion , and damning the ordinary with unspeakable gallantry and grace , furnished to the populace , at once a pleasant excitement and a wholesome and profound example .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 43]: Among all the dangerous characters who , in such a state of society , prowled and skulked in the metropolis at night , there was one man from whom many as uncouth and fierce as he , shrunk with an involuntary dread .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 21]: Who he was , or whence he came , was a question often asked , but which none could answer .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 40]: His name was unknown , he had never been seen until within about eight days or thereabouts , and was equally a stranger to the old ruffians , upon whose haunts he ventured fearlessly , as to the young .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 42]: He could be no spy , for he never removed his slouched hat to look about him , entered into conversation with no man , heeded nothing that passed , listened to no discourse , regarded nobody that came or went .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 40]: But so surely as the dead of night set in , so surely this man was in the midst of the loose concourse in the night-cellar where outcasts of every grade resorted ; and there he sat till morning .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 36]: He was not only a spectre at their licentious feasts ; a something in the midst of their revelry and riot that chilled and haunted them ; but out of doors he was the same .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 58]: Directly it was dark , he was abroad -- never in company with any one , but always alone ; never lingering or loitering , but always walking swiftly ; and looking -LRB- so they said who had seen him -RRB- over his shoulder from time to time , and as he did so quickening his pace .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 36]: In the fields , the lanes , the roads , in all quarters of the town -- east , west , north , and south -- that man was seen gliding on like a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: He was always hurrying away .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 25]: Those who encountered him , saw him steal past , caught sight of the backward glance , and so lost him in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 16]: This constant restlessness , and flitting to and fro , gave rise to strange stories .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 48]: He was seen in such distant and remote places , at times so nearly tallying with each other , that some doubted whether there were not two of them , or more -- some , whether he had not unearthly means of travelling from spot to spot .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 79]: The footpad hiding in a ditch had marked him passing like a ghost along its brink ; the vagrant had met him on the dark high-road ; the beggar had seen him pause upon the bridge to look down at the water , and then sweep on again ; they who dealt in bodies with the surgeons could swear he slept in churchyards , and that they had beheld him glide away among the tombs on their approach .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 32]: And as they told these stories to each other , one who had looked about him would pull his neighbour by the sleeve , and there he would be among them .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 25]: At last , one man -- he was one of those whose commerce lay among the graves -- resolved to question this strange companion .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 43]: Next night , when he had eat his poor meal voraciously -LRB- he was accustomed to do that , they had observed , as though he had no other in the day -RRB- , this fellow sat down at his elbow . '
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 7]: A black night , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 8]: ` It is a black night . '
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 11]: ` Blacker than last , though that was pitchy too .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 14]: Did n't I pass you near the turnpike in the Oxford Road ? '
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 7]: ` It 's like you may .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 35]: ` Come , come , master , ' cried the fellow , urged on by the looks of his comrades , and slapping him on the shoulder ; ` be more companionable and communicative .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 9]: Be more the gentleman in this good company .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 21]: There are tales among us that you have sold yourself to the devil , and I know not what . '
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 10]: ` We all have , have we not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 7]: returned the stranger , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 16]: ` If we were fewer in number , perhaps he would give better wages . '
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 28]: ` It goes rather hard with you , indeed , ' said the fellow , as the stranger disclosed his haggard unwashed face , and torn clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 5]: ` What of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 5]: Be merry , master .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 81]: A stave of a roaring song now ' -- ` Sing you , if you desire to hear one , ' replied the other , shaking him roughly off ; ` and do n't touch me if you 're a prudent man ; I carry arms which go off easily -- they have done so , before now -- and make it dangerous for strangers who do n't know the trick of them , to lay hands upon me . '
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 6]: ` Do you threaten ? '
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 4]: said the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 27]: ` Yes , ' returned the other , rising and turning upon him , and looking fiercely round as if in apprehension of a general attack .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 25]: His voice , and look , and bearing -- all expressive of the wildest recklessness and desperation -- daunted while they repelled the bystanders .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 27]: Although in a very different sphere of action now , they were not without much of the effect they had wrought at the Maypole Inn . '
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 26]: I am what you all are , and live as you all do , ' said the man sternly , after a short silence . '
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 25]: I am in hiding here like the rest , and if we were surprised would perhaps do my part with the best of ye .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 16]: If it 's my humour to be left to myself , let me have it .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 33]: Otherwise , ' -- and here he swore a tremendous oath -- ` there 'll be mischief done in this place , though there ARE odds of a score against me . '
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 78]: A low murmur , having its origin perhaps in a dread of the man and the mystery that surrounded him , or perhaps in a sincere opinion on the part of some of those present , that it would be an inconvenient precedent to meddle too curiously with a gentleman 's private affairs if he saw reason to conceal them , warned the fellow who had occasioned this discussion that he had best pursue it no further .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 29]: After a short time the strange man lay down upon a bench to sleep , and when they thought of him again , they found he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 42]: Next night , as soon as it was dark , he was abroad again and traversing the streets ; he was before the locksmith 's house more than once , but the family were out , and it was close shut .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 11]: This night he crossed London Bridge and passed into Southwark .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 26]: As he glided down a bye street , a woman with a little basket on her arm , turned into it at the other end .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 21]: Directly he observed her , he sought the shelter of an archway , and stood aside until she had passed .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 11]: Then he emerged cautiously from his hiding-place , and followed .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 34]: She went into several shops to purchase various kinds of household necessaries , and round every place at which she stopped he hovered like her evil spirit ; following her when she reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 25]: It was nigh eleven o'clock , and the passengers in the streets were thinning fast , when she turned , doubtless to go home .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 6]: The phantom still followed her .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 29]: She turned into the same bye street in which he had seen her first , which , being free from shops , and narrow , was extremely dark .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 25]: She quickened her pace here , as though distrustful of being stopped , and robbed of such trifling property as she carried with her .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 11]: He crept along on the other side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 23]: Had she been gifted with the speed of wind , it seemed as if his terrible shadow would have tracked her down .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 30]: At length the widow -- for she it was -- reached her own door , and , panting for breath , paused to take the key from her basket .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 49]: In a flush and glow , with the haste she had made , and the pleasure of being safe at home , she stooped to draw it out , when , raising her head , she saw him standing silently beside her : the apparition of a dream .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 29]: His hand was on her mouth , but that was needless , for her tongue clove to its roof , and her power of utterance was gone . '
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 9]: I have been looking for you many nights .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 5]: Is the house empty ?
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 3]: Answer me .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 6]: Is any one inside ? '
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 11]: She could only answer by a rattle in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 7]: ` Make me a sign . '
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 11]: She seemed to indicate that there was no one there .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 20]: He took the key , unlocked the door , carried her in , and secured it carefully behind them .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 20]: Chapter 17 It was a chilly night , and the fire in the widow 's parlour had burnt low .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 27]: Her strange companion placed her in a chair , and stooping down before the half-extinguished ashes , raked them together and fanned them with his hat .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 39]: From time to time he glanced at her over his shoulder , as though to assure himself of her remaining quiet and making no effort to depart ; and that done , busied himself about the fire again .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 35]: It was not without reason that he took these pains , for his dress was dank and drenched with wet , his jaws rattled with cold , and he shivered from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 24]: It had rained hard during the previous night and for some hours in the morning , but since noon it had been fine .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 25]: Wheresoever he had passed the hours of darkness , his condition sufficiently betokened that many of them had been spent beneath the open sky .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 63]: Besmeared with mire ; his saturated clothes clinging with a damp embrace about his limbs ; his beard unshaven , his face unwashed , his meagre cheeks worn into deep hollows , -- a more miserable wretch could hardly be , than this man who now cowered down upon the widow 's hearth , and watched the struggling flame with bloodshot eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 20]: She had covered her face with her hands , fearing , as it seemed , to look towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 10]: So they remained for some short time in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 16]: Glancing round again , he asked at length : ` Is this your house ? '
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 4]: ` It is .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 14]: Why , in the name of Heaven , do you darken it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 21]: ` Give me meat and drink , ' he answered sullenly , ` or I dare do more than that .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 14]: The very marrow in my bones is cold , with wet and hunger .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 15]: I must have warmth and food , and I will have them here . '
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 12]: ` You were the robber on the Chigwell road . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 4]: I was . '
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 8]: ` And nearly a murderer then . '
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 7]: ` The will was not wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 25]: There was one came upon me and raised the hue-and-cry ' , that it would have gone hard with , but for his nimbleness .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 8]: I made a thrust at him . '
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 9]: ` You thrust your sword at HIM ! '
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 7]: cried the widow , looking upwards .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 6]: ` You hear this man !
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 6]: you hear and saw ! '
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 30]: He looked at her , as , with her head thrown back , and her hands tight clenched together , she uttered these words in an agony of appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 16]: Then , starting to his feet as she had done , he advanced towards her .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 4]: ` Beware ! '
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 13]: she cried in a suppressed voice , whose firmness stopped him midway .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 26]: ` Do not so much as touch me with a finger , or you are lost ; body and soul , you are lost . '
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 14]: ` Hear me , ' he replied , menacing her with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 82]: ` I , that in the form of a man live the life of a hunted beast ; that in the body am a spirit , a ghost upon the earth , a thing from which all creatures shrink , save those curst beings of another world , who will not leave me ; -- I am , in my desperation of this night , past all fear but that of the hell in which I exist from day to day .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 12]: Give the alarm , cry out , refuse to shelter me .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 6]: I will not hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 28]: But I will not be taken alive ; and so surely as you threaten me above your breath , I fall a dead man on this floor .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 29]: The blood with which I sprinkle it , be on you and yours , in the name of the Evil Spirit that tempts men to their ruin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 20]: As he spoke , he took a pistol from his breast , and firmly clutched it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 11]: ` Remove this man from me , good Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 4]: cried the widow .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 20]: ` In thy grace and mercy , give him one minute 's penitence , and strike him dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 14]: ` It has no such purpose , ' he said , confronting her .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 5]: ` It is deaf .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 26]: Give me to eat and drink , lest I do that it can not help my doing , and will not do for you . '
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 12]: ` Will you leave me , if I do thus much ?
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 11]: Will you leave me and return no more ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 31]: I will promise nothing , ' he rejoined , seating himself at the table , ` nothing but this -- I will execute my threat if you betray me . '
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 32]: She rose at length , and going to a closet or pantry in the room , brought out some fragments of cold meat and bread and put them on the table .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 9]: He asked for brandy , and for water .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 18]: These she produced likewise ; and he ate and drank with the voracity of a famished hound .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 29]: All the time he was so engaged she kept at the uttermost distance of the chamber , and sat there shuddering , but with her face towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 80]: She never turned her back upon him once ; and although when she passed him -LRB- as she was obliged to do in going to and from the cupboard -RRB- she gathered the skirts of her garment about her , as if even its touching his by chance were horrible to think of , still , in the midst of all this dread and terror , she kept her face towards his own , and watched his every movement .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 51]: His repast ended -- if that can be called one , which was a mere ravenous satisfying of the calls of hunger -- he moved his chair towards the fire again , and warming himself before the blaze which had now sprung brightly up , accosted her once more . '
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 29]: I am an outcast , to whom a roof above his head is often an uncommon luxury , and the food a beggar would reject is delicate fare .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 7]: You live here at your ease .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 7]: Do you live alone ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 12]: I do not , ' she made answer with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 7]: ` Who dwells here besides ? '
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 9]: ` One -- it is no matter who .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 12]: You had best begone , or he may find you here .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 6]: Why do you linger ? '
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 16]: ` For warmth , ' he replied , spreading out his hands before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 4]: ` For warmth .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 7]: You are rich , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 8]: ` Very , ' she said faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 4]: ` Very rich .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 8]: No doubt I am very rich . '
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 8]: ` At least you are not penniless .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 5]: You have some money .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 8]: You were making purchases to-night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 6]: I have a little left .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 8]: It is but a few shillings . '
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 6]: ` Give me your purse .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 10]: You had it in your hand at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 6]: Give it to me . '
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 10]: She stepped to the table and laid it down .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 16]: He reached across , took it up , and told the contents into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 17]: As he was counting them , she listened for a moment , and sprung towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 24]: ` Take what there is , take all , take more if more were there , but go before it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 13]: I have heard a wayward step without , I know full well .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 5]: It will return directly .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 3]: Begone . '
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 7]: ` Do not stop to ask .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: I will not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 29]: Much as I dread to touch you , I would drag you to the door if I possessed the strength , rather than you should lose an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 3]: Miserable wretch !
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 6]: fly from this place . '
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 21]: ` If there are spies without , I am safer here , ' replied the man , standing aghast . '
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 16]: I will remain here , and will not fly till the danger is past . '
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 7]: ` It is too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 16]: cried the widow , who had listened for the step , and not to him .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 9]: ` Hark to that foot upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 7]: Do you tremble to hear it !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 10]: It is my son , my idiot son ! '
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 15]: As she said this wildly , there came a heavy knocking at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 10]: He looked at her , and she at him .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 14]: ` Let him come in , ' said the man , hoarsely . '
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 11]: I fear him less than the dark , houseless night .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 4]: He knocks again .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 6]: Let him come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 26]: ` The dread of this hour , ' returned the widow , ` has been upon me all my life , and I will not .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 13]: Evil will fall upon him , if you stand eye to eye .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 4]: My blighted boy !
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 26]: all good angels who know the truth -- hear a poor mother 's prayer , and spare my boy from knowledge of this man ! '
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 8]: ` He rattles at the shutters ! '
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 4]: cried the man .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 5]: ` He calls you .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 5]: That voice and cry !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 11]: It was he who grappled with me in the road .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 5]: Was it he ? '
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 21]: She had sunk upon her knees , and so knelt down , moving her lips , but uttering no sound .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 20]: As he gazed upon her , uncertain what to do or where to turn , the shutters flew open .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 50]: He had barely time to catch a knife from the table , sheathe it in the loose sleeve of his coat , hide in the closet , and do all with the lightning 's speed , when Barnaby tapped at the bare glass , and raised the sash exultingly .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 12]: ` Why , who can keep out Grip and me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 14]: he cried , thrusting in his head , and staring round the room .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 7]: ` Are you there , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 12]: How long you keep us from the fire and light . '
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 10]: She stammered some excuse and tendered him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 22]: But Barnaby sprung lightly in without assistance , and putting his arms about her neck , kissed her a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 28]: ` We have been afield , mother -- leaping ditches , scrambling through hedges , running down steep banks , up and away , and hurrying on .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 35]: The wind has been blowing , and the rushes and young plants bowing and bending to it , lest it should do them harm , the cowards -- and Grip -- ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 58]: -- brave Grip , who cares for nothing , and when the wind rolls him over in the dust , turns manfully to bite it -- Grip , bold Grip , has quarrelled with every little bowing twig -- thinking , he told me , that it mocked him -- and has worried it like a bulldog .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 68]: The raven , in his little basket at his master 's back , hearing this frequent mention of his name in a tone of exultation , expressed his sympathy by crowing like a cock , and afterwards running over his various phrases of speech with such rapidity , and in so many varieties of hoarseness , that they sounded like the murmurs of a crowd of people .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 10]: ` He takes such care of me besides ! '
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 3]: said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 6]: ` Such care , mother !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 50]: He watches all the time I sleep , and when I shut my eyes and make-believe to slumber , he practises new learning softly ; but he keeps his eye on me the while , and if he sees me laugh , though never so little , stops directly .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 11]: He wo n't surprise me till he 's perfect . '
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 28]: The raven crowed again in a rapturous manner which plainly said , ` Those are certainly some of my characteristics , and I glory in them . '
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 29]: In the meantime , Barnaby closed the window and secured it , and coming to the fireplace , prepared to sit down with his face to the closet .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 20]: But his mother prevented this , by hastily taking that side herself , and motioning him towards the other .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 8]: ` How pale you are to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 8]: said Barnaby , leaning on his stick .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 14]: ` We have been cruel , Grip , and made her anxious ! '
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 10]: Anxious in good truth , and sick at heart !
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 19]: The listener held the door of his hiding-place open with his hand , and closely watched her son .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 31]: Grip -- alive to everything his master was unconscious of -- had his head out of the basket , and in return was watching him intently with his glistening eye .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 40]: ` He flaps his wings , ' said Barnaby , turning almost quickly enough to catch the retreating form and closing door , ` as if there were strangers here , but Grip is wiser than to fancy that .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 4]: Jump then ! '
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 33]: Accepting this invitation with a dignity peculiar to himself , the bird hopped up on his master 's shoulder , from that to his extended hand , and so to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 37]: Barnaby unstrapping the basket and putting it down in a corner with the lid open , Grip 's first care was to shut it down with all possible despatch , and then to stand upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 48]: Believing , no doubt , that he had now rendered it utterly impossible , and beyond the power of mortal man , to shut him up in it any more , he drew a great many corks in triumph , and uttered a corresponding number of hurrahs .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 4]: ` Mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 44]: said Barnaby , laying aside his hat and stick , and returning to the chair from which he had risen , ` I 'll tell you where we have been to-day , and what we have been doing , -- shall I ? '
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 19]: She took his hand in hers , and holding it , nodded the word she could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 36]: ` You must n't tell , ' said Barnaby , holding up his finger , ` for it 's a secret , mind , and only known to me , and Grip , and Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 30]: We had the dog with us , but he 's not like Grip , clever as he is , and does n't guess it yet , I 'll wager .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 10]: -- Why do you look behind me so ? '
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 5]: ` Did I ? '
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 5]: she answered faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 7]: I did n't know I did .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 5]: Come nearer me . '
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 6]: ` You are frightened ! '
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 6]: said Barnaby , changing colour .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 14]: ` Mother -- you do n't see ' -- ` See what ? '
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 15]: ` There 's -- there 's none of this about , is there ? '
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 19]: he answered in a whisper , drawing closer to her and clasping the mark upon his wrist . '
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 8]: I am afraid there is , somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 13]: You make my hair stand on end , and my flesh creep .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 7]: Why do you look like that ?
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 23]: Is it in the room as I have seen it in my dreams , dashing the ceiling and the walls with red ?
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 3]: Tell me .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 4]: Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 32]: He fell into a shivering fit as he put the question , and shutting out the light with his hands , sat shaking in every limb until it had passed away .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 13]: After a time , he raised his head and looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 6]: ` Is it gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 15]: ` There has been nothing here , ' rejoined his mother , soothing him .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 7]: ` Nothing indeed , dear Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 10]: You see there are but you and me . '
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 19]: He gazed at her vacantly , and , becoming reassured by degrees , burst into a wild laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 12]: ` But let us see , ' he said , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 5]: ` Were we talking ?
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 6]: Was it you and me ?
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 6]: Where have we been ? '
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 6]: ` Nowhere but here . '
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 19]: ` Aye , but Hugh , and I , ' said Barnaby , -- ` that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 55]: Maypole Hugh , and I , you know , and Grip -- we have been lying in the forest , and among the trees by the road side , with a dark lantern after night came on , and the dog in a noose ready to slip him when the man came by . '
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 5]: ` What man ? '
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 11]: ` The robber ; him that the stars winked at .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 17]: We have waited for him after dark these many nights , and we shall have him .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 8]: I 'd know him in a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 5]: Mother , see here !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 5]: This is the man .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 3]: Look ! '
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 50]: He twisted his handkerchief round his head , pulled his hat upon his brow , wrapped his coat about him , and stood up before her : so like the original he counterfeited , that the dark figure peering out behind him might have passed for his own shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 22]: We shall have him , ' he cried , ridding himself of the semblance as hastily as he had assumed it .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 35]: ` You shall see him , mother , bound hand and foot , and brought to London at a saddle-girth ; and you shall hear of him at Tyburn Tree if we have luck .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: So Hugh says .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 8]: You 're pale again , and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 10]: And why DO you look behind me so ? '
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 10]: ` It is nothing , ' she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 6]: I am not quite well .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 13]: Go you to bed , dear , and leave me here . '
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 5]: ` To bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 4]: he answered . '
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 6]: I do n't like bed .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 36]: I like to lie before the fire , watching the prospects in the burning coals -- the rivers , hills , and dells , in the deep , red sunset , and the wild faces .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 14]: I am hungry too , and Grip has eaten nothing since broad noon .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 5]: Let us to supper .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 2]: Grip !
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 6]: To supper , lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 41]: The raven flapped his wings , and , croaking his satisfaction , hopped to the feet of his master , and there held his bill open , ready for snapping up such lumps of meat as he should throw him .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 16]: Of these he received about a score in rapid succession , without the smallest discomposure .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 9]: ` That 's all , ' said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 4]: ` More ! '
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 3]: cried Grip .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 4]: ` More ! '
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 63]: But it appearing for a certainty that no more was to be had , he retreated with his store ; and disgorging the morsels one by one from his pouch , hid them in various corners -- taking particular care , however , to avoid the closet , as being doubtful of the hidden man 's propensities and power of resisting temptation .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 66]: When he had concluded these arrangements , he took a turn or two across the room with an elaborate assumption of having nothing on his mind -LRB- but with one eye hard upon his treasure all the time -RRB- , and then , and not till then , began to drag it out , piece by piece , and eat it with the utmost relish .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 21]: Barnaby , for his part , having pressed his mother to eat in vain , made a hearty supper too .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 21]: Once during the progress of his meal , he wanted more bread from the closet and rose to get it .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 24]: She hurriedly interposed to prevent him , and summoning her utmost fortitude , passed into the recess , and brought it out herself .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 28]: ` Mother , ' said Barnaby , looking at her steadfastly as she sat down beside him after doing so ; ` is to-day my birthday ? '
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 4]: ` To-day ! '
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 32]: ` Do n't you recollect it was but a week or so ago , and that summer , autumn , and winter have to pass before it comes again ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 14]: I remember that it has been so till now , ' said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 16]: ` But I think to-day must be my birthday too , for all that . '
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 5]: She asked him why ?
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 12]: ` I 'll tell you why , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 28]: I have always seen you -- I did n't let you know it , but I have -- on the evening of that day grow very sad .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 39]: I have seen you cry when Grip and I were most glad ; and look frightened with no reason ; and I have touched your hand , and felt that it was cold -- as it is now .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 49]: Once , mother -LRB- on a birthday that was , also -RRB- , Grip and I thought of this after we went upstairs to bed , and when it was midnight , striking one o'clock , we came down to your door to see if you were well .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 6]: You were on your knees .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 8]: I forget what it was you said .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 13]: Grip , what was it we heard her say that night ? '
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 7]: ` I 'm a devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 5]: rejoined the raven promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 41]: ` But you said something in a prayer ; and when you rose and walked about , you looked -LRB- as you have done ever since , mother , towards night on my birthday -RRB- just as you do now .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 14]: I have found that out , you see , though I am silly .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 20]: So I say you 're wrong ; and this must be my birthday -- my birthday , Grip ! '
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 33]: The bird received this information with a crow of such duration as a cock , gifted with intelligence beyond all others of his kind , might usher in the longest day with .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 28]: Then , as if he had well considered the sentiment , and regarded it as apposite to birthdays , he cried , ` Never say die ! '
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 12]: a great many times , and flapped his wings for emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 34]: The widow tried to make light of Barnaby 's remark , and endeavoured to divert his attention to some new subject ; too easy a task at all times , as she knew .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 57]: His supper done , Barnaby , regardless of her entreaties , stretched himself on the mat before the fire ; Grip perched upon his leg , and divided his time between dozing in the grateful warmth , and endeavouring -LRB- as it presently appeared -RRB- to recall a new accomplishment he had been studying all day .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 81]: A long and profound silence ensued , broken only by some change of position on the part of Barnaby , whose eyes were still wide open and intently fixed upon the fire ; or by an effort of recollection on the part of Grip , who would cry in a low voice from time to time , ` Polly put the ket -- ' and there stop short , forgetting the remainder , and go off in a doze again .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 20]: After a long interval , Barnaby 's breathing grew more deep and regular , and his eyes were closed .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 11]: But even then the unquiet spirit of the raven interposed .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 18]: ` Polly put the ket -- ' cried Grip , and his master was broad awake again .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 48]: At length Barnaby slept soundly , and the bird with his bill sunk upon his breast , his breast itself puffed out into a comfortable alderman-like form , and his bright eye growing smaller and smaller , really seemed to be subsiding into a state of repose .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 32]: Now and then he muttered in a sepulchral voice , ` Polly put the ket -- ' but very drowsily , and more like a drunken man than a reflecting raven .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 13]: The widow , scarcely venturing to breathe , rose from her seat .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: The man glided from the closet , and extinguished the candle . '
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 19]: -- tle on , ' cried Grip , suddenly struck with an idea and very much excited . '
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 4]: -- tle on .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 24]: Polly put the ket-tle on , we 'll all have tea ; Polly put the ket-tle on , we 'll all have tea .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 6]: Hurrah , hurrah , hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 58]: I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil , I 'm a ket-tle on , Keep up your spirits , Never say die , Bow , wow , wow , I 'm a devil , I 'm a ket-tle , I 'm a -- Polly put the ket-tle on , we 'll all have tea . '
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 18]: They stood rooted to the ground , as though it had been a voice from the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 9]: But even this failed to awaken the sleeper .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 22]: He turned over towards the fire , his arm fell to the ground , and his head drooped heavily upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 26]: The widow and her unwelcome visitor gazed at him and at each other for a moment , and then she motioned him towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 7]: ` Stay , ' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 9]: ` You teach your son well . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 10]: I have taught him nothing that you heard to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 10]: Depart instantly , or I will rouse him . '
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 8]: ` You are free to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 6]: Shall I rouse him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 9]: ` You dare not do that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 10]: I dare do anything , I have told you .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 8]: He knows me well , it seems .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 8]: At least I will know him . '
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 10]: ` Would you kill him in his sleep ? '
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 9]: cried the widow , throwing herself between them .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 27]: ` Woman , ' he returned between his teeth , as he motioned her aside , ' I would see him nearer , and I will .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 15]: If you want one of us to kill the other , wake him . '
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 24]: With that he advanced , and bending down over the prostrate form , softly turned back the head and looked into the face .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 17]: The light of the fire was upon it , and its every lineament was revealed distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 12]: He contemplated it for a brief space , and hastily uprose .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 32]: ` Observe , ' he whispered in the widow 's ear : ` In him , of whose existence I was ignorant until to-night , I have you in my power .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 7]: Be careful how you use me .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 7]: Be careful how you use me .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 13]: I am destitute and starving , and a wanderer upon the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 10]: I may take a sure and slow revenge . '
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 10]: ` There is some dreadful meaning in your words .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 7]: I do not fathom it . '
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 19]: ` There is a meaning in them , and I see you fathom it to its very depth .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 14]: You have anticipated it for years ; you have told me as much .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 7]: I leave you to digest it .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 7]: Do not forget my warning . '
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 24]: He pointed , as he left her , to the slumbering form , and stealthily withdrawing , made his way into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 33]: She fell on her knees beside the sleeper , and remained like one stricken into stone , until the tears which fear had frozen so long , came tenderly to her relief .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 99]: ` Oh Thou , ' she cried , ` who hast taught me such deep love for this one remnant of the promise of a happy life , out of whose affliction , even , perhaps the comfort springs that he is ever a relying , loving child to me -- never growing old or cold at heart , but needing my care and duty in his manly strength as in his cradle-time -- help him , in his darkened walk through this sad world , or he is doomed , and my poor heart is broken ! '
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 80]: Chapter 18 Gliding along the silent streets , and holding his course where they were darkest and most gloomy , the man who had left the widow 's house crossed London Bridge , and arriving in the City , plunged into the backways , lanes , and courts , between Cornhill and Smithfield ; with no more fixedness of purpose than to lose himself among their windings , and baffle pursuit , if any one were dogging his steps .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: It was the dead time of the night , and all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 40]: Now and then a drowsy watchman 's footsteps sounded on the pavement , or the lamplighter on his rounds went flashing past , leaving behind a little track of smoke mingled with glowing morsels of his hot red link .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 38]: He hid himself even from these partakers of his lonely walk , and , shrinking in some arch or doorway while they passed , issued forth again when they were gone and so pursued his solitary way .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 85]: To be shelterless and alone in the open country , hearing the wind moan and watching for day through the whole long weary night ; to listen to the falling rain , and crouch for warmth beneath the lee of some old barn or rick , or in the hollow of a tree ; are dismal things -- but not so dismal as the wandering up and down where shelter is , and beds and sleepers are by thousands ; a houseless rejected creature .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 155]: To pace the echoing stones from hour to hour , counting the dull chimes of the clocks ; to watch the lights twinkling in chamber windows , to think what happy forgetfulness each house shuts in ; that here are children coiled together in their beds , here youth , here age , here poverty , here wealth , all equal in their sleep , and all at rest ; to have nothing in common with the slumbering world around , not even sleep , Heaven 's gift to all its creatures , and be akin to nothing but despair ; to feel , by the wretched contrast with everything on every hand , more utterly alone and cast away than in a trackless desert ; this is a kind of suffering , on which the rivers of great cities close full many a time , and which the solitude in crowds alone awakens .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 41]: The miserable man paced up and down the streets -- so long , so wearisome , so like each other -- and often cast a wistful look towards the east , hoping to see the first faint streaks of day .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 20]: But obdurate night had yet possession of the sky , and his disturbed and restless walk found no relief .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 44]: One house in a back street was bright with the cheerful glare of lights ; there was the sound of music in it too , and the tread of dancers , and there were cheerful voices , and many a burst of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 57]: To this place -- to be near something that was awake and glad -- he returned again and again ; and more than one of those who left it when the merriment was at its height , felt it a check upon their mirthful mood to see him flitting to and fro like an uneasy ghost .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 29]: At last the guests departed , one and all ; and then the house was close shut up , and became as dull and silent as the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 12]: His wanderings brought him at one time to the city jail .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 56]: Instead of hastening from it as a place of ill omen , and one he had cause to shun , he sat down on some steps hard by , and resting his chin upon his hand , gazed upon its rough and frowning walls as though even they became a refuge in his jaded eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 19]: He paced it round and round , came back to the same spot , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 39]: He did this often , and once , with a hasty movement , crossed to where some men were watching in the prison lodge , and had his foot upon the steps as though determined to accost them .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 23]: But looking round , he saw that the day began to break , and failing in his purpose , turned and fled .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 23]: He was soon in the quarter he had lately traversed , and pacing to and fro again as he had done before .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 51]: He was passing down a mean street , when from an alley close at hand some shouts of revelry arose , and there came straggling forth a dozen madcaps , whooping and calling to each other , who , parting noisily , took different ways and dispersed in smaller groups .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 54]: Hoping that some low place of entertainment which would afford him a safe refuge might be near at hand , he turned into this court when they were all gone , and looked about for a half-opened door , or lighted window , or other indication of the place whence they had come .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 36]: It was so profoundly dark , however , and so ill-favoured , that he concluded they had but turned up there , missing their way , and were pouring out again when he observed them .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 45]: With this impression , and finding there was no outlet but that by which he had entered , he was about to turn , when from a grating near his feet a sudden stream of light appeared , and the sound of talking came .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 18]: He retreated into a doorway to see who these talkers were , and to listen to them .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 26]: The light came to the level of the pavement as he did this , and a man ascended , bearing in his hand a torch .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 42]: This figure unlocked and held open the grating as for the passage of another , who presently appeared , in the form of a young man of small stature and uncommon self-importance , dressed in an obsolete and very gaudy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 14]: ` Good night , noble captain , ' said he with the torch .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 5]: ` Farewell , commander .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 7]: Good luck , illustrious general ! '
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 38]: In return to these compliments the other bade him hold his tongue , and keep his noise to himself , and laid upon him many similar injunctions , with great fluency of speech and sternness of manner .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 20]: ` Commend me , captain , to the stricken Miggs , ' returned the torch-bearer in a lower voice .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 10]: ` My captain flies at higher game than Miggses .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 15]: My captain is an eagle , both as respects his eye and soaring wings .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 13]: My captain breaketh hearts as other bachelors break eggs at breakfast . '
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 10]: ` What a fool you are , Stagg ! '
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 27]: said Mr Tappertit , stepping on the pavement of the court , and brushing from his legs the dust he had contracted in his passage upward .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 6]: ` His precious limbs ! '
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 9]: cried Stagg , clasping one of his ankles .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 9]: ` Shall a Miggs aspire to these proportions !
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 7]: No , no , my captain .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 14]: We will inveigle ladies fair , and wed them in our secret cavern .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 11]: We will unite ourselves with blooming beauties , captain . '
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 43]: ` I 'll tell you what , my buck , ' said Mr Tappertit , releasing his leg ; ` I 'll trouble you not to take liberties , and not to broach certain questions unless certain questions are broached to you .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 14]: Speak when you 're spoke to on particular subjects , and not otherways .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 26]: Hold the torch up till I 've got to the end of the court , and then kennel yourself , do you hear ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 8]: I hear you , noble captain . '
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 10]: ` Obey then , ' said Mr Tappertit haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 7]: ` Gentlemen , lead on ! '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 28]: With which word of command -LRB- addressed to an imaginary staff or retinue -RRB- he folded his arms , and walked with surpassing dignity down the court .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 32]: His obsequious follower stood holding the torch above his head , and then the observer saw for the first time , from his place of concealment , that he was blind .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 41]: Some involuntary motion on his part caught the quick ear of the blind man , before he was conscious of having moved an inch towards him , for he turned suddenly and cried , ` Who 's there ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 11]: A man , ' said the other , advancing . '
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 5]: A friend . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 4]: A stranger ! '
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 5]: rejoined the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: ` Strangers are not my friends .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 8]: What do you do there ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 15]: I saw your company come out , and waited here till they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 7]: I want a lodging . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 7]: A lodging at this time ! '
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 13]: returned Stagg , pointing towards the dawn as though he saw it .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 11]: ` Do you know the day is breaking ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 14]: I know it , ' rejoined the other , ` to my cost .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 11]: I have been traversing this iron-hearted town all night . '
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 28]: ` You had better traverse it again , ' said the blind man , preparing to descend , 'till you find some lodgings suitable to your taste .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 7]: I do n't let any . '
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 4]: ` Stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 10]: cried the other , holding him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 43]: ` I 'll beat this light about that hangdog face of yours -LRB- for hangdog it is , if it answers to your voice -RRB- , and rouse the neighbourhood besides , if you detain me , ' said the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 5]: ` Let me go .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 5]: Do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 6]: ` Do YOU hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 19]: returned the other , chinking a few shillings together , and hurriedly pressing them into his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 6]: I beg nothing of you .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 10]: I will pay for the shelter you give me .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 2]: Death !
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 10]: Is it much to ask of such as you !
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 19]: I have come from the country , and desire to rest where there are none to question me .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 12]: I am faint , exhausted , worn out , almost dead .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 13]: Let me lie down , like a dog , before your fire .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 7]: I ask no more than that .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 14]: If you would be rid of me , I will depart to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 54]: ` If a gentleman has been unfortunate on the road , ' muttered Stagg , yielding to the other , who , pressing on him , had already gained a footing on the steps -- ` and can pay for his accommodation -- ' ' I will pay you with all I have .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 20]: I am just now past the want of food , God knows , and wish but to purchase shelter .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 7]: What companion have you below ? '
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 4]: ` None . '
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 13]: ` Then fasten your grate there , and show me the way .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 3]: Quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 15]: The blind man complied after a moment 's hesitation , and they descended together .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 32]: The dialogue had passed as hurriedly as the words could be spoken , and they stood in his wretched room before he had had time to recover from his first surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 16]: ` May I see where that door leads to , and what is beyond ? '
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 8]: said the man , glancing keenly round .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 9]: ` You will not mind that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 6]: I will show you myself .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: Follow me , or go before .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 5]: Take your choice . '
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 30]: He bade him lead the way , and , by the light of the torch which his conductor held up for the purpose , inspected all three cellars narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 45]: Assured that the blind man had spoken truth , and that he lived there alone , the visitor returned with him to the first , in which a fire was burning , and flung himself with a deep groan upon the ground before it .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 14]: His host pursued his usual occupation without seeming to heed him any further .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 44]: But directly he fell asleep -- and he noted his falling into a slumber , as readily as the keenest-sighted man could have done -- he knelt down beside him , and passed his hand lightly but carefully over his face and person .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 18]: His sleep was checkered with starts and moans , and sometimes with a muttered word or two .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 15]: His hands were clenched , his brow bent , and his mouth firmly set .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 49]: All this , the blind man accurately marked ; and as if his curiosity were strongly awakened , and he had already some inkling of his mystery , he sat watching him , if the expression may be used , and listening , until it was broad day .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 271]: Chapter 19 Dolly Varden 's pretty little head was yet bewildered by various recollections of the party , and her bright eyes were yet dazzled by a crowd of images , dancing before them like motes in the sunbeams , among which the effigy of one partner in particular did especially figure , the same being a young coachmaker -LRB- a master in his own right -RRB- who had given her to understand , when he handed her into the chair at parting , that it was his fixed resolve to neglect his business from that time , and die slowly for the love of her -- Dolly 's head , and eyes , and thoughts , and seven senses , were all in a state of flutter and confusion for which the party was accountable , although it was now three days old , when , as she was sitting listlessly at breakfast , reading all manner of fortunes -LRB- that is to say , of married and flourishing fortunes -RRB- in the grounds of her teacup , a step was heard in the workshop , and Mr Edward Chester was descried through the glass door , standing among the rusty locks and keys , like love among the roses -- for which apt comparison the historian may by no means take any credit to himself , the same being the invention , in a sentimental mood , of the chaste and modest Miggs , who , beholding him from the doorsteps she was then cleaning , did , in her maiden meditation , give utterance to the simile .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 135]: The locksmith , who happened at the moment to have his eyes thrown upward and his head backward , in an intense communing with Toby , did not see his visitor , until Mrs Varden , more watchful than the rest , had desired Sim Tappertit to open the glass door and give him admission -- from which untoward circumstance the good lady argued -LRB- for she could deduce a precious moral from the most trifling event -RRB- that to take a draught of small ale in the morning was to observe a pernicious , irreligious , and Pagan custom , the relish whereof should be left to swine , and Satan , or at least to Popish persons , and should be shunned by the righteous as a work of sin and evil .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 59]: She would no doubt have pursued her admonition much further , and would have founded on it a long list of precious precepts of inestimable value , but that the young gentleman standing by in a somewhat uncomfortable and discomfited manner while she read her spouse this lecture , occasioned her to bring it to a premature conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 20]: ` I 'm sure you 'll excuse me , sir , ' said Mrs Varden , rising and curtseying .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 21]: ` Varden is so very thoughtless , and needs so much reminding -- Sim , bring a chair here . '
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 16]: Mr Tappertit obeyed , with a flourish implying that he did so , under protest .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 13]: ` And you can go , Sim , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 37]: Mr Tappertit obeyed again , still under protest ; and betaking himself to the workshop , began seriously to fear that he might find it necessary to poison his master , before his time was out .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 44]: In the meantime , Edward returned suitable replies to Mrs Varden 's courtesies , and that lady brightened up very much ; so that when he accepted a dish of tea from the fair hands of Dolly , she was perfectly agreeable . '
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 65]: I am sure if there 's anything we can do , -- Varden , or I , or Dolly either , -- to serve you , sir , at any time , you have only to say it , and it shall be done , ' said Mrs V. ' I am much obliged to you , I am sure , ' returned Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 20]: ` You encourage me to say that I have come here now , to beg your good offices . '
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: Mrs Varden was delighted beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 60]: ` It occurred to me that probably your fair daughter might be going to the Warren , either to-day or to-morrow , ' said Edward , glancing at Dolly ; ` and if so , and you will allow her to take charge of this letter , ma'am , you will oblige me more than I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 43]: The truth is , that while I am very anxious it should reach its destination , I have particular reasons for not trusting it to any other conveyance ; so that without your help , I am wholly at a loss . '
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 60]: ` She was not going that way , sir , either to-day , or to-morrow , nor indeed all next week , ' the lady graciously rejoined , ` but we shall be very glad to put ourselves out of the way on your account , and if you wish it , you may depend upon its going to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 45]: You might suppose , ' said Mrs Varden , frowning at her husband , ` from Varden 's sitting there so glum and silent , that he objected to this arrangement ; but you must not mind that , sir , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 7]: It 's his way at home .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 13]: Out of doors , he can be cheerful and talkative enough . '
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 41]: Now , the fact was , that the unfortunate locksmith , blessing his stars to find his helpmate in such good humour , had been sitting with a beaming face , hearing this discourse with a joy past all expression .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 10]: Wherefore this sudden attack quite took him by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 9]: ` My dear Martha -- ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 22]: ` Oh yes , I dare say , ' interrupted Mrs Varden , with a smile of mingled scorn and pleasantry .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 4]: ` Very dear !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 6]: We all know that . '
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 18]: ` No , but my good soul , ' said Gabriel , ` you are quite mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 4]: You are indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 11]: I was delighted to find you so kind and ready .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 20]: I waited , my dear , anxiously , I assure you , to hear what you would say . '
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 12]: ` You waited anxiously , ' repeated Mrs V. ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 5]: Thank you , Varden .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 21]: You waited , as you always do , that I might bear the blame , if any came of it .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 27]: But I am used to it , ' said the lady with a kind of solemn titter , ` and that 's my comfort ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 12]: I give you my word , Martha -- ' said Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 36]: ` Let me give you MY word , my dear , ' interposed his wife with a Christian smile , ` that such discussions as these between married people , are much better left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 14]: Therefore , if you please , Varden , we 'll drop the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 8]: I have no wish to pursue it .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 3]: I could .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 7]: I might say a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 6]: But I would rather not .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 9]: Pray do n't say any more . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 15]: I do n't want to say any more , ' rejoined the goaded locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 12]: ` Well then , do n't , ' said Mrs Varden .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 23]: ` Nor did I begin it , Martha , ' added the locksmith , good-humouredly , ' I must say that . '
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 10]: ` You did not begin it , Varden ! '
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 27]: exclaimed his wife , opening her eyes very wide and looking round upon the company , as though she would say , You hear this man !
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 9]: ` You did not begin it , Varden !
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 11]: But you shall not say I was out of temper .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 19]: No , you did not begin it , oh dear no , not you , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 10]: ` Well , well , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 7]: ` That 's settled then . '
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 12]: ` Oh yes , ' rejoined his wife , ` quite .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 18]: If you like to say Dolly began it , my dear , I shall not contradict you .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 5]: I know my duty .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 9]: I need know it , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 23]: I am often obliged to bear it in mind , when my inclination perhaps would be for the moment to forget it .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 6]: Thank you , Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 51]: And so , with a mighty show of humility and forgiveness , she folded her hands , and looked round again , with a smile which plainly said , ` If you desire to see the first and foremost among female martyrs , here she is , on view ! '
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 127]: This little incident , illustrative though it was of Mrs Varden 's extraordinary sweetness and amiability , had so strong a tendency to check the conversation and to disconcert all parties but that excellent lady , that only a few monosyllables were uttered until Edward withdrew ; which he presently did , thanking the lady of the house a great many times for her condescension , and whispering in Dolly 's ear that he would call on the morrow , in case there should happen to be an answer to the note -- which , indeed , she knew without his telling , as Barnaby and his friend Grip had dropped in on the previous night to prepare her for the visit which was then terminating .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 70]: Gabriel , who had attended Edward to the door , came back with his hands in his pockets ; and , after fidgeting about the room in a very uneasy manner , and casting a great many sidelong looks at Mrs Varden -LRB- who with the calmest countenance in the world was five fathoms deep in the Protestant Manual -RRB- , inquired of Dolly how she meant to go .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 38]: Dolly supposed by the stage-coach , and looked at her lady mother , who finding herself silently appealed to , dived down at least another fathom into the Manual , and became unconscious of all earthly things .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 9]: ` Martha -- ' said the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 18]: I hear you , Varden , ' said his wife , without rising to the surface . '
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 61]: I am sorry , my dear , you have such an objection to the Maypole and old John , for otherways as it 's a very fine morning , and Saturday 's not a busy day with us , we might have all three gone to Chigwell in the chaise , and had quite a happy day of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 18]: Mrs Varden immediately closed the Manual , and bursting into tears , requested to be led upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 10]: ` What is the matter now , Martha ? '
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 4]: inquired the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 8]: To which Martha rejoined , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 26]: do n't speak to me , ' and protested in agony that if anybody had told her so , she would n't have believed it .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 34]: ` But , Martha , ' said Gabriel , putting himself in the way as she was moving off with the aid of Dolly 's shoulder , ` would n't have believed what ?
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 7]: Tell me what 's wrong now .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 4]: Do tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 8]: Upon my soul I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 6]: Do you know , child ?
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 3]: Damme ! '
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 27]: cried the locksmith , plucking at his wig in a kind of frenzy , ` nobody does know , I verily believe , but Miggs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 36]: ` Miggs , ' said Mrs Varden faintly , and with symptoms of approaching incoherence , ` is attached to me , and that is sufficient to draw down hatred upon her in this house .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 15]: She is a comfort to me , whatever she may be to others . '
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 17]: ` She 's no comfort to me , ' cried Gabriel , made bold by despair .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 9]: ` She 's the misery of my life .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 11]: She 's all the plagues of Egypt in one . '
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 17]: ` She 's considered so , I have no doubt , ' said Mrs Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 19]: I was prepared for that ; it 's natural ; it 's of a piece with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 24]: When you taunt me as you do to my face , how can I wonder that you taunt her behind her back ! '
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 87]: And here the incoherence coming on very strong , Mrs Varden wept , and laughed , and sobbed , and shivered , and hiccoughed , and choked ; and said she knew it was very foolish but she could n't help it ; and that when she was dead and gone , perhaps they would be sorry for it -- which really under the circumstances did not appear quite so probable as she seemed to think -- with a great deal more to the same effect .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 46]: In a word , she passed with great decency through all the ceremonies incidental to such occasions ; and being supported upstairs , was deposited in a highly spasmodic state on her own bed , where Miss Miggs shortly afterwards flung herself upon the body .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 51]: The philosophy of all this was , that Mrs Varden wanted to go to Chigwell ; that she did not want to make any concession or explanation ; that she would only go on being implored and entreated so to do ; and that she would accept no other terms .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 137]: Accordingly , after a vast amount of moaning and crying upstairs , and much damping of foreheads , and vinegaring of temples , and hartshorning of noses , and so forth ; and after most pathetic adjurations from Miggs , assisted by warm brandy-and-water not over-weak , and divers other cordials , also of a stimulating quality , administered at first in teaspoonfuls and afterwards in increasing doses , and of which Miss Miggs herself partook as a preventive measure -LRB- for fainting is infectious -RRB- ; after all these remedies , and many more too numerous to mention , but not to take , had been applied ; and many verbal consolations , moral , religious , and miscellaneous , had been super-added thereto ; the locksmith humbled himself , and the end was gained .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 25]: ` If it 's only for the sake of peace and quietness , father , ' said Dolly , urging him to go upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 13]: ` Oh , Doll , Doll , ' said her good-natured father .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 19]: ` If you ever have a husband of your own -- ' Dolly glanced at the glass . '
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 19]: -- Well , WHEN you have , ' said the locksmith , ` never faint , my darling .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 20]: More domestic unhappiness has come of easy fainting , Doll , than from all the greater passions put together .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 25]: Remember that , my dear , if you would be really happy , which you never can be , if your husband is n't .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 10]: And a word in your ear , my precious .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 8]: Never have a Miggs about you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 67]: With this advice he kissed his blooming daughter on the cheek , and slowly repaired to Mrs Varden 's room ; where that lady , lying all pale and languid on her couch , was refreshing herself with a sight of her last new bonnet , which Miggs , as a means of calming her scattered spirits , displayed to the best advantage at her bedside .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 11]: ` Here 's master , mim , ' said Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 16]: ` Oh , what a happiness it is when man and wife come round again !
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 17]: Oh gracious , to think that him and her should ever have a word together ! '
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 43]: In the energy of these sentiments , which were uttered as an apostrophe to the Heavens in general , Miss Miggs perched the bonnet on the top of her own head , and folding her hands , turned on her tears . '
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 11]: I ca n't help it , ' cried Miggs . '
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 13]: I could n't , if I was to be drownded in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 7]: She has such a forgiving spirit !
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 35]: She 'll forget all that has passed , and go along with you , sir -- Oh , if it was to the world 's end , she 'd go along with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 33]: Mrs Varden with a faint smile gently reproved her attendant for this enthusiasm , and reminded her at the same time that she was far too unwell to venture out that day .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 33]: ` Oh no , you 're not , mim , indeed you 're not , ' said Miggs ; ' I repeal to master ; master knows you 're not , mim .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 28]: The hair , and motion of the shay , will do you good , mim , and you must not give way , you must not raly .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 16]: She must keep up , must n't she , sir , for all out sakes ?
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 10]: I was a telling her that , just now .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 11]: She must remember us , even if she forgets herself .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 11]: Master will persuade you , mim , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 23]: There 's Miss Dolly 's a-going you know , and master , and you , and all so happy and so comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 44]: cried Miggs , turning on the tears again , previous to quitting the room in great emotion , ' I never see such a blessed one as she is for the forgiveness of her spirit , I never , never , never did .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 15]: Not more did master neither ; no , nor no one -- never ! '
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 76]: For five minutes or thereabouts , Mrs Varden remained mildly opposed to all her husband 's prayers that she would oblige him by taking a day 's pleasure , but relenting at length , she suffered herself to be persuaded , and granting him her free forgiveness -LRB- the merit whereof , she meekly said , rested with the Manual and not with her -RRB- , desired that Miggs might come and help her dress .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 54]: The handmaid attended promptly , and it is but justice to their joint exertions to record that , when the good lady came downstairs in course of time , completely decked out for the journey , she really looked as if nothing had happened , and appeared in the very best health imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 81]: As to Dolly , there she was again , the very pink and pattern of good looks , in a smart little cherry-coloured mantle , with a hood of the same drawn over her head , and upon the top of that hood , a little straw hat trimmed with cherry-coloured ribbons , and worn the merest trifle on one side -- just enough in short to make it the wickedest and most provoking head-dress that ever malicious milliner devised .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 190]: And not to speak of the manner in which these cherry-coloured decorations brightened her eyes , or vied with her lips , or shed a new bloom on her face , she wore such a cruel little muff , and such a heart-rending pair of shoes , and was so surrounded and hemmed in , as it were , by aggravations of all kinds , that when Mr Tappettit , holding the horse 's head , saw her come out of the house alone , such impulses came over him to decoy her into the chaise and drive off like mad , that he would unquestionably have done it , but for certain uneasy doubts besetting him as to the shortest way to Gretna Green ; whether it was up the street or down , or up the right-hand turning or the left ; and whether , supposing all the turnpikes to be carried by storm , the blacksmith in the end would marry them on credit ; which by reason of his clerical office appeared , even to his excited imagination , so unlikely , that he hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 33]: And while he stood hesitating , and looking post-chaises-and-six at Dolly , out came his master and his mistress , and the constant Miggs , and the opportunity was gone for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 74]: For now the chaise creaked upon its springs , and Mrs Varden was inside ; and now it creaked again , and more than ever , and the locksmith was inside ; and now it bounded once , as if its heart beat lightly , and Dolly was inside ; and now it was gone and its place was empty , and he and that dreary Miggs were standing in the street together .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 43]: The hearty locksmith was in as good a humour as if nothing had occurred for the last twelve months to put him out of his way , Dolly was all smiles and graces , and Mrs Varden was agreeable beyond all precedent .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 55]: As they jogged through the streets talking of this thing and of that , who should be descried upon the pavement but that very coachmaker , looking so genteel that nobody would have believed he had ever had anything to do with a coach but riding in it , and bowing like any nobleman .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 61]: To be sure Dolly was confused when she bowed again , and to be sure the cherry-coloured ribbons trembled a little when she met his mournful eye , which seemed to say , ' I have kept my word , I have begun , the business is going to the devil , and you 're the cause of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 64]: There he stood , rooted to the ground : as Dolly said , like a statue ; and as Mrs Varden said , like a pump ; till they turned the corner : and when her father thought it was like his impudence , and her mother wondered what he meant by it , Dolly blushed again till her very hood was pale .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 80]: But on they went , not the less merrily for this , and there was the locksmith in the incautious fulness of his heart ` pulling-up ' at all manner of places , and evincing a most intimate acquaintance with all the taverns on the road , and all the landlords and all the landladies , with whom , indeed , the little horse was on equally friendly terms , for he kept on stopping of his own accord .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 101]: Never were people so glad to see other people as these landlords and landladies were to behold Mr Varden and Mrs Varden and Miss Varden ; and would n't they get out , said one ; and they really must walk upstairs , said another ; and she would take it ill and be quite certain they were proud if they would n't have a little taste of something , said a third ; and so on , that it was really quite a Progress rather than a ride , and one continued scene of hospitality from beginning to end .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 66]: It was pleasant enough to be held in such esteem , not to mention the refreshments ; so Mrs Varden said nothing at the time , and was all affability and delight -- but such a body of evidence as she collected against the unfortunate locksmith that day , to be used thereafter as occasion might require , never was got together for matrimonial purposes .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 59]: In course of time -- and in course of a pretty long time too , for these agreeable interruptions delayed them not a little , -- they arrived upon the skirts of the Forest , and riding pleasantly on among the trees , came at last to the Maypole , where the locksmith 's cheerful ` Yoho ! '
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 47]: speedily brought to the porch old John , and after him young Joe , both of whom were so transfixed at sight of the ladies , that for a moment they were perfectly unable to give them any welcome , and could do nothing but stare .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 45]: It was only for a moment , however , that Joe forgot himself , for speedily reviving he thrust his drowsy father aside -- to Mr Willet 's mighty and inexpressible indignation -- and darting out , stood ready to help them to alight .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 10]: It was necessary for Dolly to get out first .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 32]: Joe had her in his arms ; -- yes , though for a space of time no longer than you could count one in , Joe had her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 7]: Here was a glimpse of happiness !
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 37]: It would be difficult to describe what a flat and commonplace affair the helping Mrs Varden out afterwards was , but Joe did it , and did it too with the best grace in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 58]: Then old John , who , entertaining a dull and foggy sort of idea that Mrs Varden was n't fond of him , had been in some doubt whether she might not have come for purposes of assault and battery , took courage , hoped she was well , and offered to conduct her into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 23]: This tender being amicably received , they marched in together ; Joe and Dolly followed , arm-in-arm , -LRB- happiness again ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 7]: and Varden brought up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 23]: Old John would have it that they must sit in the bar , and nobody objecting , into the bar they went .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 29]: All bars are snug places , but the Maypole 's was the very snuggest , cosiest , and completest bar , that ever the wit of man devised .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 151]: Such amazing bottles in old oaken pigeon-holes ; such gleaming tankards dangling from pegs at about the same inclination as thirsty men would hold them to their lips ; such sturdy little Dutch kegs ranged in rows on shelves ; so many lemons hanging in separate nets , and forming the fragrant grove already mentioned in this chronicle , suggestive , with goodly loaves of snowy sugar stowed away hard by , of punch , idealised beyond all mortal knowledge ; such closets , such presses , such drawers full of pipes , such places for putting things away in hollow window-seats , all crammed to the throat with eatables , drinkables , or savoury condiments ; lastly , and to crown all , as typical of the immense resources of the establishment , and its defiances to all visitors to cut and come again , such a stupendous cheese !
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 36]: It is a poor heart that never rejoices -- it must have been the poorest , weakest , and most watery heart that ever beat , which would not have warmed towards the Maypole bar .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 6]: Mrs Varden 's did directly .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 37]: She could no more have reproached John Willet among those household gods , the kegs and bottles , lemons , pipes , and cheese , than she could have stabbed him with his own bright carving-knife .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 14]: The order for dinner too -- it might have soothed a savage . '
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 53]: A bit of fish , ' said John to the cook , ` and some lamb chops -LRB- breaded , with plenty of ketchup -RRB- , and a good salad , and a roast spring chicken , with a dish of sausages and mashed potatoes , or something of that sort . '
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 5]: Something of that sort !
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 6]: The resources of these inns !
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 58]: To talk carelessly about dishes , which in themselves were a first-rate holiday kind of dinner , suitable to one 's wedding-day , as something of that sort : meaning , if you ca n't get a spring chicken , any other trifle in the way of poultry will do -- such as a peacock , perhaps !
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 40]: The kitchen too , with its great broad cavernous chimney ; the kitchen , where nothing in the way of cookery seemed impossible ; where you could believe in anything to eat , they chose to tell you of .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 22]: Mrs Varden returned from the contemplation of these wonders to the bar again , with a head quite dizzy and bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 11]: Her housekeeping capacity was not large enough to comprehend them .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 8]: She was obliged to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: Waking was pain , in the midst of such immensity .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 112]: Dolly in the meanwhile , whose gay heart and head ran upon other matters , passed out at the garden door , and glancing back now and then -LRB- but of course not wondering whether Joe saw her -RRB- , tripped away by a path across the fields with which she was well acquainted , to discharge her mission at the Warren ; and this deponent hath been informed and verily believes , that you might have seen many less pleasant objects than the cherry-coloured mantle and ribbons , as they went fluttering along the green meadows in the bright light of the day , like giddy things as they were .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 89]: Chapter 20 The proud consciousness of her trust , and the great importance she derived from it , might have advertised it to all the house if she had had to run the gauntlet of its inhabitants ; but as Dolly had played in every dull room and passage many and many a time , when a child , and had ever since been the humble friend of Miss Haredale , whose foster-sister she was , she was as free of the building as the young lady herself .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 33]: So , using no greater precaution than holding her breath and walking on tiptoe as she passed the library door , she went straight to Emma 's room as a privileged visitor .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 9]: It was the liveliest room in the building .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 29]: The chamber was sombre like the rest for the matter of that , but the presence of youth and beauty would make a prison cheerful -LRB- saving alas !
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 18]: that confinement withers them -RRB- , and lend some charms of their own to the gloomiest scene .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 41]: Birds , flowers , books , drawing , music , and a hundred such graceful tokens of feminine loves and cares , filled it with more of life and human sympathy than the whole house besides seemed made to hold .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 24]: There was heart in the room ; and who that has a heart , ever fails to recognise the silent presence of another !
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 43]: Dolly had one undoubtedly , and it was not a tough one either , though there was a little mist of coquettishness about it , such as sometimes surrounds that sun of life in its morning , and slightly dims its lustre .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 86]: Thus , when Emma rose to greet her , and kissing her affectionately on the cheek , told her , in her quiet way , that she had been very unhappy , the tears stood in Dolly 's eyes , and she felt more sorry than she could tell ; but next moment she happened to raise them to the glass , and really there was something there so exceedingly agreeable , that as she sighed , she smiled , and felt surprisingly consoled . '
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 34]: I have heard about it , miss , ' said Dolly , ` and it 's very sad indeed , but when things are at the worst they are sure to mend . '
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 12]: ` But are you sure they are at the worst ? '
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 6]: asked Emma with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 28]: ` Why , I do n't see how they can very well be more unpromising than they are ; I really do n't , ' said Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 10]: ` And I bring something to begin with . '
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 6]: ` Not from Edward ? '
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 43]: Dolly nodded and smiled , and feeling in her pockets -LRB- there were pockets in those days -RRB- with an affectation of not being able to find what she wanted , which greatly enhanced her importance , at length produced the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 36]: As Emma hastily broke the seal and became absorbed in its contents , Dolly 's eyes , by one of those strange accidents for which there is no accounting , wandered to the glass again .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 19]: She could not help wondering whether the coach-maker suffered very much , and quite pitied the poor man .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 54]: It was a long letter -- a very long letter , written close on all four sides of the sheet of paper , and crossed afterwards ; but it was not a consolatory letter , for as Emma read it she stopped from time to time to put her handkerchief to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 41]: To be sure Dolly marvelled greatly to see her in so much distress , for to her thinking a love affair ought to be one of the best jokes , and the slyest , merriest kind of thing in life .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 61]: But she set it down in her own mind that all this came from Miss Haredale 's being so constant , and that if she would only take on with some other young gentleman -- just in the most innocent way possible , to keep her first lover up to the mark -- she would find herself inexpressibly comforted . '
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 18]: I am sure that 's what I should do if it was me , ' thought Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 29]: ` To make one 's sweetheart miserable is well enough and quite right , but to be made miserable one 's self is a little too much ! '
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 18]: However it would n't do to say so , and therefore she sat looking on in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 39]: She needed a pretty considerable stretch of patience , for when the long letter had been read once all through it was read again , and when it had been read twice all through it was read again .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 43]: During this tedious process , Dolly beguiled the time in the most improving manner that occurred to her , by curling her hair on her fingers , with the aid of the looking-glass before mentioned , and giving it some killing twists .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 5]: Everything has an end .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 13]: Even young ladies in love can not read their letters for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 19]: In course of time the packet was folded up , and it only remained to write the answer .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 31]: But as this promised to be a work of time likewise , Emma said she would put it off until after dinner , and that Dolly must dine with her .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 34]: As Dolly had made up her mind to do so beforehand , she required very little pressing ; and when they had settled this point , they went to walk in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 34]: They strolled up and down the terrace walks , talking incessantly -- at least , Dolly never left off once -- and making that quarter of the sad and mournful house quite gay .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 102]: Not that they talked loudly or laughed much , but they were both so very handsome , and it was such a breezy day , and their light dresses and dark curls appeared so free and joyous in their abandonment , and Emma was so fair , and Dolly so rosy , and Emma so delicately shaped , and Dolly so plump , and -- in short , there are no flowers for any garden like such flowers , let horticulturists say what they may , and both house and garden seemed to know it , and to brighten up sensibly .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 52]: After this , came the dinner and the letter writing , and some more talking , in the course of which Miss Haredale took occasion to charge upon Dolly certain flirtish and inconstant propensities , which accusations Dolly seemed to think very complimentary indeed , and to be mightily amused with .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 41]: Finding her quite incorrigible in this respect , Emma suffered her to depart ; but not before she had confided to her that important and never-sufficiently-to-be-taken-care-of answer , and endowed her moreover with a pretty little bracelet as a keepsake .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 57]: Having clasped it on her arm , and again advised her half in jest and half in earnest to amend her roguish ways , for she knew she was fond of Joe at heart -LRB- which Dolly stoutly denied , with a great many haughty protestations that she hoped she could do better than that indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 45]: and so forth -RRB- , she bade her farewell ; and after calling her back to give her more supplementary messages for Edward , than anybody with tenfold the gravity of Dolly Varden could be reasonably expected to remember , at length dismissed her .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 36]: Dolly bade her good bye , and tripping lightly down the stairs arrived at the dreaded library door , and was about to pass it again on tiptoe , when it opened , and behold !
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 5]: there stood Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 65]: Now , Dolly had from her childhood associated with this gentleman the idea of something grim and ghostly , and being at the moment conscience-stricken besides , the sight of him threw her into such a flurry that she could neither acknowledge his presence nor run away , so she gave a great start , and then with downcast eyes stood still and trembled .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 18]: ` Come here , girl , ' said Mr Haredale , taking her by the hand . '
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 8]: I want to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 52]: ` If you please , sir , I 'm in a hurry , ' faltered Dolly , ` and -- you have frightened me by coming so suddenly upon me , sir -- I would rather go , sir , if you 'll be so good as to let me . '
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 23]: ` Immediately , ' said Mr Haredale , who had by this time led her into the room and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 5]: You shall go directly .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 7]: You have just left Emma ? '
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , just this minute .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 22]: -- Father 's waiting for me , sir , if you 'll please to have the goodness -- ' I know .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 8]: I know , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 6]: ` Answer me a question .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 8]: What did you bring here to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 7]: ` Bring here , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 3]: faltered Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 12]: ` You will tell me the truth , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 24]: Dolly hesitated for a little while , and somewhat emboldened by his manner , said at last , ` Well then , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 6]: It was a letter . '
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 9]: ` From Mr Edward Chester , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 10]: And you are the bearer of the answer ? '
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 21]: Dolly hesitated again , and not being able to decide upon any other course of action , burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 12]: ` You alarm yourself without cause , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 7]: ` Why are you so foolish ?
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 6]: Surely you can answer me .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 18]: You know that I have but to put the question to Emma and learn the truth directly .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 8]: Have you the answer with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 25]: Dolly had what is popularly called a spirit of her own , and being now fairly at bay , made the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 16]: ` Yes , sir , ' she rejoined , trembling and frightened as she was .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 8]: ` Yes , sir , I have .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 18]: You may kill me if you please , sir , but I wo n't give it up .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 11]: I 'm very sorry , -- but I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 6]: There , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 13]: I commend your firmness and your plain-speaking , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 17]: ` Rest assured that I have as little desire to take your letter as your life .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 12]: You are a very discreet messenger and a good girl . '
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 56]: Not feeling quite certain , as she afterwards said , whether he might not be ` coming over her ' with these compliments , Dolly kept as far from him as she could , cried again , and resolved to defend her pocket -LRB- for the letter was there -RRB- to the last extremity . '
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 56]: I have some design , ' said Mr Haredale after a short silence , during which a smile , as he regarded her , had struggled through the gloom and melancholy that was natural to his face , ` of providing a companion for my niece ; for her life is a very lonely one .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 6]: Would you like the office ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 17]: You are the oldest friend she has , and the best entitled to it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 25]: I do n't know , sir , ' answered Dolly , not sure but he was bantering her ; ' I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 11]: I do n't know what they might wish at home .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: I could n't give an opinion , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 14]: ` If your friends had no objection , would you have any ? '
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 3]: ` Come .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 12]: There 's a plain question ; and easy to answer . '
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 15]: ` None at all that I know of sir , ' replied Dolly . '
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 18]: I should be very glad to be near Miss Emma of course , and always am . '
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 10]: ` That 's well , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 9]: ` That is all I had to say .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 6]: You are anxious to go .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 8]: Do n't let me detain you . '
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 43]: Dolly did n't let him , nor did she wait for him to try , for the words had no sooner passed his lips than she was out of the room , out of the house , and in the fields again .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 51]: The first thing to be done , of course , when she came to herself and considered what a flurry she had been in , was to cry afresh ; and the next thing , when she reflected how well she had got over it , was to laugh heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 34]: The tears once banished gave place to the smiles , and at last Dolly laughed so much that she was fain to lean against a tree , and give vent to her exultation .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 44]: When she could laugh no longer , and was quite tired , she put her head-dress to rights , dried her eyes , looked back very merrily and triumphantly at the Warren chimneys , which were just visible , and resumed her walk .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 41]: The twilight had come on , and it was quickly growing dusk , but the path was so familiar to her from frequent traversing that she hardly thought of this , and certainly felt no uneasiness at being left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 63]: Moreover , there was the bracelet to admire ; and when she had given it a good rub , and held it out at arm 's length , it sparkled and glittered so beautifully on her wrist , that to look at it in every point of view and with every possible turn of the arm , was quite an absorbing business .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 73]: There was the letter too , and it looked so mysterious and knowing , when she took it out of her pocket , and it held , as she knew , so much inside , that to turn it over and over , and think about it , and wonder how it began , and how it ended , and what it said all through , was another matter of constant occupation .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 30]: Between the bracelet and the letter , there was quite enough to do without thinking of anything else ; and admiring each by turns , Dolly went on gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 41]: As she passed through a wicket-gate to where the path was narrow , and lay between two hedges garnished here and there with trees , she heard a rustling close at hand , which brought her to a sudden stop .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 3]: She listened .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 42]: All was very quiet , and she went on again -- not absolutely frightened , but a little quicker than before perhaps , and possibly not quite so much at her ease , for a check of that kind is startling .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 31]: She had no sooner moved on again , than she was conscious of the same sound , which was like that of a person tramping stealthily among bushes and brushwood .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 21]: Looking towards the spot whence it appeared to come , she almost fancied she could make out a crouching figure .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 4]: She stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 6]: All was quiet as before .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 18]: On she went once more -- decidedly faster now -- and tried to sing softly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 6]: It must he the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 19]: But how came the wind to blow only when she walked , and cease when she stood still ?
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 16]: She stopped involuntarily as she made the reflection , and the rustling noise stopped likewise .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 33]: She was really frightened now , and was yet hesitating what to do , when the bushes crackled and snapped , and a man came plunging through them , close before her .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 56]: Chapter 21 It was for the moment an inexpressible relief to Dolly , to recognise in the person who forced himself into the path so abruptly , and now stood directly in her way , Hugh of the Maypole , whose name she uttered in a tone of delighted surprise that came from her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 6]: ` Was it you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 12]: she said , ` how glad I am to see you !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 9]: and how could you terrify me so ! '
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 20]: In answer to which , he said nothing at all , but stood quite still , looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 9]: ` Did you come to meet me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 3]: asked Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 24]: Hugh nodded , and muttered something to the effect that he had been waiting for her , and had expected her sooner . '
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 17]: I thought it likely they would send , ' said Dolly , greatly reassured by this .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 12]: ` Nobody sent me , ' was his sullen answer . '
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 8]: I came of my own accord . '
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 40]: The rough bearing of this fellow , and his wild , uncouth appearance , had often filled the girl with a vague apprehension even when other people were by , and had occasioned her to shrink from him involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 33]: The having him for an unbidden companion in so solitary a place , with the darkness fast gathering about them , renewed and even increased the alarm she had felt at first .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 45]: If his manner had been merely dogged and passively fierce , as usual , she would have had no greater dislike to his company than she always felt -- perhaps , indeed , would have been rather glad to have had him at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 18]: But there was something of coarse bold admiration in his look , which terrified her very much .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 39]: She glanced timidly towards him , uncertain whether to go forward or retreat , and he stood gazing at her like a handsome satyr ; and so they remained for some short time without stirring or breaking silence .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 14]: At length Dolly took courage , shot past him , and hurried on .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 13]: ` Why do you spend so much breath in avoiding me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 17]: said Hugh , accommodating his pace to hers , and keeping close at her side . '
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 22]: I wish to get back as quickly as I can , and you walk too near me , answered Dolly . '
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 5]: ` Too near ! '
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 17]: said Hugh , stooping over her so that she could feel his breath upon her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 5]: ` Why too near ?
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 11]: You 're always proud to ME , mistress . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 7]: I am proud to no one .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 8]: You mistake me , ' answered Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 13]: ` Fall back , if you please , or go on . '
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 25]: ` Nay , mistress , ' he rejoined , endeavouring to draw her arm through his , ` I 'll walk with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 16]: She released herself and clenching her little hand , struck him with right good will .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 36]: At this , Maypole Hugh burst into a roar of laughter , and passing his arm about her waist , held her in his strong grasp as easily as if she had been a bird .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 5]: Well done , mistress !
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 3]: Strike again .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 31]: You shall beat my face , and tear my hair , and pluck my beard up by the roots , and welcome , for the sake of your bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 5]: Strike again , mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 2]: Do .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 5]: I like it . '
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 19]: ` Let me go , ' she cried , endeavouring with both her hands to push him off .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 8]: ` Let me go this moment . '
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 16]: ` You had as good be kinder to me , Sweetlips , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 6]: ` You had , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 2]: Come .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 4]: Tell me now .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 7]: Why are you always so proud ?
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 9]: I do n't quarrel with you for it .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 8]: I love you when you 're proud .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 17]: You ca n't hide your beauty from a poor fellow ; that 's a comfort ! '
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 26]: She gave him no answer , but as he had not yet checked her progress , continued to press forward as rapidly as she could .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 32]: At length , between the hurry she had made , her terror , and the tightness of his embrace , her strength failed her , and she could go no further .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 41]: ` Hugh , ' cried the panting girl , ` good Hugh ; if you will leave me I will give you anything -- everything I have -- and never tell one word of this to any living creature . '
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 10]: ` You had best not , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 11]: ` Harkye , little dove , you had best not .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 17]: All about here know me , and what I dare do if I have a mind .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 45]: If ever you are going to tell , stop when the words are on your lips , and think of the mischief you 'll bring , if you do , upon some innocent heads that you would n't wish to hurt a hair of .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 18]: Bring trouble on me , and I 'll bring trouble and something more on them in return .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 20]: I care no more for them than for so many dogs ; not so much -- why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 12]: I 'd sooner kill a man than a dog any day .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 24]: I 've never been sorry for a man 's death in all my life , and I have for a dog 's . '
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 51]: There was something so thoroughly savage in the manner of these expressions , and the looks and gestures by which they were accompanied , that her great fear of him gave her new strength , and enabled her by a sudden effort to extricate herself and run fleetly from him .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 47]: But Hugh was as nimble , strong , and swift of foot , as any man in broad England , and it was but a fruitless expenditure of energy , for he had her in his encircling arms again before she had gone a hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 26]: ` Softly , darling -- gently -- would you fly from rough Hugh , that loves you as well as any drawing-room gallant ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 14]: I would , ' she answered , struggling to free herself again . '
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 3]: I will .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 4]: Help ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 10]: A fine for crying out , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 10]: A fine , pretty one , from your lips .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 4]: I pay myself !
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 3]: ` Help !
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 2]: help !
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 3]: help ! '
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 24]: As she shrieked with the utmost violence she could exert , a shout was heard in answer , and another , and another .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 5]: ` Thank Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 7]: cried the girl in an ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 9]: ` Joe , dear Joe , this way .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 3]: Help ! '
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 29]: Her assailant paused , and stood irresolute for a moment , but the shouts drawing nearer and coming quick upon them , forced him to a speedy decision .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 20]: He released her , whispered with a menacing look , ` Tell HIM : and see what follows ! '
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 11]: and leaping the hedge , was gone in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 14]: Dolly darted off , and fairly ran into Joe Willet 's open arms .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 6]: ` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 4]: are you hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 4]: what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 4]: who was it ?
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 4]: where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 6]: what was he like ? '
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 19]: with a great many encouraging expressions and assurances of safety , were the first words Joe poured forth .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 37]: But poor little Dolly was so breathless and terrified that for some time she was quite unable to answer him , and hung upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying as if her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 39]: Joe had not the smallest objection to have her hanging on his shoulder ; no , not the least , though it crushed the cherry-coloured ribbons sadly , and put the smart little hat out of all shape .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 17]: But he could n't bear to see her cry ; it went to his very heart .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 25]: He tried to console her , bent over her , whispered to her -- some say kissed her , but that 's a fable .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 47]: At any rate he said all the kind and tender things he could think of and Dolly let him go on and did n't interrupt him once , and it was a good ten minutes before she was able to raise her head and thank him .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 9]: ` What was it that frightened you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 51]: A man whose person was unknown to her had followed her , she answered ; he began by begging , and went on to threats of robbery , which he was on the point of carrying into execution , and would have executed , but for Joe 's timely aid .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 32]: The hesitation and confusion with which she said this , Joe attributed to the fright she had sustained , and no suspicion of the truth occurred to him for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 11]: ` Stop when the words are on your lips . '
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 29]: A hundred times that night , and very often afterwards , when the disclosure was rising to her tongue , Dolly thought of that , and repressed it .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 74]: A deeply rooted dread of the man ; the conviction that his ferocious nature , once roused , would stop at nothing ; and the strong assurance that if she impeached him , the full measure of his wrath and vengeance would be wreaked on Joe , who had preserved her ; these were considerations she had not the courage to overcome , and inducements to secrecy too powerful for her to surmount .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 74]: Joe , for his part , was a great deal too happy to inquire very curiously into the matter ; and Dolly being yet too tremulous to walk without assistance , they went forward very slowly , and in his mind very pleasantly , until the Maypole lights were near at hand , twinkling their cheerful welcome , when Dolly stopped suddenly and with a half scream exclaimed , ` The letter ! '
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 5]: ` What letter ? '
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 3]: cried Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 13]: ` That I was carrying -- I had it in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 13]: My bracelet too , ' she said , clasping her wrist . '
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 7]: I have lost them both . '
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 8]: ` Do you mean just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 27]: ` Either I dropped them then , or they were taken from me , ' answered Dolly , vainly searching her pocket and rustling her dress .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 8]: ` They are gone , both gone .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 8]: What an unhappy girl I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 37]: With these words poor Dolly , who to do her justice was quite as sorry for the loss of the letter as for her bracelet , fell a-crying again , and bemoaned her fate most movingly .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 80]: Joe tried to comfort her with the assurance that directly he had housed her in the Maypole , he would return to the spot with a lantern -LRB- for it was now quite dark -RRB- and make strict search for the missing articles , which there was great probability of his finding , as it was not likely that anybody had passed that way since , and she was not conscious that they had been forcibly taken from her .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 77]: Dolly thanked him very heartily for this offer , though with no great hope of his quest being successful ; and so with many lamentations on her side , and many hopeful words on his , and much weakness on the part of Dolly and much tender supporting on the part of Joe , they reached the Maypole bar at last , where the locksmith and his wife and old John were yet keeping high festival .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 31]: Mr Willet received the intelligence of Dolly 's trouble with that surprising presence of mind and readiness of speech for which he was so eminently distinguished above all other men .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 48]: Mrs Varden expressed her sympathy for her daughter 's distress by scolding her roundly for being so late ; and the honest locksmith divided himself between condoling with and kissing Dolly , and shaking hands heartily with Joe , whom he could not sufficiently praise or thank .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 72]: In reference to this latter point , old John was far from agreeing with his friend ; for besides that he by no means approved of an adventurous spirit in the abstract , it occurred to him that if his son and heir had been seriously damaged in a scuffle , the consequences would assuredly have been expensive and inconvenient , and might perhaps have proved detrimental to the Maypole business .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 90]: Wherefore , and because he looked with no favourable eye upon young girls , but rather considered that they and the whole female sex were a kind of nonsensical mistake on the part of Nature , he took occasion to retire and shake his head in private at the boiler ; inspired by which silent oracle , he was moved to give Joe various stealthy nudges with his elbow , as a parental reproof and gentle admonition to mind his own business and not make a fool of himself .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 28]: Joe , however , took down the lantern and lighted it ; and arming himself with a stout stick , asked whether Hugh was in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 17]: ` He 's lying asleep before the kitchen fire , sir , ' said Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 10]: ` What do you want him for ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 19]: I want him to come with me to look after this bracelet and letter , ' answered Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 4]: ` Halloa there !
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 3]: Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 15]: Dolly turned pale as death , and felt as if she must faint forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 31]: After a few moments , Hugh came staggering in , stretching himself and yawning according to custom , and presenting every appearance of having been roused from a sound nap .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 14]: ` Here , sleepy-head , ' said Joe , giving him the lantern .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 16]: ` Carry this , and bring the dog , and that small cudgel of yours .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 12]: And woe betide the fellow if we come upon him . '
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 5]: ` What fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 10]: growled Hugh , rubbing his eyes and shaking himself .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 5]: ` What fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 28]: returned Joe , who was in a state of great valour and bustle ; ' a fellow you ought to know of and be more alive about .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 54]: It 's well for the like of you , lazy giant that you are , to be snoring your time away in chimney-corners , when honest men 's daughters ca n't cross even our quiet meadows at nightfall without being set upon by footpads , and frightened out of their precious lives . '
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 14]: ` They never rob me , ' cried Hugh with a laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 7]: I have got nothing to lose .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 14]: But I 'd as lief knock them at head as any other men .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 6]: How many are there ? '
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 15]: ` Only one , ' said Dolly faintly , for everybody looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 10]: ` And what was he like , mistress ? '
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 25]: said Hugh with a glance at young Willet , so slight and momentary that the scowl it conveyed was lost on all but her .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 6]: ` About my height ? '
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 17]: ` Not -- not so tall , ' Dolly replied , scarce knowing what she said .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 22]: ` His dress , ' said Hugh , looking at her keenly , ` like -- like any of ours now ?
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 26]: I know all the people hereabouts , and maybe could give a guess at the man , if I had anything to guide me . '
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 36]: Dolly faltered and turned paler yet ; then answered that he was wrapped in a loose coat and had his face hidden by a handkerchief and that she could give no other description of him .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 15]: ` You would n't know him if you saw him then , belike ? '
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 8]: said Hugh with a malicious grin . '
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 14]: I should not , ' answered Dolly , bursting into tears again . '
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 8]: I do n't wish to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 9]: I ca n't bear to think of him .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 9]: I ca n't talk about him any more .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 16]: Do n't go to look for these things , Mr Joe , pray do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 11]: I entreat you not to go with that man . '
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 8]: ` Not to go with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 9]: ` I 'm too rough for them all .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 7]: They 're all afraid of me .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 13]: Why , bless you mistress , I 've the tenderest heart alive .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 19]: I love all the ladies , ma'am , ' said Hugh , turning to the locksmith 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 39]: Mrs Varden opined that if he did , he ought to be ashamed of himself ; such sentiments being more consistent -LRB- so she argued -RRB- with a benighted Mussulman or wild Islander than with a stanch Protestant .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 21]: Arguing from this imperfect state of his morals , Mrs Varden further opined that he had never studied the Manual .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 62]: Hugh admitting that he never had , and moreover that he could n't read , Mrs Varden declared with much severity , that he ought to he even more ashamed of himself than before , and strongly recommended him to save up his pocket-money for the purchase of one , and further to teach himself the contents with all convenient diligence .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 34]: She was still pursuing this train of discourse , when Hugh , somewhat unceremoniously and irreverently , followed his young master out , and left her to edify the rest of the company .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 60]: This she proceeded to do , and finding that Mr Willet 's eyes were fixed upon her with an appearance of deep attention , gradually addressed the whole of her discourse to him , whom she entertained with a moral and theological lecture of considerable length , in the conviction that great workings were taking place in his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 182]: The simple truth was , however , that Mr Willet , although his eyes were wide open and he saw a woman before him whose head by long and steady looking at seemed to grow bigger and bigger until it filled the whole bar , was to all other intents and purposes fast asleep ; and so sat leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets until his son 's return caused him to wake up with a deep sigh , and a faint impression that he had been dreaming about pickled pork and greens -- a vision of his slumbers which was no doubt referable to the circumstance of Mrs Varden 's having frequently pronounced the word ` Grace ' with much emphasis ; which word , entering the portals of Mr Willet 's brain as they stood ajar , and coupling itself with the words ` before meat , ' which were there ranging about , did in time suggest a particular kind of meat together with that description of vegetable which is usually its companion .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 6]: The search was wholly unsuccessful .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 31]: Joe had groped along the path a dozen times , and among the grass , and in the dry ditch , and in the hedge , but all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 46]: Dolly , who was quite inconsolable for her loss , wrote a note to Miss Haredale giving her the same account of it that she had given at the Maypole , which Joe undertook to deliver as soon as the family were stirring next day .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 87]: That done , they sat down to tea in the bar , where there was an uncommon display of buttered toast , and -- in order that they might not grow faint for want of sustenance , and might have a decent halting-place or halfway house between dinner and supper -- a few savoury trifles in the shape of great rashers of broiled ham , which being well cured , done to a turn , and smoking hot , sent forth a tempting and delicious fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 32]: Mrs Varden was seldom very Protestant at meals , unless it happened that they were underdone , or overdone , or indeed that anything occurred to put her out of humour .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 31]: Her spirits rose considerably on beholding these goodly preparations , and from the nothingness of good works , she passed to the somethingness of ham and toast with great cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 87]: Nay , under the influence of these wholesome stimulants , she sharply reproved her daughter for being low and despondent -LRB- which she considered an unacceptable frame of mind -RRB- , and remarked , as she held her own plate for a fresh supply , that it would be well for Dolly , who pined over the loss of a toy and a sheet of paper , if she would reflect upon the voluntary sacrifices of the missionaries in foreign parts who lived chiefly on salads .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 27]: The proceedings of such a day occasion various fluctuations in the human thermometer , and especially in instruments so sensitively and delicately constructed as Mrs Varden .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 18]: Thus , at dinner Mrs V. stood at summer heat ; genial , smiling , and delightful .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 23]: After dinner , in the sunshine of the wine , she went up at least half-a-dozen degrees , and was perfectly enchanting .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 27]: As its effect subsided , she fell rapidly , went to sleep for an hour or so at temperate , and woke at something below freezing .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 57]: Now she was at summer heat again , in the shade ; and when tea was over , and old John , producing a bottle of cordial from one of the oaken cases , insisted on her sipping two glasses thereof in slow succession , she stood steadily at ninety for one hour and a quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 45]: Profiting by experience , the locksmith took advantage of this genial weather to smoke his pipe in the porch , and in consequence of this prudent management , he was fully prepared , when the glass went down again , to start homewards directly .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 16]: The horse was accordingly put in , and the chaise brought round to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 48]: Joe , who would on no account be dissuaded from escorting them until they had passed the most dreary and solitary part of the road , led out the grey mare at the same time ; and having helped Dolly into her seat -LRB- more happiness ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 6]: sprung gaily into the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 53]: Then , after many good nights , and admonitions to wrap up , and glancing of lights , and handing in of cloaks and shawls , the chaise rolled away , and Joe trotted beside it -- on Dolly 's side , no doubt , and pretty close to the wheel too .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 35]: Chapter 22 It was a fine bright night , and for all her lowness of spirits Dolly kept looking up at the stars in a manner so bewitching -LRB- and SHE knew it ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 46]: that Joe was clean out of his senses , and plainly showed that if ever a man were -- not to say over head and ears , but over the Monument and the top of Saint Paul 's in love , that man was himself .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 38]: The road was a very good one ; not at all a jolting road , or an uneven one ; and yet Dolly held the side of the chaise with one little hand , all the way .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 32]: If there had been an executioner behind him with an uplifted axe ready to chop off his head if he touched that hand , Joe could n't have helped doing it .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 63]: From putting his own hand upon it as if by chance , and taking it away again after a minute or so , he got to riding along without taking it off at all ; as if he , the escort , were bound to do that as an important part of his duty , and had come out for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 20]: The most curious circumstance about this little incident was , that Dolly did n't seem to know of it .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 20]: She looked so innocent and unconscious when she turned her eyes on Joe , that it was quite provoking .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 56]: She talked though ; talked about her fright , and about Joe 's coming up to rescue her , and about her gratitude , and about her fear that she might not have thanked him enough , and about their always being friends from that time forth -- and about all that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 77]: And when Joe said , not friends he hoped , Dolly was quite surprised , and said not enemies she hoped ; and when Joe said , could n't they be something much better than either , Dolly all of a sudden found out a star which was brighter than all the other stars , and begged to call his attention to the same , and was ten thousand times more innocent and unconscious than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 96]: In this manner they travelled along , talking very little above a whisper , and wishing the road could be stretched out to some dozen times its natural length -- at least that was Joe 's desire -- when , as they were getting clear of the forest and emerging on the more frequented road , they heard behind them the sound of a horse 's feet at a round trot , which growing rapidly louder as it drew nearer , elicited a scream from Mrs Varden , and the cry ' a friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 17]: from the rider , who now came panting up , and checked his horse beside them .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 6]: ` This man again ! '
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 5]: cried Dolly , shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 4]: ` Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 9]: ` What errand are you upon ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 20]: I come to ride back with you , ' he answered , glancing covertly at the locksmith 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 5]: ` HE sent me .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 5]: ` My father ! '
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 30]: said poor Joe ; adding under his breath , with a very unfilial apostrophe , ` Will he never think me man enough to take care of myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 10]: returned Hugh to the first part of the inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 21]: ` The roads are not safe just now , he says , and you 'd better have a companion . '
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 9]: ` Ride on then , ' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 10]: ` I 'm not going to turn yet . '
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 9]: Hugh complied , and they went on again .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 27]: It was his whim or humour to ride immediately before the chaise , and from this position he constantly turned his head , and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 32]: Dolly felt that he looked at her , but she averted her eyes and feared to raise them once , so great was the dread with which he had inspired her .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 72]: This interruption , and the consequent wakefulness of Mrs Varden , who had been nodding in her sleep up to this point , except for a minute or two at a time , when she roused herself to scold the locksmith for audaciously taking hold of her to prevent her nodding herself out of the chaise , put a restraint upon the whispered conversation , and made it difficult of resumption .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 38]: Indeed , before they had gone another mile , Gabriel stopped at his wife 's desire , and that good lady protested she would not hear of Joe 's going a step further on any account whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 40]: It was in vain for Joe to protest on the other hand that he was by no means tired , and would turn back presently , and would see them safely past such a point , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 17]: Mrs Varden was obdurate , and being so was not to be overcome by mortal agency .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 16]: ` Good night -- if I must say it , ' said Joe , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 8]: ` Good night , ' said Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 36]: She would have added , ` Take care of that man , and pray do n't trust him , ' but he had turned his horse 's head , and was standing close to them .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 58]: She had therefore nothing for it but to suffer Joe to give her hand a gentle squeeze , and when the chaise had gone on for some distance , to look back and wave it , as he still lingered on the spot where they had parted , with the tall dark figure of Hugh beside him .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 31]: What she thought about , going home ; and whether the coach-maker held as favourable a place in her meditations as he had occupied in the morning , is unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 26]: They reached home at last -- at last , for it was a long way , made none the shorter by Mrs Varden 's grumbling .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 12]: Miggs hearing the sound of wheels was at the door immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 7]: ` Here they are , Simmun !
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 5]: Here they are ! '
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 17]: cried Miggs , clapping her hands , and issuing forth to help her mistress to alight .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 7]: ` Bring a chair , Simmun .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 12]: Now , a n't you the better for it , mim ?
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 19]: Do n't you feel more yourself than you would have done if you 'd have stopped at home ?
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 4]: Oh , gracious !
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 5]: how cold you are !
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 15]: Goodness me , sir , she 's a perfect heap of ice . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 10]: I ca n't help it , my good girl .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 15]: You had better take her in to the fire , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 29]: ` Master sounds unfeeling , mim , ' said Miggs , in a tone of commiseration , ` but such is not his intentions , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 30]: After what he has seen of you this day , I never will believe but that he has a deal more affection in his heart than to speak unkind .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 19]: Come in and sit yourself down by the fire ; there 's a good dear -- do . '
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 4]: Mrs Varden complied .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 23]: The locksmith followed with his hands in his pockets , and Mr Tappertit trundled off with the chaise to a neighbouring stable .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 41]: ` Martha , my dear , ' said the locksmith , when they reached the parlour , ` if you 'll look to Dolly yourself or let somebody else do it , perhaps it will be only kind and reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 17]: She has been frightened , you know , and is not at all well to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 42]: In fact , Dolly had thrown herself upon the sofa , quite regardless of all the little finery of which she had been so proud in the morning , and with her face buried in her hands was crying very much .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 124]: At first sight of this phenomenon -LRB- for Dolly was by no means accustomed to displays of this sort , rather learning from her mother 's example to avoid them as much as possible -RRB- Mrs Varden expressed her belief that never was any woman so beset as she ; that her life was a continued scene of trial ; that whenever she was disposed to be well and cheerful , so sure were the people around her to throw , by some means or other , a damp upon her spirits ; and that , as she had enjoyed herself that day , and Heaven knew it was very seldom she did enjoy herself so she was now to pay the penalty .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 8]: To all such propositions Miggs assented freely .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 43]: Poor Dolly , however , grew none the better for these restoratives , but rather worse , indeed ; and seeing that she was really ill , both Mrs Varden and Miggs were moved to compassion , and tended her in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 40]: But even then , their very kindness shaped itself into their usual course of policy , and though Dolly was in a swoon , it was rendered clear to the meanest capacity , that Mrs Varden was the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 95]: Thus when Dolly began to get a little better , and passed into that stage in which matrons hold that remonstrance and argument may be successfully applied , her mother represented to her , with tears in her eyes , that if she had been flurried and worried that day , she must remember it was the common lot of humanity , and in especial of womankind , who through the whole of their existence must expect no less , and were bound to make up their minds to meek endurance and patient resignation .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 60]: Mrs Varden entreated her to remember that one of these days she would , in all probability , have to do violence to her feelings so far as to be married ; and that marriage , as she might see every day of her life -LRB- and truly she did -RRB- was a state requiring great fortitude and forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 104]: She represented to her in lively colours , that if she -LRB- Mrs V. -RRB- had not , in steering her course through this vale of tears , been supported by a strong principle of duty which alone upheld and prevented her from drooping , she must have been in her grave many years ago ; in which case she desired to know what would have become of that errant spirit -LRB- meaning the locksmith -RRB- , of whose eye she was the very apple , and in whose path she was , as it were , a shining light and guiding star ?
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 12]: Miss Miggs also put in her word to the same effect .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 151]: She said that indeed and indeed Miss Dolly might take pattern by her blessed mother , who , she always had said , and always would say , though she were to be hanged , drawn , and quartered for it next minute , was the mildest , amiablest , forgivingest-spirited , longest-sufferingest female as ever she could have believed ; the mere narration of whose excellencies had worked such a wholesome change in the mind of her own sister-in-law , that , whereas , before , she and her husband lived like cat and dog , and were in the habit of exchanging brass candlesticks , pot-lids , flat-irons , and other such strong resentments , they were now the happiest and affectionatest couple upon earth ; as could be proved any day on application at Golden Lion Court , number twenty-sivin , second bell-handle on the right-hand doorpost .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 101]: After glancing at herself as a comparatively worthless vessel , but still as one of some desert , she besought her to bear in mind that her aforesaid dear and only mother was of a weakly constitution and excitable temperament , who had constantly to sustain afflictions in domestic life , compared with which thieves and robbers were as nothing , and yet never sunk down or gave way to despair or wrath , but , in prize-fighting phraseology , always came up to time with a cheerful countenance , and went in to win as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 64]: When Miggs finished her solo , her mistress struck in again , and the two together performed a duet to the same purpose ; the burden being , that Mrs Varden was persecuted perfection , and Mr Varden , as the representative of mankind in that apartment , a creature of vicious and brutal habits , utterly insensible to the blessings he enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 98]: Of so refined a character , indeed , was their talent of assault under the mask of sympathy , that when Dolly , recovering , embraced her father tenderly , as in vindication of his goodness , Mrs Varden expressed her solemn hope that this would be a lesson to him for the remainder of his life , and that he would do some little justice to a woman 's nature ever afterwards -- in which aspiration Miss Miggs , by divers sniffs and coughs , more significant than the longest oration , expressed her entire concurrence .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 41]: But the great joy of Miggs 's heart was , that she not only picked up a full account of what had happened , but had the exquisite delight of conveying it to Mr Tappertit for his jealousy and torture .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 35]: For that gentleman , on account of Dolly 's indisposition , had been requested to take his supper in the workshop , and it was conveyed thither by Miss Miggs 's own fair hands .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 5]: ` Oh Simmun ! '
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 11]: said the young lady , ` such goings on to-day !
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 8]: Oh , gracious me , Simmun ! '
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 65]: Mr Tappertit , who was not in the best of humours , and who disliked Miss Miggs more when she laid her hand on her heart and panted for breath than at any other time , as her deficiency of outline was most apparent under such circumstances , eyed her over in his loftiest style , and deigned to express no curiosity whatever . '
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 14]: I never heard the like , nor nobody else , ' pursued Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 8]: ` The idea of interfering with HER .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 26]: What people can see in her to make it worth their while to do so , that 's the joke -- he he he ! '
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 33]: Finding there was a lady in the case , Mr Tappertit haughtily requested his fair friend to be more explicit , and demanded to know what she meant by ` her . '
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 19]: ` Why , that Dolly , ' said Miggs , with an extremely sharp emphasis on the name .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 29]: ` But , oh upon my word and honour , young Joseph Willet is a brave one ; and he do deserve her , that he do . '
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 4]: ` Woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 18]: said Mr Tappertit , jumping off the counter on which he was seated ; ` beware ! '
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 7]: ` My stars , Simmun ! '
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 7]: cried Miggs , in affected astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 7]: ` You frighten me to death !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 30]: ` There are strings , ' said Mr Tappertit , flourishing his bread-and-cheese knife in the air , ` in the human heart that had better not be wibrated .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 8]: That 's what 's the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 20]: ` Oh , very well -- if you 're in a huff , ' cried Miggs , turning away .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 17]: ` Huff or no huff , ' said Mr Tappertit , detaining her by the wrist .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 8]: ` What do you mean , Jezebel ?
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 7]: What were you going to say ?
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 4]: Answer me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 97]: Notwithstanding this uncivil exhortation , Miggs gladly did as she was required ; and told him how that their young mistress , being alone in the meadows after dark , had been attacked by three or four tall men , who would have certainly borne her away and perhaps murdered her , but for the timely arrival of Joseph Willet , who with his own single hand put them all to flight , and rescued her ; to the lasting admiration of his fellow-creatures generally , and to the eternal love and gratitude of Dolly Varden .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 37]: ` Very good , ' said Mr Tappertit , fetching a long breath when the tale was told , and rubbing his hair up till it stood stiff and straight on end all over his head .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 7]: ` His days are numbered . '
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 7]: ` Oh , Simmun ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 16]: I tell you , ' said the ` prentice , ` his days are numbered .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 3]: Leave me .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 6]: Get along with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 21]: Miggs departed at his bidding , but less because of his bidding than because she desired to chuckle in secret .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 44]: When she had given vent to her satisfaction , she returned to the parlour ; where the locksmith , stimulated by quietness and Toby , had become talkative , and was disposed to take a cheerful review of the occurrences of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 44]: But Mrs Varden , whose practical religion -LRB- as is not uncommon -RRB- was usually of the retrospective order , cut him short by declaiming on the sinfulness of such junketings , and holding that it was high time to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 35]: To bed therefore she withdrew , with an aspect as grim and gloomy as that of the Maypole 's own state couch ; and to bed the rest of the establishment soon afterwards repaired .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 68]: Chapter 23 Twilight had given place to night some hours , and it was high noon in those quarters of the town in which ` the world ' condescended to dwell -- the world being then , as now , of very limited dimensions and easily lodged -- when Mr Chester reclined upon a sofa in his dressing-room in the Temple , entertaining himself with a book .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 24]: He was dressing , as it seemed , by easy stages , and having performed half the journey was taking a long rest .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 27]: Completely attired as to his legs and feet in the trimmest fashion of the day , he had yet the remainder of his toilet to perform .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 68]: The coat was stretched , like a refined scarecrow , on its separate horse ; the waistcoat was displayed to the best advantage ; the various ornamental articles of dress were severally set out in most alluring order ; and yet he lay dangling his legs between the sofa and the ground , as intent upon his book as if there were nothing but bed before him .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 63]: ` Upon my honour , ' he said , at length raising his eyes to the ceiling with the air of a man who was reflecting seriously on what he had read ; ` upon my honour , the most masterly composition , the most delicate thoughts , the finest code of morality , and the most gentlemanly sentiments in the universe !
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 34]: Ah Ned , Ned , if you would but form your mind by such precepts , we should have but one common feeling on every subject that could possibly arise between us ! '
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 29]: This apostrophe was addressed , like the rest of his remarks , to empty air : for Edward was not present , and the father was quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 60]: ` My Lord Chesterfield , ' he said , pressing his hand tenderly upon the book as he laid it down , ` if I could but have profited by your genius soon enough to have formed my son on the model you have left to all wise fathers , both he and I would have been rich men .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 40]: Shakespeare was undoubtedly very fine in his way ; Milton good , though prosy ; Lord Bacon deep , and decidedly knowing ; but the writer who should be his country 's pride , is my Lord Chesterfield . '
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 13]: He became thoughtful again , and the toothpick was in requisition . '
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 61]: I thought I was tolerably accomplished as a man of the world , ' he continued , ' I flattered myself that I was pretty well versed in all those little arts and graces which distinguish men of the world from boors and peasants , and separate their character from those intensely vulgar sentiments which are called the national character .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 15]: Apart from any natural prepossession in my own favour , I believed I was .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 37]: Still , in every page of this enlightened writer , I find some captivating hypocrisy which has never occurred to me before , or some superlative piece of selfishness to which I was utterly a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 22]: I should quite blush for myself before this stupendous creature , if remembering his precepts , one might blush at anything .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 4]: An amazing man !
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 4]: a nobleman indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 25]: any King or Queen may make a Lord , but only the Devil himself -- and the Graces -- can make a Chesterfield . '
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 39]: Men who are thoroughly false and hollow , seldom try to hide those vices from themselves ; and yet in the very act of avowing them , they lay claim to the virtues they feign most to despise .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 16]: ` For , ' say they , ` this is honesty , this is truth .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 17]: All mankind are like us , but they have not the candour to avow it . '
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 57]: The more they affect to deny the existence of any sincerity in the world , the more they would be thought to possess it in its boldest shape ; and this is an unconscious compliment to Truth on the part of these philosophers , which will turn the laugh against them to the Day of Judgment .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 69]: Mr Chester , having extolled his favourite author , as above recited , took up the book again in the excess of his admiration and was composing himself for a further perusal of its sublime morality , when he was disturbed by a noise at the outer door ; occasioned as it seemed by the endeavours of his servant to obstruct the entrance of some unwelcome visitor . '
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 43]: A late hour for an importunate creditor , ' he said , raising his eyebrows with as indolent an expression of wonder as if the noise were in the street , and one with which he had not the smallest possible concern .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 7]: ` Much after their accustomed time .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: The usual pretence I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 10]: No doubt a heavy payment to make up tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 24]: Poor fellow , he loses time , and time is money as the good proverb says -- I never found it out though .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 3]: What now ?
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 10]: You know I am not at home . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 38]: A man , sir , ' replied the servant , who was to the full as cool and negligent in his way as his master , ` has brought home the riding-whip you lost the other day .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 29]: I told him you were out , but he said he was to wait while I brought it in , and would n't go till I did . '
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 25]: ` He was quite right , ' returned his master , ` and you 're a blockhead , possessing no judgment or discretion whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 20]: Tell him to come in , and see that he rubs his shoes for exactly five minutes first . '
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 12]: The man laid the whip on a chair , and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 41]: The master , who had only heard his foot upon the ground and had not taken the trouble to turn round and look at him , shut his book , and pursued the train of ideas his entrance had disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 35]: ` If time were money , ' he said , handling his snuff-box , ' I would compound with my creditors , and give them -- let me see -- how much a day ?
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 25]: There 's my nap after dinner -- an hour -- they 're extremely welcome to that , and to make the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 26]: In the morning , between my breakfast and the paper , I could spare them another hour ; in the evening before dinner say another .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 5]: Three hours a day .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 14]: They might pay themselves in calls , with interest , in twelve months .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 9]: I think I shall propose it to them .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 10]: Ah , my centaur , are you there ? '
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 35]: ` Here I am , ' replied Hugh , striding in , followed by a dog , as rough and sullen as himself ; ` and trouble enough I 've had to get here .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 19]: What do you ask me to come for , and keep me out when I DO come ? '
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 55]: ` My good fellow , ' returned the other , raising his head a little from the cushion and carelessly surveying him from top to toe , ' I am delighted to see you , and to have , in your being here , the very best proof that you are not kept out .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 5]: How are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 11]: ` I 'm well enough , ' said Hugh impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 9]: ` You look a perfect marvel of health .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 4]: Sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 10]: ` I 'd rather stand , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 29]: ` Please yourself my good fellow , ' returned Mr Chester rising , slowly pulling off the loose robe he wore , and sitting down before the dressing-glass .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 8]: ` Please yourself by all means . '
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 46]: Having said this in the politest and blandest tone possible , he went on dressing , and took no further notice of his guest , who stood in the same spot as uncertain what to do next , eyeing him sulkily from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 12]: ` Are you going to speak to me , master ? '
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 8]: he said , after a long silence .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 21]: ` My worthy creature , ' returned Mr Chester , ` you are a little ruffled and out of humour .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 10]: I 'll wait till you 're quite yourself again .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 7]: I am in no hurry . '
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 7]: This behaviour had its intended effect .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 16]: It humbled and abashed the man , and made him still more irresolute and uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 40]: Hard words he could have returned , violence he would have repaid with interest ; but this cool , complacent , contemptuous , self-possessed reception , caused him to feel his inferiority more completely than the most elaborate arguments .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 6]: Everything contributed to this effect .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 111]: His own rough speech , contrasted with the soft persuasive accents of the other ; his rude bearing , and Mr Chester 's polished manner ; the disorder and negligence of his ragged dress , and the elegant attire he saw before him ; with all the unaccustomed luxuries and comforts of the room , and the silence that gave him leisure to observe these things , and feel how ill at ease they made him ; all these influences , which have too often some effect on tutored minds and become of almost resistless power when brought to bear on such a mind as his , quelled Hugh completely .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 68]: He moved by little and little nearer to Mr Chester 's chair , and glancing over his shoulder at the reflection of his face in the glass , as if seeking for some encouragement in its expression , said at length , with a rough attempt at conciliation , ` ARE you going to speak to me , master , or am I to go away ? '
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 16]: ` Speak you , ' said Mr Chester , ` speak you , good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 8]: I have spoken , have I not ?
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 7]: I am waiting for you . '
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 55]: ` Why , look ` ee , sir , ' returned Hugh with increased embarrassment , ` am I the man that you privately left your whip with before you rode away from the Maypole , and told to bring it back whenever he might want to see you on a certain subject ? '
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 38]: ` No doubt the same , or you have a twin brother , ' said Mr Chester , glancing at the reflection of his anxious face ; ` which is not probable , I should say . '
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 27]: ` Then I have come , sir , ' said Hugh , ` and I have brought it back , and something else along with it .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 21]: A letter , sir , it is , that I took from the person who had charge of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 15]: As he spoke , he laid upon the dressing-table , Dolly 's lost epistle .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 11]: The very letter that had cost her so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 13]: ` Did you obtain this by force , my good fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 17]: said Mr Chester , casting his eye upon it without the least perceptible surprise or pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 8]: ` Not quite , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 4]: ` Partly . '
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 13]: ` Who was the messenger from whom you took it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 3]: A woman .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 6]: One Varden 's daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 5]: ` Oh indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 5]: said Mr Chester gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 10]: ` What else did you take from her ? '
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 5]: ` What else ? '
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 36]: ` Yes , ' said the other , in a drawling manner , for he was fixing a very small patch of sticking plaster on a very small pimple near the corner of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 5]: ` What else ? '
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 13]: ` Well a kiss , ' replied Hugh , after some hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 6]: ` And what else ? '
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 5]: ` Nothing . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 34]: I think , ' said Mr Chester , in the same easy tone , and smiling twice or thrice to try if the patch adhered -- ' I think there was something else .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 30]: I have heard a trifle of jewellery spoken of -- a mere trifle -- a thing of such little value , indeed , that you may have forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 18]: Do you remember anything of the kind -- such as a bracelet now , for instance ? '
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 49]: Hugh with a muttered oath thrust his hand into his breast , and drawing the bracelet forth , wrapped in a scrap of hay , was about to lay it on the table likewise , when his patron stopped his hand and bade him put it up again .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 20]: ` You took that for yourself my excellent friend , ' he said , ` and may keep it .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 9]: I am neither a thief nor a receiver .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 7]: Do n't show it to me .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 12]: You had better hide it again , and lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 20]: Do n't let me see where you put it either , ' he added , turning away his head .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 8]: ` You 're not a receiver ! '
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 14]: said Hugh bluntly , despite the increasing awe in which he held him .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 10]: ` What do you call THAT , master ? '
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 9]: striking the letter with his heavy hand . '
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 14]: I call that quite another thing , ' said Mr Chester coolly . '
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 11]: I shall prove it presently , as you will see .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 8]: You are thirsty , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 13]: Hugh drew his sleeve across his lips , and gruffly answered yes .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 20]: ` Step to that closet and bring me a bottle you will see there , and a glass . '
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 3]: He obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 28]: His patron followed him with his eyes , and when his back was turned , smiled as he had never done when he stood beside the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 13]: On his return he filled the glass , and bade him drink .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 13]: That dram despatched , he poured him out another , and another .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 8]: ` How many can you bear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 8]: he said , filling the glass again .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 10]: ` As many as you like to give me .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 3]: Pour on .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 3]: Fill high .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 9]: A bumper with a bead in the middle !
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 31]: Give me enough of this , ' he added , as he tossed it down his hairy throat , ` and I 'll do murder if you ask me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 52]: ` As I do n't mean to ask you , and you might possibly do it without being invited if you went on much further , ' said Mr Chester with great composure , we will stop , if agreeable to you , my good friend , at the next glass .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 10]: You were drinking before you came here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 32]: I always am when I can get it , ' cried Hugh boisterously , waving the empty glass above his head , and throwing himself into a rude dancing attitude . '
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 4]: I always am .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 9]: What 's so good to me as this ?
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 5]: What ever has been ?
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 19]: What else has kept away the cold on bitter nights , and driven hunger off in starving times ?
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 26]: What else has given me the strength and courage of a man , when men would have left me to die , a puny child ?
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 13]: I should never have had a man 's heart but for this .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 8]: I should have died in a ditch .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 29]: Where 's he who when I was a weak and sickly wretch , with trembling legs and fading sight , bade me cheer up , as this did ?
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 15]: I never knew him ; not I. I drink to the drink , master .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 40]: ` You are an exceedingly cheerful young man , ' said Mr Chester , putting on his cravat with great deliberation , and slightly moving his head from side to side to settle his chin in its proper place .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: ` Quite a boon companion . '
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 19]: ` Do you see this hand , master , ' said Hugh , ` and this arm ? '
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: baring the brawny limb to the elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 28]: ` It was once mere skin and bone , and would have been dust in some poor churchyard by this time , but for the drink . '
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 22]: ` You may cover it , ' said Mr Chester , ` it 's sufficiently real in your sleeve . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 28]: I should never have been spirited up to take a kiss from the proud little beauty , master , but for the drink , ' cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 6]: It was a good one .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 9]: As sweet as honeysuckle , I warrant you .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 7]: I thank the drink for it .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 10]: I 'll drink to the drink again , master .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 5]: Fill me one more .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 2]: Come .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 4]: One more ! '
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 51]: ` You are such a promising fellow , ' said his patron , putting on his waistcoat with great nicety , and taking no heed of this request , ` that I must caution you against having too many impulses from the drink , and getting hung before your time .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 7]: What 's your age ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 30]: ` At any rate , ' said Mr Chester , ` you are young enough to escape what I may call a natural death for some years to come .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 21]: How can you trust yourself in my hands on so short an acquaintance , with a halter round your neck ?
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 9]: What a confiding nature yours must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 22]: Hugh fell back a pace or two and surveyed him with a look of mingled terror , indignation , and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 53]: Regarding himself in the glass with the same complacency as before , and speaking as smoothly as if he were discussing some pleasant chit-chat of the town , his patron went on : ` Robbery on the king 's highway , my young friend , is a very dangerous and ticklish occupation .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 28]: It is pleasant , I have no doubt , while it lasts ; but like many other pleasures in this transitory world , it seldom lasts long .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 32]: And really if in the ingenuousness of youth , you open your heart so readily on the subject , I am afraid your career will be an extremely short one . '
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 6]: ` How 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 8]: ` What do you talk of master ?
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 8]: Who was it set me on ? '
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 4]: ` Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 19]: said Mr Chester , wheeling sharply round , and looking full at him for the first time . '
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 6]: I did n't hear you .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 5]: Who was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 11]: Hugh faltered , and muttered something which was not audible .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: ` Who was it ?
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 15]: I am curious to know , ' said Mr Chester , with surpassing affability .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 6]: ` Some rustic beauty perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 8]: But be cautious , my good friend .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 8]: They are not always to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 13]: Do take my advice now , and be careful of yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 17]: With these words he turned to the glass again , and went on with his toilet .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 24]: Hugh would have answered him that he , the questioner himself had set him on , but the words stuck in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 24]: The consummate art with which his patron had led him to this point , and managed the whole conversation , perfectly baffled him .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 70]: He did not doubt that if he had made the retort which was on his lips when Mr Chester turned round and questioned him so keenly , he would straightway have given him into custody and had him dragged before a justice with the stolen property upon him ; in which case it was as certain he would have been hung as it was that he had been born .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 26]: The ascendency which it was the purpose of the man of the world to establish over this savage instrument , was gained from that time .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 6]: Hugh 's submission was complete .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 37]: He dreaded him beyond description ; and felt that accident and artifice had spun a web about him , which at a touch from such a master-hand as his , would bind him to the gallows .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 62]: With these thoughts passing through his mind , and yet wondering at the very same time how he who came there rioting in the confidence of this man -LRB- as he thought -RRB- , should be so soon and so thoroughly subdued , Hugh stood cowering before him , regarding him uneasily from time to time , while he finished dressing .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 29]: When he had done so , he took up the letter , broke the seal , and throwing himself back in his chair , read it leisurely through .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: ` Very neatly worded upon my life !
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 27]: Quite a woman 's letter , full of what people call tenderness , and disinterestedness , and heart , and all that sort of thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 26]: As he spoke , he twisted it up , and glancing lazily round at Hugh as though he would say ` You see this ? '
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 9]: held it in the flame of the candle .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 21]: When it was in a full blaze , he tossed it into the grate , and there it smouldered away .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 27]: ` It was directed to my son , ' he said , turning to Hugh , ` and you did quite right to bring it here .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 18]: I opened it on my own responsibility , and you see what I have done with it .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 8]: Take this , for your trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 15]: Hugh stepped forward to receive the piece of money he held out to him .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 53]: As he put it in his hand , he added : ` If you should happen to find anything else of this sort , or to pick up any kind of information you may think I would like to have , bring it here , will you , my good fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 25]: This was said with a smile which implied -- or Hugh thought it did -- ` fail to do so at your peril ! '
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 6]: He answered that he would .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 38]: ` And do n't , ' said his patron , with an air of the very kindest patronage , ` do n't be at all downcast or uneasy respecting that little rashness we have been speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 26]: Your neck is as safe in my hands , my good fellow , as though a baby 's fingers clasped it , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 5]: -- Take another glass .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 6]: You are quieter now . '
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 21]: Hugh accepted it from his hand , and looking stealthily at his smiling face , drank the contents in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 9]: ` Do n't you -- ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 12]: -- do n't you drink to the drink any more ? '
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 10]: said Mr Chester , in his most winning manner .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 20]: ` To you , sir , ' was the sullen answer , with something approaching to a bow . '
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 6]: I drink to you . '
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 4]: God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 13]: By the bye , what is your name , my good soul ?
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 17]: You are called Hugh , I know , of course -- your other name ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 8]: I have no other name . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 5]: A very strange fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 19]: Do you mean that you never knew one , or that you do n't choose to tell it ?
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 3]: Which ? '
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 16]: ` I 'd tell it if I could , ' said Hugh , quickly . '
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 10]: I have been always called Hugh ; nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 45]: I never knew , nor saw , nor thought about a father ; and I was a boy of six -- that 's not very old -- when they hung my mother up at Tyburn for a couple of thousand men to stare at .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 7]: They might have let her live .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 6]: She was poor enough . '
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 6]: ` How very sad ! '
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 10]: exclaimed his patron , with a condescending smile . '
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 12]: I have no doubt she was an exceedingly fine woman . '
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 9]: ` You see that dog of mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 5]: said Hugh , abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 8]: ` Faithful , I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 16]: rejoined his patron , looking at him through his glass ; ` and immensely clever ?
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 17]: Virtuous and gifted animals , whether man or beast , always are so very hideous . '
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 30]: ` Such a dog as that , and one of the same breed , was the only living thing except me that howled that day , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 28]: ` Out of the two thousand odd -- there was a larger crowd for its being a woman -- the dog and I alone had any pity .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 49]: If he 'd have been a man , he 'd have been glad to be quit of her , for she had been forced to keep him lean and half-starved ; but being a dog , and not having a man 's sense , he was sorry . '
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 23]: ` It was dull of the brute , certainly , ' said Mr Chester , ` and very like a brute . '
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 32]: Hugh made no rejoinder , but whistling to his dog , who sprung up at the sound and came jumping and sporting about him , bade his sympathising friend good night .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 7]: ` Good night ; he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 12]: ` Remember ; you 're safe with me -- quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 32]: So long as you deserve it , my good fellow , as I hope you always will , you have a friend in me , on whose silence you may rely .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 20]: Now do be careful of yourself , pray do , and consider what jeopardy you might have stood in .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 3]: Good night !
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 4]: bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 58]: Hugh truckled before the hidden meaning of these words as much as such a being could , and crept out of the door so submissively and subserviently -- with an air , in short , so different from that with which he had entered -- that his patron on being left alone , smiled more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 27]: ` And yet , ' he said , as he took a pinch of snuff , ' I do not like their having hanged his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 15]: The fellow has a fine eye , and I am sure she was handsome .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 15]: But very probably she was coarse -- red-nosed perhaps , and had clumsy feet .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 13]: Aye , it was all for the best , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 37]: With this comforting reflection , he put on his coat , took a farewell glance at the glass , and summoned his man , who promptly attended , followed by a chair and its two bearers .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 4]: ` Foh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 4]: said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 17]: ` The very atmosphere that centaur has breathed , seems tainted with the cart and ladder .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 4]: Here , Peak .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 31]: Bring some scent and sprinkle the floor ; and take away the chair he sat upon , and air it ; and dash a little of that mixture upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 5]: I am stifled ! '
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 50]: The man obeyed ; and the room and its master being both purified , nothing remained for Mr Chester but to demand his hat , to fold it jauntily under his arm , to take his seat in the chair and be carried off ; humming a fashionable tune .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 228]: Chapter 24 How the accomplished gentleman spent the evening in the midst of a dazzling and brilliant circle ; how he enchanted all those with whom he mingled by the grace of his deportment , the politeness of his manner , the vivacity of his conversation , and the sweetness of his voice ; how it was observed in every corner , that Chester was a man of that happy disposition that nothing ruffled him , that he was one on whom the world 's cares and errors sat lightly as his dress , and in whose smiling face a calm and tranquil mind was constantly reflected ; how honest men , who by instinct knew him better , bowed down before him nevertheless , deferred to his every word , and courted his favourable notice ; how people , who really had good in them , went with the stream , and fawned and flattered , and approved , and despised themselves while they did so , and yet had not the courage to resist ; how , in short , he was one of those who are received and cherished in society -LRB- as the phrase is -RRB- by scores who individually would shrink from and be repelled by the object of their lavish regard ; are things of course , which will suggest themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 14]: Matter so commonplace needs but a passing glance , and there an end .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 22]: The despisers of mankind -- apart from the mere fools and mimics , of that creed -- are of two sorts .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 30]: They who believe their merit neglected and unappreciated , make up one class ; they who receive adulation and flattery , knowing their own worthlessness , compose the other .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 13]: Be sure that the coldest-hearted misanthropes are ever of this last order .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 73]: Mr Chester sat up in bed next morning , sipping his coffee , and remembering with a kind of contemptuous satisfaction how he had shone last night , and how he had been caressed and courted , when his servant brought in a very small scrap of dirty paper , tightly sealed in two places , on the inside whereof was inscribed in pretty large text these words : ' A friend .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 5]: Desiring of a conference .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 2]: Immediate .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 2]: Private .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 9]: Burn it when you 've read it . '
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 16]: ` Where in the name of the Gunpowder Plot did you pick up this ? '
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 4]: said his master .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 17]: It was given him by a person then waiting at the door , the man replied .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 8]: ` With a cloak and dagger ? '
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 4]: said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 19]: With nothing more threatening about him , it appeared , than a leather apron and a dirty face .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 7]: ` Let him come in . '
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 53]: In he came -- Mr Tappertit ; with his hair still on end , and a great lock in his hand , which he put down on the floor in the middle of the chamber as if he were about to go through some performances in which it was a necessary agent .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 27]: ` Sir , ' said Mr Tappertit with a low bow , ' I thank you for this condescension , and am glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 38]: Pardon the menial office in which I am engaged , sir , and extend your sympathies to one , who , humble as his appearance is , has inn ` ard workings far above his station . '
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 43]: Mr Chester held the bed-curtain farther back , and looked at him with a vague impression that he was some maniac , who had not only broken open the door of his place of confinement , but had brought away the lock .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 14]: Mr Tappertit bowed again , and displayed his legs to the best advantage .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 40]: ` You have heard , sir , ' said Mr Tappertit , laying his hand upon his breast , ` of G. Varden Locksmith and bell-hanger and repairs neatly executed in town and country , Clerkenwell , London ? '
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 5]: ` What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 4]: asked Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 10]: ` I 'm his ` prentice , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 5]: ` What THEN ? '
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 4]: ` Ahem ! '
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 37]: ` Would you permit me to shut the door , sir , and will you further , sir , give me your honour bright , that what passes between us is in the strictest confidence ? '
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 55]: Mr Chester laid himself calmly down in bed again , and turning a perfectly undisturbed face towards the strange apparition , which had by this time closed the door , begged him to speak out , and to be as rational as he could , without putting himself to any very great personal inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 59]: ` In the first place , sir , ' said Mr Tappertit , producing a small pocket-handkerchief and shaking it out of the folds , ` as I have not a card about me -LRB- for the envy of masters debases us below that level -RRB- allow me to offer the best substitute that circumstances will admit of .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 42]: If you will take that in your own hand , sir , and cast your eye on the right-hand corner , ' said Mr Tappertit , offering it with a graceful air , ` you will meet with my credentials . '
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 24]: ` Thank you , ' answered Mr Chester , politely accepting it , and turning to some blood-red characters at one end . '
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 3]: `` Four .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 3]: Simon Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 3]: One . ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 23]: Is that the -- ' ` Without the numbers , sir , that is my name , ' replied the ` prentice .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 20]: ` They are merely intended as directions to the washerwoman , and have no connection with myself or family .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 24]: YOUR name , sir , ' said Mr Tappertit , looking very hard at his nightcap , ` is Chester , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 12]: You need n't pull it off , sir , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 7]: I observe E. C. from here .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 9]: We will take the rest for granted . '
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 42]: ` Pray , Mr Tappertit , ' said Mr Chester , ` has that complicated piece of ironmongery which you have done me the favour to bring with you , any immediate connection with the business we are to discuss ? '
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 13]: ` It has not , sir , ' rejoined the ` prentice .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 17]: ` It 's going to be fitted on a ware'us - door in Thames Street . '
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 47]: ` Perhaps , as that is the case , ' said Mr Chester , ` and as it has a stronger flavour of oil than I usually refresh my bedroom with , you will oblige me so far as to put it outside the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 19]: ` By all means , sir , ' said Mr Tappertit , suiting the action to the word .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 12]: ` You 'll excuse my mentioning it , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 10]: ` Do n't apologise , sir , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 11]: And now , if you please , to business . '
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 26]: During the whole of this dialogue , Mr Chester had suffered nothing but his smile of unvarying serenity and politeness to appear upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 59]: Sim Tappertit , who had far too good an opinion of himself to suspect that anybody could be playing upon him , thought within himself that this was something like the respect to which he was entitled , and drew a comparison from this courteous demeanour of a stranger , by no means favourable to the worthy locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 33]: ` From what passes in our house , ' said Mr Tappertit , ' I am aware , sir , that your son keeps company with a young lady against your inclinations .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 11]: Sir , your son has not used me well . '
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 17]: ` Mr Tappertit , ' said the other , ` you grieve me beyond description . '
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 12]: ` Thank you , sir , ' replied the ` prentice .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 10]: ` I 'm glad to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 16]: He 's very proud , sir , is your son ; very haughty . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 12]: I am afraid he IS haughty , ' said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 18]: ` Do you know I was really afraid of that before ; and you confirm me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 68]: ` To recount the menial offices I 've had to do for your son , sir , ' said Mr Tappertit ; ` the chairs I 've had to hand him , the coaches I 've had to call for him , the numerous degrading duties , wholly unconnected with my indenters , that I 've had to do for him , would fill a family Bible .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 34]: Besides which , sir , he is but a young man himself and I do not consider `` thank ` ee Sim , '' a proper form of address on those occasions . '
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 11]: ` Mr Tappertit , your wisdom is beyond your years .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 6]: Pray go on . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 25]: I thank you for your good opinion , sir , ' said Sim , much gratified , ` and will endeavour so to do .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 27]: Now sir , on this account -LRB- and perhaps for another reason or two which I need n't go into -RRB- I am on your side .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 86]: And what I tell you is this -- that as long as our people go backwards and forwards , to and fro , up and down , to that there jolly old Maypole , lettering , and messaging , and fetching and carrying , you could n't help your son keeping company with that young lady by deputy , -- not if he was minded night and day by all the Horse Guards , and every man of 'em in the very fullest uniform . '
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 15]: Mr Tappertit stopped to take breath after this , and then started fresh again .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 13]: ` Now , sir , I am a coming to the point .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 15]: You will inquire of me , `` how is this to he prevented ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 6]: I 'll tell you how .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 42]: If an honest , civil , smiling gentleman like you -- ' ` Mr Tappertit -- really -- ' ` No , no , I 'm serious , ' rejoined the ` prentice , ' I am , upon my soul .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 42]: If an honest , civil , smiling gentleman like you , was to talk but ten minutes to our old woman -- that 's Mrs Varden -- and flatter her up a bit , you 'd gain her over for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 53]: Then there 's this point got -- that her daughter Dolly , ' -- here a flush came over Mr Tappertit 's face -- ` would n't be allowed to be a go-between from that time forward ; and till that point 's got , there 's nothing ever will prevent her .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 4]: Mind that . '
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 28]: ` Mr Tappertit , your knowledge of human nature -- ' ` Wait a minute , ' said Sim , folding his arms with a dreadful calmness .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 8]: ` Now I come to THE point .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 69]: Sir , there is a villain at that Maypole , a monster in human shape , a vagabond of the deepest dye , that unless you get rid of and have kidnapped and carried off at the very least -- nothing less will do -- will marry your son to that young woman , as certainly and as surely as if he was the Archbishop of Canterbury himself .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 34]: He will , sir , for the hatred and malice that he bears to you ; let alone the pleasure of doing a bad action , which to him is its own reward .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 90]: If you knew how this chap , this Joseph Willet -- that 's his name -- comes backwards and forwards to our house , libelling , and denouncing , and threatening you , and how I shudder when I hear him , you 'd hate him worse than I do , -- worse than I do , sir , ' said Mr Tappertit wildly , putting his hair up straighter , and making a crunching noise with his teeth ; ` if sich a thing is possible . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 11]: A little private vengeance in this , Mr Tappertit ? '
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 22]: ` Private vengeance , sir , or public sentiment , or both combined -- destroy him , ' said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 6]: ` Miggs says so too .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 7]: Miggs and me both say so .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 12]: We ca n't bear the plotting and undermining that takes place .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 6]: Our souls recoil from it .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 21]: Barnaby Rudge and Mrs Rudge are in it likewise ; but the villain , Joseph Willet , is the ringleader .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 11]: Their plottings and schemes are known to me and Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 11]: If you want information of 'em , apply to us .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 7]: Put Joseph Willet down , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 3]: Destroy him .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 3]: Crush him .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 5]: And be happy . '
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 72]: With these words , Mr Tappertit , who seemed to expect no reply , and to hold it as a necessary consequence of his eloquence that his hearer should be utterly stunned , dumbfoundered , and overwhelmed , folded his arms so that the palm of each hand rested on the opposite shoulder , and disappeared after the manner of those mysterious warners of whom he had read in cheap story-books .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 23]: ` That fellow , ' said Mr Chester , relaxing his face when he was fairly gone , ` is good practice .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 12]: I HAVE some command of my features , beyond all doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 24]: He fully confirms what I suspected , though ; and blunt tools are sometimes found of use , where sharper instruments would fail .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 15]: I fear I may be obliged to make great havoc among these worthy people .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 4]: A troublesome necessity !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 7]: I quite feel for them . '
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 25]: With that he fell into a quiet slumber : -- subsided into such a gentle , pleasant sleep , that it was quite infantine .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 85]: Chapter 25 Leaving the favoured , and well-received , and flattered of the world ; him of the world most worldly , who never compromised himself by an ungentlemanly action , and never was guilty of a manly one ; to lie smilingly asleep -- for even sleep , working but little change in his dissembling face , became with him a piece of cold , conventional hypocrisy -- we follow in the steps of two slow travellers on foot , making towards Chigwell .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 5]: Barnaby and his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 8]: Grip in their company , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 84]: The widow , to whom each painful mile seemed longer than the last , toiled wearily along ; while Barnaby , yielding to every inconstant impulse , fluttered here and there , now leaving her far behind , now lingering far behind himself , now darting into some by-lane or path and leaving her to pursue her way alone , until he stealthily emerged again and came upon her with a wild shout of merriment , as his wayward and capricious nature prompted .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 68]: Now he would call to her from the topmost branch of some high tree by the roadside ; now using his tall staff as a leaping-pole , come flying over ditch or hedge or five-barred gate ; now run with surprising swiftness for a mile or more on the straight road , and halting , sport upon a patch of grass with Grip till she came up .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 59]: These were his delights ; and when his patient mother heard his merry voice , or looked into his flushed and healthy face , she would not have abated them by one sad word or murmur , though each had been to her a source of suffering in the same degree as it was to him of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 32]: It is something to look upon enjoyment , so that it be free and wild and in the face of nature , though it is but the enjoyment of an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 54]: It is something to know that Heaven has left the capacity of gladness in such a creature 's breast ; it is something to be assured that , however lightly men may crush that faculty in their fellows , the Great Creator of mankind imparts it even to his despised and slighted work .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 23]: Who would not rather see a poor idiot happy in the sunlight , than a wise man pining in a darkened jail !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 37]: Ye men of gloom and austerity , who paint the face of Infinite Benevolence with an eternal frown ; read in the Everlasting Book , wide open to your view , the lesson it would teach .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 38]: Its pictures are not in black and sombre hues , but bright and glowing tints ; its music -- save when ye drown it -- is not in sighs and groans , but songs and cheerful sounds .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 18]: Listen to the million voices in the summer air , and find one dismal as your own .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 62]: Remember , if ye can , the sense of hope and pleasure which every glad return of day awakens in the breast of all your kind who have not changed their nature ; and learn some wisdom even from the witless , when their hearts are lifted up they know not why , by all the mirth and happiness it brings .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 34]: The widow 's breast was full of care , was laden heavily with secret dread and sorrow ; but her boy 's gaiety of heart gladdened her , and beguiled the long journey .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 61]: Sometimes he would bid her lean upon his arm , and would keep beside her steadily for a short distance ; but it was more his nature to be rambling to and fro , and she better liked to see him free and happy , even than to have him near her , because she loved him better than herself .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 34]: She had quitted the place to which they were travelling , directly after the event which had changed her whole existence ; and for two-and-twenty years had never had courage to revisit it .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 6]: It was her native village .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 13]: How many recollections crowded on her mind when it appeared in sight !
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 3]: Two-and-twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 8]: Her boy 's whole life and history .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 23]: The last time she looked back upon those roofs among the trees , she carried him in her arms , an infant .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 44]: How often since that time had she sat beside him night and day , watching for the dawn of mind that never came ; how had she feared , and doubted , and yet hoped , long after conviction forced itself upon her !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 49]: The little stratagems she had devised to try him , the little tokens he had given in his childish way -- not of dulness but of something infinitely worse , so ghastly and unchildlike in its cunning -- came back as vividly as if but yesterday had intervened .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 74]: The room in which they used to be ; the spot in which his cradle stood ; he , old and elfin-like in face , but ever dear to her , gazing at her with a wild and vacant eye , and crooning some uncouth song as she sat by and rocked him ; every circumstance of his infancy came thronging back , and the most trivial , perhaps , the most distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 122]: His older childhood , too ; the strange imaginings he had ; his terror of certain senseless things -- familiar objects he endowed with life ; the slow and gradual breaking out of that one horror , in which , before his birth , his darkened intellect began ; how , in the midst of all , she had found some hope and comfort in his being unlike another child , and had gone on almost believing in the slow development of his mind until he grew a man , and then his childhood was complete and lasting ; one after another , all these old thoughts sprung up within her , strong after their long slumber and bitterer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 12]: She took his arm and they hurried through the village street .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 23]: It was the same as it was wont to be in old times , yet different too , and wore another air .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 32]: The change was in herself , not it ; but she never thought of that , and wondered at its alteration , and where it lay , and what it was .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 38]: The people all knew Barnaby , and the children of the place came flocking round him -- as she remembered to have done with their fathers and mothers round some silly beggarman , when a child herself .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 29]: None of them knew her ; they passed each well-remembered house , and yard , and homestead ; and striking into the fields , were soon alone again .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 9]: The Warren was the end of their journey .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 28]: Mr Haredale was walking in the garden , and seeing them as they passed the iron gate , unlocked it , and bade them enter that way .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 21]: ` At length you have mustered heart to visit the old place , ' he said to the widow . '
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 7]: I am glad you have . '
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 16]: ` For the first time , and the last , sir , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 13]: ` The first for many years , but not the last ? '
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 6]: ` The very last . '
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 34]: ` You mean , ' said Mr Haredale , regarding her with some surprise , ` that having made this effort , you are resolved not to persevere and are determined to relapse ?
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 6]: This is unworthy of you .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 11]: I have often told you , you should return here .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: You would be happier here than elsewhere , I know .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 11]: As to Barnaby , it 's quite his home . '
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 14]: ` And Grip 's , ' said Barnaby , holding the basket open .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 48]: The raven hopped gravely out , and perching on his shoulder and addressing himself to Mr Haredale , cried -- as a hint , perhaps , that some temperate refreshment would be acceptable -- ` Polly put the ket-tle on , we 'll all have tea ! '
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 24]: ` Hear me , Mary , ' said Mr Haredale kindly , as he motioned her to walk with him towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 25]: ` Your life has been an example of patience and fortitude , except in this one particular which has often given me great pain .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 51]: It is enough to know that you were cruelly involved in the calamity which deprived me of an only brother , and Emma of her father , without being obliged to suppose -LRB- as I sometimes am -RRB- that you associate us with the author of our joint misfortunes . '
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 9]: ` Associate you with him , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 14]: ` Indeed , ' said Mr Haredale , ' I think you do .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 39]: I almost believe that because your husband was bound by so many ties to our relation , and died in his service and defence , you have come in some sort to connect us with his murder . '
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 4]: ` Alas ! '
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 9]: ` You little know my heart , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 7]: You little know the truth ! '
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 34]: ` It is natural you should do so ; it is very probable you may , without being conscious of it , ' said Mr Haredale , speaking more to himself than her .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 7]: ` We are a fallen house .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 37]: Money , dispensed with the most lavish hand , would be a poor recompense for sufferings like yours ; and thinly scattered by hands so pinched and tied as ours , it becomes a miserable mockery .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 14]: I feel it so , God knows , ' he added , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 10]: ` Why should I wonder if she does ! '
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 44]: ` You do me wrong , dear sir , indeed , ' she rejoined with great earnestness ; ` and yet when you come to hear what I desire your leave to say -- ' ' I shall find my doubts confirmed ? '
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: he said , observing that she faltered and became confused .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 38]: He quickened his pace for a few steps , but fell back again to her side , and said : ` And have you come all this way at last , solely to speak to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 8]: She answered , ` Yes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 66]: A curse , ' he muttered , ` upon the wretched state of us proud beggars , from whom the poor and rich are equally at a distance ; the one being forced to treat us with a show of cold respect ; the other condescending to us in their every deed and word , and keeping more aloof , the nearer they approach us .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 49]: -- Why , if it were pain to you -LRB- as it must have been -RRB- to break for this slight purpose the chain of habit forged through two-and-twenty years , could you not let me know your wish , and beg me to come to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 13]: ` There was not time , sir , ' she rejoined . '
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 24]: I took my resolution but last night , and taking it , felt that I must not lose a day -- a day !
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 10]: an hour -- in having speech with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 9]: They had by this time reached the house .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 21]: Mr Haredale paused for a moment , and looked at her as if surprised by the energy of her manner .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 53]: Observing , however , that she took no heed of him , but glanced up , shuddering , at the old walls with which such horrors were connected in her mind , he led her by a private stair into his library , where Emma was seated in a window , reading .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 35]: The young lady , seeing who approached , hastily rose and laid aside her book , and with many kind words , and not without tears , gave her a warm and earnest welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 21]: But the widow shrunk from her embrace as though she feared her , and sunk down trembling on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 19]: ` It is the return to this place after so long an absence , ' said Emma gently .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 30]: ` Pray ring , dear uncle -- or stay -- Barnaby will run himself and ask for wine -- ' ` Not for the world , ' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 13]: ` It would have another taste -- I could not touch it .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 8]: I want but a minute 's rest .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 5]: Nothing but that . '
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 13]: Miss Haredale stood beside her chair , regarding her with silent pity .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 34]: She remained for a little time quite still ; then rose and turned to Mr Haredale , who had sat down in his easy chair , and was contemplating her with fixed attention .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 31]: The tale connected with the mansion borne in mind , it seemed , as has been already said , the chosen theatre for such a deed as it had known .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 78]: The room in which this group were now assembled -- hard by the very chamber where the act was done -- dull , dark , and sombre ; heavy with worm-eaten books ; deadened and shut in by faded hangings , muffling every sound ; shadowed mournfully by trees whose rustling boughs gave ever and anon a spectral knocking at the glass ; wore , beyond all others in the house , a ghostly , gloomy air .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 13]: Nor were the group assembled there , unfitting tenants of the spot .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 72]: The widow , with her marked and startling face and downcast eyes ; Mr Haredale stern and despondent ever ; his niece beside him , like , yet most unlike , the picture of her father , which gazed reproachfully down upon them from the blackened wall ; Barnaby , with his vacant look and restless eye ; were all in keeping with the place , and actors in the legend .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 59]: Nay , the very raven , who had hopped upon the table and with the air of some old necromancer appeared to be profoundly studying a great folio volume that lay open on a desk , was strictly in unison with the rest , and looked like the embodied spirit of evil biding his time of mischief . '
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 17]: I scarcely know , ' said the widow , breaking silence , ` how to begin .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 8]: You will think my mind disordered . '
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 30]: ` The whole tenor of your quiet and reproachless life since you were last here , ' returned Mr Haredale , mildly , ` shall bear witness for you .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 10]: Why do you fear to awaken such a suspicion ?
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 7]: You do not speak to strangers .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 14]: You have not to claim our interest or consideration for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 4]: Be more yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 3]: Take heart .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 22]: Any advice or assistance that I can give you , you know is yours of right , and freely yours . '
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 57]: ` What if I came , sir , ' she rejoined , ' I who have but one other friend on earth , to reject your aid from this moment , and to say that henceforth I launch myself upon the world , alone and unassisted , to sink or swim as Heaven may decree ! '
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 55]: ` You would have , if you came to me for such a purpose , ' said Mr Haredale calmly , ` some reason to assign for conduct so extraordinary , which -- if one may entertain the possibility of anything so wild and strange -- would have its weight , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 17]: ` That , sir , ' she answered , ` is the misery of my distress .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 7]: I can give no reason whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 11]: My own bare word is all that I can offer .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 11]: It is my duty , my imperative and bounden duty .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 16]: If I did not discharge it , I should be a base and guilty wretch .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 17]: Having said that , my lips are sealed , and I can say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 35]: As though she felt relieved at having said so much , and had nerved herself to the remainder of her task , she spoke from this time with a firmer voice and heightened courage .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 53]: ` Heaven is my witness , as my own heart is -- and yours , dear young lady , will speak for me , I know -- that I have lived , since that time we all have bitter reason to remember , in unchanging devotion , and gratitude to this family .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 17]: Heaven is my witness that go where I may , I shall preserve those feelings unimpaired .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 36]: And it is my witness , too , that they alone impel me to the course I must take , and from which nothing now shall turn me , as I hope for mercy . '
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 11]: ` These are strange riddles , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 21]: ` In this world , sir , ' she replied , ` they may , perhaps , never be explained .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 14]: In another , the Truth will be discovered in its own good time .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 19]: And may that time , ' she added in a low voice , ` be far distant ! '
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 26]: ` Let me be sure , ' said Mr Haredale , ` that I understand you , for I am doubtful of my own senses .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 84]: Do you mean that you are resolved voluntarily to deprive yourself of those means of support you have received from us so long -- that you are determined to resign the annuity we settled on you twenty years ago -- to leave house , and home , and goods , and begin life anew -- and this , for some secret reason or monstrous fancy which is incapable of explanation , which only now exists , and has been dormant all this time ?
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 14]: In the name of God , under what delusion are you labouring ? '
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 75]: ` As I am deeply thankful , ' she made answer , ` for the kindness of those , alive and dead , who have owned this house ; and as I would not have its roof fall down and crush me , or its very walls drip blood , my name being spoken in their hearing ; I never will again subsist upon their bounty , or let it help me to subsistence .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 27]: You do not know , ' she added , suddenly , ` to what uses it may be applied ; into what hands it may pass .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 9]: I do , and I renounce it . '
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 16]: ` Surely , ' said Mr Haredale , ` its uses rest with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 4]: ` They did .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 7]: They rest with me no longer .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 18]: It may be -- it IS -- devoted to purposes that mock the dead in their graves .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 7]: It never can prosper with me .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 26]: It will bring some other heavy judgement on the head of my dear son , whose innocence will suffer for his mother 's guilt . '
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 7]: ` What words are these ! '
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 9]: cried Mr Haredale , regarding her with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 8]: ` Among what associates have you fallen ?
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 11]: Into what guilt have you ever been betrayed ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 26]: I am guilty , and yet innocent ; wrong , yet right ; good in intention , though constrained to shield and aid the bad .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 20]: Ask me no more questions , sir ; but believe that I am rather to be pitied than condemned .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 17]: I must leave my house to-morrow , for while I stay there , it is haunted .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 17]: My future dwelling , if I am to live in peace , must be a secret .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 36]: If my poor boy should ever stray this way , do not tempt him to disclose it or have him watched when he returns ; for if we are hunted , we must fly again .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 42]: And now this load is off my mind , I beseech you -- and you , dear Miss Haredale , too -- to trust me if you can , and think of me kindly as you have been used to do .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 64]: If I die and can not tell my secret even then -LRB- for that may come to pass -RRB- , it will sit the lighter on my breast in that hour for this day 's work ; and on that day , and every day until it comes , I will pray for and thank you both , and trouble you no more .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 51]: With that , she would have left them , but they detained her , and with many soothing words and kind entreaties , besought her to consider what she did , and above all to repose more freely upon them , and say what weighed so sorely on her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 47]: Finding her deaf to their persuasions , Mr Haredale suggested , as a last resource , that she should confide in Emma , of whom , as a young person and one of her own sex , she might stand in less dread than of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 20]: From this proposal , however , she recoiled with the same indescribable repugnance she had manifested when they met .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 53]: The utmost that could be wrung from her was , a promise that she would receive Mr Haredale at her own house next evening , and in the mean time reconsider her determination and their dissuasions -- though any change on her part , as she told them , was quite hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 59]: This condition made at last , they reluctantly suffered her to depart , since she would neither eat nor drink within the house ; and she , and Barnaby , and Grip , accordingly went out as they had come , by the private stair and garden-gate ; seeing and being seen of no one by the way .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 46]: It was remarkable in the raven that during the whole interview he had kept his eye on his book with exactly the air of a very sly human rascal , who , under the mask of pretending to read hard , was listening to everything .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 72]: He still appeared to have the conversation very strongly in his mind , for although , when they were alone again , he issued orders for the instant preparation of innumerable kettles for purposes of tea , he was thoughtful , and rather seemed to do so from an abstract sense of duty , than with any regard to making himself agreeable , or being what is commonly called good company .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 8]: They were to return by the coach .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 31]: As there was an interval of full two hours before it started , and they needed rest and some refreshment , Barnaby begged hard for a visit to the Maypole .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 56]: But his mother , who had no wish to be recognised by any of those who had known her long ago , and who feared besides that Mr Haredale might , on second thoughts , despatch some messenger to that place of entertainment in quest of her , proposed to wait in the churchyard instead .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 35]: As it was easy for Barnaby to buy and carry thither such humble viands as they required , he cheerfully assented , and in the churchyard they sat down to take their frugal dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 52]: Here again , the raven was in a highly reflective state ; walking up and down when he had dined , with an air of elderly complacency which was strongly suggestive of his having his hands under his coat-tails ; and appearing to read the tombstones with a very critical taste .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 47]: Sometimes , after a long inspection of an epitaph , he would strop his beak upon the grave to which it referred , and cry in his hoarse tones , ` I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 27]: but whether he addressed his observations to any supposed person below , or merely threw them off as a general remark , is matter of uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 58]: It was a quiet pretty spot , but a sad one for Barnaby 's mother ; for Mr Reuben Haredale lay there , and near the vault in which his ashes rested , was a stone to the memory of her own husband , with a brief inscription recording how and when he had lost his life .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 25]: She sat here , thoughtful and apart , until their time was out , and the distant horn told that the coach was coming .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 62]: Barnaby , who had been sleeping on the grass , sprung up quickly at the sound ; and Grip , who appeared to understand it equally well , walked into his basket straightway , entreating society in general -LRB- as though he intended a kind of satire upon them in connection with churchyards -RRB- never to say die on any terms .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 12]: They were soon on the coach-top and rolling along the road .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 13]: It went round by the Maypole , and stopped at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 20]: Joe was from home , and Hugh came sluggishly out to hand up the parcel that it called for .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 10]: There was no fear of old John coming out .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 14]: They could see him from the coach-roof fast asleep in his cosy bar .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 9]: It was a part of John 's character .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 14]: He made a point of going to sleep at the coach 's time .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 57]: He despised gadding about ; he looked upon coaches as things that ought to be indicted ; as disturbers of the peace of mankind ; as restless , bustling , busy , horn-blowing contrivances , quite beneath the dignity of men , and only suited to giddy girls that did nothing but chatter and go a-shopping .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 54]: ` We know nothing about coaches here , sir , ' John would say , if any unlucky stranger made inquiry touching the offensive vehicles ; ` we do n't book for 'em ; we 'd rather not ; they 're more trouble than they 're worth , with their noise and rattle .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 50]: If you like to wait for 'em you can ; but we do n't know anything about 'em ; they may call and they may not -- there 's a carrier -- he was looked upon as quite good enough for us , when I was a boy . '
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 22]: She dropped her veil as Hugh climbed up , and while he hung behind , and talked to Barnaby in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 73]: But neither he nor any other person spoke to her , or noticed her , or had any curiosity about her ; and so , an alien , she visited and left the village where she had been born , and had lived a merry child , a comely girl , a happy wife -- where she had known all her enjoyment of life , and had entered on its hardest sorrows .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 15]: Chapter 26 ` And you 're not surprised to hear this , Varden ? '
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 4]: said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 21]: You and she have always been the best friends , and you should understand her if anybody does . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 13]: I ask your pardon , sir , ' rejoined the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 8]: I did n't say I understood her .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 13]: I would n't have the presumption to say that of any woman .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 7]: It 's not so easily done .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 20]: But I am not so much surprised , sir , as you expected me to be , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 13]: ` May I ask why not , my good friend ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 33]: I have seen , sir , ' returned the locksmith with evident reluctance , ' I have seen in connection with her , something that has filled me with distrust and uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 35]: She has made bad friends , how , or when , I do n't know ; but that her house is a refuge for one robber and cut-throat at least , I am certain .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 4]: There , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 6]: Now it 's out . '
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 4]: ` Varden ! '
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 32]: ` My own eyes , sir , are my witnesses , and for her sake I would be willingly half-blind , if I could but have the pleasure of mistrusting 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 66]: I have kept the secret till now , and it will go no further than yourself , I know ; but I tell you that with my own eyes -- broad awake -- I saw , in the passage of her house one evening after dark , the highwayman who robbed and wounded Mr Edward Chester , and on the same night threatened me . '
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 11]: ` And you made no effort to detain him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 5]: said Mr Haredale quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 34]: ` Sir , ' returned the locksmith , ` she herself prevented me -- held me , with all her strength , and hung about me until he had got clear off . '
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 19]: And having gone so far , he related circumstantially all that had passed upon the night in question .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 27]: This dialogue was held in a low tone in the locksmith 's little parlour , into which honest Gabriel had shown his visitor on his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 38]: Mr Haredale had called upon him to entreat his company to the widow 's , that he might have the assistance of his persuasion and influence ; and out of this circumstance the conversation had arisen . '
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 31]: I forbore , ' said Gabriel , ` from repeating one word of this to anybody , as it could do her no good and might do her great harm .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 60]: I thought and hoped , to say the truth , that she would come to me , and talk to me about it , and tell me how it was ; but though I have purposely put myself in her way more than once or twice , she has never touched upon the subject -- except by a look .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 31]: And indeed , ' said the good-natured locksmith , ` there was a good deal in the look , more than could have been put into a great many words .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 23]: It said among other matters `` Do n't ask me anything '' so imploringly , that I did n't ask her anything .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 13]: You 'll think me an old fool , I know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 15]: If it 's any relief to call me one , pray do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 19]: I am greatly disturbed by what you tell me , ' said Mr Haredale , after a silence .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 10]: ` What meaning do you attach to it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 17]: The locksmith shook his head , and looked doubtfully out of window at the failing light .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 13]: ` She can not have married again , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 10]: ` Not without our knowledge surely , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 24]: ` She may have done so , in the fear that it would lead , if known , to some objection or estrangement .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 48]: Suppose she married incautiously -- it is not improbable , for her existence has been a lonely and monotonous one for many years -- and the man turned out a ruffian , she would be anxious to screen him , and yet would revolt from his crimes .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 4]: This might be .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 19]: It bears strongly on the whole drift of her discourse yesterday , and would quite explain her conduct .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 11]: Do you suppose Barnaby is privy to these circumstances ? '
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 29]: ` Quite impossible to say , sir , ' returned the locksmith , shaking his head again : ` and next to impossible to find out from him .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 69]: If what you suppose is really the case , I tremble for the lad -- a notable person , sir , to put to bad uses -- ' ` It is not possible , Varden , ' said Mr Haredale , in a still lower tone of voice than he had spoken yet , ` that we have been blinded and deceived by this woman from the beginning ?
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 49]: It is not possible that this connection was formed in her husband 's lifetime , and led to his and my brother 's -- ' ` Good God , sir , ' cried Gabriel , interrupting him , ` do n't entertain such dark thoughts for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 12]: Five-and-twenty years ago , where was there a girl like her ?
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 10]: A gay , handsome , laughing , bright-eyed damsel !
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 7]: Think what she was , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 34]: It makes my heart ache now , even now , though I 'm an old man , with a woman for a daughter , to think what she was and what she is .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 23]: We all change , but that 's with Time ; Time does his work honestly , and I do n't mind him .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 7]: A fig for Time , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 20]: Use him well , and he 's a hearty fellow , and scorns to have you at a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 46]: But care and suffering -LRB- and those have changed her -RRB- are devils , sir -- secret , stealthy , undermining devils -- who tread down the brightest flowers in Eden , and do more havoc in a month than Time does in a year .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 36]: Picture to yourself for one minute what Mary was before they went to work with her fresh heart and face -- do her that justice -- and say whether such a thing is possible . '
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 20]: ` You 're a good fellow , Varden , ' said Mr Haredale , ` and are quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 20]: I have brooded on that subject so long , that every breath of suspicion carries me back to it .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 6]: You are quite right . '
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 45]: ` It is n't , sir , ' cried the locksmith with brightened eyes , and sturdy , honest voice ; ` it is n't because I courted her before Rudge , and failed , that I say she was too good for him .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 11]: She would have been as much too good for me .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 18]: But she WAS too good for him ; he was n't free and frank enough for her .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 25]: I do n't reproach his memory with it , poor fellow ; I only want to put her before you as she really was .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 39]: For myself , I 'll keep her old picture in my mind ; and thinking of that , and what has altered her , I 'll stand her friend , and try to win her back to peace .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 56]: And damme , sir , ' cried Gabriel , ` with your pardon for the word , I 'd do the same if she had married fifty highwaymen in a twelvemonth ; and think it in the Protestant Manual too , though Martha said it was n't , tooth and nail , till doomsday ! '
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 48]: If the dark little parlour had been filled with a dense fog , which , clearing away in an instant , left it all radiance and brightness , it could not have been more suddenly cheered than by this outbreak on the part of the hearty locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 20]: In a voice nearly as full and round as his own , Mr Haredale cried ` Well said ! '
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 9]: and bade him come away without more parley .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 24]: The locksmith complied right willingly ; and both getting into a hackney coach which was waiting at the door , drove off straightway .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 17]: They alighted at the street corner , and dismissing their conveyance , walked to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 12]: To their first knock at the door there was no response .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 8]: A second met with the like result .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 43]: But in answer to the third , which was of a more vigorous kind , the parlour window-sash was gently raised , and a musical voice cried : ` Haredale , my dear fellow , I am extremely glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 14]: How very much you have improved in your appearance since our last meeting !
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 7]: I never saw you looking better .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 6]: HOW do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 40]: Mr Haredale turned his eyes towards the casement whence the voice proceeded , though there was no need to do so , to recognise the speaker , and Mr Chester waved his hand , and smiled a courteous welcome .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 12]: ` The door will be opened immediately , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 14]: ` There is nobody but a very dilapidated female to perform such offices .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 6]: You will excuse her infirmities ?
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 16]: If she were in a more elevated station of society , she would be gouty .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 15]: Being but a hewer of wood and drawer of water , she is rheumatic .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 15]: My dear Haredale , these are natural class distinctions , depend upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 31]: Mr Haredale , whose face resumed its lowering and distrustful look the moment he heard the voice , inclined his head stiffly , and turned his back upon the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 10]: ` Not opened yet , ' said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 18]: I hope the aged soul has not caught her foot in some unlucky cobweb by the way .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 6]: She is there at last !
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 7]: Come in , I beg ! '
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 9]: Mr Haredale entered , followed by the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 26]: Turning with a look of great astonishment to the old woman who had opened the door , he inquired for Mrs Rudge -- for Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 16]: They were both gone , she replied , wagging her ancient head , for good .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 15]: There was a gentleman in the parlour , who perhaps could tell them more .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 6]: That was all SHE knew .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 30]: ` Pray , sir , ' said Mr Haredale , presenting himself before this new tenant , ` where is the person whom I came here to see ? '
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 18]: ` My dear friend , ' he returned , ' I have not the least idea . '
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 23]: ` Your trifling is ill-timed , ' retorted the other in a suppressed tone and voice , ` and its subject ill-chosen .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 17]: Reserve it for those who are your friends , and do not expend it on me .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 17]: I lay no claim to the distinction , and have the self-denial to reject it . '
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 19]: ` My dear , good sir , ' said Mr Chester , ` you are heated with walking .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 6]: Sit down , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 27]: Our friend is -- ' ` Is but a plain honest man , ' returned Mr Haredale , ` and quite unworthy of your notice . '
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: ` Gabriel Varden by name , sir , ' said the locksmith bluntly . '
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 6]: A worthy English yeoman ! '
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 5]: said Mr Chester . '
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 27]: A most worthy yeoman , of whom I have frequently heard my son Ned -- darling fellow -- speak , and have often wished to see .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 13]: Varden , my good friend , I am glad to know you .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 20]: You wonder now , ' he said , turning languidly to Mr Haredale , ` to see me here .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: Now , I am sure you do . '
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 18]: Mr Haredale glanced at him -- not fondly or admiringly -- smiled , and held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 19]: ` The mystery is solved in a moment , ' said Mr Chester ; ` in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 9]: Will you step aside with me one instant .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 17]: You remember our little compact in reference to Ned , and your dear niece , Haredale ?
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 11]: You remember the list of assistants in their innocent intrigue ?
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 9]: You remember these two people being among them ?
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 10]: My dear fellow , congratulate yourself , and me .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 7]: I have bought them off . '
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 7]: ` You have done what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 4]: said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 12]: ` Bought them off , ' returned his smiling friend . '
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 30]: I have found it necessary to take some active steps towards setting this boy and girl attachment quite at rest , and have begun by removing these two agents .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 4]: You are surprised ?
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 10]: Who CAN withstand the influence of a little money !
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 10]: They wanted it , and have been bought off .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 9]: We have nothing more to fear from them .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 5]: They are gone . '
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 4]: ` Gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 4]: echoed Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 43]: ` My dear fellow -- and you must permit me to say again , that you never looked so young ; so positively boyish as you do to-night -- the Lord knows where ; I believe Columbus himself would n't find them .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 21]: Between you and me they have their hidden reasons , but upon that point I have pledged myself to secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 21]: She appointed to see you here to-night , I know , but found it inconvenient , and could n't wait .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 8]: Here is the key of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 30]: I am afraid you 'll find it inconveniently large ; but as the tenement is yours , your good-nature will excuse that , Haredale , I am certain ! '
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 78]: Chapter 27 Mr Haredale stood in the widow 's parlour with the door-key in his hand , gazing by turns at Mr Chester and at Gabriel Varden , and occasionally glancing downward at the key as in the hope that of its own accord it would unlock the mystery ; until Mr Chester , putting on his hat and gloves , and sweetly inquiring whether they were walking in the same direction , recalled him to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 7]: ` No , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 11]: ` Our roads diverge -- widely , as you know .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 10]: For the present , I shall remain here . '
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 23]: ` You will be hipped , Haredale ; you will be miserable , melancholy , utterly wretched , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 17]: ` It 's a place of the very last description for a man of your temper .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 10]: I know it will make you very miserable . '
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 19]: ` Let it , ' said Mr Haredale , sitting down ; ` and thrive upon the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 42]: Feigning to be wholly unconscious of the abrupt wave of the hand which rendered this farewell tantamount to a dismissal , Mr Chester retorted with a bland and heartfelt benediction , and inquired of Gabriel in what direction HE was going .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 24]: ` Yours , sir , would be too much honour for the like of me , ' replied the locksmith , hesitating . '
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 23]: I wish you to remain here a little while , Varden , ' said Mr Haredale , without looking towards them . '
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 13]: I have a word or two to say to you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 18]: I will not intrude upon your conference another moment , ' said Mr Chester with inconceivable politeness .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 9]: ` May it be satisfactory to you both !
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 5]: God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 18]: So saying , and bestowing upon the locksmith a most refulgent smile , he left them . '
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 40]: A deplorably constituted creature , that rugged person , ' he said , as he walked along the street ; ` he is an atrocity that carries its own punishment along with it -- a bear that gnaws himself .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 18]: And here is one of the inestimable advantages of having a perfect command over one 's inclinations .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 19]: I have been tempted in these two short interviews , to draw upon that fellow , fifty times .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 11]: Five men in six would have yielded to the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 27]: By suppressing mine , I wound him deeper and more keenly than if I were the best swordsman in all Europe , and he the worst .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 36]: You are the wise man 's very last resource , ' he said , tapping the hilt of his weapon ; ` we can but appeal to you when all else is said and done .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 39]: To come to you before , and thereby spare our adversaries so much , is a barbarian mode of warfare , quite unworthy of any man with the remotest pretensions to delicacy of feeling , or refinement . '
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 33]: He smiled so very pleasantly as he communed with himself after this manner , that a beggar was emboldened to follow for alms , and to dog his footsteps for some distance .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 42]: He was gratified by the circumstance , feeling it complimentary to his power of feature , and as a reward suffered the man to follow him until he called a chair , when he graciously dismissed him with a fervent blessing .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 27]: ` Which is as easy as cursing , ' he wisely added , as he took his seat , ` and more becoming to the face .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 13]: -- To Clerkenwell , my good creatures , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 24]: The chairmen were rendered quite vivacious by having such a courteous burden , and to Clerkenwell they went at a fair round trot .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 52]: Alighting at a certain point he had indicated to them upon the road , and paying them something less than they expected from a fare of such gentle speech , he turned into the street in which the locksmith dwelt , and presently stood beneath the shadow of the Golden Key .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 37]: Mr Tappertit , who was hard at work by lamplight , in a corner of the workshop , remained unconscious of his presence until a hand upon his shoulder made him start and turn his head .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 21]: ` Industry , ' said Mr Chester , ` is the soul of business , and the keystone of prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 21]: Mr Tappertit , I shall expect you to invite me to dinner when you are Lord Mayor of London . '
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 40]: ` Sir , ' returned the ` prentice , laying down his hammer , and rubbing his nose on the back of a very sooty hand , ' I scorn the Lord Mayor and everything that belongs to him .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 18]: We must have another state of society , sir , before you catch me being Lord Mayor .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 7]: How de do , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 16]: ` The better , Mr Tappertit , for looking into your ingenuous face once more .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: I hope you are well . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 39]: I am as well , sir , ' said Sim , standing up to get nearer to his ear , and whispering hoarsely , ` as any man can be under the aggrawations to which I am exposed .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 8]: My life 's a burden to me .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 22]: If it was n't for wengeance , I 'd play at pitch and toss with it on the losing hazard . '
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 8]: ` Is Mrs Varden at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 4]: said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 22]: ` Sir , ' returned Sim , eyeing him over with a look of concentrated expression , -- ` she is .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 8]: Did you wish to see her ? '
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 4]: Mr Chester nodded .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 19]: ` Then come this way , sir , ' said Sim , wiping his face upon his apron .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 6]: ` Follow me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 17]: -- Would you permit me to whisper in your ear , one half a second ? '
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 6]: ` By all means . '
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 51]: Mr Tappertit raised himself on tiptoe , applied his lips to Mr Chester 's ear , drew back his head without saying anything , looked hard at him , applied them to his ear again , again drew back , and finally whispered -- ` The name is Joseph Willet .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 6]: I say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 31]: Having said that much , he beckoned the visitor with a mysterious aspect to follow him to the parlour-door , where he announced him in the voice of a gentleman-usher .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 5]: ` Mr Chester . '
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 39]: ` And not Mr Ed ` dard , mind , ' said Sim , looking into the door again , and adding this by way of postscript in his own person ; ` it 's his father . '
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 49]: ` But do not let his father , ' said Mr Chester , advancing hat in hand , as he observed the effect of this last explanatory announcement , ` do not let his father be any check or restraint on your domestic occupations , Miss Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 2]: Now !
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 8]: A n't I always a-saying it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 7]: exclaimed Miggs , clapping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 14]: ` If he a n't been and took Missis for her own daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 12]: Well , she DO look like it , that she do .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 8]: Only think of that , mim ! '
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 21]: ` Is it possible , ' said Mr Chester in his softest tones , ` that this is Mrs Varden !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 4]: I am amazed .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 9]: That is not your daughter , Mrs Varden ?
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 4]: Your sister . '
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 18]: ` My daughter , indeed , sir , ' returned Mrs V. , blushing with great juvenility .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 7]: ` Ah , Mrs Varden ! '
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 4]: cried the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 27]: ` Ah , ma'am -- humanity is indeed a happy lot , when we can repeat ourselves in others , and still be young as they .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 23]: You must allow me to salute you -- the custom of the country , my dear madam -- your daughter too . '
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 26]: Dolly showed some reluctance to perform this ceremony , but was sharply reproved by Mrs Varden , who insisted on her undergoing it that minute .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 26]: For pride , she said with great severity , was one of the seven deadly sins , and humility and lowliness of heart were virtues .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 71]: Wherefore she desired that Dolly would be kissed immediately , on pain of her just displeasure ; at the same time giving her to understand that whatever she saw her mother do , she might safely do herself , without being at the trouble of any reasoning or reflection on the subject -- which , indeed , was offensive and undutiful , and in direct contravention of the church catechism .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 43]: Thus admonished , Dolly complied , though by no means willingly ; for there was a broad , bold look of admiration in Mr Chester 's face , refined and polished though it sought to be , which distressed her very much .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 32]: As she stood with downcast eyes , not liking to look up and meet his , he gazed upon her with an approving air , and then turned to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 24]: ` My friend Gabriel -LRB- whose acquaintance I only made this very evening -RRB- should be a happy man , Mrs Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 8]: sighed Mrs V. , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: echoed Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 7]: ` Is that the case ? '
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 6]: said Mr Chester , compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 44]: ` Master has no intentions , sir , ' murmured Miggs as she sidled up to him , ` but to be as grateful as his natur will let him , for everythink he owns which it is in his powers to appreciate .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 41]: But we never , sir ' -- said Miggs , looking sideways at Mrs Varden , and interlarding her discourse with a sigh -- ` we never know the full value of SOME wines and fig-trees till we lose 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 30]: So much the worse , sir , for them as has the slighting of 'em on their consciences when they 're gone to be in full blow elsewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 14]: And Miss Miggs cast up her eyes to signify where that might be .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 84]: As Mrs Varden distinctly heard , and was intended to hear , all that Miggs said , and as these words appeared to convey in metaphorical terms a presage or foreboding that she would at some early period droop beneath her trials and take an easy flight towards the stars , she immediately began to languish , and taking a volume of the Manual from a neighbouring table , leant her arm upon it as though she were Hope and that her Anchor .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 29]: Mr Chester perceiving this , and seeing how the volume was lettered on the back , took it gently from her hand , and turned the fluttering leaves .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 8]: ` My favourite book , dear madam .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 42]: How often , how very often in his early life -- before he can remember ' -- -LRB- this clause was strictly true -RRB- ` have I deduced little easy moral lessons from its pages , for my dear son Ned !
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 5]: You know Ned ? '
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 15]: Mrs Varden had that honour , and a fine affable young gentleman he was .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 38]: ` You 're a mother , Mrs Varden , ' said Mr Chester , taking a pinch of snuff , ` and you know what I , as a father , feel , when he is praised .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 48]: He gives me some uneasiness -- much uneasiness -- he 's of a roving nature , ma'am -- from flower to flower -- from sweet to sweet -- but his is the butterfly time of life , and we must not be hard upon such trifling . '
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 5]: He glanced at Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 9]: She was attending evidently to what he said .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 5]: Just what he desired !
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 72]: ` The only thing I object to in this little trait of Ned 's , is , ' said Mr Chester , ' -- and the mention of his name reminds me , by the way , that I am about to beg the favour of a minute 's talk with you alone -- the only thing I object to in it , is , that it DOES partake of insincerity .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 36]: Now , however I may attempt to disguise the fact from myself in my affection for Ned , still I always revert to this -- that if we are not sincere , we are nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 4]: Nothing upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 21]: Let us be sincere , my dear madam -- ' ' -- and Protestant , ' murmured Mrs Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 7]: -- and Protestant above all things .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 74]: Let us be sincere and Protestant , strictly moral , strictly just -LRB- though always with a leaning towards mercy -RRB- , strictly honest , and strictly true , and we gain -- it is a slight point , certainly , but still it is something tangible ; we throw up a groundwork and foundation , so to speak , of goodness , on which we may afterwards erect some worthy superstructure . '
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 16]: Now , to be sure , Mrs Varden thought , here is a perfect character .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 58]: Here is a meek , righteous , thoroughgoing Christian , who , having mastered all these qualities , so difficult of attainment ; who , having dropped a pinch of salt on the tails of all the cardinal virtues , and caught them every one ; makes light of their possession , and pants for more morality .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 75]: For the good woman never doubted -LRB- as many good men and women never do -RRB- , that this slighting kind of profession , this setting so little store by great matters , this seeming to say , ' I am not proud , I am what you hear , but I consider myself no better than other people ; let us change the subject , pray ' -- was perfectly genuine and true .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 27]: He so contrived it , and said it in that way that it appeared to have been forced from him , and its effect was marvellous .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 82]: Aware of the impression he had made -- few men were quicker than he at such discoveries -- Mr Chester followed up the blow by propounding certain virtuous maxims , somewhat vague and general in their nature , doubtless , and occasionally partaking of the character of truisms , worn a little out at elbow , but delivered in so charming a voice and with such uncommon serenity and peace of mind , that they answered as well as the best .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 53]: Nor is this to be wondered at ; for as hollow vessels produce a far more musical sound in falling than those which are substantial , so it will oftentimes be found that sentiments which have nothing in them make the loudest ringing in the world , and are the most relished .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 46]: Mr Chester , with the volume gently extended in one hand , and with the other planted lightly on his breast , talked to them in the most delicious manner possible ; and quite enchanted all his hearers , notwithstanding their conflicting interests and thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 41]: Even Dolly , who , between his keen regards and her eyeing over by Mr Tappertit , was put quite out of countenance , could not help owning within herself that he was the sweetest-spoken gentleman she had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 28]: Even Miss Miggs , who was divided between admiration of Mr Chester and a mortal jealousy of her young mistress , had sufficient leisure to be propitiated .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 32]: Even Mr Tappertit , though occupied as we have seen in gazing at his heart 's delight , could not wholly divert his thoughts from the voice of the other charmer .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 61]: Mrs Varden , to her own private thinking , had never been so improved in all her life ; and when Mr Chester , rising and craving permission to speak with her apart , took her by the hand and led her at arm 's length upstairs to the best sitting-room , she almost deemed him something more than human .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 21]: ` Dear madam , ' he said , pressing her hand delicately to his lips ; ` be seated . '
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 13]: Mrs Varden called up quite a courtly air , and became seated .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 7]: ` You guess my object ? '
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 10]: said Mr Chester , drawing a chair towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 6]: ` You divine my purpose ?
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 12]: I am an affectionate parent , my dear Mrs Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 28]: ` That I am sure you are , sir , ' said Mrs V. ` Thank you , ' returned Mr Chester , tapping his snuff-box lid .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 12]: ` Heavy moral responsibilities rest with parents , Mrs Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 40]: Mrs Varden slightly raised her hands , shook her head , and looked at the ground as though she saw straight through the globe , out at the other end , and into the immensity of space beyond . '
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 15]: I may confide in you , ' said Mr Chester , ` without reserve .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 25]: I love my son , ma'am , dearly ; and loving him as I do , I would save him from working certain misery .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 9]: You know of his attachment to Miss Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 18]: You have abetted him in it , and very kind of you it was to do so .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 37]: I am deeply obliged to you -- most deeply obliged to you -- for your interest in his behalf ; but my dear ma'am , it is a mistaken one , I do assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 20]: Mrs Varden stammered that she was sorry -- ' ` Sorry , my dear ma'am , ' he interposed .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 22]: ` Never be sorry for what is so very amiable , so very good in intention , so perfectly like yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 36]: But there are grave and weighty reasons , pressing family considerations , and apart even from these , points of religious difference , which interpose themselves , and render their union impossible ; utterly im-possible .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 36]: I should have mentioned these circumstances to your husband ; but he has -- you will excuse my saying this so freely -- he has NOT your quickness of apprehension or depth of moral sense .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 13]: What an extremely airy house this is , and how beautifully kept !
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 22]: For one like myself -- a widower so long -- these tokens of female care and superintendence have inexpressible charms . '
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 32]: Mrs Varden began to think -LRB- she scarcely knew why -RRB- that the young Mr Chester must be in the wrong and the old Mr Chester must he in the right .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 37]: ` My son Ned , ' resumed her tempter with his most winning air , ` has had , I am told , your lovely daughter 's aid , and your open-hearted husband 's . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 19]: -- Much more than mine , sir , ' said Mrs Varden ; ' a great deal more .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 7]: I have often had my doubts .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 15]: It 's a -- ' ' A bad example , ' suggested Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 4]: ` It is .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 5]: No doubt it is .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 31]: Your daughter is at that age when to set before her an encouragement for young persons to rebel against their parents on this most important point , is particularly injudicious .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 5]: You are quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 37]: I ought to have thought of that myself , but it escaped me , I confess -- so far superior are your sex to ours , dear madam , in point of penetration and sagacity . '
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 35]: Mrs Varden looked as wise as if she had really said something to deserve this compliment -- firmly believed she had , in short -- and her faith in her own shrewdness increased considerably .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 20]: ` My dear ma'am , ' said Mr Chester , ` you embolden me to be plain with you .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 11]: My son and I are at variance on this point .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 13]: The young lady and her natural guardian differ upon it , also .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 35]: And the closing point is , that my son is bound by his duty to me , by his honour , by every solemn tie and obligation , to marry some one else . '
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 8]: ` Engaged to marry another lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 9]: quoth Mrs Varden , holding up her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 18]: ` My dear madam , brought up , educated , and trained , expressly for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 5]: Expressly for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 16]: -- Miss Haredale , I am told , is a very charming creature . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 23]: I am her foster-mother , and should know -- the best young lady in the world , ' said Mrs Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 9]: I have not the smallest doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 6]: I am sure she is .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 20]: And you , who have stood in that tender relation towards her , are bound to consult her happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 54]: Now , can I -- as I have said to Haredale , who quite agrees -- can I possibly stand by , and suffer her to throw herself away -LRB- although she IS of a Catholic family -RRB- , upon a young fellow who , as yet , has no heart at all ?
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 31]: It is no imputation upon him to say he has not , because young men who have plunged deeply into the frivolities and conventionalities of society , very seldom have .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 13]: Their hearts never grow , my dear ma'am , till after thirty .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 26]: I do n't believe , no , I do NOT believe , that I had any heart myself when I was Ned 's age . '
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 17]: ` Oh sir , ' said Mrs Varden , ' I think you must have had .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 21]: It 's impossible that you , who have so much now , can ever have been without any . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 28]: I hope , ' he answered , shrugging his shoulders meekly , ' I have a little ; I hope , a very little -- Heaven knows !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 28]: But to return to Ned ; I have no doubt you thought , and therefore interfered benevolently in his behalf , that I objected to Miss Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 4]: How very natural !
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 18]: My dear madam , I object to him -- to him -- emphatically to Ned himself . '
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 9]: Mrs Varden was perfectly aghast at the disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 42]: ` He has , if he honourably fulfils this solemn obligation of which I have told you -- and he must be honourable , dear Mrs Varden , or he is no son of mine -- a fortune within his reach .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 65]: He is of most expensive , ruinously expensive habits ; and if , in a moment of caprice and wilfulness , he were to marry this young lady , and so deprive himself of the means of gratifying the tastes to which he has been so long accustomed , he would -- my dear madam , he would break the gentle creature 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 25]: Mrs Varden , my good lady , my dear soul , I put it to you -- is such a sacrifice to be endured ?
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 14]: Is the female heart a thing to be trifled with in this way ?
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 8]: Ask your own , my dear madam .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 9]: Ask your own , I beseech you . '
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 15]: ` Truly , ' thought Mrs Varden , ` this gentleman is a saint .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 34]: But , ' she added aloud , and not unnaturally , ` if you take Miss Emma 's lover away , sir , what becomes of the poor thing 's heart then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 24]: ` The very point , ' said Mr Chester , not at all abashed , ` to which I wished to lead you .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 35]: A marriage with my son , whom I should be compelled to disown , would be followed by years of misery ; they would be separated , my dear madam , in a twelvemonth .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 37]: To break off this attachment , which is more fancied than real , as you and I know very well , will cost the dear girl but a few tears , and she is happy again .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 90]: Take the case of your own daughter , the young lady downstairs , who is your breathing image ' -- Mrs Varden coughed and simpered -- ` there is a young man -LRB- I am sorry to say , a dissolute fellow , of very indifferent character -RRB- of whom I have heard Ned speak -- Bullet was it -- Pullet -- Mullet -- ' ` There is a young man of the name of Joseph Willet , sir , ' said Mrs Varden , folding her hands loftily .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 10]: ` That 's he , ' cried Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 25]: ` Suppose this Joseph Willet now , were to aspire to the affections of your charming daughter , and were to engage them . '
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 26]: ` It would be like his impudence , ' interposed Mrs Varden , bridling , ` to dare to think of such a thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 11]: ` My dear madam , that 's the whole case .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 9]: I know it would be like his impudence .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 41]: It is like Ned 's impudence to do as he has done ; but you would not on that account , or because of a few tears from your beautiful daughter , refrain from checking their inclinations in their birth .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 52]: I meant to have reasoned thus with your husband when I saw him at Mrs Rudge 's this evening -- ' ` My husband , ' said Mrs Varden , interposing with emotion , ` would be a great deal better at home than going to Mrs Rudge 's so often .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 9]: I do n't know what he does there .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 20]: I do n't see what occasion he has to busy himself in her affairs at all , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 82]: ` If I do n't appear to express my concurrence in those last sentiments of yours , ' returned Mr Chester , ` quite so strongly as you might desire , it is because his being there , my dear madam , and not proving conversational , led me hither , and procured me the happiness of this interview with one , in whom the whole management , conduct , and prosperity of her family are centred , I perceive . '
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 94]: With that he took Mrs Varden 's hand again , and having pressed it to his lips with the highflown gallantry of the day -- a little burlesqued to render it the more striking in the good lady 's unaccustomed eyes -- proceeded in the same strain of mingled sophistry , cajolery , and flattery , to entreat that her utmost influence might be exerted to restrain her husband and daughter from any further promotion of Edward 's suit to Miss Haredale , and from aiding or abetting either party in any way .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 21]: Mrs Varden was but a woman , and had her share of vanity , obstinacy , and love of power .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 57]: She entered into a secret treaty of alliance , offensive and defensive , with her insinuating visitor ; and really did believe , as many others would have done who saw and heard him , that in so doing she furthered the ends of truth , justice , and morality , in a very uncommon degree .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 71]: Overjoyed by the success of his negotiation , and mightily amused within himself , Mr Chester conducted her downstairs in the same state as before ; and having repeated the previous ceremony of salutation , which also as before comprehended Dolly , took his leave ; first completing the conquest of Miss Miggs 's heart , by inquiring if ` this young lady ' would light him to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 14]: ` Oh , mim , ' said Miggs , returning with the candle .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 12]: ` Oh gracious me , mim , there 's a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 18]: Was there ever such an angel to talk as he is -- and such a sweet-looking man !
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 40]: So upright and noble , that he seems to despise the very ground he walks on ; and yet so mild and condescending , that he seems to say `` but I will take notice on it too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 37]: And to think of his taking you for Miss Dolly , and Miss Dolly for your sister -- Oh , my goodness me , if I was master would n't I be jealous of him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 57]: Mrs Varden reproved her handmaid for this vain-speaking ; but very gently and mildly -- quite smilingly indeed -- remarking that she was a foolish , giddy , light-headed girl , whose spirits carried her beyond all bounds , and who did n't mean half she said , or she would be quite angry with her .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 28]: ` For my part , ' said Dolly , in a thoughtful manner , ' I half believe Mr Chester is something like Miggs in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 24]: For all his politeness and pleasant speaking , I am pretty sure he was making game of us , more than once . '
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 46]: ` If you venture to say such a thing again , and to speak ill of people behind their backs in my presence , miss , ' said Mrs Varden , ' I shall insist upon your taking a candle and going to bed directly .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 6]: How dare you , Dolly ?
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 6]: I 'm astonished at you .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 12]: The rudeness of your whole behaviour this evening has been disgraceful .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 31]: Did anybody ever hear , ' cried the enraged matron , bursting into tears , ` of a daughter telling her own mother she has been made game of ! '
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 10]: What a very uncertain temper Mrs Varden 's was !
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 48]: Chapter 28 Repairing to a noted coffee-house in Covent Garden when he left the locksmith 's , Mr Chester sat long over a late dinner , entertaining himself exceedingly with the whimsical recollection of his recent proceedings , and congratulating himself very much on his great cleverness .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 80]: Influenced by these thoughts , his face wore an expression so benign and tranquil , that the waiter in immediate attendance upon him felt he could almost have died in his defence , and settled in his own mind -LRB- until the receipt of the bill , and a very small fee for very great trouble disabused it of the idea -RRB- that such an apostolic customer was worth half-a-dozen of the ordinary run of visitors , at least .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 56]: A visit to the gaming-table -- not as a heated , anxious venturer , but one whom it was quite a treat to see staking his two or three pieces in deference to the follies of society , and smiling with equal benevolence on winners and losers -- made it late before he reached home .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 33]: It was his custom to bid his servant go to bed at his own time unless he had orders to the contrary , and to leave a candle on the common stair .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 40]: There was a lamp on the landing by which he could always light it when he came home late , and having a key of the door about him he could enter and go to bed at his pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 74]: He opened the glass of the dull lamp , whose wick , burnt up and swollen like a drunkard 's nose , came flying off in little carbuncles at the candle 's touch , and scattering hot sparks about , rendered it matter of some difficulty to kindle the lazy taper ; when a noise , as of a man snoring deeply some steps higher up , caused him to pause and listen .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 13]: It was the heavy breathing of a sleeper , close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 15]: Some fellow had lain down on the open staircase , and was slumbering soundly .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 46]: Having lighted the candle at length and opened his own door , he softly ascended , holding the taper high above his head , and peering cautiously about ; curious to see what kind of man had chosen so comfortless a shelter for his lodging .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 70]: With his head upon the landing and his great limbs flung over half-a-dozen stairs , as carelessly as though he were a dead man whom drunken bearers had thrown down by chance , there lay Hugh , face uppermost , his long hair drooping like some wild weed upon his wooden pillow , and his huge chest heaving with the sounds which so unwontedly disturbed the place and hour .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 52]: He who came upon him so unexpectedly was about to break his rest by thrusting him with his foot , when , glancing at his upturned face , he arrested himself in the very action , and stooping down and shading the candle with his hand , examined his features closely .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 39]: Close as his first inspection was , it did not suffice , for he passed the light , still carefully shaded as before , across and across his face , and yet observed him with a searching eye .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 18]: While he was thus engaged , the sleeper , without any starting or turning round , awoke .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 41]: There was a kind of fascination in meeting his steady gaze so suddenly , which took from the other the presence of mind to withdraw his eyes , and forced him , as it were , to meet his look .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 31]: So they remained staring at each other , until Mr Chester at last broke silence , and asked him in a low voice , why he lay sleeping there . '
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 30]: I thought , ' said Hugh , struggling into a sitting posture and gazing at him intently , still , ` that you were a part of my dream .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 6]: It was a curious one .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 11]: I hope it may never come true , master . '
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 7]: ` What makes you shiver ? '
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 21]: ` The -- the cold , I suppose , ' he growled , as he shook himself and rose . '
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 9]: I hardly know where I am yet . '
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 7]: ` Do you know me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 4]: said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 12]: ` Ay , I know you , ' he answered . '
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 15]: I was dreaming of you -- we 're not where I thought we were .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 6]: That 's a comfort . '
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 35]: He looked round him as he spoke , and in particular looked above his head , as though he half expected to be standing under some object which had had existence in his dream .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 19]: Then he rubbed his eyes and shook himself again , and followed his conductor into his own rooms .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 51]: Mr Chester lighted the candles which stood upon his dressing-table , and wheeling an easy-chair towards the fire , which was yet burning , stirred up a cheerful blaze , sat down before it , and bade his uncouth visitor ` Come here , ' and draw his boots off .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 30]: ` You have been drinking again , my fine fellow , ' he said , as Hugh went down on one knee , and did as he was told .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 39]: ` As I 'm alive , master , I 've walked the twelve long miles , and waited here I do n't know how long , and had no drink between my lips since dinner-time at noon . '
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 26]: ` And can you do nothing better , my pleasant friend , than fall asleep , and shake the very building with your snores ? '
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 4]: said Mr Chester .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 26]: ` Ca n't you dream in your straw at home , dull dog as you are , that you need come here to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 11]: -- Reach me those slippers , and tread softly . '
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 5]: Hugh obeyed in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 48]: ` And harkee , my dear young gentleman , ' said Mr Chester , as he put them on , ` the next time you dream , do n't let it be of me , but of some dog or horse with whom you are better acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 26]: Fill the glass once -- you 'll find it and the bottle in the same place -- and empty it to keep yourself awake . '
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 18]: Hugh obeyed again even more zealously -- and having done so , presented himself before his patron .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 17]: ` Now , ' said Mr Chester , ` what do you want with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 10]: ` There was news to-day , ' returned Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 13]: ` Your son was at our house -- came down on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 16]: He tried to see the young woman , but could n't get sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 40]: He left some letter or some message which our Joe had charge of , but he and the old one quarrelled about it when your son had gone , and the old one would n't let it be delivered .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 23]: He says -LRB- that 's the old one does -RRB- that none of his people shall interfere and get him into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 16]: He 's a landlord , he says , and lives on everybody 's custom . '
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 21]: ` He 's a jewel , ' smiled Mr Chester , ` and the better for being a dull one .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 4]: -- Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 33]: ` Varden 's daughter -- that 's the girl I kissed -- ' ' -- and stole the bracelet from upon the king 's highway , ' said Mr Chester , composedly .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 8]: ` Yes ; what of her ? '
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 27]: ` She wrote a note at our house to the young woman , saying she lost the letter I brought to you , and you burnt .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 26]: Our Joe was to carry it , but the old one kept him at home all next day , on purpose that he should n't .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 16]: Next morning he gave it to me to take ; and here it is . '
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 13]: ` You did n't deliver it then , my good friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 21]: said Mr Chester , twirling Dolly 's note between his finger and thumb , and feigning to be surprised . '
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 13]: I supposed you 'd want to have it , ' retorted Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 11]: ` Burn one , burn all , I thought . '
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 32]: ` My devil-may-care acquaintance , ' said Mr Chester -- ` really if you do not draw some nicer distinctions , your career will be cut short with most surprising suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 24]: Do n't you know that the letter you brought to me , was directed to my son who resides in this very place ?
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 17]: And can you descry no difference between his letters and those addressed to other people ? '
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 36]: ` If you do n't want it , ' said Hugh , disconcerted by this reproof , for he had expected high praise , ` give it me back , and I 'll deliver it .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 13]: I do n't know how to please you , master . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 22]: I shall deliver it , ' returned his patron , putting it away after a moment 's consideration , ` myself .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 12]: Does the young lady walk out , on fine mornings ? '
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 11]: ` Mostly -- about noon is her usual time . '
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 4]: ` Alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 6]: ` Yes , alone . '
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 8]: ` In the grounds before the house .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 8]: -- Them that the footpath crosses . '
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 36]: ` If the weather should be fine , I may throw myself in her way to-morrow , perhaps , ' said Mr Chester , as coolly as if she were one of his ordinary acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 27]: ` Mr Hugh , if I should ride up to the Maypole door , you will do me the favour only to have seen me once .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 19]: You must suppress your gratitude , and endeavour to forget my forbearance in the matter of the bracelet .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 54]: It is natural it should break out , and it does you honour ; but when other folks are by , you must , for your own sake and safety , be as like your usual self as though you owed me no obligation whatever , and had never stood within these walls .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 5]: You comprehend me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 5]: Hugh understood him perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 35]: After a pause he muttered that he hoped his patron would involve him in no trouble about this last letter ; for he had kept it back solely with the view of pleasing him .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 65]: He was continuing in this strain , when Mr Chester with a most beneficent and patronising air cut him short by saying : ` My good fellow , you have my promise , my word , my sealed bond -LRB- for a verbal pledge with me is quite as good -RRB- , that I will always protect you so long as you deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 9]: Now , do set your mind at rest .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 10]: Keep it at ease , I beg of you .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 29]: When a man puts himself in my power so thoroughly as you have done , I really feel as though he had a kind of claim upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 19]: I am more disposed to mercy and forbearance under such circumstances than I can tell you , Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 48]: Do look upon me as your protector , and rest assured , I entreat you , that on the subject of that indiscretion , you may preserve , as long as you and I are friends , the lightest heart that ever beat within a human breast .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 37]: Fill that glass once more to cheer you on your road homewards -- I am really quite ashamed to think how far you have to go -- and then God bless you for the night . '
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 26]: ` They think , ' said Hugh , when he had tossed the liquor down , ` that I am sleeping soundly in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 15]: The stable door is shut , but the steed 's gone , master . '
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 23]: ` You are a most convivial fellow , ' returned his friend , ` and I love your humour of all things .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 3]: Good night !
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 13]: Take the greatest possible care of yourself , for my sake ! '
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 30]: It was remarkable that during the whole interview , each had endeavoured to catch stolen glances of the other 's face , and had never looked full at it .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 21]: They interchanged one brief and hasty glance as Hugh went out , averted their eyes directly , and so separated .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 30]: Hugh closed the double doors behind him , carefully and without noise ; and Mr Chester remained in his easy-chair , with his gaze intently fixed upon the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 78]: he said , after meditating for a long time -- and said with a deep sigh and an uneasy shifting of his attitude , as though he dismissed some other subject from his thoughts , and returned to that which had held possession of them all the day -- the plot thickens ; I have thrown the shell ; it will explode , I think , in eight-and-forty hours , and should scatter these good folks amazingly .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 5]: We shall see ! '
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 43]: He went to bed and fell asleep , but had not slept long when he started up and thought that Hugh was at the outer door , calling in a strange voice , very different from his own , to be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 69]: The delusion was so strong upon him , and was so full of that vague terror of the night in which such visions have their being , that he rose , and taking his sheathed sword in his hand , opened the door , and looked out upon the staircase , and towards the spot where Hugh had lain asleep ; and even spoke to him by name .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 36]: But all was dark and quiet , and creeping back to bed again , he fell , after an hour 's uneasy watching , into a second sleep , and woke no more till morning .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 31]: Chapter 29 The thoughts of worldly men are for ever regulated by a moral law of gravitation , which , like the physical one , holds them down to earth .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 22]: The bright glory of day , and the silent wonders of a starlit night , appeal to their minds in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 22]: There are no signs in the sun , or in the moon , or in the stars , for their reading .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 77]: They are like some wise men , who , learning to know each planet by its Latin name , have quite forgotten such small heavenly constellations as Charity , Forbearance , Universal Love , and Mercy , although they shine by night and day so brightly that the blind may see them ; and who , looking upward at the spangled sky , see nothing there but the reflection of their own great wisdom and book-learning .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 38]: It is curious to imagine these people of the world , busy in thought , turning their eyes towards the countless spheres that shine above us , and making them reflect the only images their minds contain .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 22]: The man who lives but in the breath of princes , has nothing his sight but stars for courtiers ' breasts .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 58]: The envious man beholds his neighbours ' honours even in the sky ; to the money-hoarder , and the mass of worldly folk , the whole great universe above glitters with sterling coin -- fresh from the mint -- stamped with the sovereign 's head -- coming always between them and heaven , turn where they may .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 23]: So do the shadows of our own desires stand between us and our better angels , and thus their brightness is eclipsed .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 29]: Everything was fresh and gay , as though the world were but that morning made , when Mr Chester rode at a tranquil pace along the Forest road .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 50]: Though early in the season , it was warm and genial weather ; the trees were budding into leaf , the hedges and the grass were green , the air was musical with songs of birds , and high above them all the lark poured out her richest melody .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 47]: In shady spots , the morning dew sparkled on each young leaf and blade of grass ; and where the sun was shining , some diamond drops yet glistened brightly , as in unwillingness to leave so fair a world , and have such brief existence .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 51]: Even the light wind , whose rustling was as gentle to the ear as softly-falling water , had its hope and promise ; and , leaving a pleasant fragrance in its track as it went fluttering by , whispered of its intercourse with Summer , and of his happy coming .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 67]: The solitary rider went glancing on among the trees , from sunlight into shade and back again , at the same even pace -- looking about him , certainly , from time to time , but with no greater thought of the day or the scene through which he moved , than that he was fortunate -LRB- being choicely dressed -RRB- to have such favourable weather .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 59]: He smiled very complacently at such times , but rather as if he were satisfied with himself than with anything else : and so went riding on , upon his chestnut cob , as pleasant to look upon as his own horse , and probably far less sensitive to the many cheerful influences by which he was surrounded .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 38]: In the course of time , the Maypole 's massive chimneys rose upon his view : but he quickened not his pace one jot , and with the same cool gravity rode up to the tavern porch .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 77]: John Willet , who was toasting his red face before a great fire in the bar , and who , with surpassing foresight and quickness of apprehension , had been thinking , as he looked at the blue sky , that if that state of things lasted much longer , it might ultimately become necessary to leave off fires and throw the windows open , issued forth to hold his stirrup ; calling lustily for Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 13]: ` Oh , you 're here , are you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 13]: said John , rather surprised by the quickness with which he appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 26]: ` Take this here valuable animal into the stable , and have more than particular care of him if you want to keep your place .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 16]: A mortal lazy fellow , sir ; he needs a deal of looking after . '
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 36]: ` But you have a son , ' returned Mr Chester , giving his bridle to Hugh as he dismounted , and acknowledging his salute by a careless motion of his hand towards his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 10]: ` Why do n't you make HIM useful ? '
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 32]: ` Why , the truth is , sir , ' replied John with great importance , ` that my son -- what , you 're a-listening are you , villain ? '
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 6]: ` Who 's listening ? '
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 5]: returned Hugh angrily . '
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 10]: A treat , indeed , to hear YOU speak !
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 13]: Would you have me take him in till he 's cool ? '
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 36]: ` Walk him up and down further off then , sir , ' cried old John , ` and when you see me and a noble gentleman entertaining ourselves with talk , keep your distance .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 66]: If you do n't know your distance , sir , ' added Mr Willet , after an enormously long pause , during which he fixed his great dull eyes on Hugh , and waited with exemplary patience for any little property in the way of ideas that might come to him , ` we 'll find a way to teach you , pretty soon . '
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 68]: Hugh shrugged his shoulders scornfully , and in his reckless swaggering way , crossed to the other side of the little green , and there , with the bridle slung loosely over his shoulder , led the horse to and fro , glancing at his master every now and then from under his bushy eyebrows , with as sinister an aspect as one would desire to see .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 43]: Mr Chester , who , without appearing to do so , had eyed him attentively during this brief dispute , stepped into the porch , and turning abruptly to Mr Willet , said , ` You keep strange servants , John . '
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 48]: ` Strange enough to look at , sir , certainly , ' answered the host ; ` but out of doors ; for horses , dogs , and the likes of that ; there a n't a better man in England than is that Maypole Hugh yonder .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 27]: He a n't fit for indoors , ' added Mr Willet , with the confidential air of a man who felt his own superior nature . '
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 58]: I do that ; but if that chap had only a little imagination , sir -- ' ` He 's an active fellow now , I dare swear , ' said Mr Chester , in a musing tone , which seemed to suggest that he would have said the same had there been nobody to hear him .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 6]: ` Active , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 15]: retorted John , with quite an expression in his face ; ` that chap !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 3]: Hallo there !
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 4]: You , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 31]: Bring that horse here , and go and hang my wig on the weathercock , to show this gentleman whether you 're one of the lively sort or not . '
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 76]: Hugh made no answer , but throwing the bridle to his master , and snatching his wig from his head , in a manner so unceremonious and hasty that the action discomposed Mr Willet not a little , though performed at his own special desire , climbed nimbly to the very summit of the maypole before the house , and hanging the wig upon the weathercock , sent it twirling round like a roasting jack .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 35]: Having achieved this performance , he cast it on the ground , and sliding down the pole with inconceivable rapidity , alighted on his feet almost as soon as it had touched the earth .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 52]: ` There , sir , ' said John , relapsing into his usual stolid state , ` you wo n't see that at many houses , besides the Maypole , where there 's good accommodation for man and beast -- nor that neither , though that with him is nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 27]: This last remark bore reference to his vaulting on horseback , as upon Mr Chester 's first visit , and quickly disappearing by the stable gate .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 62]: ` That with him is nothing , ' repeated Mr Willet , brushing his wig with his wrist , and inwardly resolving to distribute a small charge for dust and damage to that article of dress , through the various items of his guest 's bill ; ` he 'll get out of a ` most any winder in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 16]: There never was such a chap for flinging himself about and never hurting his bones .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 47]: It 's my opinion , sir , that it 's pretty nearly allowing to his not having any imagination ; and that if imagination could be -LRB- which it ca n't -RRB- knocked into him , he 'd never be able to do it any more .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 12]: But we was a-talking , sir , about my son . '
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 24]: ` True , Willet , true , ' said his visitor , turning again towards the landlord with his accustomed serenity of face .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 10]: ` My good friend , what about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 15]: It has been reported that Mr Willet , previously to making answer , winked .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 84]: But as he was never known to be guilty of such lightness of conduct either before or afterwards , this may be looked upon as a malicious invention of his enemies -- founded , perhaps , upon the undisputed circumstance of his taking his guest by the third breast button of his coat , counting downwards from the chin , and pouring his reply into his ear : ` Sir , ' whispered John , with dignity , ' I know my duty .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 12]: We want no love-making here , sir , unbeknown to parents .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 52]: I respect a certain young gentleman , taking him in the light of a young gentleman ; I respect a certain young lady , taking her in the light of a young lady ; but of the two as a couple , I have no knowledge , sir , none whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 12]: My son , sir , is upon his patrole . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 32]: I thought I saw him looking through the corner window but this moment , ' said Mr Chester , who naturally thought that being on patrole , implied walking about somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 12]: ` No doubt you did , sir , ' returned John .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 17]: ` He is upon his patrole of honour , sir , not to leave the premises .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 46]: Me and some friends of mine that use the Maypole of an evening , sir , considered what was best to be done with him , to prevent his doing anything unpleasant in opposing your desires ; and we 've put him on his patrole .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 29]: And what 's more , sir , he wo n't be off his patrole for a pretty long time to come , I can tell you that . '
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 69]: When he had communicated this bright idea , which had its origin in the perusal by the village cronies of a newspaper , containing , among other matters , an account of how some officer pending the sentence of some court-martial had been enlarged on parole , Mr Willet drew back from his guest 's ear , and without any visible alteration of feature , chuckled thrice audibly .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 84]: This nearest approach to a laugh in which he ever indulged -LRB- and that but seldom and only on extreme occasions -RRB- , never even curled his lip or effected the smallest change in -- no , not so much as a slight wagging of -- his great , fat , double chin , which at these times , as at all others , remained a perfect desert in the broad map of his face ; one changeless , dull , tremendous blank .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 71]: Lest it should be matter of surprise to any , that Mr Willet adopted this bold course in opposition to one whom he had often entertained , and who had always paid his way at the Maypole gallantly , it may be remarked that it was his very penetration and sagacity in this respect , which occasioned him to indulge in those unusual demonstrations of jocularity , just now recorded .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 37]: For Mr Willet , after carefully balancing father and son in his mental scales , had arrived at the distinct conclusion that the old gentleman was a better sort of a customer than the young one .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 73]: Throwing his landlord into the same scale , which was already turned by this consideration , and heaping upon him , again , his strong desires to run counter to the unfortunate Joe , and his opposition as a general principle to all matters of love and matrimony , it went down to the very ground straightway , and sent the light cause of the younger gentleman flying upwards to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 77]: Mr Chester was not the kind of man to be by any means dim-sighted to Mr Willet 's motives , but he thanked him as graciously as if he had been one of the most disinterested martyrs that ever shone on earth ; and leaving him , with many complimentary reliances on his great taste and judgment , to prepare whatever dinner he might deem most fitting the occasion , bent his steps towards the Warren .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 86]: Dressed with more than his usual elegance ; assuming a gracefulness of manner , which , though it was the result of long study , sat easily upon him and became him well ; composing his features into their most serene and prepossessing expression ; and setting in short that guard upon himself , at every point , which denoted that he attached no slight importance to the impression he was about to make ; he entered the bounds of Miss Haredale 's usual walk .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 23]: He had not gone far , or looked about him long , when he descried coming towards him , a female figure .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 32]: A glimpse of the form and dress as she crossed a little wooden bridge which lay between them , satisfied him that he had found her whom he desired to see .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 17]: He threw himself in her way , and a very few paces brought them close together .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 19]: He raised his hat from his head , and yielding the path , suffered her to pass him .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 37]: Then , as if the idea had but that moment occurred to him , he turned hastily back and said in an agitated voice : ' I beg pardon -- do I address Miss Haredale ? '
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 20]: She stopped in some confusion at being so unexpectedly accosted by a stranger ; and answered ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 24]: ` Something told me , ' he said , LOOKING a compliment to her beauty , ` that it could be no other .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 35]: Miss Haredale , I bear a name which is not unknown to you -- which it is a pride , and yet a pain to me to know , sounds pleasantly in your ears .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 12]: I am a man advanced in life , as you see .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 16]: I am the father of him whom you honour and distinguish above all other men .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 22]: May I for weighty reasons which fill me with distress , beg but a minute 's conversation with you here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 52]: Who that was inexperienced in deceit , and had a frank and youthful heart , could doubt the speaker 's truth -- could doubt it too , when the voice that spoke , was like the faint echo of one she knew so well , and so much loved to hear ?
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 16]: She inclined her head , and stopping , cast her eyes upon the ground . '
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 9]: A little more apart -- among these trees .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 19]: It is an old man 's hand , Miss Haredale ; an honest one , believe me . '
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 22]: She put hers in it as he said these words , and suffered him to lead her to a neighbouring seat .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 15]: ` You alarm me , sir , ' she said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 15]: ` You are not the bearer of any ill news , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 16]: ` Of none that you anticipate , ' he answered , sitting down beside her .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 8]: ` Edward is well -- quite well .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 20]: It is of him I wish to speak , certainly ; but I have no misfortune to communicate . '
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 23]: She bowed her head again , and made as though she would have begged him to proceed ; but said nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 16]: I am sensible that I speak to you at a disadvantage , dear Miss Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 30]: Believe me that I am not so forgetful of the feelings of my younger days as not to know that you are little disposed to view me with favour .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 47]: You have heard me described as cold-hearted , calculating , selfish -- ' ' I have never , sir , ' -- she interposed with an altered manner and a firmer voice ; ' I have never heard you spoken of in harsh or disrespectful terms .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 22]: You do a great wrong to Edward 's nature if you believe him capable of any mean or base proceeding . '
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 36]: ` Pardon me , my sweet young lady , but your uncle -- ' ` Nor is it my uncle 's nature either , ' she replied , with a heightened colour in her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 22]: ` It is not his nature to stab in the dark , nor is it mine to love such deeds . '
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 50]: She rose as she spoke , and would have left him ; but he detained her with a gentle hand , and besought her in such persuasive accents to hear him but another minute , that she was easily prevailed upon to comply , and so sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 38]: ` And it is , ' said Mr Chester , looking upward , and apostrophising the air ; ` it is this frank , ingenuous , noble nature , Ned , that you can wound so lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 9]: Shame -- shame upon you , boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 15]: She turned towards him quickly , and with a scornful look and flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 36]: There were tears in Mr Chester 's eyes , but he dashed them hurriedly away , as though unwilling that his weakness should be known , and regarded her with mingled admiration and compassion . '
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 30]: I never until now , ' he said , ` believed , that the frivolous actions of a young man could move me like these of my own son .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 25]: I never knew till now , the worth of a woman 's heart , which boys so lightly win , and lightly fling away .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 74]: Trust me , dear young lady , that I never until now did know your worth ; and though an abhorrence of deceit and falsehood has impelled me to seek you out , and would have done so had you been the poorest and least gifted of your sex , I should have lacked the fortitude to sustain this interview could I have pictured you to my imagination as you really are . '
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 56]: If Mrs Varden could have seen the virtuous gentleman as he said these words , with indignation sparkling from his eyes -- if she could have heard his broken , quavering voice -- if she could have beheld him as he stood bareheaded in the sunlight , and with unwonted energy poured forth his eloquence !
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 17]: With a haughty face , but pale and trembling too , Emma regarded him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 20]: She neither spoke nor moved , but gazed upon him as though she would look into his heart . '
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 32]: I throw off , ' said Mr Chester , ` the restraint which natural affection would impose on some men , and reject all bonds but those of truth and duty .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 21]: Miss Haredale , you are deceived ; you are deceived by your unworthy lover , and my unworthy son . '
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 15]: Still she looked at him steadily , and still said not one word . '
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 26]: I have ever opposed his professions of love for you ; you will do me the justice , dear Miss Haredale , to remember that .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 24]: Your uncle and myself were enemies in early life , and if I had sought retaliation , I might have found it here .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 30]: But as we grow older , we grow wiser -- bitter , I would fain hope -- and from the first , I have opposed him in this attempt .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 16]: I foresaw the end , and would have spared you , if I could . '
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 10]: ` Speak plainly , sir , ' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 10]: ` You deceive me , or are deceived yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 15]: I do not believe you -- I can not -- I should not . '
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 34]: ` First , ' said Mr Chester , soothingly , ` for there may be in your mind some latent angry feeling to which I would not appeal , pray take this letter .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 35]: It reached my hands by chance , and by mistake , and should have accounted to you -LRB- as I am told -RRB- for my son 's not answering some other note of yours .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 33]: God forbid , Miss Haredale , ' said the good gentleman , with great emotion , ` that there should be in your gentle breast one causeless ground of quarrel with him .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 18]: You should know , and you will see , that he was in no fault here . '
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 49]: There appeared something so very candid , so scrupulously honourable , so very truthful and just in this course something which rendered the upright person who resorted to it , so worthy of belief -- that Emma 's heart , for the first time , sunk within her .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 9]: She turned away and burst into tears . '
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 44]: I would , ' said Mr Chester , leaning over her , and speaking in mild and quite venerable accents ; ' I would , dear girl , it were my task to banish , not increase , those tokens of your grief .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 61]: My son , my erring son , -- I will not call him deliberately criminal in this , for men so young , who have been inconstant twice or thrice before , act without reflection , almost without a knowledge of the wrong they do , -- will break his plighted faith to you ; has broken it even now .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 25]: Shall I stop here , and having given you this warning , leave it to be fulfilled ; or shall I go on ? '
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 28]: ` You will go on , sir , ' she answered , ` and speak more plainly yet , in justice both to him and me . '
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 44]: ` My dear girl , ' said Mr Chester , bending over her more affectionately still ; ` whom I would call my daughter , but the Fates forbid , Edward seeks to break with you upon a false and most unwarrantable pretence .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 13]: I have it on his own showing ; in his own hand .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 37]: Forgive me , if I have had a watch upon his conduct ; I am his father ; I had a regard for your peace and his honour , and no better resource was left me .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 92]: There lies on his desk at this present moment , ready for transmission to you , a letter , in which he tells you that our poverty -- our poverty ; his and mine , Miss Haredale -- forbids him to pursue his claim upon your hand ; in which he offers , voluntarily proposes , to free you from your pledge ; and talks magnanimously -LRB- men do so , very commonly , in such cases -RRB- of being in time more worthy of your regard -- and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 75]: A letter , to be plain , in which he not only jilts you -- pardon the word ; I would summon to your aid your pride and dignity -- not only jilts you , I fear , in favour of the object whose slighting treatment first inspired his brief passion for yourself and gave it birth in wounded vanity , but affects to make a merit and a virtue of the act . '
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 42]: She glanced proudly at him once more , as by an involuntary impulse , and with a swelling breast rejoined , ` If what you say be true , he takes much needless trouble , sir , to compass his design .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 10]: He 's very tender of my peace of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 6]: I quite thank him . '
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 34]: ` The truth of what I tell you , dear young lady , ' he replied , ` you will test by the receipt or non-receipt of the letter of which I speak .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 26]: Haredale , my dear fellow , I am delighted to see you , although we meet under singular circumstances , and upon a melancholy occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 8]: I hope you are very well . '
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 49]: At these words the young lady raised her eyes , which were filled with tears ; and seeing that her uncle indeed stood before them , and being quite unequal to the trial of hearing or of speaking one word more , hurriedly withdrew , and left them .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 23]: They stood looking at each other , and at her retreating figure , and for a long time neither of them spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 6]: ` What does this mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 10]: Explain it , ' said Mr Haredale at length .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 12]: ` Why are you here , and why with her ? '
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 94]: ` My dear friend , ' rejoined the other , resuming his accustomed manner with infinite readiness , and throwing himself upon the bench with a weary air , ` you told me not very long ago , at that delightful old tavern of which you are the esteemed proprietor -LRB- and a most charming establishment it is for persons of rural pursuits and in robust health , who are not liable to take cold -RRB- , that I had the head and heart of an evil spirit in all matters of deception .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 15]: I thought at the time ; I really did think ; you flattered me .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 22]: But now I begin to wonder at your discernment , and vanity apart , do honestly believe you spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 10]: Did you ever counterfeit extreme ingenuousness and honest indignation ?
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 22]: My dear fellow , you have no conception , if you never did , how faint the effort makes one . '
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 11]: Mr Haredale surveyed him with a look of cold contempt .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 18]: ` You may evade an explanation , I know , ' he said , folding his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 7]: ` But I must have it .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 5]: I can wait . '
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 5]: ` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 8]: Not at all , my good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 19]: You shall not wait a moment , ' returned his friend , as he lazily crossed his legs .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 8]: ` The simplest thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 6]: It lies in a nutshell .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 34]: Ned has written her a letter -- a boyish , honest , sentimental composition , which remains as yet in his desk , because he has n't had the heart to send it .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 25]: I have taken a liberty , for which my parental affection and anxiety are a sufficient excuse , and possessed myself of the contents .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 32]: I have described them to your niece -LRB- a most enchanting person , Haredale ; quite an angelic creature -RRB- , with a little colouring and description adapted to our purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 4]: It 's done .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 6]: You may be quite easy .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 5]: It 's all over .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 40]: Deprived of their adherents and mediators ; her pride and jealousy roused to the utmost ; with nobody to undeceive her , and you to confirm me ; you will find that their intercourse will close with her answer .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 19]: If she receives Ned 's letter by to-morrow noon , you may date their parting from to-morrow night .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 11]: No thanks , I beg ; you owe me none .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 33]: I have acted for myself ; and if I have forwarded our compact with all the ardour even you could have desired , I have done so selfishly , indeed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 22]: I curse the compact , as you call it , with my whole heart and soul , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 9]: ` It was made in an evil hour .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 49]: I have bound myself to a lie ; I have leagued myself with you ; and though I did so with a righteous motive , and though it cost me such an effort as haply few men know , I hate and despise myself for the deed . '
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 16]: ` You are very warm , ' said Mr Chester with a languid smile . '
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 4]: I AM warm .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 7]: I am maddened by your coldness .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 53]: ` Death , Chester , if your blood ran warmer in your veins , and there were no restraints upon me , such as those that hold and drag me back -- well ; it is done ; you tell me so , and on such a point I may believe you .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 40]: When I am most remorseful for this treachery , I will think of you and your marriage , and try to justify myself in such remembrances , for having torn asunder Emma and your son , at any cost .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 12]: Our bond is cancelled now , and we may part . '
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 55]: Mr Chester kissed his hand gracefully ; and with the same tranquil face he had preserved throughout -- even when he had seen his companion so tortured and transported by his passion that his whole frame was shaken -- lay in his lounging posture on the seat and watched him as he walked away .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 61]: ` My scapegoat and my drudge at school , ' he said , raising his head to look after him ; ` my friend of later days , who could not keep his mistress when he had won her , and threw me in her way to carry off the prize ; I triumph in the present and the past .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 22]: Bark on , ill-favoured , ill-conditioned cur ; fortune has ever been with me -- I like to hear you . '
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 14]: The spot where they had met , was in an avenue of trees .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 14]: Mr Haredale not passing out on either hand , had walked straight on .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 46]: He chanced to turn his head when at some considerable distance , and seeing that his late companion had by that time risen and was looking after him , stood still as though he half expected him to follow and waited for his coming up .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 35]: ` It MAY come to that one day , but not yet , ' said Mr Chester , waving his hand , as though they were the best of friends , and turning away .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 6]: ` Not yet , Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 15]: Life is pleasant enough to me ; dull and full of heaviness to you .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 22]: To cross swords with such a man -- to indulge his humour unless upon extremity -- would be weak indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 29]: For all that , he drew his sword as he walked along , and in an absent humour ran his eye from hilt to point full twenty times .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 36]: But thoughtfulness begets wrinkles ; remembering this , he soon put it up , smoothed his contracted brow , hummed a gay tune with greater gaiety of manner , and was his unruffled self again .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 27]: Chapter 30 A homely proverb recognises the existence of a troublesome class of persons who , having an inch conceded them , will take an ell .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 91]: Not to quote the illustrious examples of those heroic scourges of mankind , whose amiable path in life has been from birth to death through blood , and fire , and ruin , and who would seem to have existed for no better purpose than to teach mankind that as the absence of pain is pleasure , so the earth , purged of their presence , may be deemed a blessed place -- not to quote such mighty instances , it will be sufficient to refer to old John Willet .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 49]: Old John having long encroached a good standard inch , full measure , on the liberty of Joe , and having snipped off a Flemish ell in the matter of the parole , grew so despotic and so great , that his thirst for conquest knew no bounds .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 13]: The more young Joe submitted , the more absolute old John became .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 7]: The ell soon faded into nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 75]: Yards , furlongs , miles arose ; and on went old John in the pleasantest manner possible , trimming off an exuberance in this place , shearing away some liberty of speech or action in that , and conducting himself in his small way with as much high mightiness and majesty , as the most glorious tyrant that ever had his statue reared in the public ways , of ancient or of modern times .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 150]: As great men are urged on to the abuse of power -LRB- when they need urging , which is not often -RRB- , by their flatterers and dependents , so old John was impelled to these exercises of authority by the applause and admiration of his Maypole cronies , who , in the intervals of their nightly pipes and pots , would shake their heads and say that Mr Willet was a father of the good old English sort ; that there were no new-fangled notions or modern ways in him ; that he put them in mind of what their fathers were when they were boys ; that there was no mistake about him ; that it would be well for the country if there were more like him , and more was the pity that there were not ; with many other original remarks of that nature .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 142]: Then they would condescendingly give Joe to understand that it was all for his good , and he would be thankful for it one day ; and in particular , Mr Cobb would acquaint him , that when he was his age , his father thought no more of giving him a parental kick , or a box on the ears , or a cuff on the head , or some little admonition of that sort , than he did of any other ordinary duty of life ; and he would further remark , with looks of great significance , that but for this judicious bringing up , he might have never been the man he was at that present speaking ; which was probable enough , as he was , beyond all question , the dullest dog of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 48]: In short , between old John and old John 's friends , there never was an unfortunate young fellow so bullied , badgered , worried , fretted , and brow-beaten ; so constantly beset , or made so tired of his life , as poor Joe Willet .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 85]: This had come to be the recognised and established state of things ; but as John was very anxious to flourish his supremacy before the eyes of Mr Chester , he did that day exceed himself , and did so goad and chafe his son and heir , that but for Joe 's having made a solemn vow to keep his hands in his pockets when they were not otherwise engaged , it is impossible to say what he might have done with them .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 27]: But the longest day has an end , and at length Mr Chester came downstairs to mount his horse , which was ready at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 47]: As old John was not in the way at the moment , Joe , who was sitting in the bar ruminating on his dismal fate and the manifold perfections of Dolly Varden , ran out to hold the guest 's stirrup and assist him to mount .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 36]: Mr Chester was scarcely in the saddle , and Joe was in the very act of making him a graceful bow , when old John came diving out of the porch , and collared him .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 18]: ` None of that , sir , ' said John , ` none of that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 5]: No breaking of patroles .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 14]: How dare you come out of the door , sir , without leave ?
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 21]: You 're trying to get away , sir , are you , and to make a traitor of yourself again ?
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 8]: What do you mean , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 33]: ` Let me go , father , ' said Joe , imploringly , as he marked the smile upon their visitor 's face , and observed the pleasure his disgrace afforded him .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 6]: ` This is too bad .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 7]: Who wants to get away ? '
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 8]: ` Who wants to get away ! '
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 6]: cried John , shaking him .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 10]: ` Why you do , sir , you do .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 55]: You 're the boy , sir , ' added John , collaring with one band , and aiding the effect of a farewell bow to the visitor with the other , ` that wants to sneak into houses , and stir up differences between noble gentlemen and their sons , are you , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 7]: Hold your tongue , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 7]: Joe made no effort to reply .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 9]: It was the crowning circumstance of his degradation .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 24]: He extricated himself from his father 's grasp , darted an angry look at the departing guest , and returned into the house .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 65]: ` But for her , ' thought Joe , as he threw his arms upon a table in the common room , and laid his head upon them , ` but for Dolly , who I could n't bear should think me the rascal they would make me out to be if I ran away , this house and I should part to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 38]: It being evening by this time , Solomon Daisy , Tom Cobb , and Long Parkes , were all in the common room too , and had from the window been witnesses of what had just occurred .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 27]: Mr Willet joining them soon afterwards , received the compliments of the company with great composure , and lighting his pipe , sat down among them .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 30]: ` We 'll see , gentlemen , ' said John , after a long pause , ` who 's the master of this house , and who is n't .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 18]: We 'll see whether boys are to govern men , or men are to govern boys . '
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 21]: ` And quite right too , ' assented Solomon Daisy with some approving nods ; ` quite right , Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 5]: Very good , Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 6]: Well said , Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 5]: Brayvo , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 48]: John slowly brought his eyes to bear upon him , looked at him for a long time , and finally made answer , to the unspeakable consternation of his hearers , ` When I want encouragement from you , sir , I 'll ask you for it .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 7]: You let me alone , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 10]: I can get on without you , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 13]: Do n't you tackle me , sir , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 22]: ` Do n't take it ill , Johnny ; I did n't mean any harm , ' pleaded the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 19]: ` Very good , sir , ' said John , more than usually obstinate after his late success .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: ` Never mind , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 21]: I can stand pretty firm of myself , sir , I believe , without being shored up by you . '
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 25]: And having given utterance to this retort , Mr Willet fixed his eyes upon the boiler , and fell into a kind of tobacco-trance .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 110]: The spirits of the company being somewhat damped by this embarrassing line of conduct on the part of their host , nothing more was said for a long time ; but at length Mr Cobb took upon himself to remark , as he rose to knock the ashes out of his pipe , that he hoped Joe would thenceforth learn to obey his father in all things ; that he had found , that day , he was not one of the sort of men who were to be trifled with ; and that he would recommend him , poetically speaking , to mind his eye for the future .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 28]: ` I 'd recommend you , in return , ' said Joe , looking up with a flushed face , ` not to talk to me . '
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 21]: ` Hold your tongue , sir , ' cried Mr Willet , suddenly rousing himself , and turning round . '
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 48]: I wo n't , father , ' cried Joe , smiting the table with his fist , so that the jugs and glasses rung again ; ` these things are hard enough to bear from you ; from anybody else I never will endure them any more .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 14]: Therefore I say , Mr Cobb , do n't talk to me . '
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 29]: ` Why , who are you , ' said Mr Cobb , sneeringly , ` that you 're not to be talked to , eh , Joe ? '
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 71]: To which Joe returned no answer , but with a very ominous shake of the head , resumed his old position , which he would have peacefully preserved until the house shut up at night , but that Mr Cobb , stimulated by the wonder of the company at the young man 's presumption , retorted with sundry taunts , which proved too much for flesh and blood to bear .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 77]: Crowding into one moment the vexation and the wrath of years , Joe started up , overturned the table , fell upon his long enemy , pummelled him with all his might and main , and finished by driving him with surprising swiftness against a heap of spittoons in one corner ; plunging into which , head foremost , with a tremendous crash , he lay at full length among the ruins , stunned and motionless .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 48]: Then , without waiting to receive the compliments of the bystanders on the victory be had won , he retreated to his own bedchamber , and considering himself in a state of siege , piled all the portable furniture against the door by way of barricade . '
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 24]: I have done it now , ' said Joe , as he sat down upon his bedstead and wiped his heated face . '
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 8]: I knew it would come at last .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 8]: The Maypole and I must part company .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 18]: I 'm a roving vagabond -- she hates me for evermore -- it 's all over ! '
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 50]: Chapter 31 Pondering on his unhappy lot , Joe sat and listened for a long time , expecting every moment to hear their creaking footsteps on the stairs , or to be greeted by his worthy father with a summons to capitulate unconditionally , and deliver himself up straightway .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 82]: But neither voice nor footstep came ; and though some distant echoes , as of closing doors and people hurrying in and out of rooms , resounding from time to time through the great passages , and penetrating to his remote seclusion , gave note of unusual commotion downstairs , no nearer sound disturbed his place of retreat , which seemed the quieter for these far-off noises , and was as dull and full of gloom as any hermit 's cell .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 7]: It came on darker and darker .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 116]: The old-fashioned furniture of the chamber , which was a kind of hospital for all the invalided movables in the house , grew indistinct and shadowy in its many shapes ; chairs and tables , which by day were as honest cripples as need be , assumed a doubtful and mysterious character ; and one old leprous screen of faded India leather and gold binding , which had kept out many a cold breath of air in days of yore and shut in many a jolly face , frowned on him with a spectral aspect , and stood at full height in its allotted corner , like some gaunt ghost who waited to be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 56]: A portrait opposite the window -- a queer , old grey-eyed general , in an oval frame -- seemed to wink and doze as the light decayed , and at length , when the last faint glimmering speck of day went out , to shut its eyes in good earnest , and fall sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 42]: There was such a hush and mystery about everything , that Joe could not help following its example ; and so went off into a slumber likewise , and dreamed of Dolly , till the clock of Chigwell church struck two .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 4]: Still nobody came .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 38]: The distant noises in the house had ceased , and out of doors all was quiet ; save for the occasional barking of some deep-mouthed dog , and the shaking of the branches by the night wind .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 52]: He gazed mournfully out of window at each well-known object as it lay sleeping in the dim light of the moon ; and creeping back to his former seat , thought about the late uproar , until , with long thinking of , it seemed to have occurred a month ago .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 83]: Thus , between dozing , and thinking , and walking to the window and looking out , the night wore away ; the grim old screen , and the kindred chairs and tables , began slowly to reveal themselves in their accustomed forms ; the grey-eyed general seemed to wink and yawn and rouse himself ; and at last he was broad awake again , and very uncomfortable and cold and haggard he looked , in the dull grey light of morning .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 48]: The sun had begun to peep above the forest trees , and already flung across the curling mist bright bars of gold , when Joe dropped from his window on the ground below , a little bundle and his trusty stick , and prepared to descend himself .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 44]: It was not a very difficult task ; for there were so many projections and gable ends in the way , that they formed a series of clumsy steps , with no greater obstacle than a jump of some few feet at last .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 34]: Joe , with his stick and bundle on his shoulder , quickly stood on the firm earth , and looked up at the old Maypole , it might be for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 13]: He did n't apostrophise it , for he was no great scholar .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 18]: He did n't curse it , for he had little ill-will to give to anything on earth .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 32]: He felt more affectionate and kind to it than ever he had done in all his life before , so said with all his heart , ` God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 9]: as a parting wish , and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 104]: He walked along at a brisk pace , big with great thoughts of going for a soldier and dying in some foreign country where it was very hot and sandy , and leaving God knows what unheard-of wealth in prize-money to Dolly , who would be very much affected when she came to know of it ; and full of such youthful visions , which were sometimes sanguine and sometimes melancholy , but always had her for their main point and centre , pushed on vigorously until the noise of London sounded in his ears , and the Black Lion hove in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 41]: It was only eight o'clock then , and very much astonished the Black Lion was , to see him come walking in with dust upon his feet at that early hour , with no grey mare to bear him company .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 73]: But as he ordered breakfast to be got ready with all speed , and on its being set before him gave indisputable tokens of a hearty appetite , the Lion received him , as usual , with a hospitable welcome ; and treated him with those marks of distinction , which , as a regular customer , and one within the freemasonry of the trade , he had a right to claim .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 82]: This Lion or landlord , -- for he was called both man and beast , by reason of his having instructed the artist who painted his sign , to convey into the features of the lordly brute whose effigy it bore , as near a counterpart of his own face as his skill could compass and devise , -- was a gentleman almost as quick of apprehension , and of almost as subtle a wit , as the mighty John himself .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 73]: But the difference between them lay in this : that whereas Mr Willet 's extreme sagacity and acuteness were the efforts of unassisted nature , the Lion stood indebted , in no small amount , to beer ; of which he swigged such copious draughts , that most of his faculties were utterly drowned and washed away , except the one great faculty of sleep , which he retained in surprising perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 95]: The creaking Lion over the house-door was , therefore , to say the truth , rather a drowsy , tame , and feeble lion ; and as these social representatives of a savage class are usually of a conventional character -LRB- being depicted , for the most part , in impossible attitudes and of unearthly colours -RRB- , he was frequently supposed by the more ignorant and uninformed among the neighbours , to be the veritable portrait of the host as he appeared on the occasion of some great funeral ceremony or public mourning .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 12]: ` What noisy fellow is that in the next room ? '
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 19]: said Joe , when he had disposed of his breakfast , and had washed and brushed himself . '
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 9]: A recruiting serjeant , ' replied the Lion .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 4]: Joe started involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 16]: Here was the very thing he had been dreaming of , all the way along .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 18]: ` And I wish , ' said the Lion , ` he was anywhere else but here .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 13]: The party make noise enough , but do n't call for much .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 14]: There 's great cry there , Mr Willet , but very little wool .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 11]: Your father would n't like 'em , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 7]: Perhaps not much under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 25]: Perhaps if he could have known what was passing at that moment in Joe 's mind , he would have liked them still less .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 13]: ` Is he recruiting for a -- for a fine regiment ? '
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 16]: said Joe , glancing at a little round mirror that hung in the bar . '
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 10]: I believe he is , ' replied the host .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 15]: ` It 's much the same thing , whatever regiment he 's recruiting for .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 27]: I 'm told there a n't a deal of difference between a fine man and another one , when they 're shot through and through . '
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 11]: ` They 're not all shot , ' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 12]: ` No , ' the Lion answered , ` not all .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 19]: Those that are -- supposing it 's done easy -- are the best off in my opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 13]: retorted Joe , ` but you do n't care for glory . '
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 5]: ` For what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 4]: said the Lion .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 4]: ` Glory . '
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 13]: ` No , ' returned the Lion , with supreme indifference . '
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 9]: You 're right in that , Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 28]: When Glory comes here , and calls for anything to drink and changes a guinea to pay for it , I 'll give it him for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 21]: It 's my belief , sir , that the Glory 's arms would n't do a very strong business . '
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 8]: These remarks were not at all comforting .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 16]: Joe walked out , stopped at the door of the next room , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 8]: The serjeant was describing a military life .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 19]: It was all drinking , he said , except that there were frequent intervals of eating and love-making .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 22]: A battle was the finest thing in the world -- when your side won it -- and Englishmen always did that .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 10]: ` Supposing you should be killed , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 8]: said a timid voice in one corner .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 19]: ` Well , sir , supposing you should be , ' said the serjeant , ` what then ?
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 52]: Your country loves you , sir ; his Majesty King George the Third loves you ; your memory is honoured , revered , respected ; everybody 's fond of you , and grateful to you ; your name 's wrote down at full length in a book in the War Office .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 17]: Damme , gentlemen , we must all die some time , or another , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 9]: The voice coughed , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 6]: Joe walked into the room .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 19]: A group of half-a-dozen fellows had gathered together in the taproom , and were listening with greedy ears .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 17]: One of them , a carter in a smockfrock , seemed wavering and disposed to enlist .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 37]: The rest , who were by no means disposed , strongly urged him to do so -LRB- according to the custom of mankind -RRB- , backed the serjeant 's arguments , and grinned among themselves . '
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 21]: I say nothing , boys , ' said the serjeant , who sat a little apart , drinking his liquor .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 21]: ` For lads of spirit ' -- here he cast an eye on Joe -- ` this is the time .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 8]: I do n't want to inveigle you .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 11]: The king 's not come to that , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 13]: Brisk young blood is what we want ; not milk and water .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 10]: We wo n't take five men out of six .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 7]: We want top-sawyers , we do .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 63]: I 'm not a-going to tell tales out of school , but , damme , if every gentleman 's son that carries arms in our corps , through being under a cloud and having little differences with his relations , was counted up ' -- here his eye fell on Joe again , and so good-naturedly , that Joe beckoned him out .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 4]: He came directly .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 11]: ` You 're a gentleman , by G -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 13]: was his first remark , as he slapped him on the back .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 8]: ` You 're a gentleman in disguise .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 10]: So am I. Let 's swear a friendship . '
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 22]: Joe did n't exactly do that , but he shook hands with him , and thanked him for his good opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 12]: ` You want to serve , ' said his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 4]: ` You shall .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 6]: You were made for it .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: You 're one of us by nature .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 8]: What 'll you take to drink ? '
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 13]: ` Nothing just now , ' replied Joe , smiling faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 11]: I have n't quite made up my mind . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 14]: A mettlesome fellow like you , and not made up his mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 4]: cried the serjeant .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 27]: ` Here -- let me give the bell a pull , and you 'll make up your mind in half a minute , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 38]: ` You 're right so far ' -- answered Joe , ` for if you pull the bell here , where I 'm known , there 'll be an end of my soldiering inclinations in no time .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 5]: Look in my face .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 9]: You see me , do you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 46]: I do , ' replied the serjeant with an oath , ` and a finer young fellow or one better qualified to serve his king and country , I never set my -- ' he used an adjective in this place -- ` eyes on .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 27]: ` Thank you , ' said Joe , ' I did n't ask you for want of a compliment , but thank you all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 12]: Do I look like a sneaking fellow or a liar ? '
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 47]: The serjeant rejoined with many choice asseverations that he did n't ; and that if his -LRB- the serjeant 's -RRB- own father were to say he did , he would run the old gentleman through the body cheerfully , and consider it a meritorious action .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 21]: Joe expressed his obligations , and continued , ` You can trust me then , and credit what I say .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 10]: I believe I shall enlist in your regiment to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 26]: The reason I do n't do so now is , because I do n't want until to-night , to do what I ca n't recall .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 10]: Where shall I find you , this evening ? '
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 52]: His friend replied with some unwillingness , and after much ineffectual entreaty having for its object the immediate settlement of the business , that his quarters would be at the Crooked Billet in Tower Street ; where he would be found waking until midnight , and sleeping until breakfast time to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 28]: ` And if I do come -- which it 's a million to one , I shall -- when will you take me out of London ? '
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 3]: demanded Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 15]: ` To-morrow morning , at half after eight o'clock , ' replied the serjeant .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 24]: ` You 'll go abroad -- a country where it 's all sunshine and plunder -- the finest climate in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 22]: ` To go abroad , ' said Joe , shaking hands with him , ` is the very thing I want .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 6]: You may expect me . '
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 29]: ` You 're the kind of lad for us , ' cried the serjeant , holding Joe 's hand in his , in the excess of his admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 10]: ` You 're the boy to push your fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 48]: I do n't say it because I bear you any envy , or would take away from the credit of the rise you 'll make , but if I had been bred and taught like you , I 'd have been a colonel by this time . '
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 6]: ` Tush , man ! '
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 12]: said Joe , ` I 'm not so young as that .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 22]: Needs must when the devil drives ; and the devil that drives me is an empty pocket and an unhappy home .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 7]: For the present , good-bye . '
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 7]: ` For king and country ! '
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 8]: cried the serjeant , flourishing his cap .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 7]: ` For bread and meat ! '
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 7]: cried Joe , snapping his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 5]: And so they parted .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 45]: He had very little money in his pocket ; so little indeed , that after paying for his breakfast -LRB- which he was too honest and perhaps too proud to score up to his father 's charge -RRB- he had but a penny left .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 52]: He had courage , notwithstanding , to resist all the affectionate importunities of the serjeant , who waylaid him at the door with many protestations of eternal friendship , and did in particular request that he would do him the favour to accept of only one shilling as a temporary accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 66]: Rejecting his offers both of cash and credit , Joe walked away with stick and bundle as before , bent upon getting through the day as he best could , and going down to the locksmith 's in the dusk of the evening ; for it should go hard , he had resolved , but he would have a parting word with charming Dolly Varden .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 32]: He went out by Islington and so on to Highgate , and sat on many stones and gates , but there were no voices in the bells to bid him turn .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 22]: Since the time of noble Whittington , fair flower of merchants , bells have come to have less sympathy with humankind .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 10]: They only ring for money and on state occasions .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 46]: Wanderers have increased in number ; ships leave the Thames for distant regions , carrying from stem to stern no other cargo ; the bells are silent ; they ring out no entreaties or regrets ; they are used to it and have grown worldly .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 41]: Joe bought a roll , and reduced his purse to the condition -LRB- with a difference -RRB- of that celebrated purse of Fortunatus , which , whatever were its favoured owner 's necessities , had one unvarying amount in it .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 26]: In these real times , when all the Fairies are dead and buried , there are still a great many purses which possess that quality .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 40]: The sum-total they contain is expressed in arithmetic by a circle , and whether it be added to or multiplied by its own amount , the result of the problem is more easily stated than any known in figures .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 6]: Evening drew on at last .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 37]: With the desolate and solitary feeling of one who had no home or shelter , and was alone utterly in the world for the first time , he bent his steps towards the locksmith 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 44]: He had delayed till now , knowing that Mrs Varden sometimes went out alone , or with Miggs for her sole attendant , to lectures in the evening ; and devoutly hoping that this might be one of her nights of moral culture .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 43]: He had walked up and down before the house , on the opposite side of the way , two or three times , when as he returned to it again , he caught a glimpse of a fluttering skirt at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 12]: It was Dolly 's -- to whom else could it belong ?
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 11]: no dress but hers had such a flow as that .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 17]: He plucked up his spirits , and followed it into the workshop of the Golden Key .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 10]: His darkening the door caused her to look round .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 4]: Oh that face !
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 24]: ` If it had n't been for that , ' thought Joe , ' I should never have walked into poor Tom Cobb .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 8]: She 's twenty times handsomer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 7]: She might marry a Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 6]: He did n't say this .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 10]: He only thought it -- perhaps looked it also .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 20]: Dolly was glad to see him , and was SO sorry her father and mother were away from home .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 11]: Joe begged she would n't mention it on any account .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 40]: Dolly hesitated to lead the way into the parlour , for there it was nearly dark ; at the same time she hesitated to stand talking in the workshop , which was yet light and open to the street .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 66]: They had got by some means , too , before the little forge ; and Joe having her hand in his -LRB- which he had no right to have , for Dolly only gave it him to shake -RRB- , it was so like standing before some homely altar being married , that it was the most embarrassing state of things in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 29]: I have come , ' said Joe , ` to say good-bye -- to say good-bye for I do n't know how many years ; perhaps for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 6]: I am going abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 11]: Now this was exactly what he should not have said .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 84]: Here he was , talking like a gentleman at large who was free to come and go and roam about the world at pleasure , when that gallant coachmaker had vowed but the night before that Miss Varden held him bound in adamantine chains ; and had positively stated in so many words that she was killing him by inches , and that in a fortnight more or thereabouts he expected to make a decent end and leave the business to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 10]: Dolly released her hand and said ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 27]: She remarked in the same breath that it was a fine night , and in short , betrayed no more emotion than the forge itself . '
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 16]: I could n't go , ' said Joe , ` without coming to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 8]: I had n't the heart to . '
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 18]: Dolly was more sorry than she could tell , that he should have taken so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 17]: It was such a long way , and he must have such a deal to do .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 19]: And how WAS Mr Willet -- that dear old gentleman -- ` Is this all you say ! '
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 3]: cried Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 2]: All !
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 9]: Good gracious , what did the man expect !
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 43]: She was obliged to take her apron in her hand and run her eyes along the hem from corner to corner , to keep herself from laughing in his face ; -- not because his gaze confused her -- not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 63]: Joe had small experience in love affairs , and had no notion how different young ladies are at different times ; he had expected to take Dolly up again at the very point where he had left her after that delicious evening ride , and was no more prepared for such an alteration than to see the sun and moon change places .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 38]: He had buoyed himself up all day with an indistinct idea that she would certainly say ` Do n't go , ' or ` Do n't leave us , ' or ` Why do you go ? '
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 9]: or ` Why do you leave us ? '
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 75]: or would give him some little encouragement of that sort ; he had even entertained the possibility of her bursting into tears , of her throwing herself into his arms , of her falling down in a fainting fit without previous word or sign ; but any approach to such a line of conduct as this , had been so far from his thoughts that he could only look at her in silent wonder .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 31]: Dolly in the meanwhile , turned to the corners of her apron , and measured the sides , and smoothed out the wrinkles , and was as silent as he .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 11]: At last after a long pause , Joe said good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 33]: ` Good-bye ' -- said Dolly -- with as pleasant a smile as if he were going into the next street , and were coming back to supper ; ` good-bye . '
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 26]: ` Come , ' said Joe , putting out both hands , ` Dolly , dear Dolly , do n't let us part like this .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 31]: I love you dearly , with all my heart and soul ; with as much truth and earnestness as ever man loved woman in this world , I do believe .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 40]: I am a poor fellow , as you know -- poorer now than ever , for I have fled from home , not being able to bear it any longer , and must fight my own way without help .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 24]: You are beautiful , admired , are loved by everybody , are well off and happy ; and may you ever be so !
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 17]: Heaven forbid I should ever make you otherwise ; but give me a word of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 6]: Say something kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 35]: I have no right to expect it of you , I know , but I ask it because I love you , and shall treasure the slightest word from you all through my life .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 13]: Dolly , dearest , have you nothing to say to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 12]: Dolly was a coquette by nature , and a spoilt child .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 13]: She had no notion of being carried by storm in this way .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 44]: The coachmaker would have been dissolved in tears , and would have knelt down , and called himself names , and clasped his hands , and beat his breast , and tugged wildly at his cravat , and done all kinds of poetry .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 9]: Joe had no business to be going abroad .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 11]: He had no right to be able to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 12]: If he was in adamantine chains , he could n't . '
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 12]: I have said good-bye , ' said Dolly , ` twice .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 16]: Take your arm away directly , Mr Joseph , or I 'll call Miggs . '
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 20]: ` I 'll not reproach you , ' answered Joe , ` it 's my fault , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 21]: I have thought sometimes that you did n't quite despise me , but I was a fool to think so .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 18]: Every one must , who has seen the life I have led -- you most of all .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 5]: God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 7]: He was gone , actually gone .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 68]: Dolly waited a little while , thinking he would return , peeped out at the door , looked up the street and down as well as the increasing darkness would allow , came in again , waited a little longer , went upstairs humming a tune , bolted herself in , laid her head down on her bed , and cried as if her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 61]: And yet such natures are made up of so many contradictions , that if Joe Willet had come back that night , next day , next week , next month , the odds are a hundred to one she would have treated him in the very same manner , and have wept for it afterwards with the very same distress .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 92]: She had no sooner left the workshop than there cautiously peered out from behind the chimney of the forge , a face which had already emerged from the same concealment twice or thrice , unseen , and which , after satisfying itself that it was now alone , was followed by a leg , a shoulder , and so on by degrees , until the form of Mr Tappertit stood confessed , with a brown-paper cap stuck negligently on one side of its head , and its arms very much a-kimbo .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 19]: ` Have my ears deceived me , ' said the ` prentice , ` or do I dream !
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 17]: am I to thank thee , Fortun ' , or to cus thee -- which ? '
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 36]: He gravely descended from his elevation , took down his piece of looking-glass , planted it against the wall upon the usual bench , twisted his head round , and looked closely at his legs .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 26]: ` If they 're a dream , ' said Sim , ` let sculptures have such wisions , and chisel 'em out when they wake .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 4]: This is reality .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 8]: Sleep has no such limbs as them .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 7]: Tremble , Willet , and despair .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 4]: She 's mine !
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 5]: She 's mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 33]: With these triumphant expressions , he seized a hammer and dealt a heavy blow at a vice , which in his mind 's eye represented the sconce or head of Joseph Willet .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 54]: That done , he burst into a peal of laughter which startled Miss Miggs even in her distant kitchen , and dipping his head into a bowl of water , had recourse to a jack-towel inside the closet door , which served the double purpose of smothering his feelings and drying his face .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 51]: Joe , disconsolate and down-hearted , but full of courage too , on leaving the locksmith 's house made the best of his way to the Crooked Billet , and there inquired for his friend the serjeant , who , expecting no man less , received him with open arms .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 68]: In the course of five minutes after his arrival at that house of entertainment , he was enrolled among the gallant defenders of his native land ; and within half an hour , was regaled with a steaming supper of boiled tripe and onions , prepared , as his friend assured him more than once , at the express command of his most Sacred Majesty the King .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 60]: To this meal , which tasted very savoury after his long fasting , he did ample justice ; and when he had followed it up , or down , with a variety of loyal and patriotic toasts , he was conducted to a straw mattress in a loft over the stable , and locked in there for the night .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 77]: The next morning , he found that the obliging care of his martial friend had decorated his hat with sundry particoloured streamers , which made a very lively appearance ; and in company with that officer , and three other military gentlemen newly enrolled , who were under a cloud so dense that it only left three shoes , a boot , and a coat and a half visible among them , repaired to the riverside .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 41]: Here they were joined by a corporal and four more heroes , of whom two were drunk and daring , and two sober and penitent , but each of whom , like Joe , had his dusty stick and bundle .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 47]: The party embarked in a passage-boat bound for Gravesend , whence they were to proceed on foot to Chatham ; the wind was in their favour , and they soon left London behind them , a mere dark mist -- a giant phantom in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 12]: Chapter 32 Misfortunes , saith the adage , never come singly .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 72]: There is little doubt that troubles are exceedingly gregarious in their nature , and flying in flocks , are apt to perch capriciously ; crowding on the heads of some poor wights until there is not an inch of room left on their unlucky crowns , and taking no more notice of others who offer as good resting-places for the soles of their feet , than if they had no existence .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 45]: It may have happened that a flight of troubles brooding over London , and looking out for Joseph Willet , whom they could n't find , darted down haphazard on the first young man that caught their fancy , and settled on him instead .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 46]: However this may be , certain it is that on the very day of Joe 's departure they swarmed about the ears of Edward Chester , and did so buzz and flap their wings , and persecute him , that he was most profoundly wretched .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 34]: It was evening , and just eight o'clock , when he and his father , having wine and dessert set before them , were left to themselves for the first time that day .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 33]: They had dined together , but a third person had been present during the meal , and until they met at table they had not seen each other since the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 6]: Edward was reserved and silent .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 50]: Mr Chester was more than usually gay ; but not caring , as it seemed , to open a conversation with one whose humour was so different , he vented the lightness of his spirit in smiles and sparkling looks , and made no effort to awaken his attention .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 43]: So they remained for some time : the father lying on a sofa with his accustomed air of graceful negligence ; the son seated opposite to him with downcast eyes , busied , it was plain , with painful and uneasy thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 29]: ` My dear Edward , ' said Mr Chester at length , with a most engaging laugh , ` do not extend your drowsy influence to the decanter .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 14]: Suffer THAT to circulate , let your spirits be never so stagnant . '
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 15]: Edward begged his pardon , passed it , and relapsed into his former state .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 23]: ` You do wrong not to fill your glass , ' said Mr Chester , holding up his own before the light .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 21]: ` Wine in moderation -- not in excess , for that makes men ugly -- has a thousand pleasant influences .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 28]: It brightens the eye , improves the voice , imparts a new vivacity to one 's thoughts and conversation : you should try it , Ned . '
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 5]: ` Ah father ! '
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 53]: cried his son , ` if -- ' ` My good fellow , ' interposed the parent hastily , as he set down his glass , and raised his eyebrows with a startled and horrified expression , ` for Heaven 's sake do n't call me by that obsolete and ancient name .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 6]: Have some regard for delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 28]: Am I grey , or wrinkled , do I go on crutches , have I lost my teeth , that you adopt such a mode of address ?
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 9]: Good God , how very coarse ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 36]: I was about to speak to you from my heart , sir , ' returned Edward , ` in the confidence which should subsist between us ; and you check me in the outset . '
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 27]: ` Now DO , Ned , DO not , ' said Mr Chester , raising his delicate hand imploringly , ` talk in that monstrous manner .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 7]: About to speak from your heart .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 45]: Do n't you know that the heart is an ingenious part of our formation -- the centre of the blood-vessels and all that sort of thing -- which has no more to do with what you say or think , than your knees have ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 10]: How can you be so very vulgar and absurd ?
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 13]: These anatomical allusions should be left to gentlemen of the medical profession .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 8]: They are really not agreeable in society .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 8]: You quite surprise me , Ned . '
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 16]: there are no such things to wound , or heal , or have regard for .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 18]: I know your creed , sir , and will say no more , ' returned his son .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 18]: ` There again , ' said Mr Chester , sipping his wine , ` you are wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 8]: I distinctly say there are such things .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 5]: We know there are .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 36]: The hearts of animals -- of bullocks , sheep , and so forth -- are cooked and devoured , as I am told , by the lower classes , with a vast deal of relish .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 48]: Men are sometimes stabbed to the heart , shot to the heart ; but as to speaking from the heart , or to the heart , or being warm-hearted , or cold-hearted , or broken-hearted , or being all heart , or having no heart -- pah !
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 8]: these things are nonsense , Ned . '
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 20]: ` No doubt , sir , ' returned his son , seeing that he paused for him to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 5]: ` No doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 24]: ` There 's Haredale 's niece , your late flame , ' said Mr Chester , as a careless illustration of his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 12]: ` No doubt in your mind she was all heart once .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 7]: Now she has none at all .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 12]: Yet she is the same person , Ned , exactly . '
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 26]: ` She is a changed person , sir , ' cried Edward , reddening ; ` and changed by vile means , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 12]: ` You have had a cool dismissal , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 4]: ` Poor Ned !
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 9]: I told you last night what would happen .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 10]: -- May I ask you for the nutcrackers ? '
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 22]: ` She has been tampered with , and most treacherously deceived , ' cried Edward , rising from his seat . '
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 22]: I never will believe that the knowledge of my real position , given her by myself , has worked this change .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 8]: I know she is beset and tortured .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 65]: But though our contract is at an end , and broken past all redemption ; though I charge upon her want of firmness and want of truth , both to herself and me ; I do not now , and never will believe , that any sordid motive , or her own unbiassed will , has led her to this course -- never ! '
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 40]: ` You make me blush , ' returned his father gaily , ` for the folly of your nature , in which -- but we never know ourselves -- I devoutly hope there is no reflection of my own .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 49]: With regard to the young lady herself , she has done what is very natural and proper , my dear fellow ; what you yourself proposed , as I learn from Haredale ; and what I predicted -- with no great exercise of sagacity -- she would do .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 19]: She supposed you to be rich , or at least quite rich enough ; and found you poor .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 37]: Marriage is a civil contract ; people marry to better their worldly condition and improve appearances ; it is an affair of house and furniture , of liveries , servants , equipage , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 17]: The lady being poor and you poor also , there is an end of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 18]: You can not enter upon these considerations , and have no manner of business with the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 19]: I drink her health in this glass , and respect and honour her for her extreme good sense .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 7]: It is a lesson to you .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 6]: Fill yours , Ned . '
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 44]: ` It is a lesson , ' returned his son , ` by which I hope I may never profit , and if years and experience impress it on -- ' ` Do n't say on the heart , ' interposed his father .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 26]: ` On men whom the world and its hypocrisy have spoiled , ' said Edward warmly , ` Heaven keep me from its knowledge . '
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 32]: ` Come , sir , ' returned his father , raising himself a little on the sofa , and looking straight towards him ; ` we have had enough of this .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 47]: Remember , if you please , your interest , your duty , your moral obligations , your filial affections , and all that sort of thing , which it is so very delightful and charming to reflect upon ; or you will repent it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 16]: I shall never repent the preservation of my self-respect , sir , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 47]: ` Forgive me if I say that I will not sacrifice it at your bidding , and that I will not pursue the track which you would have me take , and to which the secret share you have had in this late separation tends . '
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 78]: His father rose a little higher still , and looking at him as though curious to know if he were quite resolved and earnest , dropped gently down again , and said in the calmest voice -- eating his nuts meanwhile , ` Edward , my father had a son , who being a fool like you , and , like you , entertaining low and disobedient sentiments , he disinherited and cursed one morning after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 14]: The circumstance occurs to me with a singular clearness of recollection this evening .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 11]: I remember eating muffins at the time , with marmalade .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 32]: He led a miserable life -LRB- the son , I mean -RRB- and died early ; it was a happy release on all accounts ; he degraded the family very much .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 21]: It is a sad circumstance , Edward , when a father finds it necessary to resort to such strong measures .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 42]: ` It is , ' replied Edward , ` and it is sad when a son , proffering him his love and duty in their best and truest sense , finds himself repelled at every turn , and forced to disobey .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 33]: Dear father , ' he added , more earnestly though in a gentler tone , ' I have reflected many times on what occurred between us when we first discussed this subject .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 15]: Let there be a confidence between us ; not in terms , but truth .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 8]: Hear what I have to say . '
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 28]: ` As I anticipate what it is , and can not fail to do so , Edward , ' returned his father coldly , ' I decline .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 5]: I could n't possibly .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 22]: I am sure it would put me out of temper , which is a state of mind I ca n't endure .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 56]: If you intend to mar my plans for your establishment in life , and the preservation of that gentility and becoming pride , which our family have so long sustained -- if , in short , you are resolved to take your own course , you must take it , and my curse with it .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 13]: I am very sorry , but there 's really no alternative . '
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 21]: ` The curse may pass your lips , ' said Edward , ` but it will be but empty breath .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 53]: I do not believe that any man on earth has greater power to call one down upon his fellow -- least of all , upon his own child -- than he has to make one drop of rain or flake of snow fall from the clouds above us at his impious bidding .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 9]: Beware , sir , what you do . '
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 41]: ` You are so very irreligious , so exceedingly undutiful , so horribly profane , ' rejoined his father , turning his face lazily towards him , and cracking another nut , ` that I positively must interrupt you here .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 17]: It is quite impossible we can continue to go on , upon such terms as these .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 21]: If you will do me the favour to ring the bell , the servant will show you to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 11]: Return to this roof no more , I beg you .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 23]: Go , sir , since you have no moral sense remaining ; and go to the Devil , at my express desire .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 4]: Good day . '
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 20]: Edward left the room without another word or look , and turned his back upon the house for ever .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 32]: The father 's face was slightly flushed and heated , but his manner was quite unchanged , as he rang the bell again , and addressed the servant on his entrance .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 25]: ` Peak -- if that gentleman who has just gone out -- ' ' I beg your pardon , sir , Mr Edward ? '
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 15]: ` Were there more than one , dolt , that you ask the question ?
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 20]: -- If that gentleman should send here for his wardrobe , let him have it , do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 15]: If he should call himself at any time , I 'm not at home .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 12]: You 'll tell him so , and shut the door . '
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 27]: So , it soon got whispered about , that Mr Chester was very unfortunate in his son , who had occasioned him great grief and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 48]: And the good people who heard this and told it again , marvelled the more at his equanimity and even temper , and said what an amiable nature that man must have , who , having undergone so much , could be so placid and so calm .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 56]: And when Edward 's name was spoken , Society shook its head , and laid its finger on its lip , and sighed , and looked very grave ; and those who had sons about his age , waxed wrathful and indignant , and hoped , for Virtue 's sake , that he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 22]: And the world went on turning round , as usual , for five years , concerning which this Narrative is silent .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 40]: Chapter 33 One wintry evening , early in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty , a keen north wind arose as it grew dark , and night came on with black and dismal looks .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 25]: A bitter storm of sleet , sharp , dense , and icy-cold , swept the wet streets , and rattled on the trembling windows .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 42]: Signboards , shaken past endurance in their creaking frames , fell crashing on the pavement ; old tottering chimneys reeled and staggered in the blast ; and many a steeple rocked again that night , as though the earth were troubled .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 25]: It was not a time for those who could by any means get light and warmth , to brave the fury of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 34]: In coffee-houses of the better sort , guests crowded round the fire , forgot to be political , and told each other with a secret gladness that the blast grew fiercer every minute .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 57]: Each humble tavern by the water-side , had its group of uncouth figures round the hearth , who talked of vessels foundering at sea , and all hands lost ; related many a dismal tale of shipwreck and drowned men , and hoped that some they knew were safe , and shook their heads in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 85]: In private dwellings , children clustered near the blaze ; listening with timid pleasure to tales of ghosts and goblins , and tall figures clad in white standing by bed-sides , and people who had gone to sleep in old churches and being overlooked had found themselves alone there at the dead hour of the night : until they shuddered at the thought of the dark rooms upstairs , yet loved to hear the wind moan too , and hoped it would continue bravely .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 24]: From time to time these happy indoor people stopped to listen , or one held up his finger and cried ` Hark ! '
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 87]: and then , above the rumbling in the chimney , and the fast pattering on the glass , was heard a wailing , rushing sound , which shook the walls as though a giant 's hand were on them ; then a hoarse roar as if the sea had risen ; then such a whirl and tumult that the air seemed mad ; and then , with a lengthened howl , the waves of wind swept on , and left a moment 's interval of rest .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 18]: Cheerily , though there were none abroad to see it , shone the Maypole light that evening .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 51]: Blessings on the red -- deep , ruby , glowing red -- old curtain of the window ; blending into one rich stream of brightness , fire and candle , meat , drink , and company , and gleaming like a jovial eye upon the bleak waste out of doors !
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 34]: Within , what carpet like its crunching sand , what music merry as its crackling logs , what perfume like its kitchen 's dainty breath , what weather genial as its hearty warmth !
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 11]: Blessings on the old house , how sturdily it stood !
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 80]: How did the vexed wind chafe and roar about its stalwart roof ; how did it pant and strive with its wide chimneys , which still poured forth from their hospitable throats , great clouds of smoke , and puffed defiance in its face ; how , above all , did it drive and rattle at the casement , emulous to extinguish that cheerful glow , which would not be put down and seemed the brighter for the conflict !
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 15]: The profusion too , the rich and lavish bounty , of that goodly tavern !
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 32]: It was not enough that one fire roared and sparkled on its spacious hearth ; in the tiles which paved and compassed it , five hundred flickering fires burnt brightly also .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 23]: It was not enough that one red curtain shut the wild night out , and shed its cheerful influence on the room .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 57]: In every saucepan lid , and candlestick , and vessel of copper , brass , or tin that hung upon the walls , were countless ruddy hangings , flashing and gleaming with every motion of the blaze , and offering , let the eye wander where it might , interminable vistas of the same rich colour .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 23]: The old oak wainscoting , the beams , the chairs , the seats , reflected it in a deep , dull glimmer .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 28]: There were fires and red curtains in the very eyes of the drinkers , in their buttons , in their liquor , in the pipes they smoked .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 80]: Mr Willet sat in what had been his accustomed place five years before , with his eyes on the eternal boiler ; and had sat there since the clock struck eight , giving no other signs of life than breathing with a loud and constant snore -LRB- though he was wide awake -RRB- , and from time to time putting his glass to his lips , or knocking the ashes out of his pipe , and filling it anew .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 6]: It was now half-past ten .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 32]: Mr Cobb and long Phil Parkes were his companions , as of old , and for two mortal hours and a half , none of the company had pronounced one word .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 58]: Whether people , by dint of sitting together in the same place and the same relative positions , and doing exactly the same things for a great many years , acquire a sixth sense , or some unknown power of influencing each other which serves them in its stead , is a question for philosophy to settle .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 118]: But certain it is that old John Willet , Mr Parkes , and Mr Cobb , were one and all firmly of opinion that they were very jolly companions -- rather choice spirits than otherwise ; that they looked at each other every now and then as if there were a perpetual interchange of ideas going on among them ; that no man considered himself or his neighbour by any means silent ; and that each of them nodded occasionally when he caught the eye of another , as if he would say , ` You have expressed yourself extremely well , sir , in relation to that sentiment , and I quite agree with you . '
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 121]: The room was so very warm , the tobacco so very good , and the fire so very soothing , that Mr Willet by degrees began to doze ; but as he had perfectly acquired , by dint of long habit , the art of smoking in his sleep , and as his breathing was pretty much the same , awake or asleep , saving that in the latter case he sometimes experienced a slight difficulty in respiration -LRB- such as a carpenter meets with when he is planing and comes to a knot -RRB- , neither of his companions was aware of the circumstance , until he met with one of these impediments and was obliged to try again .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 14]: ` Johnny 's dropped off , ' said Mr Parkes in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 11]: ` Fast as a top , ' said Mr Cobb .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 44]: Neither of them said any more until Mr Willet came to another knot -- one of surpassing obduracy -- which bade fair to throw him into convulsions , but which he got over at last without waking , by an effort quite superhuman .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 11]: ` He sleeps uncommon hard , ' said Mr Cobb .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 84]: Mr Parkes , who was possibly a hard-sleeper himself , replied with some disdain , ` Not a bit on it ; ' and directed his eyes towards a handbill pasted over the chimney-piece , which was decorated at the top with a woodcut representing a youth of tender years running away very fast , with a bundle over his shoulder at the end of a stick , and -- to carry out the idea -- a finger-post and a milestone beside him .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 28]: Mr Cobb likewise turned his eyes in the same direction , and surveyed the placard as if that were the first time he had ever beheld it .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 95]: Now , this was a document which Mr Willet had himself indited on the disappearance of his son Joseph , acquainting the nobility and gentry and the public in general with the circumstances of his having left his home ; describing his dress and appearance ; and offering a reward of five pounds to any person or persons who would pack him up and return him safely to the Maypole at Chigwell , or lodge him in any of his Majesty 's jails until such time as his father should come and claim him .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 93]: In this advertisement Mr Willet had obstinately persisted , despite the advice and entreaties of his friends , in describing his son as a ` young boy ; ' and furthermore as being from eighteen inches to a couple of feet shorter than he really was ; two circumstances which perhaps accounted , in some degree , for its never having been productive of any other effect than the transmission to Chigwell at various times and at a vast expense , of some five-and-forty runaways varying from six years old to twelve .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 20]: Mr Cobb and Mr Parkes looked mysteriously at this composition , at each other , and at old John .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 35]: From the time he had pasted it up with his own hands , Mr Willet had never by word or sign alluded to the subject , or encouraged any one else to do so .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 38]: Nobody had the least notion what his thoughts or opinions were , connected with it ; whether he remembered it or forgot it ; whether he had any idea that such an event had ever taken place .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 32]: Therefore , even while he slept , no one ventured to refer to it in his presence ; and for such sufficient reasons , these his chosen friends were silent now .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 25]: Mr Willet had got by this time into such a complication of knots , that it was perfectly clear he must wake or die .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 11]: He chose the former alternative , and opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 23]: ` If he do n't come in five minutes , ' said John , ' I shall have supper without him . '
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 16]: The antecedent of this pronoun had been mentioned for the last time at eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 34]: Messrs Parkes and Cobb being used to this style of conversation , replied without difficulty that to be sure Solomon was very late , and they wondered what had happened to detain him .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 14]: ` He a n't blown away , I suppose , ' said Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 19]: ` It 's enough to carry a man of his figure off his legs , and easy too .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 5]: Do you hear it ?
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 7]: It blows great guns , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 25]: There 'll be many a crash in the Forest to-night , I reckon , and many a broken branch upon the ground to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 21]: ` It wo n't break anything in the Maypole , I take it , sir , ' returned old John .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 5]: ` Let it try .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 10]: I give it leave -- what 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 8]: ` The wind , ' cried Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 16]: ` It 's howling like a Christian , and has been all night long . '
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 27]: ` Did you ever , sir , ' asked John , after a minute 's contemplation , ` hear the wind say `` Maypole '' ? '
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 9]: ` Why , what man ever did ? '
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 3]: said Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 9]: ` Nor `` ahoy , '' perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 3]: added John .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 5]: Nor that neither . '
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 45]: ` Very good , sir , ' said Mr Willet , perfectly unmoved ; ` then if that was the wind just now , and you 'll wait a little time without speaking , you 'll hear it say both words very plain . '
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 5]: Mr Willet was right .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 47]: After listening for a few moments , they could clearly hear , above the roar and tumult out of doors , this shout repeated ; and that with a shrillness and energy , which denoted that it came from some person in great distress or terror .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 14]: They looked at each other , turned pale , and held their breath .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 4]: No man stirred .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 33]: It was in this emergency that Mr Willet displayed something of that strength of mind and plenitude of mental resource , which rendered him the admiration of all his friends and neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 78]: After looking at Messrs Parkes and Cobb for some time in silence , he clapped his two hands to his cheeks , and sent forth a roar which made the glasses dance and rafters ring -- a long-sustained , discordant bellow , that rolled onward with the wind , and startling every echo , made the night a hundred times more boisterous -- a deep , loud , dismal bray , that sounded like a human gong .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 60]: Then , with every vein in his head and face swollen with the great exertion , and his countenance suffused with a lively purple , he drew a little nearer to the fire , and turning his back upon it , said with dignity : ` If that 's any comfort to anybody , they 're welcome to it .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 11]: If it a n't , I 'm sorry for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 20]: If either of you two gentlemen likes to go out and see what 's the matter , you can .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 8]: I 'm not curious , myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 57]: While he spoke the cry drew nearer and nearer , footsteps passed the window , the latch of the door was raised , it opened , was violently shut again , and Solomon Daisy , with a lighted lantern in his hand , and the rain streaming from his disordered dress , dashed into the room .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 19]: A more complete picture of terror than the little man presented , it would be difficult to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 123]: The perspiration stood in beads upon his face , his knees knocked together , his every limb trembled , the power of articulation was quite gone ; and there he stood , panting for breath , gazing on them with such livid ashy looks , that they were infected with his fear , though ignorant of its occasion , and , reflecting his dismayed and horror-stricken visage , stared back again without venturing to question him ; until old John Willet , in a fit of temporary insanity , made a dive at his cravat , and , seizing him by that portion of his dress , shook him to and fro until his very teeth appeared to rattle in his head .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 21]: ` Tell us what 's the matter , sir , ' said John , ` or I 'll kill you .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 22]: Tell us what 's the matter , sir , or in another second I 'll have your head under the biler .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 7]: How dare you look like that ?
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 6]: Is anybody a-following of you ?
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 5]: What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 16]: Say something , or I 'll be the death of you , I will . '
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 79]: Mr Willet , in his frenzy , was so near keeping his word to the very letter -LRB- Solomon Daisy 's eyes already beginning to roll in an alarming manner , and certain guttural sounds , as of a choking man , to issue from his throat -RRB- , that the two bystanders , recovering in some degree , plucked him off his victim by main force , and placed the little clerk of Chigwell in a chair .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 47]: Directing a fearful gaze all round the room , he implored them in a faint voice to give him some drink ; and above all to lock the house-door and close and bar the shutters of the room , without a moment 's loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 57]: The latter request did not tend to reassure his hearers , or to fill them with the most comfortable sensations ; they complied with it , however , with the greatest expedition ; and having handed him a bumper of brandy-and-water , nearly boiling hot , waited to hear what he might have to tell them .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 15]: ` Oh , Johnny , ' said Solomon , shaking him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 5]: ` Oh , Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 5]: Oh , Tommy Cobb .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 8]: Why did I leave this house to-night !
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 20]: On the nineteenth of March -- of all nights in the year , on the nineteenth of March ! '
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 8]: They all drew closer to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 16]: Parkes , who was nearest to the door , started and looked over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 39]: Mr Willet , with great indignation , inquired what the devil he meant by that -- and then said , ` God forgive me , ' and glanced over his own shoulder , and came a little nearer .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 24]: ` When I left here to-night , ' said Solomon Daisy , ' I little thought what day of the month it was .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 18]: I have never gone alone into the church after dark on this day , for seven-and-twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 38]: I have heard it said that as we keep our birthdays when we are alive , so the ghosts of dead people , who are not easy in their graves , keep the day they died upon .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 7]: -- How the wind roars ! '
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 3]: Nobody spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 8]: All eyes were fastened on Solomon . '
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 20]: I might have known , ' he said , ` what night it was , by the foul weather .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 16]: There 's no such night in the whole year round as this is , always .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 14]: I never sleep quietly in my bed on the nineteenth of March . '
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 14]: ` Go on , ' said Tom Cobb , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 6]: ` Nor I neither . '
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 63]: Solomon Daisy raised his glass to his lips ; put it down upon the floor with such a trembling hand that the spoon tinkled in it like a little bell ; and continued thus : ` Have I ever said that we are always brought back to this subject in some strange way , when the nineteenth of this month comes round ?
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 16]: Do you suppose it was by accident , I forgot to wind up the church-clock ?
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 26]: I never forgot it at any other time , though it 's such a clumsy thing that it has to be wound up every day .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 14]: Why should it escape my memory on this day of all others ? '
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 57]: I made as much haste down there as I could when I went from here , but I had to go home first for the keys ; and the wind and rain being dead against me all the way , it was pretty well as much as I could do at times to keep my legs .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 14]: I got there at last , opened the church-door , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 21]: I had not met a soul all the way , and you may judge whether it was dull or not .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 8]: Neither of you would bear me company .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 18]: If you could have known what was to come , you 'd have been in the right .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 72]: ` The wind was so strong , that it was as much as I could do to shut the church-door by putting my whole weight against it ; and even as it was , it burst wide open twice , with such strength that any of you would have sworn , if you had been leaning against it , as I was , that somebody was pushing on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 36]: However , I got the key turned , went into the belfry , and wound up the clock -- which was very near run down , and would have stood stock-still in half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 28]: ` As I took up my lantern again to leave the church , it came upon me all at once that this was the nineteenth of March .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 43]: It came upon me with a kind of shock , as if a hand had struck the thought upon my forehead ; at the very same moment , I heard a voice outside the tower -- rising from among the graves . '
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 41]: Here old John precipitately interrupted the speaker , and begged that if Mr Parkes -LRB- who was seated opposite to him and was staring directly over his head -RRB- saw anything , he would have the goodness to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 55]: Mr Parkes apologised , and remarked that he was only listening ; to which Mr Willet angrily retorted , that his listening with that kind of expression in his face was not agreeable , and that if he could n't look like other people , he had better put his pocket-handkerchief over his head .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 26]: Mr Parkes with great submission pledged himself to do so , if again required , and John Willet turning to Solomon desired him to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 59]: After waiting until a violent gust of wind and rain , which seemed to shake even that sturdy house to its foundation , had passed away , the little man complied : ` Never tell me that it was my fancy , or that it was any other sound which I mistook for that I tell you of .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 12]: I heard the wind whistle through the arches of the church .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 8]: I heard the steeple strain and creak .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 12]: I heard the rain as it came driving against the walls .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 6]: I felt the bells shake .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 9]: I saw the ropes sway to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 7]: And I heard that voice . '
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 7]: ` What did it say ? '
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 5]: asked Tom Cobb . '
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 14]: I do n't know what ; I do n't know that it spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 46]: It gave a kind of cry , as any one of us might do , if something dreadful followed us in a dream , and came upon us unawares ; and then it died off : seeming to pass quite round the church . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 28]: I do n't see much in that , ' said John , drawing a long breath , and looking round him like a man who felt relieved .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 17]: ` Perhaps not , ' returned his friend , ` but that 's not all . '
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 16]: ` What more do you mean to say , sir , is to come ? '
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 15]: asked John , pausing in the act of wiping his face upon his apron .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 12]: ` What are you a-going to tell us of next ? '
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 6]: ` What I saw . '
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 4]: ` Saw ! '
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 7]: echoed all three , bending forward .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 90]: ` When I opened the church-door to come out , ' said the little man , with an expression of face which bore ample testimony to the sincerity of his conviction , ` when I opened the church-door to come out , which I did suddenly , for I wanted to get it shut again before another gust of wind came up , there crossed me -- so close , that by stretching out my finger I could have touched it -- something in the likeness of a man .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 7]: It was bare-headed to the storm .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 14]: It turned its face without stopping , and fixed its eyes on mine .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 9]: It was a ghost -- a spirit . '
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 4]: ` Whose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 6]: they all three cried together .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 51]: In the excess of his emotion -LRB- for he fell back trembling in his chair , and waved his hand as if entreating them to question him no further -RRB- , his answer was lost on all but old John Willet , who happened to be seated close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 4]: ` Who ! '
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 18]: cried Parkes and Tom Cobb , looking eagerly by turns at Solomon Daisy and at Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 6]: ` Who was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 18]: ` Gentlemen , ' said Mr Willet after a long pause , ` you need n't ask .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 7]: The likeness of a murdered man .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 8]: This is the nineteenth of March . '
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 5]: A profound silence ensued .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 26]: ` If you 'll take my advice , ' said John , ` we had better , one and all , keep this a secret .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 10]: Such tales would not be liked at the Warren .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 28]: Let us keep it to ourselves for the present time at all events , or we may get into trouble , and Solomon may lose his place .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 18]: Whether it was really as he says , or whether it was n't , is no matter .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 9]: Right or wrong , nobody would believe him .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 80]: As to the probabilities , I do n't myself think , ' said Mr Willet , eyeing the corners of the room in a manner which showed that , like some other philosophers , he was not quite easy in his theory , ` that a ghost as had been a man of sense in his lifetime , would be out a-walking in such weather -- I only know that I would n't , if I was one . '
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 90]: But this heretical doctrine was strongly opposed by the other three , who quoted a great many precedents to show that bad weather was the very time for such appearances ; and Mr Parkes -LRB- who had had a ghost in his family , by the mother 's side -RRB- argued the matter with so much ingenuity and force of illustration , that John was only saved from having to retract his opinion by the opportune appearance of supper , to which they applied themselves with a dreadful relish .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 65]: Even Solomon Daisy himself , by dint of the elevating influences of fire , lights , brandy , and good company , so far recovered as to handle his knife and fork in a highly creditable manner , and to display a capacity both of eating and drinking , such as banished all fear of his having sustained any lasting injury from his fright .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 36]: Supper done , they crowded round the fire again , and , as is common on such occasions , propounded all manner of leading questions calculated to surround the story with new horrors and surprises .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 53]: But Solomon Daisy , notwithstanding these temptations , adhered so steadily to his original account , and repeated it so often , with such slight variations , and with such solemn asseverations of its truth and reality , that his hearers were -LRB- with good reason -RRB- more astonished than at first .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 60]: As he took John Willet 's view of the matter in regard to the propriety of not bruiting the tale abroad , unless the spirit should appear to him again , in which case it would be necessary to take immediate counsel with the clergyman , it was solemnly resolved that it should be hushed up and kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 27]: And as most men like to have a secret to tell which may exalt their own importance , they arrived at this conclusion with perfect unanimity .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 26]: As it was by this time growing late , and was long past their usual hour of separating , the cronies parted for the night .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 32]: Solomon Daisy , with a fresh candle in his lantern , repaired homewards under the escort of long Phil Parkes and Mr Cobb , who were rather more nervous than himself .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 44]: Mr Willet , after seeing them to the door , returned to collect his thoughts with the assistance of the boiler , and to listen to the storm of wind and rain , which had not yet abated one jot of its fury .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 33]: Chapter 34 Before old John had looked at the boiler quite twenty minutes , he got his ideas into a focus , and brought them to bear upon Solomon Daisy 's story .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 33]: The more he thought of it , the more impressed he became with a sense of his own wisdom , and a desire that Mr Haredale should be impressed with it likewise .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 80]: At length , to the end that he might sustain a principal and important character in the affair ; and might have the start of Solomon and his two friends , through whose means he knew the adventure , with a variety of exaggerations , would be known to at least a score of people , and most likely to Mr Haredale himself , by breakfast-time to-morrow ; he determined to repair to the Warren before going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 48]: ` He 's my landlord , ' thought John , as he took a candle in his hand , and setting it down in a corner out of the wind 's way , opened a casement in the rear of the house , looking towards the stables .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 78]: ` We have n't met of late years so often as we used to do -- changes are taking place in the family -- it 's desirable that I should stand as well with them , in point of dignity , as possible -- the whispering about of this here tale will anger him -- it 's good to have confidences with a gentleman of his natur ' , and set one 's - self right besides .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 3]: Halloa there !
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 4]: Hugh -- Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 3]: Hal-loa ! '
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 51]: When he had repeated this shout a dozen times , and startled every pigeon from its slumbers , a door in one of the ruinous old buildings opened , and a rough voice demanded what was amiss now , that a man could n't even have his sleep in quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 20]: Have n't you sleep enough , growler , that you 're not to be knocked up for once ? '
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 16]: ` No , ' replied the voice , as the speaker yawned and shook himself .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 7]: ` Not half enough . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 40]: I do n't know how you CAN sleep , with the wind a bellowsing and roaring about you , making the tiles fly like a pack of cards , ' said John ; ` but no matter for that .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 24]: Wrap yourself up in something or another , and come here , for you must go as far as the Warren with me .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 7]: And look sharp about it . '
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 41]: Hugh , with much low growling and muttering , went back into his lair ; and presently reappeared , carrying a lantern and a cudgel , and enveloped from head to foot in an old , frowzy , slouching horse-cloth .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 46]: Mr Willet received this figure at the back-door , and ushered him into the bar , while he wrapped himself in sundry greatcoats and capes , and so tied and knotted his face in shawls and handkerchiefs , that how he breathed was a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 30]: ` You do n't take a man out of doors at near midnight in such weather , without putting some heart into him , do you , master ? '
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 13]: ` Yes I do , sir , ' returned Mr Willet . '
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 35]: I put the heart -LRB- as you call it -RRB- into him when he has brought me safe home again , and his standing steady on his legs a n't of so much consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 25]: So hold that light up , if you please , and go on a step or two before , to show the way . '
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 16]: Hugh obeyed with a very indifferent grace , and a longing glance at the bottles .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 40]: Old John , laying strict injunctions on his cook to keep the doors locked in his absence , and to open to nobody but himself on pain of dismissal , followed him into the blustering darkness out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 55]: The way was wet and dismal , and the night so black , that if Mr Willet had been his own pilot , he would have walked into a deep horsepond within a few hundred yards of his own house , and would certainly have terminated his career in that ignoble sphere of action .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 64]: But Hugh , who had a sight as keen as any hawk 's , and , apart from that endowment , could have found his way blindfold to any place within a dozen miles , dragged old John along , quite deaf to his remonstrances , and took his own course without the slightest reference to , or notice of , his master .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 83]: So they made head against the wind as they best could ; Hugh crushing the wet grass beneath his heavy tread , and stalking on after his ordinary savage fashion ; John Willet following at arm 's length , picking his steps , and looking about him , now for bogs and ditches , and now for such stray ghosts as might be wandering abroad , with looks of as much dismay and uneasiness as his immovable face was capable of expressing .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 12]: At length they stood upon the broad gravel-walk before the Warren-house .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 15]: The building was profoundly dark , and none were moving near it save themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 37]: From one solitary turret-chamber , however , there shone a ray of light ; and towards this speck of comfort in the cold , cheerless , silent scene , Mr Willet bade his pilot lead him .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 25]: ` The old room , ' said John , looking timidly upward ; ` Mr Reuben 's own apartment , God be with us !
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 20]: I wonder his brother likes to sit there , so late at night -- on this night too . '
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 10]: ` Why , where else should he sit ? '
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 26]: asked Hugh , holding the lantern to his breast , to keep the candle from the wind , while he trimmed it with his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 11]: ` It 's snug enough , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 4]: ` Snug ! '
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 4]: said John indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 14]: ` You have a comfortable idea of snugness , you have , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 14]: Do you know what was done in that room , you ruffian ? '
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 12]: ` Why , what is it the worse for that ! '
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 10]: cried Hugh , looking into John 's fat face .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 19]: ` Does it keep out the rain , and snow , and wind , the less for that ?
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 14]: Is it less warm or dry , because a man was killed there ?
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 6]: Never believe it , master .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 12]: One man 's no such matter as that comes to . '
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 50]: Mr Willet fixed his dull eyes on his follower , and began -- by a species of inspiration -- to think it just barely possible that he was something of a dangerous character , and that it might be advisable to get rid of him one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 42]: He was too prudent to say anything , with the journey home before him ; and therefore turned to the iron gate before which this brief dialogue had passed , and pulled the handle of the bell that hung beside it .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 47]: The turret in which the light appeared being at one corner of the building , and only divided from the path by one of the garden-walks , upon which this gate opened , Mr Haredale threw up the window directly , and demanded who was there .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 34]: ` Begging pardon , sir , ' said John , ' I knew you sat up late , and made bold to come round , having a word to say to you . '
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 8]: ` Willet -- is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 12]: ` Of the Maypole -- at your service , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 9]: Mr Haredale closed the window , and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 27]: He presently appeared at a door in the bottom of the turret , and coming across the garden-walk , unlocked the gate and let them in .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 9]: ` You are a late visitor , Willet .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 6]: What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 29]: ` Nothing to speak of , sir , ' said John ; ` an idle tale , I thought you ought to know of ; nothing more . '
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 16]: ` Let your man go forward with the lantern , and give me your hand .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 7]: The stairs are crooked and narrow .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 7]: Gently with your light , friend .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 8]: You swing it like a censer . '
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 33]: Hugh , who had already reached the turret , held it more steadily , and ascended first , turning round from time to time to shed his light downward on the steps .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 35]: Mr Haredale following next , eyed his lowering face with no great favour ; and Hugh , looking down on him , returned his glances with interest , as they climbed the winding stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 16]: It terminated in a little ante-room adjoining that from which they had seen the light .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 35]: Mr Haredale entered first , and led the way through it into the latter chamber , where he seated himself at a writing-table from which he had risen when they had rung the bell .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 20]: ` Come in , ' he said , beckoning to old John , who remained bowing at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 17]: ` Not you , friend , ' he added hastily to Hugh , who entered also .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 12]: ` Willet , why do you bring that fellow here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 40]: ` Why , sir , ' returned John , elevating his eyebrows , and lowering his voice to the tone in which the question had been asked him , ` he 's a good guard , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 22]: ` Do n't be too sure of that , ' said Mr Haredale , looking towards him as he spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 4]: I doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 7]: He has an evil eye . '
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 28]: ` There 's no imagination in his eye , ' returned Mr Willet , glancing over his shoulder at the organ in question , ` certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 15]: ` There is no good there , be assured , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 17]: ` Wait in that little room , friend , and close the door between us . '
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 36]: Hugh shrugged his shoulders , and with a disdainful look , which showed , either that he had overheard , or that he guessed the purport of their whispering , did as he was told .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 38]: When he was shut out , Mr Haredale turned to John , and bade him go on with what he had to say , but not to speak too loud , for there were quick ears yonder .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 50]: Thus cautioned , Mr Willet , in an oily whisper , recited all that he had heard and said that night ; laying particular stress upon his own sagacity , upon his great regard for the family , and upon his solicitude for their peace of mind and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 12]: The story moved his auditor much more than he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 56]: Mr Haredale often changed his attitude , rose and paced the room , returned again , desired him to repeat , as nearly as he could , the very words that Solomon had used , and gave so many other signs of being disturbed and ill at ease , that even Mr Willet was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 27]: ` You did quite right , ' he said , at the end of a long conversation , ` to bid them keep this story secret .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 20]: It is a foolish fancy on the part of this weak-brained man , bred in his fears and superstition .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 44]: But Miss Haredale , though she would know it to be so , would be disturbed by it if it reached her ears ; it is too nearly connected with a subject very painful to us all , to be heard with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 14]: You were most prudent , and have laid me under a great obligation .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 7]: I thank you very much . '
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 76]: This was equal to John 's most sanguine expectations ; but he would have preferred Mr Haredale 's looking at him when he spoke , as if he really did thank him , to his walking up and down , speaking by fits and starts , often stopping with his eyes fixed on the ground , moving hurriedly on again , like one distracted , and seeming almost unconscious of what he said or did .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 31]: This , however , was his manner ; and it was so embarrassing to John that he sat quite passive for a long time , not knowing what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 5]: At length he rose .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 29]: Mr Haredale stared at him for a moment as though he had quite forgotten his being present , then shook hands with him , and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 43]: Hugh , who was , or feigned to be , fast asleep on the ante-chamber floor , sprang up on their entrance , and throwing his cloak about him , grasped his stick and lantern , and prepared to descend the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 8]: ` Stay , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 7]: ` Will this man drink ? '
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 3]: ` Drink !
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 19]: He 'd drink the Thames up , if it was strong enough , sir , replied John Willet .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 10]: ` He 'll have something when he gets home .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 11]: He 's better without it , now , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 3]: ` Nay .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 10]: Half the distance is done , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 8]: ` What a hard master you are !
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 12]: I shall go home the better for one glassful , halfway .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 39]: As John made no reply , Mr Haredale brought out a glass of liquor , and gave it to Hugh , who , as he took it in his hand , threw part of it upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 18]: ` What do you mean by splashing your drink about a gentleman 's house , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 39]: ` I 'm drinking a toast , ' Hugh rejoined , holding the glass above his head , and fixing his eyes on Mr Haredale 's face ; ' a toast to this house and its master . '
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 25]: With that he muttered something to himself , and drank the rest , and setting down the glass , preceded them without another word .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 55]: John was a good deal scandalised by this observance , but seeing that Mr Haredale took little heed of what Hugh said or did , and that his thoughts were otherwise employed , he offered no apology , and went in silence down the stairs , across the walk , and through the garden-gate .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 64]: They stopped upon the outer side for Hugh to hold the light while Mr Haredale locked it on the inner ; and then John saw with wonder -LRB- as he often afterwards related -RRB- , that he was very pale , and that his face had changed so much and grown so haggard since their entrance , that he almost seemed another man .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 81]: They were in the open road again , and John Willet was walking on behind his escort , as he had come , thinking very steadily of what be had just now seen , when Hugh drew him suddenly aside , and almost at the same instant three horsemen swept past -- the nearest brushed his shoulder even then -- who , checking their steeds as suddenly as they could , stood still , and waited for their coming up .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 97]: Chapter 35 When John Willet saw that the horsemen wheeled smartly round , and drew up three abreast in the narrow road , waiting for him and his man to join them , it occurred to him with unusual precipitation that they must be highwaymen ; and had Hugh been armed with a blunderbuss , in place of his stout cudgel , he would certainly have ordered him to fire it off at a venture , and would , while the word of command was obeyed , have consulted his own personal safety in immediate flight .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 45]: Under the circumstances of disadvantage , however , in which he and his guard were placed , he deemed it prudent to adopt a different style of generalship , and therefore whispered his attendant to address them in the most peaceable and courteous terms .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 63]: By way of acting up to the spirit and letter of this instruction , Hugh stepped forward , and flourishing his staff before the very eyes of the rider nearest to him , demanded roughly what he and his fellows meant by so nearly galloping over them , and why they scoured the king 's highway at that late hour of night .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 57]: The man whom be addressed was beginning an angry reply in the same strain , when be was checked by the horseman in the centre , who , interposing with an air of authority , inquired in a somewhat loud but not harsh or unpleasant voice : ` Pray , is this the London road ? '
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 15]: ` If you follow it right , it is , ' replied Hugh roughly .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 34]: ` Nay , brother , ' said the same person , ` you 're but a churlish Englishman , if Englishman you be -- which I should much doubt but for your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 13]: Your companion , I am sure , will answer me more civilly .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 8]: How say you , friend ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 14]: I say it IS the London road , sir , ' answered John .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 31]: ` And I wish , ' he added in a subdued voice , as he turned to Hugh , ` that you was in any other road , you vagabond .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 58]: Are you tired of your life , sir , that you go a-trying to provoke three great neck-or-nothing chaps , that could keep on running over us , back ` ards and for ` ards , till we was dead , and then take our bodies up behind 'em , and drown us ten miles off ? '
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 9]: ` How far is it to London ? '
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 5]: inquired the same speaker .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 23]: ` Why , from here , sir , ' answered John , persuasively , ` it 's thirteen very easy mile . '
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 41]: The adjective was thrown in , as an inducement to the travellers to ride away with all speed ; but instead of having the desired effect , it elicited from the same person , the remark , ` Thirteen miles !
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 7]: That 's a long distance ! '
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 10]: which was followed by a short pause of indecision .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 16]: ` Pray , ' said the gentleman , ` are there any inns hereabouts ? '
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 31]: At the word ` inns , ' John plucked up his spirit in a surprising manner ; his fears rolled off like smoke ; all the landlord stirred within him .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 34]: ` There are no inns , ' rejoined Mr Willet , with a strong emphasis on the plural number ; ` but there 's a Inn -- one Inn -- the Maypole Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 6]: That 's a Inn indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 12]: You wo n't see the like of that Inn often . '
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 8]: ` You keep it , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 7]: said the horseman , smiling . '
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 18]: I do , sir , ' replied John , greatly wondering how he had found this out .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 11]: ` And how far is the Maypole from here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 50]: ` About a mile ' -- John was going to add that it was the easiest mile in all the world , when the third rider , who had hitherto kept a little in the rear , suddenly interposed : ` And have you one excellent bed , landlord ?
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 2]: Hem !
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 33]: A bed that you can recommend -- a bed that you are sure is well aired -- a bed that has been slept in by some perfectly respectable and unexceptionable person ? '
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 20]: ` We do n't take in no tagrag and bobtail at our house , sir , ' answered John .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 45]: ` And as to the bed itself -- ' ` Say , as to three beds , ' interposed the gentleman who had spoken before ; ` for we shall want three if we stay , though my friend only speaks of one . '
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 51]: ` No , no , my lord ; you are too good , you are too kind ; but your life is of far too much importance to the nation in these portentous times , to be placed upon a level with one so useless and so poor as mine .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 15]: A great cause , my lord , a mighty cause , depends on you .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 15]: You are its leader and its champion , its advanced guard and its van .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 17]: It is the cause of our altars and our homes , our country and our faith .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 12]: Let ME sleep on a chair -- the carpet -- anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 11]: No one will repine if I take cold or fever .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 18]: Let John Grueby pass the night beneath the open sky -- no one will repine for HIM .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 54]: But forty thousand men of this our island in the wave -LRB- exclusive of women and children -RRB- rivet their eyes and thoughts on Lord George Gordon ; and every day , from the rising up of the sun to the going down of the same , pray for his health and vigour .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 26]: My lord , ' said the speaker , rising in his stirrups , ` it is a glorious cause , and must not be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 15]: My lord , it is a mighty cause , and must not be endangered .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 16]: My lord , it is a holy cause , and must not be deserted . '
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 20]: ` It IS a holy cause , ' exclaimed his lordship , lifting up his hat with great solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 4]: ` Amen . '
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 25]: ` John Grueby , ' said the long-winded gentleman , in a tone of mild reproof , ` his lordship said Amen . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 20]: I heard my lord , sir , ' said the man , sitting like a statue on his horse .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 11]: ` And do not YOU say Amen , likewise ? '
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 17]: To which John Grueby made no reply at all , but sat looking straight before him .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 12]: ` You surprise me , Grueby , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 80]: ` At a crisis like the present , when Queen Elizabeth , that maiden monarch , weeps within her tomb , and Bloody Mary , with a brow of gloom and shadow , stalks triumphant -- ' ` Oh , sir , ' cied the man , gruffly , ` where 's the use of talking of Bloody Mary , under such circumstances as the present , when my lord 's wet through , and tired with hard riding ?
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 53]: Let 's either go on to London , sir , or put up at once ; or that unfort ` nate Bloody Mary will have more to answer for -- and she 's done a deal more harm in her grave than she ever did in her lifetime , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 150]: By this time Mr Willet , who had never beard so many words spoken together at one time , or delivered with such volubility and emphasis as by the long-winded gentleman ; and whose brain , being wholly unable to sustain or compass them , had quite given itself up for lost ; recovered so far as to observe that there was ample accommodation at the Maypole for all the party : good beds ; neat wines ; excellent entertainment for man and beast ; private rooms for large and small parties ; dinners dressed upon the shortest notice ; choice stabling , and a lock-up coach-house ; and , in short , to run over such recommendatory scraps of language as were painted up on various portions of the building , and which in the course of some forty years he had learnt to repeat with tolerable correctness .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 44]: He was considering whether it was at all possible to insert any novel sentences to the same purpose , when the gentleman who had spoken first , turning to him of the long wind , exclaimed , ` What say you , Gashford ?
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 14]: Shall we tarry at this house he speaks of , or press forward ?
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 6]: You shall decide . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 69]: I would submit , my lord , then , ' returned the person he appealed to , in a silky tone , ` that your health and spirits -- so important , under Providence , to our great cause , our pure and truthful cause ' -- here his lordship pulled off his hat again , though it was raining hard -- ` require refreshment and repose . '
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 27]: ` Go on before , landlord , and show the way , ' said Lord George Gordon ; ` we will follow at a footpace . '
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 34]: ` If you 'll give me leave , my lord , ' said John Grueby , in a low voice , ` I 'll change my proper place , and ride before you .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 25]: The looks of the landlord 's friend are not over honest , and it may be as well to be cautious with him . '
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 16]: ` John Grueby is quite right , ' interposed Mr Gashford , falling back hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 17]: ` My lord , a life so precious as yours must not be put in peril .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 9]: Go forward , John , by all means .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 16]: If you have any reason to suspect the fellow , blow his brains out . '
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 33]: John made no answer , but looking straight before him , as his custom seemed to be when the secretary spoke , bade Hugh push on , and followed close behind him .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 35]: Then came his lordship , with Mr Willet at his bridle rein ; and , last of all , his lordship 's secretary -- for that , it seemed , was Gashford 's office .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 41]: Hugh strode briskly on , often looking back at the servant , whose horse was close upon his heels , and glancing with a leer at his bolster case of pistols , by which he seemed to set great store .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 39]: He was a square-built , strong-made , bull-necked fellow , of the true English breed ; and as Hugh measured him with his eye , he measured Hugh , regarding him meanwhile with a look of bluff disdain .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 55]: He was much older than the Maypole man , being to all appearance five-and-forty ; but was one of those self-possessed , hard-headed , imperturbable fellows , who , if they are ever beaten at fisticuffs , or other kind of warfare , never know it , and go on coolly till they win .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 22]: ` If I led you wrong now , ' said Hugh , tauntingly , ` you 'd -- ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 13]: -- you 'd shoot me through the head , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 34]: John Grueby took no more notice of this remark than if he had been deaf and Hugh dumb ; but kept riding on quite comfortably , with his eyes fixed on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 18]: ` Did you ever try a fall with a man when you were young , master ? '
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 10]: ` Can you make any play at single-stick ? '
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 21]: John Grueby looked at him sideways with the same contented air , but deigned not a word in answer . '
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 5]: -- Like this ? '
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 21]: said Hugh , giving his cudgel one of those skilful flourishes , in which the rustic of that time delighted .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 5]: ` Whoop ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 28]: -- Or that , ' returned John Grueby , beating down his guard with his whip , and striking him on the head with its butt end .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 9]: ` Yes , I played a little once .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 22]: You wear your hair too long ; I should have cracked your crown if it had been a little shorter . '
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 35]: It was a pretty smart , loud-sounding rap , as it was , and evidently astonished Hugh ; who , for the moment , seemed disposed to drag his new acquaintance from his saddle .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 81]: But his face betokening neither malice , triumph , rage , nor any lingering idea that he had given him offence ; his eyes gazing steadily in the old direction , and his manner being as careless and composed as if he had merely brushed away a fly ; Hugh was so puzzled , and so disposed to look upon him as a customer of almost supernatural toughness , that he merely laughed , and cried ` Well done ! '
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 13]: then , sheering off a little , led the way in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 14]: Before the lapse of many minutes the party halted at the Maypole door .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 28]: Lord George and his secretary quickly dismounting , gave their horses to their servant , who , under the guidance of Hugh , repaired to the stables .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 50]: Right glad to escape from the inclemency of the night , they followed Mr Willet into the common room , and stood warming themselves and drying their clothes before the cheerful fire , while he busied himself with such orders and preparations as his guest 's high quality required .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 38]: As he bustled in and out of the room , intent on these arrangements , he had an opportunity of observing the two travellers , of whom , as yet , he knew nothing but the voice .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 64]: The lord , the great personage who did the Maypole so much honour , was about the middle height , of a slender make , and sallow complexion , with an aquiline nose , and long hair of a reddish brown , combed perfectly straight and smooth about his ears , and slightly powdered , but without the faintest vestige of a curl .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 30]: He was attired , under his greatcoat , in a full suit of black , quite free from any ornament , and of the most precise and sober cut .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 38]: The gravity of his dress , together with a certain lankness of cheek and stiffness of deportment , added nearly ten years to his age , but his figure was that of one not yet past thirty .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 53]: As he stood musing in the red glow of the fire , it was striking to observe his very bright large eye , which betrayed a restlessness of thought and purpose , singularly at variance with the studied composure and sobriety of his mien , and with his quaint and sad apparel .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 72]: It had nothing harsh or cruel in its expression ; neither had his face , which was thin and mild , and wore an air of melancholy ; but it was suggestive of an indefinable uneasiness ; which infected those who looked upon him , and filled them with a kind of pity for the man : though why it did so , they would have had some trouble to explain .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 18]: Gashford , the secretary , was taller , angularly made , high-shouldered , bony , and ungraceful .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 24]: His dress , in imitation of his superior , was demure and staid in the extreme ; his manner , formal and constrained .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 42]: This gentleman had an overhanging brow , great hands and feet and ears , and a pair of eyes that seemed to have made an unnatural retreat into his head , and to have dug themselves a cave to hide in .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 13]: His manner was smooth and humble , but very sly and slinking .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 37]: He wore the aspect of a man who was always lying in wait for something that WOULD N'T come to pass ; but he looked patient -- very patient -- and fawned like a spaniel dog .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 68]: Even now , while he warmed and rubbed his hands before the blaze , he had the air of one who only presumed to enjoy it in his degree as a commoner ; and though he knew his lord was not regarding him , he looked into his face from time to time , and with a meek and deferential manner , smiled as if for practice .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 45]: Such were the guests whom old John Willet , with a fixed and leaden eye , surveyed a hundred times , and to whom he now advanced with a state candlestick in each hand , beseeching them to follow him into a worthier chamber .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 75]: ` For my lord , ' said John -- it is odd enough , but certain people seem to have as great a pleasure in pronouncing titles as their owners have in wearing them -- ` this room , my lord , is n't at all the sort of place for your lordship , and I have to beg your lordship 's pardon for keeping you here , my lord , one minute . '
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 27]: With this address , John ushered them upstairs into the state apartment , which , like many other things of state , was cold and comfortless .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 39]: Their own footsteps , reverberating through the spacious room , struck upon their hearing with a hollow sound ; and its damp and chilly atmosphere was rendered doubly cheerless by contrast with the homely warmth they had deserted .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 35]: It was of no use , however , to propose a return to the place they had quitted , for the preparations went on so briskly that there was no time to stop them .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 131]: John , with the tall candlesticks in his hands , bowed them up to the fireplace ; Hugh , striding in with a lighted brand and pile of firewood , cast it down upon the hearth , and set it in a blaze ; John Grueby -LRB- who had a great blue cockade in his hat , which he appeared to despise mightily -RRB- brought in the portmanteau he had carried on his horse , and placed it on the floor ; and presently all three were busily engaged in drawing out the screen , laying the cloth , inspecting the beds , lighting fires in the bedrooms , expediting the supper , and making everything as cosy and as snug as might be , on so short a notice .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 47]: In less than an hour 's time , supper had been served , and ate , and cleared away ; and Lord George and his secretary , with slippered feet , and legs stretched out before the fire , sat over some hot mulled wine together .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 29]: ` So ends , my lord , ' said Gashford , filling his glass with great complacency , ` the blessed work of a most blessed day . '
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 16]: ` And of a blessed yesterday , ' said his lordship , raising his head .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 15]: -- and here the secretary clasped his hands -- ' a blessed yesterday indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 10]: The Protestants of Suffolk are godly men and true .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 33]: Though others of our countrymen have lost their way in darkness , even as we , my lord , did lose our road to-night , theirs is the light and glory . '
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 9]: ` Did I move them , Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 4]: said Lord George .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 7]: ` Move them , my lord !
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 3]: Move them !
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 37]: They cried to be led on against the Papists , they vowed a dreadful vengeance on their heads , they roared like men possessed -- ' ` But not by devils , ' said his lord .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 4]: ` By devils !
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 3]: my lord !
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 4]: By angels . '
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 40]: ` Yes -- oh surely -- by angels , no doubt , ' said Lord George , thrusting his hands into his pockets , taking them out again to bite his nails , and looking uncomfortably at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 10]: ` Of course by angels -- eh Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 11]: ` You do not doubt it , my lord ? '
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 4]: said the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 10]: ` No -- No , ' returned his lord .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 17]: I suppose it would be decidedly irreligious to doubt it -- would n't it , Gashford ?
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 24]: Though there certainly were , ' he added , without waiting for an answer , ` some plaguy ill-looking characters among them . '
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 153]: ` When you warmed , ' said the secretary , looking sharply at the other 's downcast eyes , which brightened slowly as he spoke ; ` when you warmed into that noble outbreak ; when you told them that you were never of the lukewarm or the timid tribe , and bade them take heed that they were prepared to follow one who would lead them on , though to the very death ; when you spoke of a hundred and twenty thousand men across the Scottish border who would take their own redress at any time , if it were not conceded ; when you cried `` Perish the Pope and all his base adherents ; the penal laws against them shall never be repealed while Englishmen have hearts and hands '' -- and waved your own and touched your sword ; and when they cried `` No Popery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 26]: and you cried `` No ; not even if we wade in blood , '' and they threw up their hats and cried `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 11]: not even if we wade in blood ; No Popery !
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 3]: Lord George !
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 36]: Down with the Papists -- Vengeance on their heads : '' when this was said and done , and a word from you , my lord , could raise or still the tumult -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 25]: then I felt what greatness was indeed , and thought , When was there ever power like this of Lord George Gordon 's ! '
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 7]: ` It 's a great power .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 4]: You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 7]: It is a great power ! '
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 6]: he cried with sparkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 14]: ` But -- dear Gashford -- did I really say all that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 7]: ` And how much more ! '
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 7]: cried the secretary , looking upwards .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 5]: how much more ! '
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 24]: ` And I told them what you say , about the one hundred and forty thousand men in Scotland , did I ! '
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 6]: he asked with evident delight .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 6]: ` That was bold . '
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 6]: ` Our cause is boldness .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 6]: Truth is always bold . '
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 3]: ` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 4]: So is religion .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 7]: She 's bold , Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 10]: ` The true religion is , my lord . '
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 30]: ` And that 's ours , ' he rejoined , moving uneasily in his seat , and biting his nails as though he would pare them to the quick .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 13]: ` There can be no doubt of ours being the true one .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 17]: You feel as certain of that as I do , Gashford , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 93]: ` Does my lord ask ME , ' whined Gashford , drawing his chair nearer with an injured air , and laying his broad flat hand upon the table ; ` ME , ' he repeated , bending the dark hollows of his eyes upon him with an unwholesome smile , ` who , stricken by the magic of his eloquence in Scotland but a year ago , abjured the errors of the Romish church , and clung to him as one whose timely hand had plucked me from a pit ? '
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 3]: ` True .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 4]: No -- No .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 31]: I -- I did n't mean it , ' replied the other , shaking him by the hand , rising from his seat , and pacing restlessly about the room .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 23]: ` It 's a proud thing to lead the people , Gashford , ' he added as he made a sudden halt .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 13]: ` By force of reason too , ' returned the pliant secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 7]: ` Ay , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 36]: They may cough and jeer , and groan in Parliament , and call me fool and madman , but which of them can raise this human sea and make it swell and roar at pleasure ?
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 4]: Not one . '
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 8]: ` Not one , ' repeated Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 42]: ` Which of them can say for his honesty , what I can say for mine ; which of them has refused a minister 's bribe of one thousand pounds a year , to resign his seat in favour of another ?
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 4]: Not one . '
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 21]: ` Not one , ' repeated Gashford again -- taking the lion 's share of the mulled wine between whiles .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 95]: ` And as we are honest , true , and in a sacred cause , Gashford , ' said Lord George with a heightened colour and in a louder voice , as he laid his fevered hand upon his shoulder , ` and are the only men who regard the mass of people out of doors , or are regarded by them , we will uphold them to the last ; and will raise a cry against these un-English Papists which shall re-echo through the country , and roll with a noise like thunder .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 21]: I will be worthy of the motto on my coat of arms , `` Called and chosen and faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 14]: ` Called , ' said the secretary , ` by Heaven . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 4]: I am . '
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 7]: ` Chosen by the people . '
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 6]: ` Faithful to both . '
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 6]: ` To the block ! '
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 62]: It would be difficult to convey an adequate idea of the excited manner in which he gave these answers to the secretary 's promptings ; of the rapidity of his utterance , or the violence of his tone and gesture ; in which , struggling through his Puritan 's demeanour , was something wild and ungovernable which broke through all restraint .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 27]: For some minutes he walked rapidly up and down the room , then stopping suddenly , exclaimed , ` Gashford -- YOU moved them yesterday too .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 3]: Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 5]: You did . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 24]: I shone with a reflected light , my lord , ' replied the humble secretary , laying his hand upon his heart . '
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 6]: I did my best . '
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 19]: ` You did well , ' said his master , ` and are a great and worthy instrument .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 39]: If you will ring for John Grueby to carry the portmanteau into my room , and will wait here while I undress , we will dispose of business as usual , if you 're not too tired . '
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 7]: ` Too tired , my lord !
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 7]: -- But this is his consideration !
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 7]: Christian from head to foot . '
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 25]: With which soliloquy , the secretary tilted the jug , and looked very hard into the mulled wine , to see how much remained .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 8]: John Willet and John Grueby appeared together .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 42]: The one bearing the great candlesticks , and the other the portmanteau , showed the deluded lord into his chamber ; and left the secretary alone , to yawn and shake himself , and finally to fall asleep before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 32]: ` Now , Mr Gashford sir , ' said John Grueby in his ear , after what appeared to him a moment of unconsciousness ; ` my lord 's abed . '
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 3]: ` Oh .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 11]: Very good , John , ' was his mild reply .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 6]: ` Thank you , John .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 5]: Nobody need sit up .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 7]: I know my room . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 31]: I hope you 're not a-going to trouble your head to-night , or my lord 's head neither , with anything more about Bloody Mary , ' said John . '
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 13]: I wish the blessed old creetur had never been born . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 15]: I said you might go to bed , John , ' returned the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 11]: ` You did n't hear me , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 59]: ` Between Bloody Marys , and blue cockades , and glorious Queen Besses , and no Poperys , and Protestant associations , and making of speeches , ' pursued John Grueby , looking , as usual , a long way off , and taking no notice of this hint , ` my lord 's half off his head .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 23]: When we go out o ' doors , such a set of ragamuffins comes a-shouting after us , `` Gordon forever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 14]: that I 'm ashamed of myself and do n't know where to look .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 71]: When we 're indoors , they come a-roaring and screaming about the house like so many devils ; and my lord instead of ordering them to be drove away , goes out into the balcony and demeans himself by making speeches to 'em , and calls 'em `` Men of England , '' and `` Fellow-countrymen , '' as if he was fond of 'em and thanked 'em for coming .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 34]: I ca n't make it out , but they 're all mixed up somehow or another with that unfort ` nate Bloody Mary , and call her name out till they 're hoarse .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 36]: They 're all Protestants too -- every man and boy among 'em : and Protestants are very fond of spoons , I find , and silver-plate in general , whenever area-gates is left open accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 62]: I wish that was the worst of it , and that no more harm might be to come ; but if you do n't stop these ugly customers in time , Mr Gashford -LRB- and I know you ; you 're the man that blows the fire -RRB- , you 'll find 'em grow a little bit too strong for you .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 37]: One of these evenings , when the weather gets warmer and Protestants are thirsty , they 'll be pulling London down , -- and I never heard that Bloody Mary went as far as THAT . '
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 16]: Gashford had vanished long ago , and these remarks had been bestowed on empty air .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 51]: Not at all discomposed by the discovery , John Grueby fixed his hat on , wrongside foremost that he might be unconscious of the shadow of the obnoxious cockade , and withdrew to bed ; shaking his head in a very gloomy and prophetic manner until he reached his chamber .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 41]: Chapter 36 Gashford , with a smiling face , but still with looks of profound deference and humility , betook himself towards his master 's room , smoothing his hair down as he went , and humming a psalm tune .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 17]: As he approached Lord George 's door , he cleared his throat and hummed more vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 28]: There was a remarkable contrast between this man 's occupation at the moment , and the expression of his countenance , which was singularly repulsive and malicious .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 29]: His beetling brow almost obscured his eyes ; his lip was curled contemptuously ; his very shoulders seemed to sneer in stealthy whisperings with his great flapped ears .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 12]: he muttered softly , as he peeped in at the chamber-door .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 7]: ` He seems to be asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 5]: Pray Heaven he is !
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 14]: Too much watching , too much care , too much thought -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 7]: Lord preserve him for a martyr !
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 16]: He is a saint , if ever saint drew breath on this bad earth . '
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 92]: Placing his light upon a table , he walked on tiptoe to the fire , and sitting in a chair before it with his back towards the bed , went on communing with himself like one who thought aloud : ` The saviour of his country and his country 's religion , the friend of his poor countrymen , the enemy of the proud and harsh ; beloved of the rejected and oppressed , adored by forty thousand bold and loyal English hearts -- what happy slumbers his should be ! '
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 34]: And here he sighed , and warmed his hands , and shook his head as men do when their hearts are full , and heaved another sigh , and warmed his hands again .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 6]: ` Why , Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 24]: said Lord George , who was lying broad awake , upon his side , and had been staring at him from his entrance .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 21]: ` My -- my lord , ' said Gashford , starting and looking round as though in great surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 7]: I have disturbed you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 7]: I have not been sleeping . '
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 5]: ` Not sleeping ! '
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 7]: he repeated , with assumed confusion .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 25]: ` What can I say for having in your presence given utterance to thoughts -- but they were sincere -- they were sincere ! '
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 27]: exclaimed the secretary , drawing his sleeve in a hasty way across his eyes ; ` and why should I regret your having heard them ? '
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 17]: ` Gashford , ' said the poor lord , stretching out his hand with manifest emotion .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 6]: ` Do not regret it .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 11]: You love me well , I know -- too well .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 8]: I do n't deserve such homage . '
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 16]: Gashford made no reply , but grasped the hand and pressed it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 72]: Then rising , and taking from the trunk a little desk , he placed it on a table near the fire , unlocked it with a key he carried in his pocket , sat down before it , took out a pen , and , before dipping it in the inkstand , sucked it -- to compose the fashion of his mouth perhaps , on which a smile was hovering yet .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 11]: ` How do our numbers stand since last enrolling-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 4]: inquired Lord George .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 26]: ` Are we really forty thousand strong , or do we still speak in round numbers when we take the Association at that amount ? '
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 24]: ` Our total now exceeds that number by a score and three , ' Gashford replied , casting his eyes upon his papers .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 5]: ` The funds ? '
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 17]: ` Not VERY improving ; but there is some manna in the wilderness , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 2]: Hem !
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 10]: On Friday night the widows ' mites dropped in .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 8]: `` Forty scavengers , three and fourpence .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 11]: An aged pew-opener of St Martin 's parish , sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 9]: A bell-ringer of the established church , sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 10]: A Protestant infant , newly born , one halfpenny .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 11]: The United Link Boys , three shillings -- one bad .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 10]: The anti-popish prisoners in Newgate , five and fourpence .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 7]: A friend in Bedlam , half-a-crown .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 9]: Dennis the hangman , one shilling . '' '
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 15]: ` That Dennis , ' said his lordship , ` is an earnest man .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 15]: I marked him in the crowd in Welbeck Street , last Friday . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 21]: A good man , ' rejoined the secretary , ' a staunch , sincere , and truly zealous man . '
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 11]: ` He should be encouraged , ' said Lord George .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 7]: ` Make a note of Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 7]: I 'll talk with him . '
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 20]: Gashford obeyed , and went on reading from his list : ' `` The Friends of Reason , half-a-guinea .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 7]: The Friends of Liberty , half-a-guinea .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 7]: The Friends of Peace , half-a-guinea .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 7]: The Friends of Charity , half-a-guinea .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 7]: The Friends of Mercy , half-a-guinea .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 9]: The Associated Rememberers of Bloody Mary , half-a-guinea .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 8]: The United Bulldogs , half-a-guinea . '' '
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 27]: ` The United Bulldogs , ' said Lord George , biting his nails most horribly , ` are a new society , are they not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 10]: ` Formerly the ` Prentice Knights , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 33]: The indentures of the old members expiring by degrees , they changed their name , it seems , though they still have ` prentices among them , as well as workmen . '
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 9]: ` What is their president 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 4]: inquired Lord George .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 16]: ` President , ' said Gashford , reading , ` Mr Simon Tappertit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 4]: I remember him .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 34]: The little man , who sometimes brings an elderly sister to our meetings , and sometimes another female too , who is conscientious , I have no doubt , but not well-favoured ? '
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 9]: ` The very same , my lord . '
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 14]: ` Tappertit is an earnest man , ' said Lord George , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 6]: ` Eh , Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 12]: ` One of the foremost among them all , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 11]: He snuffs the battle from afar , like the war-horse .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 27]: He throws his hat up in the street as if he were inspired , and makes most stirring speeches from the shoulders of his friends . '
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 13]: ` Make a note of Tappertit , ' said Lord George Gordon .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 12]: ` We may advance him to a place of trust . '
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 60]: ` That , ' rejoined the secretary , doing as he was told , ` is all -- except Mrs Varden 's box -LRB- fourteenth time of opening -RRB- , seven shillings and sixpence in silver and copper , and half-a-guinea in gold ; and Miggs -LRB- being the saving of a quarter 's wages -RRB- , one-and-threepence . '
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 8]: ` Miggs , ' said Lord George .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 7]: ` Is that a man ? '
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 18]: ` The name is entered on the list as a woman , ' replied the secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 39]: I think she is the tall spare female of whom you spoke just now , my lord , as not being well-favoured , who sometimes comes to hear the speeches -- along with Tappertit and Mrs Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 13]: ` Mrs Varden is the elderly lady then , is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 18]: The secretary nodded , and rubbed the bridge of his nose with the feather of his pen .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 12]: ` She is a zealous sister , ' said Lord George .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 13]: ` Her collection goes on prosperously , and is pursued with fervour .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 7]: Has her husband joined ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 13]: A malignant , ' returned the secretary , folding up his papers .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 6]: ` Unworthy such a wife .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 10]: He remains in outer darkness and steadily refuses . '
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 9]: ` The consequences be upon his own head !
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 4]: -- Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 5]: ` My lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 29]: ` You do n't think , ' he turned restlessly in his bed as he spoke , ` these people will desert me , when the hour arrives ?
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 13]: I have spoken boldly for them , ventured much , suppressed nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 10]: They 'll not fall off , will they ? '
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 46]: ` No fear of that , my lord , ' said Gashford , with a meaning look , which was rather the involuntary expression of his own thoughts than intended as any confirmation of his words , for the other 's face was turned away .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 11]: ` Be sure there is no fear of that . '
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 30]: ` Nor , ' he said with a more restless motion than before , ` of their -- but they CAN sustain no harm from leaguing for this purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 13]: Right is on our side , though Might may be against us .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 15]: You feel as sure of that as I -- honestly , you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 25]: The secretary was beginning with ` You do not doubt , ' when the other interrupted him , and impatiently rejoined : ` Doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 5]: Who says I doubt ?
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 80]: If I doubted , should I cast away relatives , friends , everything , for this unhappy country 's sake ; this unhappy country , ' he cried , springing up in bed , after repeating the phrase ` unhappy country 's sake ' to himself , at least a dozen times , ` forsaken of God and man , delivered over to a dangerous confederacy of Popish powers ; the prey of corruption , idolatry , and despotism !
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 5]: Who says I doubt ?
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 10]: Am I called , and chosen , and faithful ?
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 3]: Tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 9]: Am I , or am I not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 15]: ` To God , the country , and yourself , ' cried Gashford . '
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 3]: I am .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 4]: I will be .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 12]: I say again , I will be : to the block .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 5]: Who says as much !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 3]: Do you ?
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 6]: Does any man alive ? '
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 34]: The secretary drooped his head with an expression of perfect acquiescence in anything that had been said or might be ; and Lord George gradually sinking down upon his pillow , fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 61]: Although there was something very ludicrous in his vehement manner , taken in conjunction with his meagre aspect and ungraceful presence , it would scarcely have provoked a smile in any man of kindly feeling ; or even if it had , he would have felt sorry and almost angry with himself next moment , for yielding to the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 12]: This lord was sincere in his violence and in his wavering .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 24]: A nature prone to false enthusiasm , and the vanity of being a leader , were the worst qualities apparent in his composition .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 50]: All the rest was weakness -- sheer weakness ; and it is the unhappy lot of thoroughly weak men , that their very sympathies , affections , confidences -- all the qualities which in better constituted minds are virtues -- dwindle into foibles , or turn into downright vices .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 32]: Gashford , with many a sly look towards the bed , sat chuckling at his master 's folly , until his deep and heavy breathing warned him that he might retire .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 69]: Locking his desk , and replacing it within the trunk -LRB- but not before he had taken from a secret lining two printed handbills -RRB- , he cautiously withdrew ; looking back , as he went , at the pale face of the slumbering man , above whose head the dusty plumes that crowned the Maypole couch , waved drearily and sadly as though it were a bier .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 53]: Stopping on the staircase to listen that all was quiet , and to take off his shoes lest his footsteps should alarm any light sleeper who might be near at hand , he descended to the ground floor , and thrust one of his bills beneath the great door of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 37]: That done , he crept softly back to his own chamber , and from the window let another fall -- carefully wrapt round a stone to save it from the wind -- into the yard below .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 29]: They were addressed on the back ` To every Protestant into whose hands this shall come , ' and bore within what follows : ` Men and Brethren .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 25]: Whoever shall find this letter , will take it as a warning to join , without delay , the friends of Lord George Gordon .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 15]: There are great events at hand ; and the times are dangerous and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 14]: Read this carefully , keep it clean , and drop it somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 5]: For King and Country .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 3]: Union . '
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 16]: ` More seed , more seed , ' said Gashford as he closed the window .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 8]: ` When will the harvest come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 37]: Chapter 37 To surround anything , however monstrous or ridiculous , with an air of mystery , is to invest it with a secret charm , and power of attraction which to the crowd is irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 76]: False priests , false prophets , false doctors , false patriots , false prodigies of every kind , veiling their proceedings in mystery , have always addressed themselves at an immense advantage to the popular credulity , and have been , perhaps , more indebted to that resource in gaining and keeping for a time the upper hand of Truth and Common Sense , than to any half-dozen items in the whole catalogue of imposture .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 16]: Curiosity is , and has been from the creation of the world , a master-passion .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 40]: To awaken it , to gratify it by slight degrees , and yet leave something always in suspense , is to establish the surest hold that can be had , in wrong , on the unthinking portion of mankind .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 66]: If a man had stood on London Bridge , calling till he was hoarse , upon the passers-by , to join with Lord George Gordon , although for an object which no man understood , and which in that very incident had a charm of its own , -- the probability is , that he might have influenced a score of people in a month .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 114]: If all zealous Protestants had been publicly urged to join an association for the avowed purpose of singing a hymn or two occasionally , and hearing some indifferent speeches made , and ultimately of petitioning Parliament not to pass an act for abolishing the penal laws against Roman Catholic priests , the penalty of perpetual imprisonment denounced against those who educated children in that persuasion , and the disqualification of all members of the Romish church to inherit real property in the United Kingdom by right of purchase or descent , -- matters so far removed from the business and bosoms of the mass , might perhaps have called together a hundred people .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 247]: But when vague rumours got abroad , that in this Protestant association a secret power was mustering against the government for undefined and mighty purposes ; when the air was filled with whispers of a confederacy among the Popish powers to degrade and enslave England , establish an inquisition in London , and turn the pens of Smithfield market into stakes and cauldrons ; when terrors and alarms which no man understood were perpetually broached , both in and out of Parliament , by one enthusiast who did not understand himself , and bygone bugbears which had lain quietly in their graves for centuries , were raised again to haunt the ignorant and credulous ; when all this was done , as it were , in the dark , and secret invitations to join the Great Protestant Association in defence of religion , life , and liberty , were dropped in the public ways , thrust under the house-doors , tossed in at windows , and pressed into the hands of those who trod the streets by night ; when they glared from every wall , and shone on every post and pillar , so that stocks and stones appeared infected with the common fear , urging all men to join together blindfold in resistance of they knew not what , they knew not why ; -- then the mania spread indeed , and the body , still increasing every day , grew forty thousand strong .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 23]: So said , at least , in this month of March , 1780 , Lord George Gordon , the Association 's president .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 16]: Whether it was the fact or otherwise , few men knew or cared to ascertain .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 39]: It had never made any public demonstration ; had scarcely ever been heard of , save through him ; had never been seen ; and was supposed by many to be the mere creature of his disordered brain .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 67]: He was accustomed to talk largely about numbers of men -- stimulated , as it was inferred , by certain successful disturbances , arising out of the same subject , which had occurred in Scotland in the previous year ; was looked upon as a cracked-brained member of the lower house , who attacked all parties and sided with none , and was very little regarded .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 53]: It was known that there was discontent abroad -- there always is ; he had been accustomed to address the people by placard , speech , and pamphlet , upon other questions ; nothing had come , in England , of his past exertions , and nothing was apprehended from his present .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 99]: Just as he has come upon the reader , he had come , from time to time , upon the public , and been forgotten in a day ; as suddenly as he appears in these pages , after a blank of five long years , did he and his proceedings begin to force themselves , about this period , upon the notice of thousands of people , who had mingled in active life during the whole interval , and who , without being deaf or blind to passing events , had scarcely ever thought of him before .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 26]: ` My lord , ' said Gashford in his ear , as he drew the curtains of his bed betimes ; ` my lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 7]: ` Yes -- who 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 5]: What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 17]: ` The clock has struck nine , ' returned the secretary , with meekly folded hands .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 6]: ` You have slept well ?
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 7]: I hope you have slept well ?
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 12]: If my prayers are heard , you are refreshed indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 40]: ` To say the truth , I have slept so soundly , ' said Lord George , rubbing his eyes and looking round the room , ` that I do n't remember quite -- what place is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 5]: ` My lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 7]: cried Gashford , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 4]: returned his superior .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 9]: You 're not a Jew then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 4]: A Jew ! '
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 8]: exclaimed the pious secretary , recoiling . '
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 9]: I dreamed that we were Jews , Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 14]: You and I -- both of us -- Jews with long beards . '
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 7]: ` Heaven forbid , my lord !
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 9]: We might as well be Papists . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 13]: I suppose we might , ' returned the other , very quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 3]: ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 8]: You really think so , Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 16]: ` Surely I do , ' the secretary cried , with looks of great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 9]: ` Yes , that seems reasonable . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 10]: I hope my lord -- ' the secretary began .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 4]: ` Hope ! '
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 6]: he echoed , interrupting him .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 9]: ` Why do you say , you hope ?
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 11]: There 's no harm in thinking of such things . '
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 10]: ` Not in dreams , ' returned the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 4]: ` In dreams !
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 7]: No , nor waking either . '
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 40]: -- ' `` Called , and chosen , and faithful , '' ' said Gashford , taking up Lord George 's watch which lay upon a chair , and seeming to read the inscription on the seal , abstractedly .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 29]: It was the slightest action possible , not obtruded on his notice , and apparently the result of a moment 's absence of mind , not worth remark .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 26]: But as the words were uttered , Lord George , who had been going on impetuously , stopped short , reddened , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 50]: Apparently quite unconscious of this change in his demeanour , the wily Secretary stepped a little apart , under pretence of pulling up the window-blind , and returning when the other had had time to recover , said : ` The holy cause goes bravely on , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 9]: I was not idle , even last night .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 19]: I dropped two of the handbills before I went to bed , and both are gone this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 20]: Nobody in the house has mentioned the circumstance of finding them , though I have been downstairs full half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 31]: One or two recruits will be their first fruit , I predict ; and who shall say how many more , with Heaven 's blessing on your inspired exertions ! '
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 27]: ` It was a famous device in the beginning , ' replied Lord George ; ` an excellent device , and did good service in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 7]: It was quite worthy of you .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 28]: You remind me not to be a sluggard , Gashford , when the vineyard is menaced with destruction , and may be trodden down by Papist feet .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 8]: Let the horses be saddled in half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 8]: We must be up and doing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 28]: He said this with a heightened colour , and in a tone of such enthusiasm , that the secretary deemed all further prompting needless , and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 20]: -- ` Dreamed he was a Jew , ' he said thoughtfully , as he closed the bedroom door .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 10]: ` He may come to that before he dies .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 5]: It 's like enough .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 29]: After a time , and provided I lost nothing by it , I do n't see why that religion should n't suit me as well as any other .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 23]: There are rich men among the Jews ; shaving is very troublesome ; -- yes , it would suit me well enough .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 14]: For the present , though , we must be Christian to the core .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 17]: Our prophetic motto will suit all creeds in their turn , that 's a comfort . '
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 19]: Reflecting on this source of consolation , he reached the sitting-room , and rang the bell for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 40]: Lord George was quickly dressed -LRB- for his plain toilet was easily made -RRB- , and as he was no less frugal in his repasts than in his Puritan attire , his share of the meal was soon dispatched .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 67]: The secretary , however , more devoted to the good things of this world , or more intent on sustaining his strength and spirits for the sake of the Protestant cause , ate and drank to the last minute , and required indeed some three or four reminders from John Grueby , before he could resolve to tear himself away from Mr Willet 's plentiful providing .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 24]: At length he came downstairs , wiping his greasy mouth , and having paid John Willet 's bill , climbed into his saddle .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 74]: Lord George , who had been walking up and down before the house talking to himself with earnest gestures , mounted his horse ; and returning old John Willet 's stately bow , as well as the parting salutation of a dozen idlers whom the rumour of a live lord being about to leave the Maypole had gathered round the porch , they rode away , with stout John Grueby in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 36]: If Lord George Gordon had appeared in the eyes of Mr Willet , overnight , a nobleman of somewhat quaint and odd exterior , the impression was confirmed this morning , and increased a hundredfold .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 69]: Sitting bolt upright upon his bony steed , with his long , straight hair , dangling about his face and fluttering in the wind ; his limbs all angular and rigid , his elbows stuck out on either side ungracefully , and his whole frame jogged and shaken at every motion of his horse 's feet ; a more grotesque or more ungainly figure can hardly be conceived .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 83]: In lieu of whip , he carried in his hand a great gold-headed cane , as large as any footman carries in these days , and his various modes of holding this unwieldy weapon -- now upright before his face like the sabre of a horse-soldier , now over his shoulder like a musket , now between his finger and thumb , but always in some uncouth and awkward fashion -- contributed in no small degree to the absurdity of his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 77]: Stiff , lank , and solemn , dressed in an unusual manner , and ostentatiously exhibiting -- whether by design or accident -- all his peculiarities of carriage , gesture , and conduct , all the qualities , natural and artificial , in which he differed from other men ; he might have moved the sternest looker-on to laughter , and fully provoked the smiles and whispered jests which greeted his departure from the Maypole inn .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 82]: Quite unconscious , however , of the effect he produced , he trotted on beside his secretary , talking to himself nearly all the way , until they came within a mile or two of London , when now and then some passenger went by who knew him by sight , and pointed him out to some one else , and perhaps stood looking after him , or cried in jest or earnest as it might be , ` Hurrah Geordie !
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 4]: No Popery ! '
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 13]: At which he would gravely pull off his hat , and bow .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 47]: When they reached the town and rode along the streets , these notices became more frequent ; some laughed , some hissed , some turned their heads and smiled , some wondered who he was , some ran along the pavement by his side and cheered .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 35]: When this happened in a crush of carts and chairs and coaches , he would make a dead stop , and pulling off his hat , cry , ` Gentlemen , No Popery ! '
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 48]: to which the gentlemen would respond with lusty voices , and with three times three ; and then , on he would go again with a score or so of the raggedest , following at his horse 's heels , and shouting till their throats were parched .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 22]: The old ladies too -- there were a great many old ladies in the streets , and these all knew him .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 42]: Some of them -- not those of the highest rank , but such as sold fruit from baskets and carried burdens -- clapped their shrivelled hands , and raised a weazen , piping , shrill ` Hurrah , my lord . '
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 31]: Others waved their hands or handkerchiefs , or shook their fans or parasols , or threw up windows and called in haste to those within , to come and see .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 65]: All these marks of popular esteem , he received with profound gravity and respect ; bowing very low , and so frequently that his hat was more off his head than on ; and looking up at the houses as he passed along , with the air of one who was making a public entry , and yet was not puffed up or proud .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 33]: So they rode -LRB- to the deep and unspeakable disgust of John Grueby -RRB- the whole length of Whitechapel , Leadenhall Street , and Cheapside , and into St Paul 's Churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 37]: Arriving close to the cathedral , he halted ; spoke to Gashford ; and looking upward at its lofty dome , shook his head , as though he said , ` The Church in Danger ! '
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 30]: Then to be sure , the bystanders stretched their throats indeed ; and he went on again with mighty acclamations from the mob , and lower bows than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 56]: So along the Strand , up Swallow Street , into the Oxford Road , and thence to his house in Welbeck Street , near Cavendish Square , whither he was attended by a few dozen idlers ; of whom he took leave on the steps with this brief parting , ` Gentlemen , No Popery .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 3]: Good day .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 5]: God bless you . '
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 23]: This being rather a shorter address than they expected , was received with some displeasure , and cries of ' A speech !
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 4]: a speech ! '
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 61]: which might have been complied with , but that John Grueby , making a mad charge upon them with all three horses , on his way to the stables , caused them to disperse into the adjoining fields , where they presently fell to pitch and toss , chuck-farthing , odd or even , dog-fighting , and other Protestant recreations .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 58]: In the afternoon Lord George came forth again , dressed in a black velvet coat , and trousers and waistcoat of the Gordon plaid , all of the same Quaker cut ; and in this costume , which made him look a dozen times more strange and singular than before , went down on foot to Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 30]: Gashford , meanwhile , bestirred himself in business matters ; with which he was still engaged when , shortly after dusk , John Grueby entered and announced a visitor .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 10]: ` Let him come in , ' said Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 4]: come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 18]: growled John to somebody without ; ` You 're a Protestant , a n't you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 13]: I should think so , ' replied a deep , gruff voice .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 13]: ` You 've the looks of it , ' said John Grueby .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 12]: ` I 'd have known you for one , anywhere . '
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 16]: With which remark he gave the visitor admission , retired , and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 55]: The man who now confronted Gashford , was a squat , thickset personage , with a low , retreating forehead , a coarse shock head of hair , and eyes so small and near together , that his broken nose alone seemed to prevent their meeting and fusing into one of the usual size .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 39]: A dingy handkerchief twisted like a cord about his neck , left its great veins exposed to view , and they were swollen and starting , as though with gulping down strong passions , malice , and ill-will .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 48]: His dress was of threadbare velveteen -- a faded , rusty , whitened black , like the ashes of a pipe or a coal fire after a day 's extinction ; discoloured with the soils of many a stale debauch , and reeking yet with pot-house odours .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 42]: In lieu of buckles at his knees , he wore unequal loops of packthread ; and in his grimy hands he held a knotted stick , the knob of which was carved into a rough likeness of his own vile face .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 23]: Such was the visitor who doffed his three-cornered hat in Gashford 's presence , and waited , leering , for his notice .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 3]: Dennis ! '
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 4]: cried the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 6]: ` Sit down . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 59]: I see my lord down yonder -- ' cried the man , with a jerk of his thumb towards the quarter that he spoke of , ` and he says to me , says my lord , `` If you 've nothing to do , Dennis , go up to my house and talk with Muster Gashford . ''
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 11]: Of course I 'd nothing to do , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 7]: These a n't my working hours .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 18]: I was a-taking the air when I see my lord , that 's what I was doing .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 16]: I takes the air by night , as the howls does , Muster Gashford . '
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 9]: And sometimes in the day-time , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 16]: said the secretary -- ` when you go out in state , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 35]: roared the fellow , smiting his leg ; ` for a gentleman as ` ull say a pleasant thing in a pleasant way , give me Muster Gashford agin ' all London and Westminster !
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 19]: My lord a n't a bad ` un at that , but he 's a fool to you .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 14]: Ah to be sure , -- when I go out in state . '
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 18]: ` And have your carriage , ' said the secretary ; ` and your chaplain , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 8]: and all the rest of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 21]: ` You 'll be the death of me , ' cried Dennis , with another roar , ` you will .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 19]: But what 's in the wind now , Muster Gashford , ' he asked hoarsely , ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 19]: Are we to be under orders to pull down one of them Popish chapels -- or what ? '
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 14]: said the secretary , suffering the faintest smile to play upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 6]: God bless me , Dennis !
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 15]: We associate , you know , for strictly peaceable and lawful purposes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 30]: I know , bless you , ' returned the man , thrusting his tongue into his cheek ; ' I entered a ' purpose , did n't I ! '
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 12]: ` No doubt , ' said Gashford , smiling as before .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 47]: And when he said so , Dennis roared again , and smote his leg still harder , and falling into fits of laughter , wiped his eyes with the corner of his neckerchief , and cried , ` Muster Gashford agin ' all England hollow ! '
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 20]: ` Lord George and I were talking of you last night , ' said Gashford , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 11]: ` He says you are a very earnest fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 10]: ` So I am , ' returned the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 10]: ` And that you truly hate the Papists . '
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 16]: ` So I do , ' and he confirmed it with a good round oath .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 39]: ` Lookye here , Muster Gashford , ' said the fellow , laying his hat and stick upon the floor , and slowly beating the palm of one hand with the fingers of the other ; ` Ob-serve .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 17]: I 'm a constitutional officer that works for my living , and does my work creditable .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 9]: Do I , or do I not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 4]: ` Unquestionably . '
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 4]: ` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 4]: Stop a minute .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 13]: My work , is sound , Protestant , constitutional , English work .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 9]: Is it , or is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 9]: ` No man alive can doubt it . '
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 5]: ` Nor dead neither .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 46]: Parliament says this here -- says Parliament , `` If any man , woman , or child , does anything which goes again a certain number of our acts '' -- how many hanging laws may there be at this present time , Muster Gashford ?
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 4]: Fifty ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 27]: I do n't exactly know how many , ' replied Gashford , leaning back in his chair and yawning ; ' a great number though . '
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 6]: ` Well , say fifty .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 39]: Parliament says , `` If any man , woman , or child , does anything again any one of them fifty acts , that man , woman , or child , shall be worked off by Dennis . ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 28]: George the Third steps in when they number very strong at the end of a sessions , and says , `` These are too many for Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 137]: I 'll have half for myself and Dennis shall have half for himself ; '' and sometimes he throws me in one over that I do n't expect , as he did three year ago , when I got Mary Jones , a young woman of nineteen who come up to Tyburn with a infant at her breast , and was worked off for taking a piece of cloth off the counter of a shop in Ludgate Hill , and putting it down again when the shopman see her ; and who had never done any harm before , and only tried to do that , in consequence of her husband having been pressed three weeks previous , and she being left to beg , with two young children -- as was proved upon the trial .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 3]: -- Well !
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 24]: That being the law and the practice of England , is the glory of England , a n't it , Muster Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 8]: ` Certainly , ' said the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 51]: ` And in times to come , ' pursued the hangman , ` if our grandsons should think of their grandfathers ' times , and find these things altered , they 'll say , `` Those were days indeed , and we 've been going down hill ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 9]: Wo n't they , Muster Gashford ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 12]: I have no doubt they will , ' said the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 12]: ` Well then , look here , ' said the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 24]: ` If these Papists gets into power , and begins to boil and roast instead of hang , what becomes of my work !
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 34]: If they touch my work that 's a part of so many laws , what becomes of the laws in general , what becomes of the religion , what becomes of the country !
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 12]: -- Did you ever go to church , Muster Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 4]: ` Ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 12]: repeated the secretary with some indignation ; ` of course . '
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 52]: ` Well , ' said the ruffian , ` I 've been once -- twice , counting the time I was christened -- and when I heard the Parliament prayed for , and thought how many new hanging laws they made every sessions , I considered that I was prayed for .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 90]: Now mind , Muster Gashford , ' said the fellow , taking up his stick and shaking it with a ferocious air , ' I must n't have my Protestant work touched , nor this here Protestant state of things altered in no degree , if I can help it ; I must n't have no Papists interfering with me , unless they come to be worked off in course of law ; I must n't have no biling , no roasting , no frying -- nothing but hanging .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 10]: My lord may well call me an earnest fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 61]: In support of the great Protestant principle of having plenty of that , I 'll , ' and here he beat his club upon the ground , ` burn , fight , kill -- do anything you bid me , so that it 's bold and devilish -- though the end of it was , that I got hung myself .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 7]: -- There , Muster Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 49]: He appropriately followed up this frequent prostitution of a noble word to the vilest purposes , by pouring out in a kind of ecstasy at least a score of most tremendous oaths ; then wiped his heated face upon his neckerchief , and cried , ` No Popery !
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 11]: I 'm a religious man , by G -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 39]: Gashford had leant back in his chair , regarding him with eyes so sunken , and so shadowed by his heavy brows , that for aught the hangman saw of them , he might have been stone blind .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 44]: He remained smiling in silence for a short time longer , and then said , slowly and distinctly : ` You are indeed an earnest fellow , Dennis -- a most valuable fellow -- the staunchest man I know of in our ranks .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 18]: But you must calm yourself ; you must be peaceful , lawful , mild as any lamb .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 9]: I am sure you will be though . '
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 16]: ` Ay , ay , we shall see , Muster Gashford , we shall see .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 19]: You wo n't have to complain of me , ' returned the other , shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 23]: I am sure I shall not , ' said the secretary in the same mild tone , and with the same emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 35]: ` We shall have , we think , about next month , or May , when this Papist relief bill comes before the house , to convene our whole body for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 36]: My lord has thoughts of our walking in procession through the streets -- just as an innocent display of strength -- and accompanying our petition down to the door of the House of Commons . '
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 14]: ` The sooner the better , ' said Dennis , with another oath .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 65]: ` We shall have to draw up in divisions , our numbers being so large ; and , I believe I may venture to say , ' resumed Gashford , affecting not to hear the interruption , ` though I have no direct instructions to that effect -- that Lord George has thought of you as an excellent leader for one of these parties .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 12]: I have no doubt you would be an admirable one . '
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 14]: ` Try me , ' said the fellow , with an ugly wink .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 47]: ` You would be cool , I know , ' pursued the secretary , still smiling , and still managing his eyes so that he could watch him closely , and really not be seen in turn , ` obedient to orders , and perfectly temperate .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 14]: You would lead your party into no danger , I am certain . '
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 47]: ` I 'd lead them , Muster Gashford , ' -- the hangman was beginning in a reckless way , when Gashford started forward , laid his finger on his lips , and feigned to write , just as the door was opened by John Grueby .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 13]: said John , looking in ; ` here 's another Protestant . '
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 16]: ` Some other room , John , ' cried Gashford in his blandest voice . '
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 7]: I am engaged just now . '
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 41]: But John had brought this new visitor to the door , and he walked in unbidden , as the words were uttered ; giving to view the form and features , rough attire , and reckless air , of Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 55]: Chapter 38 The secretary put his hand before his eyes to shade them from the glare of the lamp , and for some moments looked at Hugh with a frowning brow , as if he remembered to have seen him lately , but could not call to mind where , or on what occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 31]: His uncertainty was very brief , for before Hugh had spoken a word , he said , as his countenance cleared up : ` Ay , ay , I recollect .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 12]: It 's quite right , John , you need n't wait .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 7]: Do n't go , Dennis . '
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 14]: ` Your servant , master , ' said Hugh , as Grueby disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 14]: ` Yours , friend , ' returned the secretary in his smoothest manner .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 6]: ` What brings YOU here ?
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 10]: We left nothing behind us , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 56]: Hugh gave a short laugh , and thrusting his hand into his breast , produced one of the handbills , soiled and dirty from lying out of doors all night , which he laid upon the secretary 's desk after flattening it upon his knee , and smoothing out the wrinkles with his heavy palm .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 7]: ` Nothing but that , master .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 10]: It fell into good hands , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 6]: ` What is this ! '
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 14]: said Gashford , turning it over with an air of perfectly natural surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 17]: ` Where did you get it from , my good fellow ; what does it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 9]: I do n't understand this at all . '
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 45]: A little disconcerted by this reception , Hugh looked from the secretary to Dennis , who had risen and was standing at the table too , observing the stranger by stealth , and seeming to derive the utmost satisfaction from his manners and appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 26]: Considering himself silently appealed to by this action , Mr Dennis shook his head thrice , as if to say of Gashford , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 10]: He do n't know anything at all about it .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 6]: I know he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 40]: I 'll take my oath he do n't ; ' and hiding his profile from Hugh with one long end of his frowzy neckerchief , nodded and chuckled behind this screen in extreme approval of the secretary 's proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 18]: ` It tells the man that finds it , to come here , do n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 3]: asked Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 23]: ` I 'm no scholar , myself , but I showed it to a friend , and he said it did . '
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 30]: ` It certainly does , ' said Gashford , opening his eyes to their utmost width ; ` really this is the most remarkable circumstance I have ever known .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 15]: How did you come by this piece of paper , my good friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 19]: ` Muster Gashford , ' wheezed the hangman under his breath , ` agin ' all Newgate ! '
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 38]: Whether Hugh heard him , or saw by his manner that he was being played upon , or perceived the secretary 's drift of himself , he came in his blunt way to the point at once .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 4]: ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 30]: he said , stretching out his hand and taking it back ; ` never mind the bill , or what it says , or what it do n't say .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 27]: You do n't know anything about it , master , -- no more do I , -- no more does he , ' glancing at Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 22]: ` None of us know what it means , or where it comes from : there 's an end of that .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 23]: Now I want to make one against the Catholics , I 'm a No-Popery man , and ready to be sworn in .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 10]: That 's what I 've come here for . '
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 16]: ` Put him down on the roll , Muster Gashford , ' said Dennis approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 22]: ` That 's the way to go to work -- right to the end at once , and no palaver . '
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 18]: ` What 's the use of shooting wide of the mark , eh , old boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 7]: ` My sentiments all over ! '
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 4]: rejoined the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 14]: ` This is the sort of chap for my division , Muster Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 6]: Down with him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 6]: Put him on the roll .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 28]: I 'd stand godfather to him , if he was to be christened in a bonfire , made of the ruins of the Bank of England . '
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 32]: With these and other expressions of confidence of the like flattering kind , Mr Dennis gave him a hearty slap on the back , which Hugh was not slow to return .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 7]: ` No Popery , brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 4]: cried the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 7]: ` No Property , brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 3]: responded Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 14]: ` Popery , Popery , ' said the secretary with his usual mildness .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 8]: ` It 's all the same ! '
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 3]: cried Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 6]: ` It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 7]: Down with him , Muster Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 8]: Down with everybody , down with everything !
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 6]: Hurrah for the Protestant religion !
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 11]: That 's the time of day , Muster Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 81]: The secretary regarded them both with a very favourable expression of countenance , while they gave loose to these and other demonstrations of their patriotic purpose ; and was about to make some remark aloud , when Dennis , stepping up to him , and shading his mouth with his hand , said , in a hoarse whisper , as he nudged him with his elbow : ` Do n't split upon a constitutional officer 's profession , Muster Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 15]: There are popular prejudices , you know , and he might n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 11]: Wait till he comes to be more intimate with me .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 12]: He 's a fine-built chap , a n't he ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 6]: A powerful fellow indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 69]: ` Did you ever , Muster Gashford , ' whispered Dennis , with a horrible kind of admiration , such as that with which a cannibal might regard his intimate friend , when hungry , -- ` did you ever -- and here he drew still closer to his ear , and fenced his mouth with both his open bands -- ` see such a throat as his ?
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 8]: Do but cast your eye upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 11]: There 's a neck for stretching , Muster Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 53]: The secretary assented to this proposition with the best grace he could assume -- it is difficult to feign a true professional relish : which is eccentric sometimes -- and after asking the candidate a few unimportant questions , proceeded to enrol him a member of the Great Protestant Association of England .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 92]: If anything could have exceeded Mr Dennis 's joy on the happy conclusion of this ceremony , it would have been the rapture with which he received the announcement that the new member could neither read nor write : those two arts being -LRB- as Mr Dennis swore -RRB- the greatest possible curse a civilised community could know , and militating more against the professional emoluments and usefulness of the great constitutional office he had the honour to hold , than any adverse circumstances that could present themselves to his imagination .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 68]: The enrolment being completed , and Hugh having been informed by Gashford , in his peculiar manner , of the peaceful and strictly lawful objects contemplated by the body to which he now belonged -- during which recital Mr Dennis nudged him very much with his elbow , and made divers remarkable faces -- the secretary gave them both to understand that he desired to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 16]: Therefore they took their leaves without delay , and came out of the house together .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 8]: ` Are you walking , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 3]: said Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 3]: returned Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 6]: ` Where you will . '
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 11]: ` That 's social , ' said his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 7]: ` Which way shall we take ?
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 27]: Shall we go and have a look at doors that we shall make a pretty good clattering at , before long -- eh , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 22]: Hugh answering in the affirmative , they went slowly down to Westminster , where both houses of Parliament were then sitting .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 110]: Mingling in the crowd of carriages , horses , servants , chairmen , link-boys , porters , and idlers of all kinds , they lounged about ; while Hugh 's new friend pointed out to him significantly the weak parts of the building , how easy it was to get into the lobby , and so to the very door of the House of Commons ; and how plainly , when they marched down there in grand array , their roars and shouts would be heard by the members inside ; with a great deal more to the same purpose , all of which Hugh received with manifest delight .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 59]: He told him , too , who some of the Lords and Commons were , by name , as they came in and out ; whether they were friendly to the Papists or otherwise ; and bade him take notice of their liveries and equipages , that he might be sure of them , in case of need .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 74]: Sometimes he drew him close to the windows of a passing carriage , that he might see its master 's face by the light of the lamps ; and , both in respect of people and localities , he showed so much acquaintance with everything around , that it was plain he had often studied there before ; as indeed , when they grew a little more confidential , he confessed he had .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 39]: Perhaps the most striking part of all this was , the number of people -- never in groups of more than two or three together -- who seemed to be skulking about the crowd for the same purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 73]: To the greater part of these , a slight nod or a look from Hugh 's companion was sufficient greeting ; but , now and then , some man would come and stand beside him in the throng , and , without turning his head or appearing to communicate with him , would say a word or two in a low voice , which he would answer in the same cautious manner .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 8]: Then they would part , like strangers .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 52]: Some of these men often reappeared again unexpectedly in the crowd close to Hugh , and , as they passed by , pressed his hand , or looked him sternly in the face ; but they never spoke to him , nor he to them ; no , not a word .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 96]: It was remarkable , too , that whenever they happened to stand where there was any press of people , and Hugh chanced to be looking downward , he was sure to see an arm stretched out -- under his own perhaps , or perhaps across him -- which thrust some paper into the hand or pocket of a bystander , and was so suddenly withdrawn that it was impossible to tell from whom it came ; nor could he see in any face , on glancing quickly round , the least confusion or surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 50]: They often trod upon a paper like the one he carried in his breast , but his companion whispered him not to touch it or to take it up , -- not even to look towards it , -- so there they let them lie , and passed on .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 58]: When they had paraded the street and all the avenues of the building in this manner for near two hours , they turned away , and his friend asked him what he thought of what he had seen , and whether he was prepared for a good hot piece of work if it should come to that .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 17]: The hotter the better , ' said Hugh , ` I 'm prepared for anything . '
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 39]: -- ` So am I , ' said his friend , ` and so are many of us ; and they shook hands upon it with a great oath , and with many terrible imprecations on the Papists .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 28]: As they were thirsty by this time , Dennis proposed that they should repair together to The Boot , where there was good company and strong liquor .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 18]: Hugh yielding a ready assent , they bent their steps that way with no loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 36]: This Boot was a lone house of public entertainment , situated in the fields at the back of the Foundling Hospital ; a very solitary spot at that period , and quite deserted after dark .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 41]: The tavern stood at some distance from any high road , and was approachable only by a dark and narrow lane ; so that Hugh was much surprised to find several people drinking there , and great merriment going on .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 63]: He was still more surprised to find among them almost every face that had caught his attention in the crowd ; but his companion having whispered him outside the door , that it was not considered good manners at The Boot to appear at all curious about the company , he kept his own counsel , and made no show of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 43]: Before putting his lips to the liquor which was brought for them , Dennis drank in a loud voice the health of Lord George Gordon , President of the Great Protestant Association ; which toast Hugh pledged likewise , with corresponding enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 72]: A fiddler who was present , and who appeared to act as the appointed minstrel of the company , forthwith struck up a Scotch reel ; and that in tones so invigorating , that Hugh and his friend -LRB- who had both been drinking before -RRB- rose from their seats as by previous concert , and , to the great admiration of the assembled guests , performed an extemporaneous No-Popery Dance .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 81]: Chapter 39 The applause which the performance of Hugh and his new friend elicited from the company at The Boot , had not yet subsided , and the two dancers were still panting from their exertions , which had been of a rather extreme and violent character , when the party was reinforced by the arrival of some more guests , who , being a detachment of United Bulldogs , were received with very flattering marks of distinction and respect .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 74]: The leader of this small party -- for , including himself , they were but three in number -- was our old acquaintance , Mr Tappertit , who seemed , physically speaking , to have grown smaller with years -LRB- particularly as to his legs , which were stupendously little -RRB- , but who , in a moral point of view , in personal dignity and self-esteem , had swelled into a giant .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 72]: Nor was it by any means difficult for the most unobservant person to detect this state of feeling in the quondam ` prentice , for it not only proclaimed itself impressively and beyond mistake in his majestic walk and kindling eye , but found a striking means of revelation in his turned-up nose , which scouted all things of earth with deep disdain , and sought communion with its kindred skies .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 56]: Mr Tappertit , as chief or captain of the Bulldogs , was attended by his two lieutenants ; one , the tall comrade of his younger life ; the other , a ` Prentice Knight in days of yore -- Mark Gilbert , bound in the olden time to Thomas Curzon of the Golden Fleece .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 48]: These gentlemen , like himself , were now emancipated from their ` prentice thraldom , and served as journeymen ; but they were , in humble emulation of his great example , bold and daring spirits , and aspired to a distinguished state in great political events .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 28]: Hence their connection with the Protestant Association of England , sanctioned by the name of Lord George Gordon ; and hence their present visit to The Boot .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 4]: ` Gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 18]: said Mr Tappertit , taking off his hat as a great general might in addressing his troops .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 4]: ` Well met .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 16]: My lord does me and you the honour to send his compliments per self . '
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 12]: ` You 've seen my lord too , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 4]: said Dennis . '
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 7]: I see him this afternoon . '
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 36]: ` My duty called me to the Lobby when our shop shut up ; and I saw him there , sir , ' Mr Tappertit replied , as he and his lieutenants took their seats .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 7]: ` How do YOU do ? '
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 12]: ` Lively , master , lively , ' said the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 36]: ` Here 's a new brother , regularly put down in black and white by Muster Gashford ; a credit to the cause ; one of the stick-at-nothing sort ; one arter my own heart .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 4]: D'ye see him ?
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 17]: Has he got the looks of a man that 'll do , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 11]: he cried , as he slapped Hugh on the back .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 26]: ` Looks or no looks , ' said Hugh , with a drunken flourish of his arm , ` I 'm the man you want .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 10]: I hate the Papists , every one of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 8]: They hate me and I hate them .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 20]: They do me all the harm they can , and I 'll do them all the harm I can .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 3]: Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 34]: ` Was there ever , ' said Dennis , looking round the room , when the echo of his boisterous voice bad died away ; ` was there ever such a game boy !
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 38]: Why , I mean to say , brothers , that if Muster Gashford had gone a hundred mile and got together fifty men of the common run , they would n't have been worth this one . '
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 26]: The greater part of the company implicitly subscribed to this opinion , and testified their faith in Hugh by nods and looks of great significance .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 52]: Mr Tappertit sat and contemplated him for a long time in silence , as if he suspended his judgment ; then drew a little nearer to him , and eyed him over more carefully ; then went close up to him , and took him apart into a dark corner . '
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 21]: I say , ' he began , with a thoughtful brow , ` have n't I seen you before ? '
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 17]: ` It 's like you may , ' said Hugh , in his careless way . '
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 10]: I do n't know ; should n't wonder . '
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 14]: ` No , but it 's very easily settled , ' returned Sim .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 5]: ` Look at me .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 7]: Did you ever see ME before ?
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 17]: You would n't be likely to forget it , you know , if you ever did .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 4]: Look at me .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 13]: Do n't be afraid ; I wo n't do you any harm .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 9]: Take a good look -- steady now . '
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 67]: The encouraging way in which Mr Tappertit made this request , and coupled it with an assurance that he need n't be frightened , amused Hugh mightily -- so much indeed , that be saw nothing at all of the small man before him , through closing his eyes in a fit of hearty laughter , which shook his great broad sides until they ached again .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 13]: said Mr Tappertit , growing a little impatient under this disrespectful treatment .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 9]: ` Do you know me , feller ? '
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 8]: ` Not I , ' cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 3]: Not I !
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 7]: But I should like to . '
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 46]: ` And yet I 'd have wagered a seven-shilling piece , '' said Mr Tappertit , folding his arms , and confronting him with his legs wide apart and firmly planted on the ground , ` that you once were hostler at the Maypole . '
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 17]: Hugh opened his eyes on hearing this , and looked at him in great surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 21]: -- And so you were , too , ' said Mr Tappertit , pushing him away with a condescending playfulness .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 15]: ` When did MY eyes ever deceive -- unless it was a young woman !
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 8]: Do n't you know me now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 10]: ` Why it a n't -- ' Hugh faltered .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 6]: ` A n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 7]: ` Are you sure of that ?
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 10]: You remember G. Varden , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 19]: Certainly Hugh did , and he remembered D. Varden too ; but that he did n't tell him .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 49]: ` You remember coming down there , before I was out of my time , to ask after a vagabond that had bolted off , and left his disconsolate father a prey to the bitterest emotions , and all the rest of it -- do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 7]: ` Of course I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 8]: ` And I saw you there . '
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 6]: ` Saw me there ! '
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 12]: ` Yes , I should think you did see me there .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 11]: The place would be troubled to go on without me .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 37]: Do n't you remember my thinking you liked the vagabond , and on that account going to quarrel with you ; and then finding you detested him worse than poison , going to drink with you ?
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 7]: Do n't you remember that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 10]: and are you in the same mind now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 3]: roared Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 22]: ` You speak like a man , ' said Mr Tappertit , ` and I 'll shake hands with you . '
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 31]: With these conciliatory expressions he suited the action to the word ; and Hugh meeting his advances readily , they performed the ceremony with a show of great heartiness . '
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 28]: I find , ' said Mr Tappertit , looking round on the assembled guests , ` that brother What 's - his-name and I are old acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 16]: -- You never heard anything more of that rascal , I suppose , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 10]: ` Not a syllable , ' replied Hugh . '
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 5]: I never want to .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 8]: I do n't believe I ever shall .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 10]: He 's dead long ago , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 43]: ` It 's to be hoped , for the sake of mankind in general and the happiness of society , that he is , ' said Mr Tappertit , rubbing his palm upon his legs , and looking at it between whiles .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 9]: ` Is your other hand at all cleaner ?
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 4]: Much the same .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 9]: Well , I 'll owe you another shake .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 13]: We 'll suppose it done , if you 've no objection . '
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 92]: Hugh laughed again , and with such thorough abandonment to his mad humour , that his limbs seemed dislocated , and his whole frame in danger of tumbling to pieces ; but Mr Tappertit , so far from receiving this extreme merriment with any irritation , was pleased to regard it with the utmost favour , and even to join in it , so far as one of his gravity and station could , with any regard to that decency and decorum which men in high places are expected to maintain .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 56]: Mr Tappertit did not stop here , as many public characters might have done , but calling up his brace of lieutenants , introduced Hugh to them with high commendation ; declaring him to be a man who , at such times as those in which they lived , could not be too much cherished .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 84]: Further , he did him the honour to remark , that he would be an acquisition of which even the United Bulldogs might be proud ; and finding , upon sounding him , that he was quite ready and willing to enter the society -LRB- for he was not at all particular , and would have leagued himself that night with anything , or anybody , for any purpose whatsoever -RRB- , caused the necessary preliminaries to be gone into upon the spot .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 36]: This tribute to his great merit delighted no man more than Mr Dennis , as he himself proclaimed with several rare and surprising oaths ; and indeed it gave unmingled satisfaction to the whole assembly .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 9]: ` Make anything you like of me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 13]: cried Hugh , flourishing the can he had emptied more than once .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 9]: ` Put me on any duty you please .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 5]: I 'm your man .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 5]: I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 10]: Here 's my captain -- here 's my leader .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 32]: Let him give me the word of command , and I 'll fight the whole Parliament House single-handed , or set a lighted torch to the King 's Throne itself ! '
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 42]: With that , he smote Mr Tappertit on the back , with such violence that his little body seemed to shrink into a mere nothing ; and roared again until the very foundlings near at hand were startled in their beds .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 22]: In fact , a sense of something whimsical in their companionship seemed to have taken entire possession of his rude brain .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 47]: The bare fact of being patronised by a great man whom he could have crushed with one hand , appeared in his eyes so eccentric and humorous , that a kind of ferocious merriment gained the mastery over him , and quite subdued his brutal nature .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 38]: He roared and roared again ; toasted Mr Tappertit a hundred times ; declared himself a Bulldog to the core ; and vowed to be faithful to him to the last drop of blood in his veins .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 25]: All these compliments Mr Tappertit received as matters of course -- flattering enough in their way , but entirely attributable to his vast superiority .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 54]: His dignified self-possession only delighted Hugh the more ; and in a word , this giant and dwarf struck up a friendship which bade fair to be of long continuance , as the one held it to be his right to command , and the other considered it an exquisite pleasantry to obey .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 110]: Nor was Hugh by any means a passive follower , who scrupled to act without precise and definite orders ; for when Mr Tappertit mounted on an empty cask which stood by way of rostrum in the room , and volunteered a speech upon the alarming crisis then at hand , he placed himself beside the orator , and though he grinned from ear to ear at every word he said , threw out such expressive hints to scoffers in the management of his cudgel , that those who were at first the most disposed to interrupt , became remarkably attentive , and were the loudest in their approbation .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 24]: It was not all noise and jest , however , at The Boot , nor were the whole party listeners to the speech .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 89]: There were some men at the other end of the room -LRB- which was a long , low-roofed chamber -RRB- in earnest conversation all the time ; and when any of this group went out , fresh people were sure to come in soon afterwards and sit down in their places , as though the others had relieved them on some watch or duty ; which it was pretty clear they did , for these changes took place by the clock , at intervals of half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 107]: These persons whispered very much among themselves , and kept aloof , and often looked round , as jealous of their speech being overheard ; some two or three among them entered in books what seemed to be reports from the others ; when they were not thus employed -RRB- one of them would turn to the newspapers which were strewn upon the table , and from the St James 's Chronicle , the Herald , Chronicle , or Public Advertiser , would read to the rest in a low voice some passage having reference to the topic in which they were all so deeply interested .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 30]: But the great attraction was a pamphlet called The Thunderer , which espoused their own opinions , and was supposed at that time to emanate directly from the Association .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 36]: This was always in request ; and whether read aloud , to an eager knot of listeners , or by some solitary man , was certain to be followed by stormy talking and excited looks .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 46]: In the midst of all his merriment , and admiration of his captain , Hugh was made sensible by these and other tokens , of the presence of an air of mystery , akin to that which had so much impressed him out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 31]: It was impossible to discard a sense that something serious was going on , and that under the noisy revel of the public-house , there lurked unseen and dangerous matter .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 48]: Little affected by this , however , he was perfectly satisfied with his quarters and would have remained there till morning , but that his conductor rose soon after midnight , to go home ; Mr Tappertit following his example , left him no excuse to stay .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 22]: So they all three left the house together : roaring a No-Popery song until the fields resounded with the dismal noise .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 6]: Cheer up , captain ! '
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 12]: cried Hugh , when they had roared themselves out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 5]: ` Another stave ! '
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 31]: Mr Tappertit , nothing loath , began again ; and so the three went staggering on , arm-in-arm , shouting like madmen , and defying the watch with great valour .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 57]: Indeed this did not require any unusual bravery or boldness , as the watchmen of that time , being selected for the office on account of excessive age and extraordinary infirmity , had a custom of shutting themselves up tight in their boxes on the first symptoms of disturbance , and remaining there until they disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 32]: In these proceedings , Mr Dennis , who had a gruff voice and lungs of considerable power , distinguished himself very much , and acquired great credit with his two companions .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 9]: ` What a queer fellow you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 9]: ` You 're so precious sly and close .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 13]: Why do n't you ever tell what trade you 're of ? '
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 32]: ` Answer the captain instantly , ' cried Hugh , beating his hat down on his head ; ` why do n't you ever tell what trade you 're of ? '
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 28]: ` I 'm of as gen-teel a calling , brother , as any man in England -- as light a business as any gentleman could desire . '
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 9]: ` Was you ` prenticed to it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 4]: asked Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 8]: Natural genius , ' said Mr Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 5]: ` No ` prenticing .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 6]: It come by natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 6]: Muster Gashford knows my calling .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 27]: Look at that hand of mine -- many and many a job that hand has done , with a neatness and dex-terity , never known afore .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 45]: When I look at that hand , ' said Mr Dennis , shaking it in the air , ` and remember the helegant bits of work it has turned off , I feel quite molloncholy to think it should ever grow old and feeble .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 6]: But sich is life ! '
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 59]: He heaved a deep sigh as he indulged in these reflections , and putting his fingers with an absent air on Hugh 's throat , and particularly under his left ear , as if he were studying the anatomical development of that part of his frame , shook his head in a despondent manner and actually shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 14]: ` You 're a kind of artist , I suppose -- eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 32]: ` Yes , ' rejoined Dennis ; ` yes -- I may call myself a artist -- a fancy workman -- art improves natur ' -- that 's my motto . '
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 9]: ` And what do you call this ? '
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 11]: said Mr Tappertit taking his stick out of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 20]: ` That 's my portrait atop , ' Dennis replied ; 'd ` ye think it 's like ? '
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 15]: ` Why -- it 's a little too handsome , ' said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 5]: ` Who did it ?
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 3]: You ? '
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 4]: ` I ! '
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 10]: repeated Dennis , gazing fondly on his image . '
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 7]: I wish I had the talent .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 15]: That was carved by a friend of mine , as is now no more .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 16]: The very day afore he died , he cut that with his pocket-knife from memory !
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 26]: `` I 'll die game , '' says my friend , `` and my last moments shall be dewoted to making Dennis 's picter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 5]: That 's it . '
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 12]: ` That was a queer fancy , was n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 54]: ` It WAS a queer fancy , ' rejoined the other , breathing on his fictitious nose , and polishing it with the cuff of his coat , ` but he was a queer subject altogether -- a kind of gipsy -- one of the finest , stand-up men , you ever see .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 26]: He told me some things that would startle you a bit , did that friend of mine , on the morning when he died . '
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 13]: ` You were with him at the time , were you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 16]: ` Yes , ' he answered with a curious look , ' I was there .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 7]: yes certainly , I was there .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 12]: He would n't have gone off half as comfortable without me .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 15]: I had been with three or four of his family under the same circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 7]: They were all fine fellows . '
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 20]: ` They must have been fond of you , ' remarked Mr Tappertit , looking at him sideways . '
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 33]: I do n't know that they was exactly fond of me , ' said Dennis , with a little hesitation , ` but they all had me near 'em when they departed .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 8]: I come in for their wardrobes too .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 27]: This very handkecher that you see round my neck , belonged to him that I 've been speaking of -- him as did that likeness . '
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 32]: Mr Tappertit glanced at the article referred to , and appeared to think that the deceased 's ideas of dress were of a peculiar and by no means an expensive kind .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 20]: He made no remark upon the point , however , and suffered his mysterious companion to proceed without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 106]: ` These smalls , ' said Dennis , rubbing his legs ; ` these very smalls -- they belonged to a friend of mine that 's left off sich incumbrances for ever : this coat too -- I 've often walked behind this coat , in the street , and wondered whether it would ever come to me : this pair of shoes have danced a hornpipe for another man , afore my eyes , full half-a-dozen times at least : and as to my hat , ' he said , taking it off , and whirling it round upon his fist -- ` Lord !
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 24]: I 've seen this hat go up Holborn on the box of a hackney-coach -- ah , many and many a day ! '
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 18]: ` You do n't mean to say their old wearers are ALL dead , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 14]: said Mr Tappertit , falling a little distance from him as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 10]: ` Every one of 'em , ' replied Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 6]: ` Every man Jack ! '
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 70]: There was something so very ghastly in this circumstance , and it appeared to account , in such a very strange and dismal manner , for his faded dress -- which , in this new aspect , seemed discoloured by the earth from graves -- that Mr Tappertit abruptly found he was going another way , and , stopping short , bade him good night with the utmost heartiness .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 84]: As they happened to be near the Old Bailey , and Mr Dennis knew there were turnkeys in the lodge with whom he could pass the night , and discuss professional subjects of common interest among them before a rousing fire , and over a social glass , he separated from his companions without any great regret , and warmly shaking hands with Hugh , and making an early appointment for their meeting at The Boot , left them to pursue their road .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 28]: ` That 's a strange sort of man , ' said Mr Tappertit , watching the hackney-coachman 's hat as it went bobbing down the street . '
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 10]: I do n't know what to make of him .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 20]: Why ca n't he have his smalls made to order , or wear live clothes at any rate ? '
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 14]: ` He 's a lucky man , captain , ' cried Hugh . '
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 12]: I should like to have such friends as his . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 27]: I hope he do n't get 'em to make their wills , and then knock 'em on the head , ' said Mr Tappertit , musing .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 4]: ` But come .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 7]: The United B. 's expect me .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 2]: On !
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 8]: -- What 's the matter ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 20]: I quite forgot , ' said Hugh , who had started at the striking of a neighbouring clock . '
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 13]: I have somebody to see to-night -- I must turn back directly .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 11]: The drinking and singing put it out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 8]: It 's well I remembered it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 70]: Mr Tappertit looked at him as though he were about to give utterance to some very majestic sentiments in reference to this act of desertion , but as it was clear , from Hugh 's hasty manner , that the engagement was one of a pressing nature , he graciously forbore , and gave him his permission to depart immediately , which Hugh acknowledged with a roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 7]: ` Good night , captain ! '
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 4]: he cried . '
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 10]: I am yours to the death , remember ! '
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 4]: ` Farewell ! '
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 8]: said Mr Tappertit , waving his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 7]: ` Be bold and vigilant ! '
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 7]: ` No Popery , captain ! '
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 3]: roared Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 7]: ` England in blood first ! '
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 5]: cried his desperate leader .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 13]: Whereat Hugh cheered and laughed , and ran off like a greyhound .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 21]: ` That man will prove a credit to my corps , ' said Simon , turning thoughtfully upon his heel .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 6]: ` And let me see .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 47]: In an altered state of society -- which must ensue if we break out and are victorious -- when the locksmith 's child is mine , Miggs must be got rid of somehow , or she 'll poison the tea-kettle one evening when I 'm out .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 11]: He might marry Miggs , if he was drunk enough .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 5]: It shall be done .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 9]: I 'll make a note of it . '
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 91]: Chapter 40 Little thinking of the plan for his happy settlement in life which had suggested itself to the teeming brain of his provident commander , Hugh made no pause until Saint Dunstan 's giants struck the hour above him , when he worked the handle of a pump which stood hard by , with great vigour , and thrusting his head under the spout , let the water gush upon him until a little stream ran down from every uncombed hair , and he was wet to the waist .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 42]: Considerably refreshed by this ablution , both in mind and body , and almost sobered for the time , he dried himself as he best could ; then crossed the road , and plied the knocker of the Middle Temple gate .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 21]: The night-porter looked through a small grating in the portal with a surly eye , and cried ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 13]: which greeting Hugh returned in kind , and bade him open quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 21]: ` We do n't sell beer here , ' cried the man ; ` what else do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 16]: ` To come in , ' Hugh replied , with a kick at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 6]: ` Where to go ? '
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 5]: ` Paper Buildings . '
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 5]: ` Whose chambers ? '
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 7]: ` Sir John Chester 's . '
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 11]: Each of which answers , he emphasised with another kick .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 31]: After a little growling on the other side , the gate was opened , and he passed in : undergoing a close inspection from the porter as he did so .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 13]: ` YOU wanting Sir John , at this time of night ! '
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 3]: ` I !
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 5]: What of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 22]: ` Why , I must go with you and see that you do , for I do n't believe it . '
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 6]: ` Come along then . '
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 59]: Eyeing him with suspicious looks , the man , with key and lantern , walked on at his side , and attended him to Sir John Chester 's door , at which Hugh gave one knock , that echoed through the dark staircase like a ghostly summons , and made the dull light tremble in the drowsy lamp .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 10]: ` Do you think he wants me now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 33]: Before the man had time to answer , a footstep was heard within , a light appeared , and Sir John , in his dressing-gown and slippers , opened the door . '
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 18]: I ask your pardon , Sir John , ' said the porter , pulling off his hat .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 14]: ` Here 's a young man says he wants to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 6]: It 's late for strangers .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 12]: I thought it best to see that all was right . '
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 8]: cried Sir John , raising his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 10]: ` It 's you , messenger , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 3]: Go in .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 5]: Quite right , friend .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 6]: I commend your prudence highly .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 4]: God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 4]: Good night . '
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 36]: To be commended , thanked , God-blessed , and bade good night by one who carried ` Sir ' before his name , and wrote himself M.P. to boot , was something for a porter .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 8]: He withdrew with much humility and reverence .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 48]: Sir John followed his late visitor into the dressing-room , and sitting in his easy-chair before the fire , and moving it so that he could see him as he stood , hat in hand , beside the door , looked at him from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 81]: The old face , calm and pleasant as ever ; the complexion , quite juvenile in its bloom and clearness ; the same smile ; the wonted precision and elegance of dress ; the white , well-ordered teeth ; the delicate hands ; the composed and quiet manner ; everything as it used to be : no mark of age or passion , envy , hate , or discontent : all unruffled and serene , and quite delightful to behold .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 8]: He wrote himself M.P. -- but how ?
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 4]: Why , thus .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 14]: It was a proud family -- more proud , indeed , than wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 29]: He had stood in danger of arrest ; of bailiffs , and a jail -- a vulgar jail , to which the common people with small incomes went .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 27]: Gentlemen of ancient houses have no privilege of exemption from such cruel laws -- unless they are of one great house , and then they have .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 16]: A proud man of his stock and kindred had the means of sending him there .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 41]: He offered -- not indeed to pay his debts , but to let him sit for a close borough until his own son came of age , which , if he lived , would come to pass in twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 15]: It was quite as good as an Insolvent Act , and infinitely more genteel .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 10]: So Sir John Chester was a member of Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 5]: But how Sir John ?
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 8]: Nothing so simple , or so easy .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 14]: One touch with a sword of state , and the transformation was effected .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 20]: John Chester , Esquire , M.P. , attended court -- went up with an address -- headed a deputation .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 21]: Such elegance of manner , so many graces of deportment , such powers of conversation , could never pass unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 8]: Mr was too common for such merit .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 27]: A man so gentlemanly should have been -- but Fortune is capricious -- born a Duke : just as some dukes should have been born labourers .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 18]: He caught the fancy of the king , knelt down a grub , and rose a butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 13]: John Chester , Esquire , was knighted and became Sir John . '
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 34]: I thought when you left me this evening , my esteemed acquaintance , ' said Sir John after a pretty long silence , ` that you intended to return with all despatch ? '
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 8]: ` So I did , master . '
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 7]: ` And so you have ? '
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 8]: he retorted , glancing at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 9]: ` Is that what you would say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 58]: Instead of replying , Hugh changed the leg on which he leant , shuffled his cap from one hand to the other , looked at the ground , the wall , the ceiling , and finally at Sir John himself ; before whose pleasant face he lowered his eyes again , and fixed them on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 13]: ` And how have you been employing yourself in the meanwhile ? '
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 9]: quoth Sir John , lazily crossing his legs .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 6]: ` Where have you been ?
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 8]: what harm have you been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 16]: ` No harm at all , master , ' growled Hugh , with humility . '
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 9]: I have only done as you ordered . '
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 6]: ` As I WHAT ? '
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 4]: returned Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 36]: ` Well then , ' said Hugh uneasily , ` as you advised , or said I ought , or said I might , or said that you would do , if you was me .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 11]: Do n't be so hard upon me , master . '
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 82]: Something like an expression of triumph in the perfect control he had established over this rough instrument appeared in the knight 's face for an instant ; but it vanished directly , as he said -- paring his nails while speaking : ` When you say I ordered you , my good fellow , you imply that I directed you to do something for me -- something I wanted done -- something for my own ends and purposes -- you see ?
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 39]: Now I am sure I need n't enlarge upon the extreme absurdity of such an idea , however unintentional ; so please -- ' and here he turned his eyes upon him -- ` to be more guarded .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 5]: Will you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 13]: I meant to give you no offence , ' said Hugh . '
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 8]: I do n't know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 9]: You catch me up so very short . '
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 31]: ` You will be caught up much shorter , my good friend -- infinitely shorter -- one of these days , depend upon it , ' replied his patron calmly .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 23]: ` By-the-bye , instead of wondering why you have been so long , my wonder should be why you came at all .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 5]: Why did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 43]: ` You know , master , ' said Hugh , ` that I could n't read the bill I found , and that supposing it to be something particular from the way it was wrapped up , I brought it here . '
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 15]: ` And could you ask no one else to read it , Bruin ? '
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 4]: said Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 12]: ` No one that I could trust with secrets , master .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 30]: Since Barnaby Rudge was lost sight of for good and all -- and that 's five years ago -- I have n't talked with any one but you . '
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 13]: ` You have done me honour , I am sure . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 71]: I have come to and fro , master , all through that time , when there was anything to tell , because I knew that you 'd be angry with me if I stayed away , ' said Hugh , blurting the words out , after an embarrassed silence ; ` and because I wished to please you if I could , and not to have you go against me .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 10]: That 's the true reason why I came to-night .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 11]: You know that , master , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 33]: ` You are a specious fellow , ' returned Sir John , fixing his eyes upon him , ` and carry two faces under your hood , as well as the best .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 57]: Did n't you give me in this room , this evening , any other reason ; no dislike of anybody who has slighted you lately , on all occasions , abused you , treated you with rudeness ; acted towards you , more as if you were a mongrel dog than a man like himself ? '
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 8]: ` To be sure I did ! '
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 25]: cried Hugh , his passion rising , as the other meant it should ; ` and I say it all over now , again .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 13]: I 'd do anything to have some revenge on him -- anything .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 39]: And when you told me that he and all the Catholics would suffer from those who joined together under that handbill , I said I 'd make one of 'em , if their master was the devil himself .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 6]: I AM one of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 21]: See whether I am as good as my word and turn out to be among the foremost , or no .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 22]: I may n't have much head , master , but I 've head enough to remember those that use me ill .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 25]: You shall see , and so shall he , and so shall hundreds more , how my spirit backs me when the time comes .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 8]: My bark is nothing to my bite .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 25]: Some that I know had better have a wild lion among 'em than me , when I am fairly loose -- they had ! '
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 50]: The knight looked at him with a smile of far deeper meaning than ordinary ; and pointing to the old cupboard , followed him with his eyes while he filled and drank a glass of liquor ; and smiled when his back was turned , with deeper meaning yet .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 21]: ` You are in a blustering mood , my friend , ' he said , when Hugh confronted him again .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 7]: ` Not I , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 4]: cried Hugh . '
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 8]: I do n't say half I mean .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 7]: I have n't got the gift .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 16]: There are talkers enough among us ; I 'll be one of the doers . '
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 8]: you have joined those fellows then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 12]: said Sir John , with an air of most profound indifference .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 19]: I went up to the house you told me of ; and got put down upon the muster .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 16]: There was another man there , named Dennis -- ' ` Dennis , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 6]: cried Sir John , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 5]: ` Ay , ay !
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 9]: a pleasant fellow , I believe ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 22]: A roaring dog , master -- one after my own heart -- hot upon the matter too -- red hot . '
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 13]: ` So I have heard , ' replied Sir John , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 14]: ` You do n't happen to know his trade , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 10]: ` He would n't say , ' cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 7]: ` He keeps it secret . '
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 5]: laughed Sir John . '
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 22]: A strange fancy -- a weakness with some persons -- you 'll know it one day , I dare swear . '
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 10]: ` We 're intimate already , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 4]: ` Quite natural !
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 9]: And have been drinking together , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 4]: pursued Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 20]: ` Did you say what place you went to in company , when you left Lord George 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 63]: Hugh had not said or thought of saying , but he told him ; and this inquiry being followed by a long train of questions , he related all that had passed both in and out of doors , the kind of people he had seen , their numbers , state of feeling , mode of conversation , apparent expectations and intentions .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 68]: His questioning was so artfully contrived , that he seemed even in his own eyes to volunteer all this information rather than to have it wrested from him ; and he was brought to this state of feeling so naturally , that when Mr Chester yawned at length and declared himself quite wearied out , he made a rough kind of excuse for having talked so much .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 20]: ` There -- get you gone , ' said Sir John , holding the door open in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 10]: ` You have made a pretty evening 's work .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 8]: I told you not to do this .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 6]: You may get into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 30]: You 'll have an opportunity of revenging yourself on your proud friend Haredale , though , and for that , you 'd hazard anything , I suppose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 23]: I would , ' retorted Hugh , stopping in his passage out and looking back ; ` but what do I risk !
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 11]: What do I stand a chance of losing , master ?
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 4]: Friends , home ?
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 16]: A fig for 'em all ; I have none ; they are nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 46]: Give me a good scuffle ; let me pay off old scores in a bold riot where there are men to stand by me ; and then use me as you like -- it do n't matter much to me what the end is ! '
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 10]: ` What have you done with that paper ? '
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 5]: said Sir John . '
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 8]: I have it here , master . '
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 22]: ` Drop it again as you go along ; it 's as well not to keep such things about you . '
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 22]: Hugh nodded , and touching his cap with an air of as much respect as he could summon up , departed .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 37]: Sir John , fastening the doors behind him , went back to his dressing-room , and sat down once again before the fire , at which he gazed for a long time , in earnest meditation .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 19]: ` This happens fortunately , ' he said , breaking into a smile , ` and promises well .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 77]: My relative and I , who are the most Protestant fellows in the world , give our worst wishes to the Roman Catholic cause ; and to Saville , who introduces their bill , I have a personal objection besides ; but as each of us has himself for the first article in his creed , we can not commit ourselves by joining with a very extravagant madman , such as this Gordon most undoubtedly is .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 91]: Now really , to foment his disturbances in secret , through the medium of such a very apt instrument as my savage friend here , may further our real ends ; and to express at all becoming seasons , in moderate and polite terms , a disapprobation of his proceedings , though we agree with him in principle , will certainly be to gain a character for honesty and uprightness of purpose , which can not fail to do us infinite service , and to raise us into some importance .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 2]: Good !
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 6]: So much for public grounds .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 57]: As to private considerations , I confess that if these vagabonds WOULD make some riotous demonstration -LRB- which does not appear impossible -RRB- , and WOULD inflict some little chastisement on Haredale as a not inactive man among his sect , it would be extremely agreeable to my feelings , and would amuse me beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 3]: Good again !
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 4]: Perhaps better ! '
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 53]: When he came to this point , he took a pinch of snuff ; then beginning slowly to undress , he resumed his meditations , by saying with a smile : ' I fear , I DO fear exceedingly , that my friend is following fast in the footsteps of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 9]: His intimacy with Mr Dennis is very ominous .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 15]: But I have no doubt he must have come to that end any way .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 42]: If I lend him a helping hand , the only difference is , that he may , upon the whole , possibly drink a few gallons , or puncheons , or hogsheads , less in this life than he otherwise would .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 7]: It 's no business of mine .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 10]: It 's a matter of very small importance ! '
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 13]: So he took another pinch of snuff , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 39]: Chapter 41 From the workshop of the Golden Key , there issued forth a tinkling sound , so merry and good-humoured , that it suggested the idea of some one working blithely , and made quite pleasant music .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 53]: No man who hammered on at a dull monotonous duty , could have brought such cheerful notes from steel and iron ; none but a chirping , healthy , honest-hearted fellow , who made the best of everything , and felt kindly towards everybody , could have done it for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 12]: He might have been a coppersmith , and still been musical .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 29]: If he had sat in a jolting waggon , full of rods of iron , it seemed as if he would have brought some harmony out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 48]: Tink , tink , tink -- clear as a silver bell , and audible at every pause of the streets ' harsher noises , as though it said , ' I do n't care ; nothing puts me out ; I am resolved to he happy . '
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 68]: Women scolded , children squalled , heavy carts went rumbling by , horrible cries proceeded from the lungs of hawkers ; still it struck in again , no higher , no lower , no louder , no softer ; not thrusting itself on people 's notice a bit the more for having been outdone by louder sounds -- tink , tink , tink , tink , tink .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 93]: It was a perfect embodiment of the still small voice , free from all cold , hoarseness , huskiness , or unhealthiness of any kind ; foot-passengers slackened their pace , and were disposed to linger near it ; neighbours who had got up splenetic that morning , felt good-humour stealing on them as they heard it , and by degrees became quite sprightly ; mothers danced their babies to its ringing ; still the same magical tink , tink , tink , came gaily from the workshop of the Golden Key .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 10]: Who but the locksmith could have made such music !
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 35]: A gleam of sun shining through the unsashed window , and chequering the dark workshop with a broad patch of light , fell full upon him , as though attracted by his sunny heart .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 42]: There he stood working at his anvil , his face all radiant with exercise and gladness , his sleeves turned up , his wig pushed off his shining forehead -- the easiest , freest , happiest man in all the world .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 31]: Beside him sat a sleek cat , purring and winking in the light , and falling every now and then into an idle doze , as from excess of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 28]: Toby looked on from a tall bench hard by ; one beaming smile , from his broad nut-brown face down to the slack-baked buckles in his shoes .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 29]: The very locks that hung around had something jovial in their rust , and seemed like gouty gentlemen of hearty natures , disposed to joke on their infirmities .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 11]: There was nothing surly or severe in the whole scene .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 19]: It seemed impossible that any one of the innumerable keys could fit a churlish strong-box or a prison-door .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 28]: Cellars of beer and wine , rooms where there were fires , books , gossip , and cheering laughter -- these were their proper sphere of action .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 17]: Places of distrust and cruelty , and restraint , they would have left quadruple-locked for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 6]: Tink , tink , tink .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 11]: The locksmith paused at last , and wiped his brow .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 29]: The silence roused the cat , who , jumping softly down , crept to the door , and watched with tiger eyes a bird-cage in an opposite window .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 13]: Gabriel lifted Toby to his mouth , and took a hearty draught .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 35]: Then , as he stood upright , with his head flung back , and his portly chest thrown out , you would have seen that Gabriel 's lower man was clothed in military gear .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 61]: Glancing at the wall beyond , there might have been espied , hanging on their several pegs , a cap and feather , broadsword , sash , and coat of scarlet ; which any man learned in such matters would have known from their make and pattern to be the uniform of a serjeant in the Royal East London Volunteers .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 89]: As the locksmith put his mug down , empty , on the bench whence it had smiled on him before , he glanced at these articles with a laughing eye , and looking at them with his head a little on one side , as though he would get them all into a focus , said , leaning on his hammer : ` Time was , now , I remember , when I was like to run mad with the desire to wear a coat of that colour .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 25]: If any one -LRB- except my father -RRB- had called me a fool for my pains , how I should have fired and fumed !
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 12]: But what a fool I must have been , sure-ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 10]: sighed Mrs Varden , who had entered unobserved . '
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 4]: A fool indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 16]: A man at your time of life , Varden , should know better now . '
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 23]: ` Why , what a ridiculous woman you are , Martha , ' said the locksmith , turning round with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 11]: ` Certainly , ' replied Mrs V. with great demureness .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 6]: ` Of course I am .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 6]: I know that , Varden .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 5]: Thank you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 8]: I mean -- ' began the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 15]: ` Yes , ' said his wife , ' I know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 11]: You speak quite plain enough to be understood , Varden .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 18]: It 's very kind of you to adapt yourself to my capacity , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 20]: ` Tut , tut , Martha , ' rejoined the locksmith ; ` do n't take offence at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 42]: I mean , how strange it is of you to run down volunteering , when it 's done to defend you and all the other women , and our own fireside and everybody else 's , in case of need . '
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 14]: ` It 's unchristian , ' cried Mrs Varden , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 4]: ` Unchristian ! '
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 4]: said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 92]: ` Why , what the devil -- ' Mrs Varden looked at the ceiling , as in expectation that the consequence of this profanity would be the immediate descent of the four-post bedstead on the second floor , together with the best sitting-room on the first ; but no visible judgment occurring , she heaved a deep sigh , and begged her husband , in a tone of resignation , to go on , and by all means to blaspheme as much as possible , because he knew she liked it .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 40]: The locksmith did for a moment seem disposed to gratify her , but he gave a great gulp , and mildly rejoined : ' I was going to say , what on earth do you call it unchristian for ?
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 34]: Which would be most unchristian , Martha -- to sit quietly down and let our houses be sacked by a foreign army , or to turn out like men and drive 'em off ?
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 38]: Should n't I be a nice sort of a Christian , if I crept into a corner of my own chimney and looked on while a parcel of whiskered savages bore off Dolly -- or you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 19]: When he said ` or you , ' Mrs Varden , despite herself , relaxed into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 8]: There was something complimentary in the idea .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 16]: ` In such a state of things as that , indeed -- ' she simpered .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 5]: ` As that ! '
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 4]: repeated the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 12]: ` Well , that would be the state of things directly .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 5]: Even Miggs would go .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 40]: Some black tambourine-player , with a great turban on , would be bearing HER off , and , unless the tambourine-player was proof against kicking and scratching , it 's my belief he 'd have the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 6]: I 'd forgive the tambourine-player .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 15]: I would n't have him interfered with on any account , poor fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 53]: And here the locksmith laughed again so heartily , that tears came into his eyes -- much to Mrs Varden 's indignation , who thought the capture of so sound a Protestant and estimable a private character as Miggs by a pagan negro , a circumstance too shocking and awful for contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 52]: The picture Gabriel had drawn , indeed , threatened serious consequences , and would indubitably have led to them , but luckily at that moment a light footstep crossed the threshold , and Dolly , running in , threw her arms round her old father 's neck and hugged him tight .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 8]: ` Here she is at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 3]: cried Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 19]: ` And how well you look , Doll , and how late you are , my darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 5]: How well she looked ?
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 2]: Well ?
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 21]: Why , if he had exhausted every laudatory adjective in the dictionary , it would n't have been praise enough .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 33]: When and where was there ever such a plump , roguish , comely , bright-eyed , enticing , bewitching , captivating , maddening little puss in all this world , as Dolly !
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 16]: What was the Dolly of five years ago , to the Dolly of that day !
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 41]: How many coachmakers , saddlers , cabinet-makers , and professors of other useful arts , had deserted their fathers , mothers , sisters , brothers , and , most of all , their cousins , for the love of her !
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 44]: How many unknown gentlemen -- supposed to be of mighty fortunes , if not titles -- had waited round the corner after dark , and tempted Miggs the incorruptible , with golden guineas , to deliver offers of marriage folded up in love-letters !
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 59]: How many disconsolate fathers and substantial tradesmen had waited on the locksmith for the same purpose , with dismal tales of how their sons had lost their appetites , and taken to shut themselves up in dark bedrooms , and wandering in desolate suburbs with pale faces , and all because of Dolly Varden 's loveliness and cruelty !
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 47]: How many young men , in all previous times of unprecedented steadiness , had turned suddenly wild and wicked for the same reason , and , in an ecstasy of unrequited love , taken to wrench off door-knockers , and invert the boxes of rheumatic watchmen !
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 29]: How had she recruited the king 's service , both by sea and land , through rendering desperate his loving subjects between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five !
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 50]: How many young ladies had publicly professed , with tears in their eyes , that for their tastes she was much too short , too tall , too bold , too cold , too stout , too thin , too fair , too dark -- too everything but handsome !
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 85]: How many old ladies , taking counsel together , had thanked Heaven their daughters were not like her , and had hoped she might come to no harm , and had thought she would come to no good , and had wondered what people saw in her , and had arrived at the conclusion that she was ` going off ' in her looks , or had never come on in them , and that she was a thorough imposition and a popular mistake !
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 68]: And yet here was this same Dolly Varden , so whimsical and hard to please that she was Dolly Varden still , all smiles and dimples and pleasant looks , and caring no more for the fifty or sixty young fellows who at that very moment were breaking their hearts to marry her , than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and opened afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 61]: Dolly hugged her father as has been already stated , and having hugged her mother also , accompanied both into the little parlour where the cloth was already laid for dinner , and where Miss Miggs -- a trifle more rigid and bony than of yore -- received her with a sort of hysterical gasp , intended for a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 55]: Into the hands of that young virgin , she delivered her bonnet and walking dress -LRB- all of a dreadful , artful , and designing kind -RRB- , and then said with a laugh , which rivalled the locksmith 's music , ` How glad I always am to be at home again ! '
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 32]: ` And how glad we always are , Doll , ' said her father , putting back the dark hair from her sparkling eyes , ` to have you at home .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 6]: Give me a kiss . '
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 27]: If there had been anybody of the male kind there to see her do it -- but there was not -- it was a mercy . '
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 28]: I do n't like your being at the Warren , ' said the locksmith , ' I ca n't bear to have you out of my sight .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 11]: And what is the news over yonder , Doll ? '
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 18]: ` What news there is , I think you know already , ' replied his daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 8]: I am sure you do though . '
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 4]: ` Ay ? '
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 4]: cried the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 15]: ` Come , come , ' said Dolly , ` you know very well .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 22]: I want you to tell me why Mr Haredale -- oh , how gruff he is again , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 39]: -- has been away from home for some days past , and why he is travelling about -LRB- we know he IS travelling , because of his letters -RRB- without telling his own niece why or wherefore . '
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 19]: ` Miss Emma does n't want to know , I 'll swear , ' returned the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 19]: I do n't know that , ' said Dolly ; ` but I do , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 4]: Do tell me .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 33]: Why is he so secret , and what is this ghost story , which nobody is to tell Miss Emma , and which seems to be mixed up with his going away ?
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 11]: Now I see you know by your colouring so . '
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 57]: ` What the story means , or is , or has to do with it , I know no more than you , my dear , ' returned the locksmith , ` except that it 's some foolish fear of little Solomon 's -- which has , indeed , no meaning in it , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 22]: As to Mr Haredale 's journey , he goes , as I believe -- ' ` Yes , ' said Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 20]: ` As I believe , ' resumed the locksmith , pinching her cheek , ` on business , Doll .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 10]: What it may be , is quite another matter .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 40]: Read Blue Beard , and do n't be too curious , pet ; it 's no business of yours or mine , depend upon that ; and here 's dinner , which is much more to the purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 73]: Dolly might have remonstrated against this summary dismissal of the subject , notwithstanding the appearance of dinner , but at the mention of Blue Beard Mrs Varden interposed , protesting she could not find it in her conscience to sit tamely by , and hear her child recommended to peruse the adventures of a Turk and Mussulman -- far less of a fabulous Turk , which she considered that potentate to be .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 74]: She held that , in such stirring and tremendous times as those in which they lived , it would be much more to the purpose if Dolly became a regular subscriber to the Thunderer , where she would have an opportunity of reading Lord George Gordon 's speeches word for word , which would be a greater comfort and solace to her , than a hundred and fifty Blue Beards ever could impart .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 152]: She appealed in support of this proposition to Miss Miggs , then in waiting , who said that indeed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal of that paper generally , but especially of one article of the very last week as ever was , entitled ` Great Britain drenched in gore , ' exceeded all belief ; the same composition , she added , had also wrought such a comforting effect on the mind of a married sister of hers , then resident at Golden Lion Court , number twenty-sivin , second bell-handle on the right-hand door-post , that , being in a delicate state of health , and in fact expecting an addition to her family , she had been seized with fits directly after its perusal , and had raved of the Inquisition ever since ; to the great improvement of her husband and friends .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 84]: Miss Miggs went on to say that she would recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to hear Lord George themselves , whom she commended first , in respect of his steady Protestantism , then of his oratory , then of his eyes , then of his nose , then of his legs , and lastly of his figure generally , which she looked upon as fit for any statue , prince , or angel , to which sentiment Mrs Varden fully subscribed .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 137]: Mrs Varden having cut in , looked at a box upon the mantelshelf , painted in imitation of a very red-brick dwelling-house , with a yellow roof ; having at top a real chimney , down which voluntary subscribers dropped their silver , gold , or pence , into the parlour ; and on the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate , whereon was legibly inscribed ` Protestant Association : ' -- and looking at it , said , that it was to her a source of poignant misery to think that Varden never had , of all his substance , dropped anything into that temple , save once in secret -- as she afterwards discovered -- two fragments of tobacco-pipe , which she hoped would not be put down to his last account .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 102]: That Dolly , she was grieved to say , was no less backward in her contributions , better loving , as it seemed , to purchase ribbons and such gauds , than to encourage the great cause , then in such heavy tribulation ; and that she did entreat her -LRB- her father she much feared could not be moved -RRB- not to despise , but imitate , the bright example of Miss Miggs , who flung her wages , as it were , into the very countenance of the Pope , and bruised his features with her quarter 's money .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 16]: ` Oh , mim , ' said Miggs , ` do n't relude to that .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 12]: I had no intentions , mim , that nobody should know .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 14]: Such sacrifices as I can make , are quite a widder 's mite .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 45]: It 's all I have , ' cried Miggs with a great burst of tears -- for with her they never came on by degrees -- ` but it 's made up to me in other ways ; it 's well made up . '
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 15]: This was quite true , though not perhaps in the sense that Miggs intended .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 80]: As she never failed to keep her self-denial full in Mrs Varden 's view , it drew forth so many gifts of caps and gowns and other articles of dress , that upon the whole the red-brick house was perhaps the best investment for her small capital she could possibly have hit upon ; returning her interest , at the rate of seven or eight per cent in money , and fifty at least in personal repute and credit .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 37]: ` You need n't cry , Miggs , ' said Mrs Varden , herself in tears ; ` you need n't be ashamed of it , though your poor mistress IS on the same side . '
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 21]: Miggs howled at this remark , in a peculiarly dismal way , and said she knowed that master hated her .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 19]: That it was a dreadful thing to live in families and have dislikes , and not give satisfactions .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 24]: That to make divisions was a thing she could not abear to think of , neither could her feelings let her do it .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 50]: That if it was master 's wishes as she and him should part , it was best they should part , and she hoped he might be the happier for it , and always wished him well , and that he might find somebody as would meet his dispositions .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 45]: It would be a hard trial , she said , to part from such a missis , but she could meet any suffering when her conscience told her she was in the rights , and therefore she was willing even to go that lengths .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 43]: She did not think , she added , that she could long survive the separations , but , as she was hated and looked upon unpleasant , perhaps her dying as soon as possible would be the best endings for all parties .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 15]: With this affecting conclusion , Miss Miggs shed more tears , and sobbed abundantly .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 9]: ` Can you bear this , Varden ? '
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 15]: said his wife in a solemn voice , laying down her knife and fork .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 25]: ` Why , not very well , my dear , ' rejoined the locksmith , ` but I try to keep my temper . '
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 17]: ` Do n't let there be words on my account , mim , ' sobbed Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 11]: ` It 's much the best that we should part .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 10]: I would n't stay -- oh , gracious me !
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 20]: -- and make dissensions , not for a annual gold mine , and found in tea and sugar . '
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 85]: Lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the cause of Miss Miggs 's deep emotion , it may be whispered apart that , happening to be listening , as her custom sometimes was , when Gabriel and his wife conversed together , she had heard the locksmith 's joke relative to the foreign black who played the tambourine , and bursting with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in her fair breast , exploded in the manner we have witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 26]: Matters having now arrived at a crisis , the locksmith , as usual , and for the sake of peace and quietness , gave in .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 10]: ` What are you crying for , girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter with you ?
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 8]: What are you talking about hatred for ?
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 12]: I do n't hate you ; I do n't hate anybody .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 24]: Dry your eyes and make yourself agreeable , in Heaven 's name , and let us all be happy while we can . '
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 40]: The allied powers deeming it good generalship to consider this a sufficient apology on the part of the enemy , and confession of having been in the wrong , did dry their eyes and take it in good part .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 30]: Miss Miggs observed that she bore no malice , no not to her greatest foe , whom she rather loved the more indeed , the greater persecution she sustained .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 40]: Mrs Varden approved of this meek and forgiving spirit in high terms , and incidentally declared as a closing article of agreement , that Dolly should accompany her to the Clerkenwell branch of the association , that very night .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 64]: This was an extraordinary instance of her great prudence and policy ; having had this end in view from the first , and entertaining a secret misgiving that the locksmith -LRB- who was bold when Dolly was in question -RRB- would object , she had backed Miss Miggs up to this point , in order that she might have him at a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 35]: The manoeuvre succeeded so well that Gabriel only made a wry face , and with the warning he had just had , fresh in his mind , did not dare to say one word .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 36]: The difference ended , therefore , in Miggs being presented with a gown by Mrs Varden and half-a-crown by Dolly , as if she had eminently distinguished herself in the paths of morality and goodness .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 65]: Mrs V. , according to custom , expressed her hope that Varden would take a lesson from what had passed and learn more generous conduct for the time to come ; and the dinner being now cold and nobody 's appetite very much improved by what had passed , they went on with it , as Mrs Varden said , ` like Christians . '
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 78]: As there was to be a grand parade of the Royal East London Volunteers that afternoon , the locksmith did no more work ; but sat down comfortably with his pipe in his mouth , and his arm round his pretty daughter 's waist , looking lovingly on Mrs V. , from time to time , and exhibiting from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot , one smiling surface of good humour .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 65]: And to be sure , when it was time to dress him in his regimentals , and Dolly , hanging about him in all kinds of graceful winning ways , helped to button and buckle and brush him up and get him into one of the tightest coats that ever was made by mortal tailor , he was the proudest father in all England .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 9]: ` What a handy jade it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 64]: said the locksmith to Mrs Varden , who stood by with folded hands -- rather proud of her husband too -- while Miggs held his cap and sword at arm 's length , as if mistrusting that the latter might run some one through the body of its own accord ; ` but never marry a soldier , Doll , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 27]: Dolly did n't ask why not , or say a word , indeed , but stooped her head down very low to tie his sash . '
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 20]: I never wear this dress , ' said honest Gabriel , ` but I think of poor Joe Willet .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 12]: I loved Joe ; he was always a favourite of mine .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 3]: Poor Joe !
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 16]: -- Dear heart , my girl , do n't tie me in so tight . '
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 25]: Dolly laughed -- not like herself at all -- the strangest little laugh that could be -- and held her head down lower still .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 5]: ` Poor Joe ! '
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 18]: resumed the locksmith , muttering to himself ; ' I always wish he had come to me .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 13]: I might have made it up between them , if he had .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 19]: old John made a great mistake in his way of acting by that lad -- a great mistake .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 12]: -- Have you nearly tied that sash , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 7]: What an ill-made sash it was !
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 12]: There it was , loose again and trailing on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 13]: Dolly was obliged to kneel down , and recommence at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 30]: ` Never mind young Willet , Varden , ' said his wife frowning ; ` you might find some one more deserving to talk about , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 11]: Miss Miggs gave a great sniff to the same effect .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 21]: ` Nay , Martha , ' cried the locksmith , ` do n't let us bear too hard upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 17]: If the lad is dead indeed , we 'll deal kindly by his memory . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 7]: A runaway and a vagabond ! '
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 4]: said Mrs Varden .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 9]: Miss Miggs expressed her concurrence as before . '
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 20]: A runaway , my dear , but not a vagabond , ' returned the locksmith in a gentle tone .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 19]: ` He behaved himself well , did Joe -- always -- and was a handsome , manly fellow .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 10]: Do n't call him a vagabond , Martha . '
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 9]: Mrs Varden coughed -- and so did Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 28]: ` He tried hard to gain your good opinion , Martha , I can tell you , ' said the locksmith smiling , and stroking his chin .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 4]: that he did .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 52]: It seems but yesterday that he followed me out to the Maypole door one night , and begged me not to say how like a boy they used him -- say here , at home , he meant , though at the time , I recollect , I did n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 10]: `` And how 's Miss Dolly , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 14]: says Joe , ' pursued the locksmith , musing sorrowfully , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 4]: Poor Joe ! '
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 10]: ` Well , I declare , ' cried Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 5]: Goodness gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 39]: said Gabriel , turning sharply to her , ` Why , if here a n't Miss Dolly , ' said the handmaid , stooping down to look into her face , ` a-giving way to floods of tears .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 3]: Oh mim !
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 3]: oh sir .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 41]: Raly it 's give me such a turn , ' cried the susceptible damsel , pressing her hand upon her side to quell the palpitation of her heart , ` that you might knock me down with a feather . '
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 53]: The locksmith , after glancing at Miss Miggs as if he could have wished to have a feather brought straightway , looked on with a broad stare while Dolly hurried away , followed by that sympathising young woman : then turning to his wife , stammered out , ` Is Dolly ill ?
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 5]: Have I done anything ?
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 6]: Is it my fault ? '
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 5]: ` Your fault ! '
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 5]: cried Mrs V. reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 11]: ` There -- you had better make haste out . '
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 7]: ` What have I done ? '
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 4]: said poor Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 27]: ` It was agreed that Mr Edward 's name was never to be mentioned , and I have not spoken of him , have I ? '
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 20]: Mrs Varden merely replied that she had no patience with him , and bounced off after the other two .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 24]: The unfortunate locksmith wound his sash about him , girded on his sword , put on his cap , and walked out . '
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 33]: I am not much of a dab at my exercise , ' he said under his breath , ` but I shall get into fewer scrapes at that work than at this .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 23]: Every man came into the world for something ; my department seems to be to make every woman cry without meaning it .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 6]: It 's rather hard ! '
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 37]: But he forgot it before he reached the end of the street , and went on with a shining face , nodding to the neighbours , and showering about his friendly greetings like mild spring rain .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 60]: Chapter 42 The Royal East London Volunteers made a brilliant sight that day : formed into lines , squares , circles , triangles , and what not , to the beating of drums , and the streaming of flags ; and performed a vast number of complex evolutions , in all of which Serjeant Varden bore a conspicuous share .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 33]: Having displayed their military prowess to the utmost in these warlike shows , they marched in glittering order to the Chelsea Bun House , and regaled in the adjacent taverns until dark .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 28]: Then at sound of drum they fell in again , and returned amidst the shouting of His Majesty 's lieges to the place from whence they came .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 79]: The homeward march being somewhat tardy , -- owing to the un-soldierlike behaviour of certain corporals , who , being gentlemen of sedentary pursuits in private life and excitable out of doors , broke several windows with their bayonets , and rendered it imperative on the commanding officer to deliver them over to a strong guard , with whom they fought at intervals as they came along , -- it was nine o'clock when the locksmith reached home .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 27]: A hackney-coach was waiting near his door ; and as he passed it , Mr Haredale looked from the window and called him by his name .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 24]: ` The sight of you is good for sore eyes , sir , ' said the locksmith , stepping up to him . '
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 14]: I wish you had walked in though , rather than waited here . '
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 29]: ` There is nobody at home , I find , ' Mr Haredale answered ; ` besides , I desired to be as private as I could . '
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 10]: muttered the locksmith , looking round at his house .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 14]: ` Gone with Simon Tappertit to that precious Branch , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 38]: Mr Haredale invited him to come into the coach , and , if he were not tired or anxious to go home , to ride with him a little way that they might have some talk together .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 13]: Gabriel cheerfully complied , and the coachman mounting his box drove off .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 37]: ` Varden , ' said Mr Haredale , after a minute 's pause , ` you will be amazed to hear what errand I am on ; it will seem a very strange one . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 34]: I have no doubt it 's a reasonable one , sir , and has a meaning in it , ' replied the locksmith ; ` or it would not be yours at all .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 11]: Have you just come back to town , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 8]: ` But half an hour ago . '
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 12]: ` Bringing no news of Barnaby , or his mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 5]: said the locksmith dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 9]: you need n't shake your head , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 6]: It was a wild-goose chase .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 8]: I feared that , from the first .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 12]: You exhausted all reasonable means of discovery when they went away .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 19]: To begin again after so long a time has passed is hopeless , sir -- quite hopeless . '
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 8]: ` Why , where are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 4]: he returned impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 6]: ` Where can they be ?
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 4]: Above ground ? '
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 28]: ` God knows , ' rejoined the locksmith , ` many that I knew above it five years ago , have their beds under the grass now .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 8]: And the world is a wide place .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 11]: It 's a hopeless attempt , sir , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 25]: We must leave the discovery of this mystery , like all others , to time , and accident , and Heaven 's pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 32]: ` Varden , my good fellow , ' said Mr Haredale , ' I have a deeper meaning in my present anxiety to find them out , than you can fathom .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 27]: It is not a mere whim ; it is not the casual revival of my old wishes and desires ; but an earnest , solemn purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 16]: My thoughts and dreams all tend to it , and fix it in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 21]: I have no rest by day or night ; I have no peace or quiet ; I am haunted . '
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 44]: His voice was so altered from its usual tones , and his manner bespoke so much emotion , that Gabriel , in his wonder , could only sit and look towards him in the darkness , and fancy the expression of his face .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 16]: ` Do not ask me , ' continued Mr Haredale , ` to explain myself .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 18]: If I were to do so , you would think me the victim of some hideous fancy .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 36]: It is enough that this is so , and that I can not -- no , I can not -- lie quietly in my bed , without doing what will seem to you incomprehensible . '
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 24]: ` Since when , sir , ' said the locksmith after a pause , ` has this uneasy feeling been upon you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 19]: Mr Haredale hesitated for some moments , and then replied : ` Since the night of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 11]: In short , since the last nineteenth of March . '
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 34]: As though he feared that Varden might express surprise , or reason with him , he hastily went on : ` You will think , I know , I labour under some delusion .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 4]: Perhaps I do .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 22]: But it is not a morbid one ; it is a wholesome action of the mind , reasoning on actual occurrences .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 46]: You know the furniture remains in Mrs Rudge 's house , and that it has been shut up , by my orders , since she went away , save once a-week or so , when an old neighbour visits it to scare away the rats .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 9]: I am on my way there now . '
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 6]: ` For what purpose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 4]: asked the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 21]: ` To pass the night there , ' he replied ; ` and not to-night alone , but many nights .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 16]: This is a secret which I trust to you in case of any unexpected emergency .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 25]: You will not come , unless in case of strong necessity , to me ; from dusk to broad day I shall be there .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 24]: Emma , your daughter , and the rest , suppose me out of London , as I have been until within this hour .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 5]: Do not undeceive them .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 9]: This is the errand I am bound upon .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 23]: I know I may confide it to you , and I rely upon your questioning me no more at this time . '
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 53]: With that , as if to change the theme , he led the astounded locksmith back to the night of the Maypole highwayman , to the robbery of Edward Chester , to the reappearance of the man at Mrs Rudge 's house , and to all the strange circumstances which afterwards occurred .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 80]: He even asked him carelessly about the man 's height , his face , his figure , whether he was like any one he had ever seen -- like Hugh , for instance , or any man he had known at any time -- and put many questions of that sort , which the locksmith , considering them as mere devices to engage his attention and prevent his expressing the astonishment he felt , answered pretty much at random .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 27]: At length , they arrived at the corner of the street in which the house stood , where Mr Haredale , alighting , dismissed the coach .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 28]: ` If you desire to see me safely lodged , ' he said , turning to the locksmith with a gloomy smile , ` you can . '
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 24]: Gabriel , to whom all former marvels had been nothing in comparison with this , followed him along the narrow pavement in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 33]: When they reached the door , Mr Haredale softly opened it with a key he had about him , and closing it when Varden entered , they were left in thorough darkness .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 9]: They groped their way into the ground-floor room .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 21]: Here Mr Haredale struck a light , and kindled a pocket taper he had brought with him for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 56]: It was then , when the flame was full upon him , that the locksmith saw for the first time how haggard , pale , and changed he looked ; how worn and thin he was ; how perfectly his whole appearance coincided with all that he had said so strangely as they rode along .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 24]: It was not an unnatural impulse in Gabriel , after what he had heard , to note curiously the expression of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 44]: It was perfectly collected and rational ; -- so much so , indeed , that he felt ashamed of his momentary suspicion , and drooped his own when Mr Haredale looked towards him , as if he feared they would betray his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 9]: ` Will you walk through the house ? '
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 21]: said Mr Haredale , with a glance towards the window , the crazy shutters of which were closed and fastened .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 5]: ` Speak low . '
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 23]: There was a kind of awe about the place , which would have rendered it difficult to speak in any other manner .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 11]: Gabriel whispered ` Yes , ' and followed him upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 10]: Everything was just as they had seen it last .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 31]: There was a sense of closeness from the exclusion of fresh air , and a gloom and heaviness around , as though long imprisonment had made the very silence sad .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 36]: The homely hangings of the beds and windows had begun to droop ; the dust lay thick upon their dwindling folds ; and damps had made their way through ceiling , wall , and floor .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 61]: The boards creaked beneath their tread , as if resenting the unaccustomed intrusion ; nimble spiders , paralysed by the taper 's glare , checked the motion of their hundred legs upon the wall , or dropped like lifeless things upon the ground ; the death-watch ticked ; and the scampering feet of rats and mice rattled behind the wainscot .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 34]: As they looked about them on the decaying furniture , it was strange to find how vividly it presented those to whom it had belonged , and with whom it was once familiar .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 37]: Grip seemed to perch again upon his high-backed chair ; Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite corner by the fire ; the mother to resume her usual seat , and watch him as of old .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 56]: Even when they could separate these objects from the phantoms of the mind which they invoked , the latter only glided out of sight , but lingered near them still ; for then they seemed to lurk in closets and behind the doors , ready to start out and suddenly accost them in well-remembered tones .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 15]: They went downstairs , and again into the room they had just now left .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 31]: Mr Haredale unbuckled his sword and laid it on the table , with a pair of pocket pistols ; then told the locksmith he would light him to the door .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 24]: ` But this is a dull place , sir , ' said Gabriel lingering ; ` may no one share your watch ? '
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 22]: He shook his head , and so plainly evinced his wish to be alone , that Gabriel could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 40]: In another moment the locksmith was standing in the street , whence he could see that the light once more travelled upstairs , and soon returning to the room below , shone brightly through the chinks of the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 16]: If ever man were sorely puzzled and perplexed , the locksmith was , that night .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 91]: Even when snugly seated by his own fireside , with Mrs Varden opposite in a nightcap and night-jacket , and Dolly beside him -LRB- in a most distracting dishabille -RRB- curling her hair , and smiling as if she had never cried in all her life and never could -- even then , with Toby at his elbow and his pipe in his mouth , and Miggs -LRB- but that perhaps was not much -RRB- falling asleep in the background , he could not quite discard his wonder and uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 46]: So in his dreams -- still there was Mr Haredale , haggard and careworn , listening in the solitary house to every sound that stirred , with the taper shining through the chinks until the day should turn it pale and end his lonely watching .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 25]: Chapter 43 Next morning brought no satisfaction to the locksmith 's thoughts , nor next day , nor the next , nor many others .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 54]: Often after nightfall he entered the street , and turned his eyes towards the well-known house ; and as surely as he did so , there was the solitary light , still gleaming through the crevices of the window-shutter , while all within was motionless , noiseless , cheerless , as a grave .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 31]: Unwilling to hazard Mr Haredale 's favour by disobeying his strict injunction , he never ventured to knock at the door or to make his presence known in any way .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 23]: But whenever strong interest and curiosity attracted him to the spot -- which was not seldom -- the light was always there .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 22]: If he could have known what passed within , the knowledge would have yielded him no clue to this mysterious vigil .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 16]: At twilight , Mr Haredale shut himself up , and at daybreak he came forth .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 22]: He never missed a night , always came and went alone , and never varied his proceedings in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 8]: The manner of his watch was this .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 33]: At dusk , he entered the house in the same way as when the locksmith bore him company , kindled a light , went through the rooms , and narrowly examined them .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 28]: That done , he returned to the chamber on the ground-floor , and laying his sword and pistols on the table , sat by it until morning .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 28]: He usually had a book with him , and often tried to read , but never fixed his eyes or thoughts upon it for five minutes together .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 22]: The slightest noise without doors , caught his ear ; a step upon the pavement seemed to make his heart leap .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 31]: He was not without some refreshment during the long lonely hours ; generally carrying in his pocket a sandwich of bread and meat , and a small flask of wine .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 42]: The latter diluted with large quantities of water , he drank in a heated , feverish way , as though his throat were dried ; but he scarcely ever broke his fast , by so much as a crumb of bread .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 76]: If this voluntary sacrifice of sleep and comfort had its origin , as the locksmith on consideration was disposed to think , in any superstitious expectation of the fulfilment of a dream or vision connected with the event on which he had brooded for so many years , and if he waited for some ghostly visitor who walked abroad when men lay sleeping in their beds , he showed no trace of fear or wavering .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 81]: His stern features expressed inflexible resolution ; his brows were puckered , and his lips compressed , with deep and settled purpose ; and when he started at a noise and listened , it was not with the start of fear but hope , and catching up his sword as though the hour had come at last , he would clutch it in his tight-clenched hand , and listen with sparkling eyes and eager looks , until it died away .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 20]: These disappointments were numerous , for they ensued on almost every sound , but his constancy was not shaken .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 33]: Still , every night he was at his post , the same stern , sleepless , sentinel ; and still night passed , and morning dawned , and he must watch again .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 54]: This went on for weeks ; he had taken a lodging at Vauxhall in which to pass the day and rest himself ; and from this place , when the tide served , he usually came to London Bridge from Westminster by water , in order that he might avoid the busy streets .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 38]: One evening , shortly before twilight , he came his accustomed road upon the river 's bank , intending to pass through Westminster Hall into Palace Yard , and there take boat to London Bridge as usual .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 43]: There was a pretty large concourse of people assembled round the Houses of Parliament , looking at the members as they entered and departed , and giving vent to rather noisy demonstrations of approval or dislike , according to their known opinions .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 68]: As he made his way among the throng , he heard once or twice the No-Popery cry , which was then becoming pretty familiar to the ears of most men ; but holding it in very slight regard , and observing that the idlers were of the lowest grade , he neither thought nor cared about it , but made his way along , with perfect indifference .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 142]: There were many little knots and groups of persons in Westminster Hall : some few looking upward at its noble ceiling , and at the rays of evening light , tinted by the setting sun , which streamed in aslant through its small windows , and growing dimmer by degrees , were quenched in the gathering gloom below ; some , noisy passengers , mechanics going home from work , and otherwise , who hurried quickly through , waking the echoes with their voices , and soon darkening the small door in the distance , as they passed into the street beyond ; some , in busy conference together on political or private matters , pacing slowly up and down with eyes that sought the ground , and seeming , by their attitudes , to listen earnestly from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 90]: Here , a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air ; there , a solitary man , half clerk , half mendicant , paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait ; at his elbow passed an errand-lad , swinging his basket round and round , and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof ; while a more observant schoolboy , half-way through , pocketed his ball , and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 31]: It was that time of evening when , if you shut your eyes and open them again , the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 53]: The smooth-worn pavement , dusty with footsteps , still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly , save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder , and drowned all other noises in its rolling sound .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 43]: Mr Haredale , glancing only at such of these groups as he passed nearest to , and then in a manner betokening that his thoughts were elsewhere , had nearly traversed the Hall , when two persons before him caught his attention .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 97]: One of these , a gentleman in elegant attire , carried in his hand a cane , which he twirled in a jaunty manner as he loitered on ; the other , an obsequious , crouching , fawning figure , listened to what he said -- at times throwing in a humble word himself -- and , with his shoulders shrugged up to his ears , rubbed his hands submissively , or answered at intervals by an inclination of the head , half-way between a nod of acquiescence , and a bow of most profound respect .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 43]: In the abstract there was nothing very remarkable in this pair , for servility waiting on a handsome suit of clothes and a cane -- not to speak of gold and silver sticks , or wands of office -- is common enough .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 26]: But there was that about the well-dressed man , yes , and about the other likewise , which struck Mr Haredale with no pleasant feeling .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 39]: He hesitated , stopped , and would have stepped aside and turned out of his path , but at the moment , the other two faced about quickly , and stumbled upon him before he could avoid them .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 39]: The gentleman with the cane lifted his hat and had begun to tender an apology , which Mr Haredale had begun as hastily to acknowledge and walk away , when he stopped short and cried , ` Haredale !
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 10]: Gad bless me , this is strange indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 34]: ` It is , ' he returned impatiently ; ` yes -- a -- ' ` My dear friend , ' cried the other , detaining him , ` why such great speed ?
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 14]: One minute , Haredale , for the sake of old acquaintance . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 9]: I am in haste , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 9]: ` Neither of us has sought this meeting .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 7]: Let it be a brief one .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 6]: ` Fie , fie ! '
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 15]: replied Sir John -LRB- for it was he -RRB- , ` how very churlish !
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 6]: We were speaking of you .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 14]: Your name was on my lips -- perhaps you heard me mention it ?
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 2]: No ?
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 6]: I am sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 5]: I am really sorry .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 9]: -- You know our friend here , Haredale ?
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 9]: This is really a most remarkable meeting ! '
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 35]: The friend , plainly very ill at ease , had made bold to press Sir John 's arm , and to give him other significant hints that he was desirous of avoiding this introduction .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 46]: As it did not suit Sir John 's purpose , however , that it should be evaded , he appeared quite unconscious of these silent remonstrances , and inclined his hand towards him , as he spoke , to call attention to him more particularly .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 36]: The friend , therefore , had nothing for it , but to muster up the pleasantest smile he could , and to make a conciliatory bow , as Mr Haredale turned his eyes upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 27]: Seeing that he was recognised , he put out his hand in an awkward and embarrassed manner , which was not mended by its contemptuous rejection .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 5]: ` Mr Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 5]: said Haredale , coldly .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 9]: ` It is as I have heard then .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 28]: You have left the darkness for the light , sir , and hate those whose opinions you formerly held , with all the bitterness of a renegade .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 11]: You are an honour , sir , to any cause .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 19]: I wish the one you espouse at present , much joy of the acquisition it has made . '
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 21]: The secretary rubbed his hands and bowed , as though he would disarm his adversary by humbling himself before him .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 26]: Sir John Chester again exclaimed , with an air of great gaiety , ` Now , really , this is a most remarkable meeting ! '
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 11]: and took a pinch of snuff with his usual self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 64]: ` Mr Haredale , ' said Gashford , stealthily raising his eyes , and letting them drop again when they met the other 's steady gaze , is too conscientious , too honourable , too manly , I am sure , to attach unworthy motives to an honest change of opinions , even though it implies a doubt of those he holds himself .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 25]: Mr Haredale is too just , too generous , too clear-sighted in his moral vision , to -- ' ` Yes , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 12]: he rejoined with a sarcastic smile , finding the secretary stopped .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 22]: ` You were saying ' -- Gashford meekly shrugged his shoulders , and looking on the ground again , was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 34]: ` No , but let us really , ' interposed Sir John at this juncture , ` let us really , for a moment , contemplate the very remarkable character of this meeting .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 20]: Haredale , my dear friend , pardon me if I think you are not sufficiently impressed with its singularity .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 78]: Here we stand , by no previous appointment or arrangement , three old schoolfellows , in Westminster Hall ; three old boarders in a remarkably dull and shady seminary at Saint Omer 's , where you , being Catholics and of necessity educated out of England , were brought up ; and where I , being a promising young Protestant at that time , was sent to learn the French tongue from a native of Paris ! '
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 122]: ` Add to the singularity , Sir John , ' said Mr Haredale , ` that some of you Protestants of promise are at this moment leagued in yonder building , to prevent our having the surpassing and unheard-of privilege of teaching our children to read and write -- here -- in this land , where thousands of us enter your service every year , and to preserve the freedom of which , we die in bloody battles abroad , in heaps : and that others of you , to the number of some thousands as I learn , are led on to look on all men of my creed as wolves and beasts of prey , by this man Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 53]: Add to it besides the bare fact that this man lives in society , walks the streets in broad day -- I was about to say , holds up his head , but that he does not -- and it will be strange , and very strange , I grant you . '
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 17]: you are hard upon our friend , ' replied Sir John , with an engaging smile .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 11]: ` You are really very hard upon our friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 18]: ` Let him go on , Sir John , ' said Gashford , fumbling with his gloves .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 6]: ` Let him go on .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 8]: I can make allowances , Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 17]: I am honoured with your good opinion , and I can dispense with Mr Haredale 's .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 19]: Mr Haredale is a sufferer from the penal laws , and I ca n't expect his favour . '
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 41]: ` You have so much of my favour , sir , ' retorted Mr Haredale , with a bitter glance at the third party in their conversation , ` that I am glad to see you in such good company .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 13]: You are the essence of your great Association , in yourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 18]: ` Now , there you mistake , ' said Sir John , in his most benignant way .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 25]: ` There -- which is a most remarkable circumstance for a man of your punctuality and exactness , Haredale -- you fall into error .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 42]: I do n't belong to the body ; I have an immense respect for its members , but I do n't belong to it ; although I am , it is certainly true , the conscientious opponent of your being relieved .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 23]: I feel it my duty to be so ; it is a most unfortunate necessity ; and cost me a bitter struggle .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 7]: -- Will you try this box ?
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 24]: If you do n't object to a trifling infusion of a very chaste scent , you 'll find its flavour exquisite . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 42]: I ask your pardon , Sir John , ' said Mr Haredale , declining the proffer with a motion of his hand , ` for having ranked you among the humble instruments who are obvious and in all men 's sight .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 10]: I should have done more justice to your genius .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 20]: Men of your capacity plot in secrecy and safety , and leave exposed posts to the duller wits . '
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 37]: ` Do n't apologise , for the world , ' replied Sir John sweetly ; ` old friends like you and I , may be allowed some freedoms , or the deuce is in it . '
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 45]: Gashford , who had been very restless all this time , but had not once looked up , now turned to Sir John , and ventured to mutter something to the effect that he must go , or my lord would perhaps be waiting .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 77]: ` Do n't distress yourself , good sir , ' said Mr Haredale , ` I 'll take my leave , and put you at your ease -- ' which he was about to do without ceremony , when he was stayed by a buzz and murmur at the upper end of the hall , and , looking in that direction , saw Lord George Gordon coming in , with a crowd of people round him .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 48]: There was a lurking look of triumph , though very differently expressed , in the faces of his two companions , which made it a natural impulse on Mr Haredale 's part not to give way before this leader , but to stand there while he passed .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 43]: He drew himself up and , clasping his hands behind him , looked on with a proud and scornful aspect , while Lord George slowly advanced -LRB- for the press was great about him -RRB- towards the spot where they were standing .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 83]: He had left the House of Commons but that moment , and had come straight down into the Hall , bringing with him , as his custom was , intelligence of what had been said that night in reference to the Papists , and what petitions had been presented in their favour , and who had supported them , and when the bill was to be brought in , and when it would be advisable to present their own Great Protestant petition .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 21]: All this he told the persons about him in a loud voice , and with great abundance of ungainly gesture .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 75]: Those who were nearest him made comments to each other , and vented threats and murmurings ; those who were outside the crowd cried , ` Silence , ' and Stand back , ' or closed in upon the rest , endeavouring to make a forcible exchange of places : and so they came driving on in a very disorderly and irregular way , as it is the manner of a crowd to do .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 51]: When they were very near to where the secretary , Sir John , and Mr Haredale stood , Lord George turned round and , making a few remarks of a sufliciently violent and incoherent kind , concluded with the usual sentiment , and called for three cheers to back it .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 28]: While these were in the act of being given with great energy , he extricated himself from the press , and stepped up to Gashford 's side .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 25]: Both he and Sir John being well known to the populace , they fell back a little , and left the four standing together .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 25]: ` Mr Haredale , Lord George , ' said Sir John Chester , seeing that the nobleman regarded him with an inquisitive look . '
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 24]: A Catholic gentleman unfortunately -- most unhappily a Catholic -- but an esteemed acquaintance of mine , and once of Mr Gashford 's .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 12]: My dear Haredale , this is Lord George Gordon . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 22]: I should have known that , had I been ignorant of his lordship 's person , ' said Mr Haredale . '
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 37]: I hope there is but one gentleman in England who , addressing an ignorant and excited throng , would speak of a large body of his fellow-subjects in such injurious language as I heard this moment .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 11]: For shame , my lord , for shame ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 37]: I can not talk to you , sir , ' replied Lord George in a loud voice , and waving his hand in a disturbed and agitated manner ; ` we have nothing in common . '
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 45]: ` We have much in common -- many things -- all that the Almighty gave us , ' said Mr Haredale ; ` and common charity , not to say common sense and common decency , should teach you to refrain from these proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 40]: If every one of those men had arms in their hands at this moment , as they have them in their heads , I would not leave this place without telling you that you disgrace your station . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 25]: I do n't hear you , sir , ' he replied in the same manner as before ; ' I ca n't hear you .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 9]: It is indifferent to me what you say .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 33]: Do n't retort , Gashford , ' for the secretary had made a show of wishing to do so ; ' I can hold no communion with the worshippers of idols . '
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 40]: As he said this , he glanced at Sir John , who lifted his hands and eyebrows , as if deploring the intemperate conduct of Mr Haredale , and smiled in admiration of the crowd and of their leader .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 5]: ` HE retort ! '
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 3]: cried Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 8]: ` Look you here , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 7]: Do you know this man ? '
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 24]: Lord George replied by laying his hand upon the shoulder of his cringing secretary , and viewing him with a smile of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 161]: ` This man , ' said Mr Haredale , eyeing him from top to toe , ` who in his boyhood was a thief , and has been from that time to this , a servile , false , and truckling knave : this man , who has crawled and crept through life , wounding the hands he licked , and biting those he fawned upon : this sycophant , who never knew what honour , truth , or courage meant ; who robbed his benefactor 's daughter of her virtue , and married her to break her heart , and did it , with stripes and cruelty : this creature , who has whined at kitchen windows for the broken food , and begged for halfpence at our chapel doors : this apostle of the faith , whose tender conscience can not bear the altars where his vicious life was publicly denounced -- Do you know this man ? '
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 16]: ` Oh , really -- you are very , very hard upon our friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 4]: exclaimed Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 57]: ` Let Mr Haredale go on , ' said Gashford , upon whose unwholesome face the perspiration had broken out during this speech , in blotches of wet ; ' I do n't mind him , Sir John ; it 's quite as indifferent to me what he says , as it is to my lord .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 22]: If he reviles my lord , as you have heard , Sir John , how can I hope to escape ? '
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 80]: ` Is it not enough , my lord , ' Mr Haredale continued , ` that I , as good a gentleman as you , must hold my property , such as it is , by a trick at which the state connives because of these hard laws ; and that we may not teach our youth in schools the common principles of right and wrong ; but must we be denounced and ridden by such men as this !
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 10]: Here is a man to head your No-Popery cry !
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 3]: For shame .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 4]: For shame ! '
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 47]: The infatuated nobleman had glanced more than once at Sir John Chester , as if to inquire whether there was any truth in these statements concerning Gashford , and Sir John had as often plainly answered by a shrug or look , ` Oh dear me !
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 3]: no . '
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 39]: He now said , in the same loud key , and in the same strange manner as before : ' I have nothing to say , sir , in reply , and no desire to hear anything more .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 17]: I beg you wo n't obtrude your conversation , or these personal attacks , upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 36]: I shall not be deterred from doing my duty to my country and my countrymen , by any such attempts , whether they proceed from emissaries of the Pope or not , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 5]: Come , Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 23]: They had walked on a few paces while speaking , and were now at the Hall-door , through which they passed together .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 29]: Mr Haredale , without any leave-taking , turned away to the river stairs , which were close at hand , and hailed the only boatman who remained there .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 113]: But the throng of people -- the foremost of whom had heard every word that Lord George Gordon said , and among all of whom the rumour had been rapidly dispersed that the stranger was a Papist who was bearding him for his advocacy of the popular cause -- came pouring out pell-mell , and , forcing the nobleman , his secretary , and Sir John Chester on before them , so that they appeared to be at their head , crowded to the top of the stairs where Mr Haredale waited until the boat was ready , and there stood still , leaving him on a little clear space by himself .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 10]: They were not silent , however , though inactive .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 28]: At first some indistinct mutterings arose among them , which were followed by a hiss or two , and these swelled by degrees into a perfect storm .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 12]: Then one voice said , ` Down with the Papists ! '
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 12]: and there was a pretty general cheer , but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 37]: After a lull of a few moments , one man cried out , ` Stone him ; ' another , ` Duck him ; ' another , in a stentorian voice , ` No Popery ! '
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 25]: This favourite cry the rest re-echoed , and the mob , which might have been two hundred strong , joined in a general shout .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 34]: Mr Haredale had stood calmly on the brink of the steps , until they made this demonstration , when he looked round contemptuously , and walked at a slow pace down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 50]: He was pretty near the boat , when Gashford , as if without intention , turned about , and directly afterwards a great stone was thrown by some hand , in the crowd , which struck him on the head , and made him stagger like a drunken man .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 14]: The blood sprung freely from the wound , and trickled down his coat .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 28]: He turned directly , and rushing up the steps with a boldness and passion which made them all fall back , demanded : ` Who did that ?
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 9]: Show me the man who hit me . '
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 31]: Not a soul moved ; except some in the rear who slunk off , and , escaping to the other side of the way , looked on like indifferent spectators .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 6]: ` Who did that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 9]: ` Show me the man who did it .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 6]: Dog , was it you ?
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 15]: It was your deed , if not your hand -- I know you . '
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 18]: He threw himself on Gashford as he said the words , and hurled him to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 28]: There was a sudden motion in the crowd , and some laid hands upon him , but his sword was out , and they fell off again .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 32]: ` My lord -- Sir John , ' -- he cried , ` draw , one of you -- you are responsible for this outrage , and I look to you .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 8]: Draw , if you are gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 35]: With that he struck Sir John upon the breast with the flat of his weapon , and with a burning face and flashing eyes stood upon his guard ; alone , before them all .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 35]: For an instant , for the briefest space of time the mind can readily conceive , there was a change in Sir John 's smooth face , such as no man ever saw there .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 29]: The next moment , he stepped forward , and laid one hand on Mr Haredale 's arm , while with the other he endeavoured to appease the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 34]: ` My dear friend , my good Haredale , you are blinded with passion -- it 's very natural , extremely natural -- but you do n't know friends from foes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 21]: I know them all , sir , I can distinguish well -- ' he retorted , almost mad with rage .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 12]: ` Sir John , Lord George -- do you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 5]: Are you cowards ? '
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 31]: ` Never mind , sir , ' said a man , forcing his way between and pushing him towards the stairs with friendly violence , ` never mind asking that .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 8]: For God 's sake , get away .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 8]: What CAN you do against this number ?
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 48]: And there are as many more in the next street , who 'll be round dfrectly , ' -- indeed they began to pour in as he said the words -- ` you 'd be giddy from that cut , in the first heat of a scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 37]: Now do retire , sir , or take my word for it you 'll be worse used than you would be if every man in the crowd was a woman , and that woman Bloody Mary .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 14]: Come , sir , make haste -- as quick as you can . '
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 29]: Mr Haredale , who began to turn faint and sick , felt how sensible this advice was , and descended the steps with his unknown friend 's assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 52]: John Grueby -LRB- for John it was -RRB- helped him into the boat , and giving her a shove off , which sent her thirty feet into the tide , bade the waterman pull away like a Briton ; and walked up again as composedly as if he had just landed .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 82]: There was at first a slight disposition on the part of the mob to resent this interference ; but John looking particularly strong and cool , and wearing besides Lord George 's livery , they thought better of it , and contented themselves with sending a shower of small missiles after the boat , which plashed harmlessly in the water ; for she had by this time cleared the bridge , and was darting swiftly down the centre of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 28]: From this amusement , they proceeded to giving Protestant knocks at the doors of private houses , breaking a few lamps , and assaulting some stray constables .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 32]: But , it being whispered that a detachment of Life Guards had been sent for , they took to their heels with great expedition , and left the street quite clear .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 34]: Chapter 44 When the concourse separated , and , dividing into chance clusters , drew off in various directions , there still remained upon the scene of the late disturbance , one man .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 50]: This man was Gashford , who , bruised by his late fall , and hurt in a much greater degree by the indignity he had undergone , and the exposure of which he had been the victim , limped up and down , breathing curses and threats of vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 14]: It was not the secretary 's nature to waste his wrath in words .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 62]: While he vented the froth of his malevolence in those effusions , he kept a steady eye on two men , who , having disappeared with the rest when the alarm was spread , had since returned , and were now visible in the moonlight , at no great distance , as they walked to and fro , and talked together .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 33]: He made no move towards them , but waited patiently on the dark side of the street , until they were tired of strolling backwards and forwards and walked away in company .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 27]: Then he followed , but at some distance : keeping them in view , without appearing to have that object , or being seen by them .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 43]: They went up Parliament Street , past Saint Martin 's church , and away by Saint Giles 's to Tottenham Court Road , at the back of which , upon the western side , was then a place called the Green Lanes .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 17]: This was a retired spot , not of the choicest kind , leading into the fields .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 147]: Great heaps of ashes ; stagnant pools , overgrown with rank grass and duckweed ; broken turnstiles ; and the upright posts of palings long since carried off for firewood , which menaced all heedless walkers with their jagged and rusty nails ; were the leading features of the landscape : while here and there a donkey , or a ragged horse , tethered to a stake , and cropping off a wretched meal from the coarse stunted turf , were quite in keeping with the scene , and would have suggested -LRB- if the houses had not done so , sufficiently , of themselves -RRB- how very poor the people were who lived in the crazy huts adjacent , and how foolhardy it might prove for one who carried money , or wore decent clothes , to walk that way alone , unless by daylight .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 13]: Poverty has its whims and shows of taste , as wealth has .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 51]: Some of these cabins were turreted , some had false windows painted on their rotten walls ; one had a mimic clock , upon a crazy tower of four feet high , which screened the chimney ; each in its little patch of ground had a rude seat or arbour .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 23]: The population dealt in bones , in rags , in broken glass , in old wheels , in birds , and dogs .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 41]: These , in their several ways of stowage , filled the gardens ; and shedding a perfume , not of the most delicious nature , in the air , filled it besides with yelps , and screams , and howling .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 44]: Into this retreat , the secretary followed the two men whom he had held in sight ; and here he saw them safely lodged , in one of the meanest houses , which was but a room , and that of small dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 50]: He waited without , until the sound of their voices , joined in a discordant song , assured him they were making merry ; and then approaching the door , by means of a tottering plank which crossed the ditch in front , knocked at it with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 22]: ` Muster Gashfordl ' said the man who opened it , taking his pipe from his mouth , in evident surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 12]: ` Why , who 'd have thought of this here honour !
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 12]: Walk in , Muster Gashford -- walk in , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 13]: Gashford required no second invitation , and entered with a gracious air .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 34]: There was a fire in the rusty grate -LRB- for though the spring was pretty far advanced , the nights were cold -RRB- , and on a stool beside it Hugh sat smoking .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 39]: Dennis placed a chair , his only one , for the secretary , in front of the hearth ; and took his seat again upon the stool he had left when he rose to give the visitor admission .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 12]: ` What 's in the wind now , Muster Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 15]: he said , as he resumed his pipe , and looked at him askew .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 6]: ` Any orders from head-quarters ?
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 6]: Are we going to begin ?
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 8]: What is it , Muster Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 19]: ` Oh , nothing , nothing , ' rejoined the secretary , with a friendly nod to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 9]: ` We have broken the ice , though .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 13]: We had a little spurt to-day -- eh , Dennis ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 10]: A very little one , ' growled the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 8]: ` Not half enough for me . '
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 6]: ` Nor me neither ! '
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 18]: ` Give us something to do with life in it -- with life in it , master .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 5]: Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 40]: ` Why , you would n't , ' said the secretary , with his worst expression of face , and in his mildest tones , ` have anything to do , with -- with death in it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 10]: I do n't know that , ' replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 7]: ` I 'm open to orders .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 13]: I do n't care ; not I. ' ` Nor I ! '
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 3]: vociferated Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 5]: ` Brave fellows ! '
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 24]: said the secretary , in as pastor-like a voice as if he were commending them for some uncommon act of valour and generosity .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 28]: ` By the bye ' -- and here he stopped and warmed his hands : then suddenly looked up -- ` who threw that stone to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 19]: Mr Dennis coughed and shook his head , as who should say , ' A mystery indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 7]: Hugh sat and smoked in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 7]: ` It was well done ! '
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 10]: said the secretary , warming his hands again . '
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 9]: I should like to know that man . '
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 5]: ` Would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 16]: said Dennis , after looking at his face to assure himself that he was serious .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 14]: ` Would you like to know that man , Muster Gashford ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 9]: I should indeed , ' replied the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 32]: ` Why then , Lord love you , ' said the hangman , in his hoarest chuckle , as he pointed with his pipe to Hugh , ` there he sits .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 5]: That 's the man .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 38]: My stars and halters , Muster Gashford , ' he added in a whisper , as he drew his stool close to him and jogged him with his elbow , ` what a interesting blade he is !
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 11]: He wants as much holding in as a thorough-bred bulldog .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 31]: If it had n't been for me to-day , he 'd have had that ` ere Roman down , and made a riot of it , in another minute . '
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 6]: ` And why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 14]: cried Hugh in a surly voice , as he overheard this last remark .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 10]: ` Where 's the good of putting things off ?
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 14]: Strike while the iron 's hot ; that 's what I say . '
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 30]: retorted Dennis , shaking his head , with a kind of pity for his friend 's ingenuous youth ; ` but suppose the iron a n't hot , brother !
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 18]: You must get people 's blood up afore you strike , and have 'em in the humour .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 14]: There was n't quite enough to provoke 'em to-day , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 21]: If you 'd had your way , you 'd have spoilt the fun to come , and ruined us . '
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 12]: ` Dennis is quite right , ' said Gashford , smoothly .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 6]: ` He is perfectly correct .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 10]: Dennis has great knowledge of the world . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 23]: I ought to have , Muster Gashford , seeing what a many people I 've helped out of it , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 11]: grinned the hangman , whispering the words behind his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 38]: The secretary laughed at this jest as much as Dennis could desire , and when he had done , said , turning to Hugh : ` Dennis 's policy was mine , as you may have observed .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 15]: You saw , for instance , how I fell when I was set upon .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 5]: I made no resistance .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 8]: I did nothing to provoke an outbreak .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 5]: Oh dear no ! '
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 9]: ` No , by the Lord Harry ! '
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 22]: cried Dennis with a noisy laugh , ` you went down very quiet , Muster Gashford -- and very flat besides .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 17]: I thinks to myself at the time `` it 's all up with Muster Gashford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 22]: I never see a man lay flatter nor more still -- with the life in him -- than you did to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 23]: He 's a rough ` un to play with , is that ` ere Papist , and that 's the fact . '
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 34]: The secretary 's face , as Dennis roared with laughter , and turned his wrinkled eyes on Hugh who did the like , might have furnished a study for the devil 's picture .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 71]: He sat quite silent until they were serious again , and then said , looking round : ` We are very pleasant here ; so very pleasant , Dennis , that but for my lord 's particular desire that I should sup with him , and the time being very near at hand , I should he inclined to stay , until it would be hardly safe to go homeward .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 16]: I come upon a little business -- yes , I do -- as you supposed .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 10]: It 's very flattering to you ; being this .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 41]: If we ever should be obliged -- and we ca n't tell , you know -- this is a very uncertain world ' -- ' I believe you , Muster Gashford , ' interposed the hangman with a grave nod .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 24]: ` The uncertainties as I 've seen in reference to this here state of existence , the unexpected contingencies as have come about !
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 6]: -- Oh my eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 22]: Feeling the subject much too vast for expression , he puffed at his pipe again , and looked the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 92]: I say , ' resumed the secretary , in a slow , impressive way ; ` we ca n't tell what may come to pass ; and if we should be obliged , against our wills , to have recourse to violence , my lord -LRB- who has suffered terribly to-day , as far as words can go -RRB- consigns to you two -- bearing in mind my recommendation of you both , as good staunch men , beyond all doubt and suspicion -- the pleasant task of punishing this Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 38]: You may do as you please with him , or his , provided that you show no mercy , and no quarter , and leave no two beams of his house standing where the builder placed them .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 50]: You may sack it , burn it , do with it as you like , but it must come down ; it must be razed to the ground ; and he , and all belonging to him , left as shelterless as new-born infants whom their mothers have exposed .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 12]: said Gashford , pausing , and pressing his hands together gently .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 7]: ` Understand you , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 6]: ` You speak plain now .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 8]: Why , this is hearty ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 23]: I knew you would like it , ' said Gashford , shaking him by the hand ; ' I thought you would .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 3]: Good night !
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 14]: Do n't rise , Dennis : I would rather find my way alone .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 21]: I may have to make other visits here , and it 's pleasant to come and go without disturbing you .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 8]: I can find my way perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 12]: He was gone , and had shut the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 16]: They looked at each other , and nodded approvingly : Dennis stirred up the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 10]: ` This looks a little more like business ! '
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 6]: ` Ay , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 9]: cried Hugh ; ` this suits me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 35]: ` I 've heerd it said of Muster Gashford , ' said the hangman , ` that he 'd a surprising memory and wonderful firmness -- that he never forgot , and never forgave .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 8]: -- Let 's drink his health ! '
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 33]: Hugh readily complied -- pouring no liquor on the floor when he drank this toast -- and they pledged the secretary as a man after their own hearts , in a bumper .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 74]: Chapter 45 While the worst passions of the worst men were thus working in the dark , and the mantle of religion , assumed to cover the ugliest deformities , threatened to become the shroud of all that was good and peaceful in society , a circumstance occurred which once more altered the position of two persons from whom this history has long been separated , and to whom it must now return .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 87]: In a small English country town , the inhabitants of which supported themselves by the labour of their hands in plaiting and preparing straw for those who made bonnets and other articles of dress and ornament from that material , -- concealed under an assumed name , and living in a quiet poverty which knew no change , no pleasures , and few cares but that of struggling on from day to day in one great toil for bread , -- dwelt Barnaby and his mother .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 43]: Their poor cottage had known no stranger 's foot since they sought the shelter of its roof five years before ; nor had they in all that time held any commerce or communication with the old world from which they had fled .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 23]: To labour in peace , and devote her labour and her life to her poor son , was all the widow sought .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 26]: If happiness can be said at any time to be the lot of one on whom a secret sorrow preys , she was happy now .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 35]: Tranquillity , resignation , and her strong love of him who needed it so much , formed the small circle of her quiet joys ; and while that remained unbroken , she was contented .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 18]: For Barnaby himself , the time which had flown by , had passed him like the wind .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 27]: The daily suns of years had shed no brighter gleam of reason on his mind ; no dawn had broken on his long , dark night .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 61]: He would sit sometimes -- often for days together on a low seat by the fire or by the cottage door , busy at work -LRB- for he had learnt the art his mother plied -RRB- , and listening , God help him , to the tales she would repeat , as a lure to keep him in her sight .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 63]: He had no recollection of these little narratives ; the tale of yesterday was new to him upon the morrow ; but he liked them at the moment ; and when the humour held him , would remain patiently within doors , hearing her stories like a little child , and working cheerfully from sunrise until it was too dark to see .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 41]: At other times , -- and then their scanty earnings were barely sufficient to furnish them with food , though of the coarsest sort , -- he would wander abroad from dawn of day until the twilight deepened into night .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 24]: Few in that place , even of the children , could be idle , and he had no companions of his own kind .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 22]: Indeed there were not many who could have kept up with him in his rambles , had there been a legion .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 21]: But there were a score of vagabond dogs belonging to the neighbours , who served his purpose quite as well .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 82]: With two or three of these , or sometimes with a full half-dozen barking at his heels , he would sally forth on some long expedition that consumed the day ; and though , on their return at nightfall , the dogs would come home limping and sore-footed , and almost spent with their fatigue , Barnaby was up and off again at sunrise with some new attendants of the same class , with whom he would return in like manner .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 46]: On all these travels , Grip , in his little basket at his master 's back , was a constant member of the party , and when they set off in fine weather and in high spirits , no dog barked louder than the raven .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 9]: Their pleasures on these excursions were simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 22]: A crust of bread and scrap of meat , with water from the brook or spring , sufficed for their repast .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 73]: Barnaby 's enjoyments were , to walk , and run , and leap , till he was tired ; then to lie down in the long grass , or by the growing corn , or in the shade of some tall tree , looking upward at the light clouds as they floated over the blue surface of the sky , and listening to the lark as she poured out her brilliant song .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 22]: There were wild-flowers to pluck -- the bright red poppy , the gentle harebell , the cowslip , and the rose .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 61]: There were birds to watch ; fish ; ants ; worms ; hares or rabbits , as they darted across the distant pathway in the wood and so were gone : millions of living things to have an interest in , and lie in wait for , and clap hands and shout in memory of , when they had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 90]: In default of these , or when they wearied , there was the merry sunlight to hunt out , as it crept in aslant through leaves and boughs of trees , and hid far down -- deep , deep , in hollow places -- like a silver pool , where nodding branches seemed to bathe and sport ; sweet scents of summer air breathing over fields of beans or clover ; the perfume of wet leaves or moss ; the life of waving trees , and shadows always changing .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 52]: When these or any of them tired , or in excess of pleasing tempted him to shut his eyes , there was slumber in the midst of all these soft delights , with the gentle wind murmuring like music in his ears , and everything around melting into one delicious dream .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 44]: Their hut -- for it was little more -- stood on the outskirts of the town , at a short distance from the high road , but in a secluded place , where few chance passengers strayed at any season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 25]: It had a plot of garden-ground attached , which Barnaby , in fits and starts of working , trimmed , and kept in order .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 29]: Within doors and without , his mother laboured for their common good ; and hail , rain , snow , or sunshine , found no difference in her .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 41]: Though so far removed from the scenes of her past life , and with so little thought or hope of ever visiting them again , she seemed to have a strange desire to know what happened in the busy world .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 17]: Any old newspaper , or scrap of intelligence from London , she caught at with avidity .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 33]: The excitement it produced was not of a pleasurable kind , for her manner at such times expressed the keenest anxiety and dread ; but it never faded in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 42]: Then , and in stormy winter nights , when the wind blew loud and strong , the old expression came into her face , and she would be seized with a fit of trembling , like one who had an ague .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 29]: But Barnaby noted little of this ; and putting a great constraint upon herself , she usually recovered her accustomed manner before the change had caught his observation .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 15]: Grip was by no means an idle or unprofitable member of the humble household .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 46]: Partly by dint of Barnaby 's tuition , and partly by pursuing a species of self-instruction common to his tribe , and exerting his powers of observation to the utmost , he had acquired a degree of sagacity which rendered him famous for miles round .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 56]: His conversational powers and surprising performances were the universal theme : and as many persons came to see the wonderful raven , and none left his exertions unrewarded -- when he condescended to exhibit , which was not always , for genius is capricious -- his earnings formed an important item in the common stock .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 90]: Indeed , the bird himself appeared to know his value well ; for though he was perfectly free and unrestrained in the presence of Barnaby and his mother , he maintained in public an amazing gravity , and never stooped to any other gratuitous performances than biting the ankles of vagabond boys -LRB- an exercise in which he much delighted -RRB- , killing a fowl or two occasionally , and swallowing the dinners of various neighbouring dogs , of whom the boldest held him in great awe and dread .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 45]: Time had glided on in this way , and nothing had happened to disturb or change their mode of life , when , one summer 's night in June , they were in their little garden , resting from the labours of the day .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 41]: The widow 's work was yet upon her knee , and strewn upon the ground about her ; and Barnaby stood leaning on his spade , gazing at the brightness in the west , and singing softly to himself . '
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 6]: A brave evening , mother !
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 33]: If we had , chinking in our pockets , but a few specks of that gold which is piled up yonder in the sky , we should be rich for life . '
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 17]: ` We are better as we are , ' returned the widow with a quiet smile .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 28]: ` Let us be contented , and we do not want and need not care to have it , though it lay shining at our feet . '
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 34]: said Barnaby , resting with crossed arms on his spade , and looking wistfully at the sunset , that 's well enough , mother ; but gold 's a good thing to have .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 10]: I wish that I knew where to find it .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 15]: Grip and I could do much with gold , be sure of that . '
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 7]: ` What would you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 5]: A world of things .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 38]: We 'd dress finely -- you and I , I mean ; not Grip -- keep horses , dogs , wear bright colours and feathers , do no more work , live delicately and at our ease .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 19]: Oh , we 'd find uses for it , mother , and uses that would do us good .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 9]: I would I knew where gold was buried .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 11]: How hard I 'd work to dig it up ! '
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 59]: ` You do not know , ' said his mother , rising from her seat and laying her hand upon his shoulder , ` what men have done to win it , and how they have found , too late , that it glitters brightest at a distance , and turns quite dim and dull when handled . '
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 25]: ` Ay , ay ; so you say ; so you think , ' he answered , still looking eagerly in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 14]: ` For all that , mother , I should like to try . '
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 16]: ` Do you not see , ' she said , ` how red it is ?
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 11]: Nothing bears so many stains of blood , as gold .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 3]: Avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 12]: None have such cause to hate its name as we have .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 12]: Do not so much as think of it , dear love .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 26]: It has brought such misery and suffering on your head and mine as few have known , and God grant few may have to undergo .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 23]: I would rather we were dead and laid down in our graves , than you should ever come to love it . '
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 14]: For a moment Barnaby withdrew his eyes and looked at her with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 50]: Then , glancing from the redness in the sky to the mark upon his wrist as if he would compare the two , he seemed about to question her with earnestness , when a new object caught his wandering attention , and made him quite forgetful of his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 50]: This was a man with dusty feet and garments , who stood , bare-headed , behind the hedge that divided their patch of garden from the pathway , and leant meekly forward as if he sought to mingle with their conversation , and waited for his time to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 29]: His face was turned towards the brightness , too , but the light that fell upon it showed that he was blind , and saw it not . '
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 7]: A blessing on those voices ! '
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 5]: said the wayfarer . '
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 15]: I feel the beauty of the night more keenly , when I hear them .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 7]: They are like eyes to me .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 15]: Will they speak again , and cheer the heart of a poor traveller ? '
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 7]: ` Have you no guide ? '
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 10]: asked the widow , after a moment 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 33]: ` None but that , ' he answered , pointing with his staff towards the sun ; ` and sometimes a milder one at night , but she is idle now . '
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 8]: ` Have you travelled far ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 17]: A weary way and long , ' rejoined the traveller as he shook his head . '
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 7]: A weary , weary , way .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 27]: I struck my stick just now upon the bucket of your well -- be pleased to let me have a draught of water , lady . '
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 9]: ` Why do you call me lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 4]: she returned . '
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 8]: I am as poor as you . '
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 19]: ` Your speech is soft and gentle , and I judge by that , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 21]: ` The coarsest stuffs and finest silks , are -- apart from the sense of touch -- alike to me .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 10]: I can not judge you by your dress . '
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 24]: ` Come round this way , ' said Barnaby , who had passed out at the garden-gate and now stood close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 7]: ` Put your hand in mine .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 11]: You 're blind and always in the dark , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 7]: Are you frightened in the dark ?
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 10]: Do you see great crowds of faces , now ?
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 7]: Do they grin and chatter ? '
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 4]: ` Alas ! '
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 9]: returned the other , ' I see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 7]: Waking or sleeping , nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 26]: Barnaby looked curiously at his eyes , and touching them with his fingers , as an inquisitive child might , led him towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 19]: ` You have come a long distance , ` said the widow , meeting him at the door .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 11]: ` How have you found your way so far ? '
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 47]: ` Use and necessity are good teachers , as I have heard -- the best of any , ' said the blind man , sitting down upon the chair to which Barnaby had led him , and putting his hat and stick upon the red-tiled floor .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 12]: ` May neither you nor your son ever learn under them .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 6]: They are rough masters . '
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 21]: ` You have wandered from the road , too , ' said the widow , in a tone of pity .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 30]: ` Maybe , maybe , ' returned the blind man with a sigh , and yet with something of a smile upon his face , ` that 's likely .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 11]: Handposts and milestones are dumb , indeed , to me .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 14]: Thank you the more for this rest , and this refreshing drink ! '
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 14]: As he spoke , he raised the mug of water to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 37]: It was clear , and cold , and sparkling , but not to his taste nevertheless , or his thirst was not very great , for he only wetted his lips and put it down again .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 25]: He wore , hanging with a long strap round his neck , a kind of scrip or wallet , in which to carry food .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 38]: The widow set some bread and cheese before him , but he thanked her , and said that through the kindness of the charitable he had broken his fast once since morning , and was not hungry .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 28]: When he had made her this reply , he opened his wallet , and took out a few pence , which was all it appeared to contain .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 45]: ` Might I make bold to ask , ' he said , turning towards where Barnaby stood looking on , ` that one who has the gift of sight , would lay this out for me in bread to keep me on my way ?
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 23]: Heaven 's blessing on the young feet that will bestir themselves in aid of one so helpless as a sightless man ! '
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 21]: Barnaby looked at his mother , who nodded assent ; in another moment he was gone upon his charitable errand .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 50]: The blind man sat listening with an attentive face , until long after the sound of his retreating footsteps was inaudible to the widow , and then said , suddenly , and in a very altered tone : ` There are various degrees and kinds of blindness , widow .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 33]: There is the connubial blindness , ma'am , which perhaps you may have observed in the course of your own experience , and which is a kind of wilful and self-bandaging blindness .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 33]: There is the blindness of party , ma'am , and public men , which is the blindness of a mad bull in the midst of a regiment of soldiers clothed in red .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 51]: There is the blind confidence of youth , which is the blindness of young kittens , whose eyes have not yet opened on the world ; and there is that physical blindness , ma'am , of which I am , contrairy to my own desire , a most illustrious example .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 46]: Added to these , ma'am , is that blindness of the intellect , of which we have a specimen in your interesting son , and which , having sometimes glimmerings and dawnings of the light , is scarcely to be trusted as a total darkness .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 53]: Therefore , ma'am , I have taken the liberty to get him out of the way for a short time , while you and I confer together , and this precaution arising out of the delicacy of my sentiments towards yourself , you will excuse me , ma'am , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 46]: Having delivered himself of this speech with many flourishes of manner , he drew from beneath his coat a flat stone bottle , and holding the cork between his teeth , qualified his mug of water with a plentiful infusion of the liquor it contained .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 27]: He politely drained the bumper to her health , and the ladies , and setting it down empty , smacked his lips with infinite relish . '
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 35]: I am a citizen of the world , ma'am , ' said the blind man , corking his bottle , ` and if I seem to conduct myself with freedom , it is therefore .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 15]: You wonder who I am , ma'am , and what has brought me here .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 36]: Such experience of human nature as I have , leads me to that conclusion , without the aid of eyes by which to read the movements of your soul as depicted in your feminine features .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 12]: I will satisfy your curiosity immediately , ma'am ; immediately . '
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 42]: With that he slapped his bottle on its broad back , and having put it under his garment as before , crossed his legs and folded his hands , and settled himself in his chair , previous to proceeding any further .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 67]: The change in his manner was so unexpected , the craft and wickedness of his deportment were so much aggravated by his condition -- for we are accustomed to see in those who have lost a human sense , something in its place almost divine -- and this alteration bred so many fears in her whom he addressed , that she could not pronounce one word .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 30]: After waiting , as it seemed , for some remark or answer , and waiting in vain , the visitor resumed : ` Madam , my name is Stagg .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 28]: A friend of mine who has desired the honour of meeting with you any time these five years past , has commissioned me to call upon you .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 14]: I should be glad to whisper that gentleman 's name in your ear .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 9]: -- Zounds , ma'am , are you deaf ?
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 21]: Do you hear me say that I should be glad to whisper my friend 's name in your ear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 28]: ` You need not repeat it , ' said the widow , with a stifled groan ; ' I see too well from whom you come . '
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 44]: ` But as a man of honour , ma'am , ' said the blind man , striking himself on the breast , ` whose credentials must not be disputed , I take leave to say that I WILL mention that gentleman 's name .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 27]: Ay , ay , ' he added , seeming to catch with his quick ear the very motion of her hand , ` but not aloud .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 15]: With your leave , ma'am , I desire the favour of a whisper . '
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 9]: She moved towards him , and stooped down .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 25]: He muttered a word in her ear ; and , wringing her hands , she paced up and down the room like one distracted .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 39]: The blind man , with perfect composure , produced his bottle again , mixed another glassful ; put it up as before ; and , drinking from time to time , followed her with his face in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 21]: ` You are slow in conversation , widow , ' he said after a time , pausing in his draught .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 11]: ` We shall have to talk before your son . '
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 9]: ` What would you have me do ? '
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 7]: ` What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 29]: ` We are poor , widow , we are poor , ' he retorted , stretching out his right hand , and rubbing his thumb upon its palm .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 4]: ` Poor ! '
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 7]: ` And what am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 12]: ` Comparisons are odious , ' said the blind man . '
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 10]: I do n't know , I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 7]: I say that we are poor .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 12]: My friend 's circumstances are indifferent , and so are mine .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 15]: We must have our rights , widow , or we must be bought off .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 19]: But you know that , as well as I , so where is the use of talking ? '
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 8]: She still walked wildly to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 18]: At length , stopping abruptly before him , she said : ` Is he near here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 4]: ` He is .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 5]: Close at hand . '
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 7]: ` Then I am lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 18]: ` Not lost , widow , ' said the blind man , calmly ; ` only found .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 6]: Shall I call him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 14]: ` Not for the world , ' she answered , with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 28]: ` Very good , ' he replied , crossing his legs again , for he had made as though he would rise and walk to the door .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 7]: ` As you please , widow .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 10]: His presence is not necessary that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 34]: But both he and I must live ; to live , we must eat and drink ; to eat and drink , we must have money : -- I say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 12]: ` Do you know how pinched and destitute I am ? '
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 4]: she retorted . '
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 10]: I do not think you do , or can .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 22]: If you had eyes , and could look around you on this poor place , you would have pity on me .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 20]: let your heart be softened by your own affliction , friend , and have some sympathy with mine . '
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 22]: The blind man snapped his fingers as he answered : ' -- Beside the question , ma'am , beside the question .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 17]: I have the softest heart in the world , but I ca n't live upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 24]: Many a gentleman lives well upon a soft head , who would find a heart of the same quality a very great drawback .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 4]: Listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 17]: This is a matter of business , with which sympathies and sentiments have nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 24]: As a mutual friend , I wish to arrange it in a satisfactory manner , if possible ; and thus the case stands .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 14]: -- If you are very poor now , it 's your own choice .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 17]: You have friends who , in case of need , are always ready to help you .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 36]: My friend is in a more destitute and desolate situation than most men , and , you and he being linked together in a common cause , he naturally looks to you to assist him .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 34]: He has boarded and lodged with me a long time -LRB- for as I said just now , I am very soft-hearted -RRB- , and I quite approve of his entertaining this opinion .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 17]: You have always had a roof over your head ; he has always been an outcast .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 16]: You have your son to comfort and assist you ; he has nobody at all .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 9]: The advantages must not be all one side .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 19]: You are in the same boat , and we must divide the ballast a little more equally . '
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 15]: She was about to speak , but he checked her , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 29]: ` The only way of doing this , is by making up a little purse now and then for my friend ; and that 's what I advise .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 73]: He bears you no malice that I know of , ma'am : so little , that although you have treated him harshly more than once , and driven him , I may say , out of doors , he has that regard for you that I believe even if you disappointed him now , he would consent to take charge of your son , and to make a man of him . '
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 23]: He laid a great stress on these latter words , and paused as if to find out what effect they had produced .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 7]: She only answered by her tears .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 49]: ` He is a likely lad , ' said the blind man , thoughtfully , ` for many purposes , and not ill-disposed to try his fortune in a little change and bustle , if I may judge from what I heard of his talk with you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 3]: -- Come .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 13]: In a word , my friend has pressing necessity for twenty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 16]: You , who can give up an annuity , can get that sum for him .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 9]: It 's a pity you should be troubled .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 16]: You seem very comfortable here , and it 's worth that much to remain so .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 10]: Twenty pounds , widow , is a moderate demand .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 15]: You know where to apply for it ; a post will bring it you .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 5]: -- Twenty pounds ! '
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 14]: She was about to answer him again , but again he stopped her .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 14]: ` Do n't say anything hastily ; you might be sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 7]: Think of it a little while .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 12]: Twenty pounds -- of other people 's money -- how easy !
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 7]: Turn it over in your mind .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 6]: I 'm in no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 19]: Night 's coming on , and if I do n't sleep here , I shall not go far .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 3]: Twenty pounds !
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 22]: Consider of it , ma'am , for twenty minutes ; give each pound a minute ; that 's a fair allowance .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 19]: I 'll enjoy the air the while , which is very mild and pleasant in these parts . '
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 17]: With these words he groped his way to the door , carrying his chair with him .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 48]: Then seating himself , under a spreading honeysuckle , and stretching his legs across the threshold so that no person could pass in or out without his knowledge , he took from his pocket a pipe , flint , steel and tinder-box , and began to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 25]: It was a lovely evening , of that gentle kind , and at that time of year , when the twilight is most beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 62]: Pausing now and then to let his smoke curl slowly off , and to sniff the grateful fragrance of the flowers , he sat there at his ease -- as though the cottage were his proper dwelling , and he had held undisputed possession of it all his life -- waiting for the widow 's answer and for Barnaby 's return .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 77]: Chapter 46 When Barnaby returned with the bread , the sight of the pious old pilgrim smoking his pipe and making himself so thoroughly at home , appeared to surprise even him ; the more so , as that worthy person , instead of putting up the loaf in his wallet as a scarce and precious article , tossed it carelessly on the table , and producing his bottle , bade him sit down and drink .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 14]: ` For I carry some comfort , you see , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 4]: ` Taste that .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 5]: Is it good ? '
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 23]: The water stood in Barnaby 's eyes as he coughed from the strength of the draught , and answered in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 19]: ` Drink some more , ' said the blind man ; ` do n't be afraid of it .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 13]: You do n't taste anything like that , often , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 4]: ` Often ! '
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 3]: cried Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 4]: ` Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 5]: ` Too poor ? '
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 8]: returned the blind man with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 3]: ` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 4]: That 's bad .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 17]: Your mother , poor soul , would be happier if she was richer , Barnaby . '
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 47]: ` Why , so I tell her -- the very thing I told her just before you came to-night , when all that gold was in the sky , ' said Barnaby , drawing his chair nearer to him , and looking eagerly in his face .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 4]: ` Tell me .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 15]: Is there any way of being rich , that I could find out ? '
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 4]: ` Any way !
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 5]: A hundred ways . '
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 6]: ` Ay , ay ? '
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 6]: ` Do you say so ?
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 4]: What are they ?
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 22]: -- Nay , mother , it 's for your sake I ask ; not mine ; -- for yours , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 5]: What are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 46]: The blind man turned his face , on which there was a smile of triumph , to where the widow stood in great distress ; and answered , ` Why , they are not to be found out by stay-at-homes , my good friend . '
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 5]: ` By stay-at-homes ! '
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 8]: cried Barnaby , plucking at his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 7]: ` But I am not one .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 6]: Now , there you mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 18]: I am often out before the sun , and travel home when he has gone to rest .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 42]: I am away in the woods before the day has reached the shady places , and am often there when the bright moon is peeping through the boughs , and looking down upon the other moon that lives in the water .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 35]: As I walk along , I try to find , among the grass and moss , some of that small money for which she works so hard and used to shed so many tears .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 44]: As I lie asleep in the shade , I dream of it -- dream of digging it up in heaps ; and spying it out , hidden under bushes ; and seeing it sparkle , as the dew-drops do , among the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 6]: But I never find it .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 6]: Tell me where it is .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 31]: I 'd go there , if the journey were a whole year long , because I know she would be happier when I came home and brought some with me .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 3]: Speak again .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 12]: I 'll listen to you if you talk all night . '
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 111]: The blind man passed his hand lightly over the poor fellow 's face , and finding that his elbows were planted on the table , that his chin rested on his two hands , that he leaned eagerly forward , and that his whole manner expressed the utmost interest and anxiety , paused for a minute as though he desired the widow to observe this fully , and then made answer : ` It 's in the world , bold Barnaby , the merry world ; not in solitary places like those you pass your time in , but in crowds , and where there 's noise and rattle . '
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 3]: ` Good !
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 3]: good ! '
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 7]: cried Barnaby , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 4]: I love that .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 5]: Grip loves it too .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 5]: It suits us both .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 6]: That 's brave ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 70]: -- The kind of places , ' said the blind man , ` that a young fellow likes , and in which a good son may do more for his mother , and himself to boot , in a month , than he could here in all his life -- that is , if he had a friend , you know , and some one to advise with . '
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 8]: ` You hear this , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 9]: cried Barnaby , turning to her with delight .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 18]: ` Never tell me we should n't heed it , if it lay shining at out feet .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 9]: Why do we heed it so much now ?
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 10]: Why do you toil from morning until night ? '
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 12]: ` Surely , ' said the blind man , ` surely .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 7]: Have you no answer , widow ?
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 16]: Is your mind , ' he slowly added , ` not made up yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 15]: ` Let me speak with you , ' she answered , ` apart . '
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 25]: ` Lay your hand upon my sleeve , ' said Stagg , arising from the table ; ` and lead me where you will .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 5]: Courage , bold Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 14]: We 'll talk more of this : I 've a fancy for you .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 7]: Wait there till I come back .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 5]: Now , widow . '
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 18]: She led him out at the door , and into the little garden , where they stopped .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 29]: ` You are a fit agent , ' she said , in a half breathless manner , ` and well represent the man who sent you here . '
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 14]: ` I 'll tell him that you said so , ' Stagg retorted .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 22]: ` He has a regard for you , and will respect me the more -LRB- if possible -RRB- for your praise .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 9]: We must have our rights , widow . '
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 3]: ` Rights !
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 23]: Do you know , ' she said , ` that a word from me -- ' ` Why do you stop ? '
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 11]: returned the blind man calmly , after a long pause .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 23]: ` Do I know that a word from you would place my friend in the last position of the dance of life ?
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 5]: Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 4]: What of that ?
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 9]: It will never be spoken , widow . '
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 8]: ` You are sure of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 17]: ` Quite -- so sure , that I do n't come here to discuss the question .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 15]: I say we must have our rights , or we must be bought off .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 36]: Keep to that point , or let me return to my young friend , for I have an interest in the lad , and desire to put him in the way of making his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 2]: Bah !
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 26]: you need n't speak , ' he added hastily ; ' I know what you would say : you have hinted at it once already .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 12]: Have I no feeling for you , because I am blind ?
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 6]: No , I have not .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 24]: Why do you expect me , being in darkness , to be better than men who have their sight -- why should you ?
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 19]: Is the hand of Heaven more manifest in my having no eyes , than in your having two ?
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 70]: It 's the cant of you folks to be horrified if a blind man robs , or lies , or steals ; oh yes , it 's far worse in him , who can barely live on the few halfpence that are thrown to him in streets , than in you , who can see , and work , and are not dependent on the mercies of the world .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 5]: A curse on you !
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 33]: You who have five senses may be wicked at your pleasure ; we who have four , and want the most important , are to live and be moral on our affliction .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 16]: The true charity and justice of rich to poor , all the world over ! '
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 23]: He paused a moment when he had said these words , and caught the sound of money , jingling in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 9]: he cried , quickly resuming his former manner .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 7]: ` That should lead to something .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 6]: The point , widow ? '
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 11]: ` First answer me one question , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 9]: ` You say he is close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 6]: Has he left London ? '
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 21]: ` Being close at hand , widow , it would seem he has , ' returned the blind man . '
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 6]: I mean , for good ?
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 5]: You know that . '
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 6]: ` Yes , for good .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 19]: The truth is , widow , that his making a longer stay there might have had disagreeable consequences .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 9]: He has come away for that reason . '
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 19]: ` Listen , ' said the widow , telling some money out , upon a bench beside them .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 4]: ` Count . '
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 12]: ` Six , ' said the blind man , listening attentively .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 5]: ` Any more ? '
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 15]: ` They are the savings , ' she answered , ` of five years .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 4]: Six guineas . '
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 34]: He put out his hand for one of the coins ; felt it carefully , put it between his teeth , rung it on the bench ; and nodded to her to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 21]: ` These have been scraped together and laid by , lest sickness or death should separate my son and me .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 19]: They have been purchased at the price of much hunger , hard labour , and want of rest .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 37]: If you CAN take them -- do -- on condition that you leave this place upon the instant , and enter no more into that room , where he sits now , expecting your return . '
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 36]: ` Six guineas , ' said the blind man , shaking his head , ` though of the fullest weight that were ever coined , fall very far short of twenty pounds , widow . '
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 21]: ` For such a sum , as you know , I must write to a distant part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 15]: To do that , and receive an answer , I must have time . '
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 5]: ` Two days ? '
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 3]: said Stagg .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 4]: ` More . '
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 6]: ` Four days ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 3]: A week .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 17]: Return on this day week , at the same hour , but not to the house .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 9]: Wait at the corner of the lane . '
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 23]: ` Of course , ' said the blind man , with a crafty look , ' I shall find you there ? '
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 8]: ` Where else can I take refuge ?
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 32]: Is it not enough that you have made a beggar of me , and that I have sacrificed my whole store , so hardly earned , to preserve this home ? '
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 9]: said the blind man , after some consideration .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 21]: ` Set me with my face towards the point you speak of , and in the middle of the road .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 6]: Is this the spot ? '
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 5]: ` It is . '
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 8]: ` On this day week at sunset .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 7]: And think of him within doors .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 9]: -- For the present , good night . '
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 13]: She made him no answer , nor did he stop for any .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 33]: He went slowly away , turning his head from time to time , and stopping to listen , as if he were curious to know whether he was watched by any one .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 18]: The shadows of night were closing fast around , and he was soon lost in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 39]: It was not , however , until she had traversed the lane from end to end , and made sure that he was gone , that she re-entered the cottage , and hurriedly barred the door and window .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 4]: ` Mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 3]: said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 6]: ` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 7]: Where is the blind man ? '
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 6]: ` He is gone . '
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 4]: ` Gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 7]: he cried , starting up . '
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 8]: I must have more talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 8]: Which way did he take ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 15]: I do n't know , ' she answered , folding her arms about him .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 8]: ` You must not go out to-night .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 8]: There are ghosts and dreams abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 4]: ` Ay ? '
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 8]: said Barnaby , in a frightened whisper .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 8]: ` It is not safe to stir .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 8]: We must leave this place to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 4]: ` This place !
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 11]: This cottage -- and the little garden , mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 5]: To-morrow morning at sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 37]: We must travel to London ; lose ourselves in that wide place -- there would be some trace of us in any other town -- then travel on again , and find some new abode . '
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 13]: Little persuasion was required to reconcile Barnaby to anything that promised change .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 58]: In another minute , he was wild with delight ; in another , full of grief at the prospect of parting with his friends the dogs ; in another , wild again ; then he was fearful of what she had said to prevent his wandering abroad that night , and full of terrors and strange questions .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 40]: His light-heartedness in the end surmounted all his other feelings , and lying down in his clothes to the end that he might be ready on the morrow , he soon fell fast asleep before the poor turf fire .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 15]: His mother did not close her eyes , but sat beside him , watching .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 36]: Every breath of wind sounded in her ears like that dreaded footstep at the door , or like that hand upon the latch , and made the calm summer night , a night of horror .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 7]: At length the welcome day appeared .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 36]: When she had made the little preparations which were needful for their journey , and had prayed upon her knees with many tears , she roused Barnaby , who jumped up gaily at her summons .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 16]: His clothes were few enough , and to carry Grip was a labour of love .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 24]: As the sun shed his earliest beams upon the earth , they closed the door of their deserted home , and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 7]: The sky was blue and bright .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 11]: The air was fresh and filled with a thousand perfumes .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 11]: Barnaby looked upward , and laughed with all his heart .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 40]: But it was a day he usually devoted to a long ramble , and one of the dogs -- the ugliest of them all -- came bounding up , and jumping round him in the fulness of his joy .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 22]: He had to bid him go back in a surly tone , and his heart smote him while he did so .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 20]: The dog retreated ; turned with a half-incredulous , half-imploring look ; came a little back ; and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 17]: It was the last appeal of an old companion and a faithful friend -- cast off .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 23]: Barnaby could bear no more , and as he shook his head and waved his playmate home , he burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 25]: ` Oh mother , mother , how mournful he will be when he scratches at the door , and finds it always shut ! '
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 45]: There was such a sense of home in the thought , that though her own eyes overflowed she would not have obliterated the recollection of it , either from her own mind or from his , for the wealth of the whole wide world .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 128]: Chapter 47 In the exhaustless catalogue of Heaven 's mercies to mankind , the power we have of finding some germs of comfort in the hardest trials must ever occupy the foremost place ; not only because it supports and upholds us when we most require to be sustained , but because in this source of consolation there is something , we have reason to believe , of the divine spirit ; something of that goodness which detects amidst our own evil doings , a redeeming quality ; something which , even in our fallen nature , we possess in common with the angels ; which had its being in the old time when they trod the earth , and lingers on it yet , in pity .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 28]: How often , on their journey , did the widow remember with a grateful heart , that out of his deprivation Barnaby 's cheerfulness and affection sprung !
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 34]: How often did she call to mind that but for that , he might have been sullen , morose , unkind , far removed from her -- vicious , perhaps , and cruel !
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 21]: How often had she cause for comfort , in his strength , and hope , and in his simple nature !
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 30]: Those feeble powers of mind which rendered him so soon forgetful of the past , save in brief gleams and flashes , -- even they were a comfort now .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 45]: The world to him was full of happiness ; in every tree , and plant , and flower , in every bird , and beast , and tiny insect whom a breath of summer wind laid low upon the ground , he had delight .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 29]: His delight was hers ; and where many a wise son would have made her sorrowful , this poor light-hearted idiot filled her breast with thankfulness and love .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 28]: Their stock of money was low , but from the hoard she had told into the blind man 's hand , the widow had withheld one guinea .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 25]: This , with the few pence she possessed besides , was to two persons of their frugal habits , a goodly sum in bank .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 71]: Moreover they had Grip in company ; and when they must otherwise have changed the guinea , it was but to make him exhibit outside an alehouse door , or in a village street , or in the grounds or gardens of a mansion of the better sort , and scores who would have given nothing in charity , were ready to bargain for more amusement from the talking bird .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 65]: One day -- for they moved slowly , and although they had many rides in carts and waggons , were on the road a week -- Barnaby , with Grip upon his shoulder and his mother following , begged permission at a trim lodge to go up to the great house , at the other end of the avenue , and show his raven .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 75]: The man within was inclined to give them admittance , and was indeed about to do so , when a stout gentleman with a long whip in his hand , and a flushed face which seemed to indicate that he had had his morning 's draught , rode up to the gate , and called in a loud voice and with more oaths than the occasion seemed to warrant to have it opened directly .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 8]: ` Who hast thou got here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 25]: said the gentleman angrily , as the man threw the gate wide open , and pulled off his hat , ` who are these ?
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 7]: art a beggar , woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 13]: The widow answered with a curtsey , that they were poor travellers .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 13]: ` Vagrants , ' said the gentleman , ` vagrants and vagabonds .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 23]: Thee wish to be made acquainted with the cage , dost thee -- the cage , the stocks , and the whipping-post ?
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 6]: Where dost come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 44]: She told him in a timid manner , -- for he was very loud , hoarse , and red-faced , -- and besought him not to be angry , for they meant no harm , and would go upon their way that moment .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 26]: ` Do n't he too sure of that , ' replied the gentleman , ` we do n't allow vagrants to roam about this place .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 21]: I know what thou want ` st -- - stray linen drying on hedges , and stray poultry , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 11]: What hast got in that basket , lazy hound ? '
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 43]: ` Grip , Grip , Grip -- Grip the clever , Grip the wicked , Grip the knowing -- Grip , Grip , Grip , ' cried the raven , whom Barnaby had shut up on the approach of this stern personage .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 34]: ` I 'm a devil I 'm a devil I 'm a devil , Never say die Hurrah Bow wow wow , Polly put the kettle on we 'll all have tea . '
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 21]: ` Take the vermin out , scoundrel , ' said the gentleman , ` and let me see him . '
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 80]: Barnaby , thus condescendingly addressed , produced his bird , but not without much fear and trembling , and set him down upon the ground ; which he had no sooner done than Grip drew fifty corks at least , and then began to dance ; at the same time eyeing the gentleman with surprising insolence of manner , and screwing his head so much on one side that he appeared desirous of screwing it off upon the spot .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 33]: The cork-drawing seemed to make a greater impression on the gentleman 's mind , than the raven 's power of speech , and was indeed particularly adapted to his habits and capacity .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 39]: He desired to have that done again , but despite his being very peremptory , and notwithstanding that Barnaby coaxed to the utmost , Grip turned a deaf ear to the request , and preserved a dead silence .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 15]: ` Bring him along , ' said the gentleman , pointing to the house .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 31]: But Grip , who had watched the action , anticipated his master , by hopping on before them ; -- constantly flapping his wings , and screaming ` cook ! '
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 20]: meanwhile , as a hint perhaps that there was company coming , and a small collation would be acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 68]: Barnaby and his mother walked on , on either side of the gentleman on horseback , who surveyed each of them from time to time in a proud and coarse manner , and occasionally thundered out some question , the tone of which alarmed Barnaby so much that he could find no answer , and , as a matter of course , could make him no reply .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 41]: On one of these occasions , when the gentleman appeared disposed to exercise his horsewhip , the widow ventured to inform him in a low voice and with tears in her eyes , that her son was of weak mind .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 7]: ` An idiot , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 11]: said the gentleman , looking at Barnaby as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 11]: ` And how long hast thou been an idiot ? '
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 25]: ` She knows , ' was Barnaby 's timid answer , pointing to his mother -- ` I -- always , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 11]: ` From his birth , ' said the widow . '
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 18]: I do n't believe it , ' cried the gentleman , ` not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 8]: It 's an excuse not to work .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 10]: There 's nothing like flogging to cure that disorder .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 17]: I 'd make a difference in him in ten minutes , I 'll be bound . '
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 20]: ` Heaven has made none in more than twice ten years , sir , ' said the widow mildly .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 10]: ` Then why do n't you shut him up ?
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 10]: we pay enough for county institutions , damn 'em .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 14]: But thou 'd rather drag him about to excite charity -- of course .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 7]: Ay , I know thee . '
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 13]: Now , this gentleman had various endearing appellations among his intimate friends .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 92]: By some he was called ' a country gentleman of the true school , ' by some ' a fine old country gentleman , ' by some ' a sporting gentleman , ' by some ' a thorough-bred Englishman , ' by some ' a genuine John Bull ; ' but they all agreed in one respect , and that was , that it was a pity there were not more like him , and that because there were not , the country was going to rack and ruin every day .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 81]: He was in the commission of the peace , and could write his name almost legibly ; but his greatest qualifications were , that he was more severe with poachers , was a better shot , a harder rider , had better horses , kept better dogs , could eat more solid food , drink more strong wine , go to bed every night more drunk and get up every morning more sober , than any man in the county .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 37]: In knowledge of horseflesh he was almost equal to a farrier , in stable learning he surpassed his own head groom , and in gluttony not a pig on his estate was a match for him .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 28]: He had no seat in Parliament himself , but he was extremely patriotic , and usually drove his voters up to the poll with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 28]: He was warmly attached to church and state , and never appointed to the living in his gift any but a three-bottle man and a first-rate fox-hunter .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 64]: He mistrusted the honesty of all poor people who could read and write , and had a secret jealousy of his own wife -LRB- a young lady whom he had married for what his friends called ` the good old English reason , ' that her father 's property adjoined his own -RRB- for possessing those accomplishments in a greater degree than himself .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 29]: In short , Barnaby being an idiot , and Grip a creature of mere brute instinct , it would be very hard to say what this gentleman was .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 56]: He rode up to the door of a handsome house approached by a great flight of steps , where a man was waiting to take his horse , and led the way into a large hall , which , spacious as it was , was tainted with the fumes of last night 's stale debauch .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 44]: Greatcoats , riding-whips , bridles , top-boots , spurs , and such gear , were strewn about on all sides , and formed , with some huge stags ' antlers , and a few portraits of dogs and horses , its principal embellishments .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 90]: Throwing himself into a great chair -LRB- in which , by the bye , he often snored away the night , when he had been , according to his admirers , a finer country gentleman than usual -RRB- he bade the man to tell his mistress to come down : and presently there appeared , a little flurried , as it seemed , by the unwonted summons , a lady much younger than himself , who had the appearance of being in delicate health , and not too happy .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 20]: Thou ` st no delight in following the hounds as an Englishwoman should have , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 6]: ` See to this here .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 7]: That 'll please thee perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 23]: The lady smiled , sat down at a little distance from him , and glanced at Barnaby with a look of pity .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 27]: ` He 's an idiot , the woman says , ' observed the gentleman , shaking his head ; ' I do n't believe it . '
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 7]: ` Are you his mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 4]: asked the lady .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 4]: She answered yes .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 10]: ` What 's the use of asking HER ? '
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 12]: said the gentleman , thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 10]: ` She 'll tell thee so , of course .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 12]: Most likely he 's hired , at so much a day .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 3]: Get on .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 6]: Make him do something . '
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 38]: Grip having by this time recovered his urbanity , condescended , at Barnaby 's solicitation , to repeat his various phrases of speech , and to go through the whole of his performances with the utmost success .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 46]: The corks , and the never say die , afforded the gentleman so much delight that he demanded the repetition of this part of the entertainment , until Grip got into his basket , and positively refused to say another word , good or bad .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 35]: The lady too , was much amused with him ; and the closing point of his obstinacy so delighted her husband that he burst into a roar of laughter , and demanded his price .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 11]: Barnaby looked as though he did n't understand his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 5]: Probably he did not .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 23]: ` His price , ' said the gentleman , rattling the money in his pockets , ` what dost want for him ?
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 4]: How much ? '
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 29]: ` He 's not to be sold , ' replied Barnaby , shutting up the basket in a great hurry , and throwing the strap over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 7]: ` Mother , come away . '
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 24]: ` Thou seest how much of an idiot he is , book-learner , ' said the gentleman , looking scornfully at his wife .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 7]: ` He can make a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 10]: What dost want for him , old woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 14]: ` He is my son 's constant companion , ' said the widow .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 13]: ` He is not to be sold , sir , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 7]: ` Not to be sold ! '
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 16]: cried the gentleman , growing ten times redder , hoarser , and louder than before .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 7]: ` Not to be sold ! '
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 8]: ` Indeed no , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 18]: ` We have never thought of parting with him , sir , I do assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 36]: He was evidently about to make a very passionate retort , when a few murmured words from his wife happening to catch his ear , he turned sharply round , and said , ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 3]: What ? '
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 20]: ` We can hardly expect them to sell the bird , against their own desire , ' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 16]: ` If they prefer to keep him -- ' ` Prefer to keep him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 3]: he echoed .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 34]: ` These people , who go tramping about the country a-pilfering and vagabondising on all hands , prefer to keep a bird , when a landed proprietor and a justice asks his price !
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 8]: That old woman 's been to school .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 5]: I know she has .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 20]: Do n't tell me no , ' he roared to the widow , ' I say , yes . '
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 18]: Barnaby 's mother pleaded guilty to the accusation , and hoped there was no harm in it .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 5]: ` No harm ! '
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 3]: No harm .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 13]: No harm , ye old rebel , not a bit of harm .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 41]: If my clerk was here , I 'd set ye in the stocks , I would , or lay ye in jail for prowling up and down , on the look-out for petty larcenies , ye limb of a gipsy .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 19]: Here , Simon , put these pilferers out , shove 'em into the road , out with 'em !
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 20]: Ye do n't want to sell the bird , ye that come here to beg , do n't ye ?
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 15]: If they a n't out in double-quick , set the dogs upon 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 77]: They waited for no further dismissal , but fled precipitately , leaving the gentleman to storm away by himself -LRB- for the poor lady had already retreated -RRB- , and making a great many vain attempts to silence Grip , who , excited by the noise , drew corks enough for a city feast as they hurried down the avenue , and appeared to congratulate himself beyond measure on having been the cause of the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 53]: When they had nearly reached the lodge , another servant , emerging from the shrubbery , feigned to be very active in ordering them off , but this man put a crown into the widow 's hand , and whispering that his lady sent it , thrust them gently from the gate .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 84]: This incident only suggested to the widow 's mind , when they halted at an alehouse some miles further on , and heard the justice 's character as given by his friends , that perhaps something more than capacity of stomach and tastes for the kennel and the stable , were required to form either a perfect country gentleman , a thoroughbred Englishman , or a genuine John Bull ; and that possibly the terms were sometimes misappropriated , not to say disgraced .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 27]: She little thought then , that a circumstance so slight would ever influence their future fortunes ; but time and experience enlightened her in this respect .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 39]: ` Mother , ' said Barnaby , as they were sitting next day in a waggon which was to take them within ten miles of the capital , ` we 're going to London first , you said .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 9]: Shall we see that blind man there ? '
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 10]: She was about to answer ` Heaven forbid ! '
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 18]: but checked herself , and told him No , she thought not ; why did he ask ?
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 17]: ` He 's a wise man , ' said Barnaby , with a thoughtful countenance . '
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 10]: I wish that we may meet with him again .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 9]: What was it that he said of crowds ?
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 21]: That gold was to be found where people crowded , and not among the trees and in such quiet places ?
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 23]: He spoke as if he loved it ; London is a crowded place ; I think we shall meet him there . '
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 13]: ` But why do you desire to see him , love ? '
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 43]: ` Because , ' said Barnaby , looking wistfully at her , ` he talked to me about gold , which is a rare thing , and say what you will , a thing you would like to have , I know .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 39]: And because he came and went away so strangely -- just as white-headed old men come sometimes to my bed 's foot in the night , and say what I ca n't remember when the bright day returns .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 8]: He told me he 'd come back .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 9]: I wonder why he broke his word ! '
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 16]: ` But you never thought of being rich or gay , before , dear Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 7]: You have always been contented . '
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 25]: He laughed and bade her say that again , then cried , ` Ay ay -- oh yes , ' and laughed once more .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 25]: Then something passed that caught his fancy , and the topic wandered from his mind , and was succeeded by another just as fleeting .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 48]: But it was plain from what he had said , and from his returning to the point more than once that day , and on the next , that the blind man 's visit , and indeed his words , had taken strong possession of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 124]: Whether the idea of wealth had occurred to him for the first time on looking at the golden clouds that evening -- and images were often presented to his thoughts by outward objects quite as remote and distant ; or whether their poor and humble way of life had suggested it , by contrast , long ago ; or whether the accident -LRB- as he would deem it -RRB- of the blind man 's pursuing the current of his own remarks , had done so at the moment ; or he had been impressed by the mere circumstance of the man being blind , and , therefore , unlike any one with whom he had talked before ; it was impossible to tell .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 24]: She tried every means to discover , but in vain ; and the probability is that Barnaby himself was equally in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 38]: It filled her with uneasiness to find him harping on this string , but all that she could do , was to lead him quickly to some other subject , and to dismiss it from his brain .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 46]: To caution him against their visitor , to show any fear or suspicion in reference to him , would only be , she feared , to increase that interest with which Barnaby regarded him , and to strengthen his desire to meet him once again .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 45]: She hoped , by plunging into the crowd , to rid herself of her terrible pursuer , and then , by journeying to a distance and observing increased caution , if that were possible , to live again unknown , in secrecy and peace .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 55]: They reached , in course of time , their halting-place within ten miles of London , and lay there for the night , after bargaining to be carried on for a trifle next day , in a light van which was returning empty , and was to start at five o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 67]: The driver was punctual , the road good -- save for the dust , the weather being very hot and dry -- and at seven in the forenoon of Friday the second of June , one thousand seven hundred and eighty , they alighted at the foot of Westminster Bridge , bade their conductor farewell , and stood alone , together , on the scorching pavement .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 23]: For the freshness which night sheds upon such busy thoroughfares had already departed , and the sun was shining with uncommon lustre .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 35]: Chapter 48 Uncertain where to go next , and bewildered by the crowd of people who were already astir , they sat down in one of the recesses on the bridge , to rest .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 41]: They soon became aware that the stream of life was all pouring one way , and that a vast throng of persons were crossing the river from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore , in unusual haste and evident excitement .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 51]: They were , for the most part , in knots of two or three , or sometimes half-a-dozen ; they spoke little together -- many of them were quite silent ; and hurried on as if they had one absorbing object in view , which was common to them all .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 66]: They were surprised to see that nearly every man in this great concourse , which still came pouring past , without slackening in the least , wore in his hat a blue cockade ; and that the chance passengers who were not so decorated , appeared timidly anxious to escape observation or attack , and gave them the wall as if they would conciliate them .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 43]: This , however , was natural enough , considering their inferiority in point of numbers ; for the proportion of those who wore blue cockades , to those who were dressed as usual , was at least forty or fifty to one .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 60]: There was no quarrelling , however : the blue cockades went swarming on , passing each other when they could , and making all the speed that was possible in such a multitude ; and exchanged nothing more than looks , and very often not even those , with such of the passers-by as were not of their number .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 26]: At first , the current of people had been confined to the two pathways , and but a few more eager stragglers kept the road .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 54]: But after half an hour or so , the passage was completely blocked up by the great press , which , being now closely wedged together , and impeded by the carts and coaches it encountered , moved but slowly , and was sometimes at a stand for five or ten minutes together .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 91]: After the lapse of nearly two hours , the numbers began to diminish visibly , and gradually dwindling away , by little and little , left the bridge quite clear , save that , now and then , some hot and dusty man , with the cockade in his hat , and his coat thrown over his shoulder , went panting by , fearful of being too late , or stopped to ask which way his friends had taken , and being directed , hastened on again like one refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 47]: In this comparative solitude , which seemed quite strange and novel after the late crowd , the widow had for the first time an opportunity of inquiring of an old man who came and sat beside them , what was the meaning of that great assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 27]: ` Why , where have you come from , ' he returned , ` that you have n't heard of Lord George Gordon 's great association ?
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 18]: This is the day that he presents the petition against the Catholics , God bless him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 12]: ` What have all these men to do with that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 10]: ` What have they to do with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 5]: the old man replied .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 7]: ` Why , how you talk !
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 36]: Do n't you know his lordship has declared he wo n't present it to the house at all , unless it is attended to the door by forty thousand good and true men at least ?
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 9]: There 's a crowd for you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 5]: A crowd indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 3]: said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 9]: ` Do you hear that , mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 26]: ` And they 're mustering yonder , as I am told , ' resumed the old man , ` nigh upon a hundred thousand strong .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 5]: Let Lord George alone .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 5]: He knows his power .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 47]: There 'll be a good many faces inside them three windows over there , ' and he pointed to where the House of Commons overlooked the river , ` that 'll turn pale when good Lord George gets up this afternoon , and with reason too !
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 4]: Ay , ay .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 5]: Let his lordship alone .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 4]: Let him alone .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 4]: HE knows ! '
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 28]: And so , with much mumbling and chuckling and shaking of his forefinger , he rose , with the assistance of his stick , and tottered off .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 4]: ` Mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 13]: said Barnaby , ` that 's a brave crowd he talks of .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 7]: ` Not to join it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 4]: cried his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 14]: ` Yes , yes , ' he answered , plucking at her sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 4]: ` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 28]: ` You do n't know , ' she urged , ` what mischief they may do , where they may lead you , what their meaning is .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 14]: Dear Barnaby , for my sake -- ' ` For your sake ! '
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 7]: he cried , patting her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 8]: It IS for your sake , mother .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 12]: You remember what the blind man said , about the gold .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 6]: Here 's a brave crowd !
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 15]: Or wait till I come back -- yes , yes , wait here . '
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 21]: She tried with all the earnestness her fears engendered , to turn him from his purpose , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 29]: He was stooping down to buckle on his shoe , when a hackney-coach passed them rather quickly , and a voice inside called to the driver to stop .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 10]: ` Young man , ' said a voice within .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 6]: ` Who 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 6]: cried Barnaby , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 8]: ` Do you wear this ornament ? '
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 10]: returned the stranger , holding out a blue cockade .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 8]: ` In Heaven 's name , no .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 8]: Pray do not give it him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 4]: exclaimed the widow .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 17]: ` Speak for yourself , woman , ' said the man within the coach , coldly .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 23]: ` Leave the young man to his choice ; he 's old enough to make it , and to snap your apron-strings .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 20]: He knows , without your telling , whether he wears the sign of a loyal Englishman or not . '
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 11]: Barnaby , trembling with impatience , cried , ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 17]: yes , yes , I do , ' as he had cried a dozen times already .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 32]: The man threw him a cockade , and crying , ` Make haste to St George 's Fields , ' ordered the coachman to drive on fast ; and left them .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 48]: With hands that trembled with his eagerness to fix the bauble in his hat , Barnaby was adjusting it as he best could , and hurriedly replying to the tears and entreaties of his mother , when two gentlemen passed on the opposite side of the way .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 28]: Observing them , and seeing how Barnaby was occupied , they stopped , whispered together for an instant , turned back , and came over to them .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 8]: ` Why are you sitting here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 26]: said one of them , who was dressed in a plain suit of black , wore long lank hair , and carried a great cane .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 12]: ` Why have you not gone with the rest ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 26]: I am going , sir , ' replied Barnaby , finishing his task , and putting his hat on with an air of pride . '
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 7]: I shall be there directly . '
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 29]: ` Say `` my lord , '' young man , when his lordship does you the honour of speaking to you , ' said the second gentleman mildly .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 22]: ` If you do n't know Lord George Gordon when you see him , it 's high time you should . '
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 46]: ` Nay , Gashford , ' said Lord George , as Barnaby pulled off his hat again and made him a low bow , ` it 's no great matter on a day like this , which every Englishman will remember with delight and pride .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 19]: Put on your hat , friend , and follow us , for you lag behind and are late .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 6]: It 's past ten now .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 14]: Did n't you know that the hour for assembling was ten o'clock ? '
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 13]: Barnaby shook his head and looked vacantly from one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 19]: ` You might have known it , friend , ' said Gashford , ` it was perfectly understood .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 10]: How came you to be so ill informed ? '
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 14]: ` He can not tell you , sir , ' the widow interposed .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 10]: ` It 's of no use to ask him .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 22]: We are but this morning come from a long distance in the country , and know nothing of these matters . '
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 26]: ` The cause has taken a deep root , and has spread its branches far and wide , ' said Lord George to his secretary .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 7]: ` This is a pleasant hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 7]: I thank Heaven for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 4]: ` Amen ! '
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 7]: cried Gashford with a solemn face .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 15]: ` You do not understand me , my lord , ' said the widow .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 11]: ` Pardon me , but you cruelly mistake my meaning .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 7]: We know nothing of these matters .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 16]: We have no desire or right to join in what you are about to do .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 18]: This is my son , my poor afflicted son , dearer to me than my own life .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 22]: In mercy 's name , my lord , go your way alone , and do not tempt him into danger ! '
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 14]: ` My good woman , ' said Gashford , ` how can you !
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 4]: -- Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 12]: -- What do you mean by tempting , and by danger ?
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 19]: Do you think his lordship is a roaring lion , going about and seeking whom he may devour ?
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 5]: God bless me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 64]: ` No , no , my lord , forgive me , ' implored the widow , laying both her hands upon his breast , and scarcely knowing what she did , or said , in the earnestness of her supplication , ` but there are reasons why you should hear my earnest , mother 's prayer , and leave my son with me .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 3]: Oh do !
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 15]: He is not in his right senses , he is not , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 46]: ` It is a bad sign of the wickedness of these times , ' said Lord George , evading her touch , and colouring deeply , ` that those who cling to the truth and support the right cause , are set down as mad .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 17]: Have you the heart to say this of your own son , unnatural mother ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 7]: I am astonished at you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 10]: said Gashford , with a kind of meek severity .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 12]: ` This is a very sad picture of female depravity . '
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 29]: ` He has surely no appearance , ' said Lord George , glancing at Barnaby , and whispering in his secretary 's ear , ` of being deranged ?
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 16]: And even if he had , we must not construe any trifling peculiarity into madness .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 25]: Which of us ' -- and here he turned red again -- ` would be safe , if that were made the law ! '
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 40]: ` Not one , ' replied the secretary ; ` in that case , the greater the zeal , the truth , and talent ; the more direct the call from above ; the clearer would be the madness .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 55]: With regard to this young man , my lord , ' he added , with a lip that slightly curled as he looked at Barnaby , who stood twirling his hat , and stealthily beckoning them to come away , ` he is as sensible and self-possessed as any one I ever saw . '
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 13]: ` And you desire to make one of this great body ? '
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 18]: said Lord George , addressing him ; ` and intended to make one , did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 13]: ` Yes -- yes , ' said Barnaby , with sparkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 7]: ` To be sure I did !
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 8]: I told her so myself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 18]: I see , ' replied Lord George , with a reproachful glance at the unhappy mother . '
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 4]: I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 14]: Follow me and this gentleman , and you shall have your wish . '
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 31]: Barnaby kissed his mother tenderly on the cheek , and bidding her be of good cheer , for their fortunes were both made now , did as he was desired .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 21]: She , poor woman , followed too -- with how much fear and grief it would be hard to tell .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 76]: They passed quickly through the Bridge Road , where the shops were all shut up -LRB- for the passage of the great crowd and the expectation of their return had alarmed the tradesmen for their goods and windows -RRB- , and where , in the upper stories , all the inhabitants were congregated , looking down into the street below , with faces variously expressive of alarm , of interest , expectancy , and indignation .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 56]: Some of these applauded , and some hissed ; but regardless of these interruptions -- for the noise of a vast congregation of people at a little distance , sounded in his ears like the roaring of the sea -- Lord George Gordon quickened his pace , and presently arrived before St George 's Fields .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 13]: They were really fields at that time , and of considerable extent .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 50]: Here an immense multitude was collected , bearing flags of various kinds and sizes , but all of the same colour -- blue , like the cockades -- some sections marching to and fro in military array , and others drawn up in circles , squares , and lines .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 28]: A large portion , both of the bodies which paraded the ground , and of those which remained stationary , were occupied in singing hymns or psalms .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 47]: With whomsoever this originated , it was well done ; for the sound of so many thousand voices in the air must have stirred the heart of any man within him , and could not fail to have a wonderful effect upon enthusiasts , however mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 20]: Scouts had been posted in advance of the great body , to give notice of their leader 's coming .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 54]: These falling back , the word was quickly passed through the whole host , and for a short interval there ensued a profound and deathlike silence , during which the mass was so still and quiet , that the fluttering of a banner caught the eye , and became a circumstance of note .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 30]: Then they burst into a tremendous shout , into another , and another ; and the air seemed rent and shaken , as if by the discharge of cannon .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 4]: ` Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 38]: cried Lord George , pressing his secretary 's arm tight within his own , and speaking with as much emotion in his voice , as in his altered face , ' I arn called indeed , now .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 6]: I feel and know it .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 8]: I am the leader of a host .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 30]: If they summoned me at this moment with one voice to lead them on to death , I 'd do it -- Yes , and fall first myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 12]: ` It is a proud sight , ' said the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 18]: ` It is a noble day for England , and for the great cause throughout the world .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 26]: Such homage , my lord , as I , an humble but devoted man , can render -- ' ` What are you doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 22]: cried his master , catching him by both hands ; for he had made a show of kneeling at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 35]: ` Do not unfit me , dear Gashford , for the solemn duty of this glorious day -- ' the tears stood in the eyes of the poor gentleman as he said the words .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 28]: -- ` Let us go among them ; we have to find a place in some division for this new recruit -- give me your hand . '
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 36]: Gashford slid his cold insidious palm into his master 's grasp , and so , hand in hand , and followed still by Barnaby and by his mother too , they mingled with the concourse .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 28]: They had by this time taken to their singing again , and as their leader passed between their ranks , they raised their voices to their utmost .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 31]: Many of those who were banded together to support the religion of their country , even unto death , had never heard a hymn or psalm in all their lives .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 50]: But these fellows having for the most part strong lungs , and being naturally fond of singing , chanted any ribaldry or nonsense that occurred to them , feeling pretty certain that it would not be detected in the general chorus , and not caring much if it were .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 46]: Many of these voluntaries were sung under the very nose of Lord George Gordon , who , quite unconscious of their burden , passed on with his usual stiff and solemn deportment , very much edified and delighted by the pious conduct of his followers .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 47]: So they went on and on , up this line , down that , round the exterior of this circle , and on every side of that hollow square ; and still there were lines , and squares , and circles out of number to review .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 98]: The day being now intensely hot , and the sun striking down his fiercest rays upon the field , those who carried heavy banners began to grow faint and weary ; most of the number assembled were fain to pull off their neckcloths , and throw their coats and waistcoats open ; and some , towards the centre , quite overpowered by the excessive heat , which was of course rendered more unendurable by the multitude around them , lay down upon the grass , and offered all they had about them for a drink of water .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 42]: Still , no man left the ground , not even of those who were so distressed ; still Lord George , streaming from every pore , went on with Gashford ; and still Barnaby and his mother followed close behind them .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 94]: They had arrived at the top of a long line of some eight hundred men in single file , and Lord George had turned his head to look back , when a loud cry of recognition -- in that peculiar and half-stifled tone which a voice has , when it is raised in the open air and in the midst of a great concourse of persons -- was heard , and a man stepped with a shout of laughter from the rank , and smote Barnaby on the shoulders with his heavy hand .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 5]: ` How now ! '
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 4]: ` Barnaby Rudge !
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 13]: Why , where have you been hiding for these hundred years ? '
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 33]: Barnaby had been thinking within himself that the smell of the trodden grass brought back his old days at cricket , when he was a young boy and played on Chigwell Green .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 25]: Confused by this sudden and boisterous address , he stared in a bewildered manner at the man , and could scarcely say ` What !
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 3]: Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 4]: ` Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 12]: echoed the other ; ` ay , Hugh -- Maypole Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 5]: You remember my dog ?
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 13]: He 's alive now , and will know you , I warrant .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 10]: What , you wear the colour , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 3]: Well done !
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 15]: ` You know this young man , I see , ' said Lord George .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 7]: ` Know him , my lord !
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 10]: as well as I know my own right hand .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 5]: My captain knows him .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 6]: We all know him . '
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 10]: ` Will you take him into your division ? '
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 27]: ` It has n't in it a better , nor a nimbler , nor a more active man , than Barnaby Rudge , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 10]: ` Show me the man who says it has !
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 5]: Fall in , Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 46]: He shall march , my lord , between me and Dennis ; and he shall carry , ' he added , taking a flag from the hand of a tired man who tendered it , ` the gayest silken streamer in this valiant army . '
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 10]: ` In the name of God , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 7]: shrieked the widow , darting forward .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 18]: ` Barnaby -- my lord -- see -- he 'll come back -- Barnaby -- Barnaby ! '
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 7]: ` Women in the field ! '
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 12]: cried Hugh , stepping between them , and holding her off .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 3]: ` Holloa !
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 5]: My captain there ! '
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 11]: cried Simon Tappertit , bustling up in a great heat .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 8]: ` Do you call this order ? '
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 20]: ` Nothing like it , captain , ' answered Hugh , still holding her back with his outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 7]: ` It 's against all orders .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 11]: Ladies are carrying off our gallant soldiers from their duty .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 7]: The word of command , captain !
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 7]: They 're filing off the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 3]: Quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 4]: ` Close ! '
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 11]: cried Simon , with the whole power of his lungs .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 3]: ` Form !
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 3]: March ! '
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 35]: She was thrown to the ground ; the whole field was in motion ; Barnaby was whirled away into the heart of a dense mass of men , and she saw him no more .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 28]: Chapter 49 The mob had been divided from its first assemblage into four divisions ; the London , the Westminster , the Southwark , and the Scotch .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 52]: Each of these divisions being subdivided into various bodies , and these bodies being drawn up in various forms and figures , the general arrangement was , except to the few chiefs and leaders , as unintelligible as the plan of a great battle to the meanest soldier in the field .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 62]: It was not without its method , however ; for , in a very short space of time after being put in motion , the crowd had resolved itself into three great parties , and were prepared , as had been arranged , to cross the river by different bridges , and make for the House of Commons in separate detachments .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 50]: At the head of that division which had Westminster Bridge for its approach to the scene of action , Lord George Gordon took his post ; with Gashford at his right hand , and sundry ruffians , of most unpromising appearance , forming a kind of staff about him .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 96]: The conduct of a second party , whose route lay by Blackfriars , was entrusted to a committee of management , including perhaps a dozen men : while the third , which was to go by London Bridge , and through the main streets , in order that their numbers and their serious intentions might be the better known and appreciated by the citizens , were led by Simon Tappertit -LRB- assisted by a few subalterns , selected from the Brotherhood of United Bulldogs -RRB- , Dennis the hangman , Hugh , and some others .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 32]: The word of command being given , each of these great bodies took the road assigned to it , and departed on its way , in perfect order and profound silence .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 51]: That which went through the City greatly exceeded the others in number , and was of such prodigious extent that when the rear began to move , the front was nearly four miles in advance , notwithstanding that the men marched three abreast and followed very close upon each other .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 53]: At the head of this party , in the place where Hugh , in the madness of his humour , had stationed him , and walking between that dangerous companion and the hangman , went Barnaby ; as many a man among the thousands who looked on that day afterwards remembered well .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 75]: Forgetful of all other things in the ecstasy of the moment , his face flushed and his eyes sparkling with delight , heedless of the weight of the great banner he carried , and mindful only of its flashing in the sun and rustling in the summer breeze , on he went , proud , happy , elated past all telling : -- the only light-hearted , undesigning creature , in the whole assembly .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 9]: ` What do you think of this ? '
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 23]: asked Hugh , as they passed through the crowded streets , and looked up at the windows which were thronged with spectators .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 13]: ` They have all turned out to see our flags and streamers ?
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 4]: Eh , Barnaby ?
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 12]: Why , Barnaby 's the greatest man of all the pack !
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 13]: His flag 's the largest of the lot , the brightest too .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 10]: There 's nothing in the show , like Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 7]: All eyes are turned on him .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 57]: ` Do n't make that din , brother , ' growled the hangman , glancing with no very approving eyes at Barnaby as he spoke : ' I hope he do n't think there 's nothing to be done , but carrying that there piece of blue rag , like a boy at a breaking up .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 10]: You 're ready for action I hope , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 16]: You , I mean , ' he added , nudging Barnaby roughly with his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 7]: ` What are you staring at ?
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 7]: Why do n't you speak ? '
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 17]: Barnaby had been gazing at his flag , and looked vacantly from his questioner to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 13]: ` He do n't understand your way , ' said the latter .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 10]: ` Here , I 'll explain it to him .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 9]: Barnaby old boy , attend to me . '
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 24]: ` I 'll attend , ' said Barnaby , looking anxiously round ; ` but I wish I could see her somewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 5]: ` See who ? '
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 7]: demanded Dennis in a gruff tone .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 11]: ` You a n't in love I hope , brother ?
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 13]: That a n't the sort of thing for us , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 9]: We must n't have no love here . '
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 15]: ` She would be proud indeed to see me now , eh Hugh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 3]: said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 18]: ` Would n't it make her glad to see me at the head of this large show ?
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 11]: She 'd cry for joy , I know she would .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 5]: Where CAN she be ?
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 25]: She never sees me at my best , and what do I care to be gay and fine if SHE 'S not by ? '
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 9]: ` Why , what palaver 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 7]: asked Mr Dennis with supreme disdain .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 15]: ` We a n't got no sentimental members among us , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 22]: ` Do n't be uneasy , brother , ' cried Hugh , ` he 's only talking of his mother . '
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 6]: ` Of his what ? '
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 8]: said Mr Dennis with a strong oath .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 5]: ` His mother . '
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 29]: ` And have I combined myself with this here section , and turned out on this here memorable day , to hear men talk about their mothers ! '
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 7]: growled Mr Dennis with extreme disgust .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 19]: ` The notion of a man 's sweetheart 's bad enough , but a man 's mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 21]: -- and here his disgust was so extreme that he spat upon the ground , and could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 18]: ` Barnaby 's right , ' cried Hugh with a grin , ` and I say it .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 5]: Lookee , bold lad .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 80]: If she 's not here to see , it 's because I 've provided for her , and sent half-a-dozen gentlemen , every one of 'em with a blue flag -LRB- but not half as fine as yours -RRB- , to take her , in state , to a grand house all hung round with gold and silver banners , and everything else you please , where she 'll wait till you come , and want for nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 14]: said Barnaby , his face beaming with delight : ` have you indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 6]: That 's a good hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 4]: That 's fine !
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 4]: Kind Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 32]: ` But nothing to what will come , bless you , ' retorted Hugh , with a wink at Dennis , who regarded his new companion in arms with great astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 6]: ` No , indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 3]: cried Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 9]: ` Nothing at all , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 61]: ` Money , cocked hats and feathers , red coats and gold lace ; all the fine things there are , ever were , or will be ; will belong to us if we are true to that noble gentleman -- the best man in the world -- carry our flags for a few days , and keep 'em safe .
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 10]: That 's all we 've got to do . '
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 26]: cried Barnaby with glistening eyes , as he clutched his pole the tighter ; ' I warrant you I keep this one safe , then .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 8]: You have put it in good hands .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 6]: You know me , Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 8]: Nobody shall wrest this flag away . '
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 5]: ` Well said ! '
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 3]: Nobly said !
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 30]: That 's the old stout Barnaby , that I have climbed and leaped with , many and many a day -- I knew I was not mistaken in Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 49]: -- Do n't you see , man , ' he added in a whisper , as he slipped to the other side of Dennis , ` that the lad 's a natural , and can be got to do anything , if you take him the right way ?
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 29]: Letting alone the fun he is , he 's worth a dozen men , in earnest , as you 'd find if you tried a fall with him .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 5]: Leave him to me .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 13]: You shall soon see whether he 's of use or not . '
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 22]: Mr Dennis received these explanatory remarks with many nods and winks , and softened his behaviour towards Barnaby from that moment .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 22]: Hugh , laying his finger on his nose , stepped back into his former place , and they proceeded in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 32]: It was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon when the three great parties met at Westminster , and , uniting into one huge mass , raised a tremendous shout .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 51]: This was not only done in token of their presence , but as a signal to those on whom the task devolved , that it was time to take possession of the lobbies of both Houses , and of the various avenues of approach , and of the gallery stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 42]: To the last-named place , Hugh and Dennis , still with their pupil between them , rushed straightway ; Barnaby having given his flag into the hands of one of their own party , who kept them at the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 48]: Their followers pressing on behind , they were borne as on a great wave to the very doors of the gallery , whence it was impossible to retreat , even if they had been so inclined , by reason of the throng which choked up the passages .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 23]: It is a familiar expression in describing a great crowd , that a person might have walked upon the people 's heads .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 67]: In this case it was actually done ; for a boy who had by some means got among the concourse , and was in imminent danger of suffocation , climbed to the shoulders of a man beside him and walked upon the people 's hats and heads into the open street ; traversing in his passage the whole length of two staircases and a long gallery .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 60]: Nor was the swarm without less dense ; for a basket which had been tossed into the crowd , was jerked from head to head , and shoulder to shoulder , and went spinning and whirling on above them , until it was lost to view , without ever once falling in among them or coming near the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 79]: Through this vast throng , sprinkled doubtless here and there with honest zealots , but composed for the most part of the very scum and refuse of London , whose growth was fostered by bad criminal laws , bad prison regulations , and the worst conceivable police , such of the members of both Houses of Parliament as had not taken the precaution to be already at their posts , were compelled to fight and force their way .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 40]: Their carriages were stopped and broken ; the wheels wrenched off ; the glasses shivered to atoms ; the panels beaten in ; drivers , footmen , and masters , pulled from their seats and rolled in the mud .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 78]: Lords , commoners , and reverend bishops , with little distinction of person or party , were kicked and pinched and hustled ; passed from hand to hand through various stages of ill-usage ; and sent to their fellow-senators at last with their clothes hanging in ribands about them , their bagwigs torn off , themselves speechless and breathless , and their persons covered with the powder which had been cuffed and beaten out of their hair .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 59]: One lord was so long in the hands of the populace , that the Peers as a body resolved to sally forth and rescue him , and were in the act of doing so , when he happily appeared among them covered with dirt and bruises , and hardly to be recognised by those who knew him best .
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 11]: The noise and uproar were on the increase every moment .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 12]: The air was filled with execrations , hoots , and howlings .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 26]: The mob raged and roared , like a mad monster as it was , unceasingly , and each new outrage served to swell its fury .
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 10]: Within doors , matters were even yet more threatening .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 66]: Lord George -- preceded by a man who carried the immense petition on a porter 's knot through the lobby to the door of the House of Commons , where it was received by two officers of the house who rolled it up to the table ready for presentation -- had taken his seat at an early hour , before the Speaker went to prayers .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 24]: His followers pouring in at the same time , the lobby and all the avenues were immediately filled , as we have seen .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 78]: Thus the members were not only attacked in their passage through the streets , but were set upon within the very walls of Parliament ; while the tumult , both within and without , was so great , that those who attempted to speak could scarcely hear their own voices : far less , consult upon the course it would be wise to take in such extremity , or animate each other to dignified and firm resistance .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 98]: So sure as any member , just arrived , with dress disordered and dishevelled hair , came struggling through the crowd in the lobby , it yelled and screamed in triumph ; and when the door of the House , partially and cautiously opened by those within for his admission , gave them a momentary glimpse of the interior , they grew more wild and savage , like beasts at the sight of prey , and made a rush against the portal which strained its locks and bolts in their staples , and shook the very beams .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 70]: The strangers ' gallery , which was immediately above the door of the House , had been ordered to be closed on the first rumour of disturbance , and was empty ; save that now and then Lord George took his seat there , for the convenience of coming to the head of the stairs which led to it , and repeating to the people what had passed within .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 15]: It was on these stairs that Barnaby , Hugh , and Dennis were posted .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 35]: There were two flights , short , steep , and narrow , running parallel to each other , and leading to two little doors communicating with a low passage which opened on the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 33]: Between them was a kind of well , or unglazed skylight , for the admission of light and air into the lobby , which might be some eighteen or twenty feet below .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 49]: Upon one of these little staircases -- not that at the head of which Lord George appeared from time to time , but the other -- Gashford stood with his elbow on the bannister , and his cheek resting on his hand , with his usual crafty aspect .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 62]: Whenever he varied this attitude in the slightest degree -- so much as by the gentlest motion of his arm -- the uproar was certain to increase , not merely there , but in the lobby below ; from which place no doubt , some man who acted as fugleman to the rest , was constantly looking up and watching him .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 4]: ` Order ! '
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 28]: cried Hugh , in a voice which made itself heard even above the roar and tumult , as Lord George appeared at the top of the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 3]: ` News !
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 6]: News from my lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 13]: The noise continued , notwithstanding his appearance , until Gashford looked round .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 41]: There was silence immediately -- even among the people in the passages without , and on the other staircases , who could neither see nor hear , but to whom , notwithstanding , the signal was conveyed with marvellous rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 20]: ` Gentlemen , ' said Lord George , who was very pale and agitated , we must be firm .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 12]: They talk of delays , but we must have no delays .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 19]: They talk of taking your petition into consideration next Tuesday , but we must have it considered now .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 16]: Present appearances look bad for our success , but we must succeed and will ! '
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 8]: ` We must succeed and will ! '
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 4]: echoed the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 24]: And so among their shouts and cheers and other cries , he bowed to them and retired , and presently came back again .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 14]: There was another gesture from Gashford , and a dead silence directly . '
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 31]: I am afraid , ' he said , this time , ` that we have little reason , gentlemen , to hope for any redress from the proceedings of Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 29]: But we must redress our own grievances , we must meet again , we must put our trust in Providence , and it will bless our endeavours . '
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 17]: This speech being a little more temperate than the last , was not so favourably received .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 120]: When the noise and exasperation were at their height , he came back once more , and told them that the alarm had gone forth for many miles round ; that when the King heard of their assembling together in that great body , he had no doubt , His Majesty would send down private orders to have their wishes complied with ; and -- with the manner of his speech as childish , irresolute , and uncertain as his matter -- was proceeding in this strain , when two gentlemen suddenly appeared at the door where he stood , and pressing past him and coming a step or two lower down upon the stairs , confronted the people .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 11]: The boldness of this action quite took them by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 78]: They were not the less disconcerted , when one of the gentlemen , turning to Lord George , spoke thus -- in a loud voice that they might hear him well , but quite coolly and collectedly : ` You may tell these people , if you please , my lord , that I am General Conway of whom they have heard ; and that I oppose this petition , and all their proceedings , and yours .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 23]: I am a soldier , you may tell them , and I will protect the freedom of this place with my sword .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 65]: You see , my lord , that the members of this House are all in arms to-day ; you know that the entrance to it is a narrow one ; you can not be ignorant that there are men within these walls who are determined to defend that pass to the last , and before whom many lives must fall if your adherents persevere .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 8]: Have a care what you do . '
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 36]: ` And my Lord George , ' said the other gentleman , addressing him in like manner , ' I desire them to hear this , from me -- Colonel Gordon -- your near relation .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 41]: If a man among this crowd , whose uproar strikes us deaf , crosses the threshold of the House of Commons , I swear to run my sword that moment -- not into his , but into your body ! '
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 45]: With that , they stepped back again , keeping their faces towards the crowd ; took each an arm of the misguided nobleman ; drew him into the passage , and shut the door ; which they directly locked and fastened on the inside .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 41]: This was so quickly done , and the demeanour of both gentlemen -- who were not young men either -- was so gallant and resolute , that the crowd faltered and stared at each other with irresolute and timid looks .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 42]: Many tried to turn towards the door ; some of the faintest-hearted cried they had best go back , and called to those behind to give way ; and the panic and confusion were increasing rapidly , when Gashford whispered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 5]: ` What now ! '
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 8]: Hugh roared aloud , turning towards them .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 5]: ` Why go back ?
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 10]: Where can you do better than here , boys !
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 19]: One good rush against these doors and one below at the same time , will do the business .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 5]: Rush on , then !
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 14]: As to the door below , let those stand back who are afraid .
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 17]: Let those who are not afraid , try who shall be the first to pass it .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 3]: Here goes !
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 6]: Look out down there ! '
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 19]: Without the delay of an instant , he threw himself headlong over the bannisters into the lobby below .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 13]: He had hardly touched the ground when Barnaby was at his side .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 43]: The chaplain 's assistant , and some members who were imploring the people to retire , immediately withdrew ; and then , with a great shout , both crowds threw themselves against the doors pell-mell , and besieged the House in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 74]: At that moment , when a second onset must have brought them into collision with those who stood on the defensive within , in which case great loss of life and bloodshed would inevitably have ensued , -- the hindmost portion of the crowd gave way , and the rumour spread from mouth to mouth that a messenger had been despatched by water for the military , who were forming in the street .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 30]: Fearful of sustaining a charge in the narrow passages in which they were so closely wedged together , the throng poured out as impetuously as they had flocked in .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 82]: As the whole stream turned at once , Barnaby and Hugh went with it : and so , fighting and struggling and trampling on fallen men and being trampled on in turn themselves , they and the whole mass floated by degrees into the open street , where a large detachment of the Guards , both horse and foot , came hurrying up ; clearing the ground before them so rapidly that the people seemed to melt away as they advanced .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 39]: The word of command to halt being given , the soldiers formed across the street ; the rioters , breathless and exhausted with their late exertions , formed likewise , though in a very irregular and disorderly manner .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 38]: The commanding officer rode hastily into the open space between the two bodies , accompanied by a magistrate and an officer of the House of Commons , for whose accommodation a couple of troopers had hastily dismounted .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 12]: The Riot Act was read , but not a man stirred .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 16]: In the first rank of the insurgents , Barnaby and Hugh stood side by side .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 47]: Somebody had thrust into Barnaby 's hands when he came out into the street , his precious flag ; which , being now rolled up and tied round the pole , looked like a giant quarter-staff as he grasped it firmly and stood upon his guard .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 44]: If ever man believed with his whole heart and soul that he was engaged in a just cause , and that he was bound to stand by his leader to the last , poor Barnaby believed it of himself and Lord George Gordon .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 25]: After an ineffectual attempt to make himself heard , the magistrate gave the word and the Horse Guards came riding in among the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 68]: But , even then , he galloped here and there , exhorting the people to disperse ; and , although heavy stones were thrown at the men , and some were desperately cut and bruised , they had no orders but to make prisoners of such of the rioters as were the most active , and to drive the people back with the flat of their sabres .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 130]: As the horses came in among them , the throng gave way at many points , and the Guards , following up their advantage , were rapidly clearing the ground , when two or three of the foremost , who were in a manner cut off from the rest by the people closing round them , made straight towards Barnaby and Hugh , who had no doubt been pointed out as the two men who dropped into the lobby : laying about them now with some effect , and inflicting on the more turbulent of their opponents , a few slight flesh wounds , under the influence of which a man dropped , here and there , into the arms of his fellows , amid much groaning and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 31]: At the sight of gashed and bloody faces , seen for a moment in the crowd , then hidden by the press around them , Barnaby turned pale and sick .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 41]: But he stood his ground , and grasping his pole more firmly yet , kept his eye fixed upon the nearest soldier -- nodding his head meanwhile , as Hugh , with a scowling visage , whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 57]: The soldier came spurring on , making his horse rear as the people pressed about him , cutting at the hands of those who would have grasped his rein and forced his charger back , and waving to his comrades to follow -- and still Barnaby , without retreating an inch , waited for his coming .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 49]: Some called to him to fly , and some were in the very act of closing round him , to prevent his being taken , when the pole swept into the air above the people 's heads , and the man 's saddle was empty in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 35]: Then , he and Hugh turned and fled , the crowd opening to let them pass , and closing up again so quickly that there was no clue to the course they had taken .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 36]: Panting for breath , hot , dusty , and exhausted with fatigue , they reached the riverside in safety , and getting into a boat with all despatch were soon out of any immediate danger .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 41]: As they glided down the river , they plainly heard the people cheering ; and supposing they might have forced the soldiers to retreat , lay upon their oars for a few minutes , uncertain whether to return or not .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 58]: But the crowd passing along Westminster Bridge , soon assured them that the populace were dispersing ; and Hugh rightly guessed from this , that they had cheered the magistrate for offering to dismiss the military on condition of their immediate departure to their several homes , and that he and Barnaby were better where they were .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 55]: He advised , therefore , that they should proceed to Blackfriars , and , going ashore at the bridge , make the best of their way to The Boot ; where there was not only good entertainment and safe lodging , but where they would certainly be joined by many of their late companions .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 17]: Barnaby assenting , they decided on this course of action , and pulled for Blackfriars accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 16]: They landed at a critical time , and fortunately for themselves at the right moment .
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 51]: For , coming into Fleet Street , they found it in an unusual stir ; and inquiring the cause , were told that a body of Horse Guards had just galloped past , and that they were escorting some rioters whom they had made prisoners , to Newgate for safety .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 50]: Not at all ill-pleased to have so narrowly escaped the cavalcade , they lost no more time in asking questions , but hurried to The Boot with as much speed as Hugh considered it prudent to make , without appearing singular or attracting an inconvenient share of public notice .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 38]: Chapter 50 They were among the first to reach the tavern , but they had not been there many minutes , when several groups of men who had formed part of the crowd , came straggling in .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 37]: Among them were Simon Tappertit and Mr Dennis ; both of whom , but especially the latter , greeted Barnaby with the utmost warmth , and paid him many compliments on the prowess he had shown .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 45]: ` Which , ' said Dennis , with an oath , as he rested his bludgeon in a corner with his hat upon it , and took his seat at the same table with them , ` it does me good to think of .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 5]: There was a opportunity !
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 6]: But it led to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 11]: For my part , I do n't know what would .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 12]: There 's no spirit among the people in these here times .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 8]: Bring something to eat and drink here .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 7]: I 'm disgusted with humanity . '
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 6]: ` On what account ? '
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 16]: asked Mr Tappertit , who had been quenching his fiery face in a half-gallon can .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 13]: ` Do n't you consider this a good beginning , mister ? '
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 16]: ` Give me security that it a n't a ending , ' rejoined the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 113]: ` When that soldier went down , we might have made London ours ; but no ; -- we stand , and gape , and look on -- the justice -LRB- I wish he had had a bullet in each eye , as he would have had , if we 'd gone to work my way -RRB- says , `` My lads , if you 'll give me your word to disperse , I 'll order off the military , '' our people sets up a hurrah , throws up the game with the winning cards in their hands , and skulks away like a pack of tame curs as they are .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 24]: Ah , ' said the hangman , in a tone of deep disgust , ` it makes me blush for my feller creeturs .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 13]: I wish I had been born a ox , I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 30]: ` You 'd have been quite as agreeable a character if you had been , I think , ' returned Simon Tappertit , going out in a lofty manner .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 67]: ` Do n't be too sure of that , ' rejoined the hangman , calling after him ; ` if I was a horned animal at the present moment , with the smallest grain of sense , I 'd toss every man in this company , excepting them two , ' meaning Hugh and Barnaby , ` for his manner of conducting himself this day . '
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 47]: With which mournful review of their proceedings , Mr Dennis sought consolation in cold boiled beef and beer ; but without at all relaxing the grim and dissatisfied expression of his face , the gloom of which was rather deepened than dissipated by their grateful influence .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 26]: The company who were thus libelled might have retaliated by strong words , if not by blows , but they were dispirited and worn out .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 50]: The greater part of them had fasted since morning ; all had suffered extremely from the excessive heat ; and between the day 's shouting , exertion , and excitement , many had quite lost their voices , and so much of their strength that they could hardly stand .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 43]: Then they were uncertain what to do next , fearful of the consequences of what they had done already , and sensible that after all they had carried no point , but had indeed left matters worse than they had found them .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 47]: Of those who had come to The Boot , many dropped off within an hour ; such of them as were really honest and sincere , never , after the morning 's experience , to return , or to hold any communication with their late companions .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 28]: Others remained but to refresh themselves , and then went home desponding ; others who had theretofore been regular in their attendance , avoided the place altogether .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 60]: The half-dozen prisoners whom the Guards had taken , were magnified by report into half-a-hundred at least ; and their friends , being faint and sober , so slackened in their energy , and so drooped beneath these dispiriting influences , that by eight o'clock in the evening , Dennis , Hugh , and Barnaby , were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 16]: Even they were fast asleep upon the benches , when Gashford 's entrance roused them .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 6]: you ARE here then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 4]: said the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 12]: ` Why , where should we be , Muster Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 10]: Dennis rejoined as he rose into a sitting posture .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 13]: ` Oh nowhere , nowhere , ' he returned with excessive mildness .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 9]: ` The streets are filled with blue cockades .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 10]: I rather thought you might have been among them .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 8]: I am glad you are not . '
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 12]: ` You have orders for us , master , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 6]: ` Oh dear , no .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 9]: Not I. No orders , my good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 6]: What orders should I have ?
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 8]: You are not in my service . '
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 20]: ` Muster Gashford , ' remonstrated Dennis , ` we belong to the cause , do n't we ? '
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 5]: ` The cause ! '
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 13]: repeated the secretary , looking at him in a sort of abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 6]: ` There is no cause .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 6]: The cause is lost . '
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 4]: ` Lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 4]: ` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 7]: You have heard , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 13]: The petition is rejected by a hundred and ninety-two , to six .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 5]: It 's quite final .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 8]: We might have spared ourselves some trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 15]: That , and my lord 's vexation , are the only circumstances I regret .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 10]: I am quite satisfied in all other respects . '
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 64]: As he said this , he took a penknife from his pocket , and putting his hat upon his knee , began to busy himself in ripping off the blue cockade which he had worn all day ; at the same time humming a psalm tune which had been very popular in the morning , and dwelling on it with a gentle regret .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 25]: His two adherents looked at each other , and at him , as if they were at a loss how to pursue the subject .
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 35]: At length Hugh , after some elbowing and winking between himself and Mr Dennis , ventured to stay his hand , and to ask him why he meddled with that riband in his hat .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 40]: ` Because , ' said the secretary , looking up with something between a snarl and a smile ; ` because to sit still and wear it , or to fall asleep and wear it , is a mockery .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 7]: That 's all , friend . '
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 11]: ` What would you have us do , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 14]: ` Nothing , ' returned Gashford , shrugging his shoulders , ` nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 26]: When my lord was reproached and threatened for standing by you , I , as a prudent man , would have had you do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 20]: When the soldiers were trampling you under their horses ' feet , I would have had you do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 39]: When one of them was struck down by a daring hand , and I saw confusion and dismay in all their faces , I would have had you do nothing -- just what you did , in short .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 15]: This is the young man who had so little prudence and so much boldness .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 7]: I am sorry for him . '
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 6]: ` Sorry , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 7]: ` Sorry , Muster Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 3]: echoed Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 56]: ` In case there should be a proclamation out to-morrow , offering five hundred pounds , or some such trifle , for his apprehension ; and in case it should include another man who dropped into the lobby from the stairs above , ' said Gashford , coldly ; ` still , do nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 8]: ` Fire and fury , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 6]: cried Hugh , starting up .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 16]: ` What have we done , that you should talk to us like this ! '
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 10]: ` Nothing , ' returned Gashford with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 66]: ` If you are cast into prison ; if the young man -- ' here he looked hard at Barnaby 's attentive face -- ` is dragged from us and from his friends ; perhaps from people whom he loves , and whom his death would kill ; is thrown into jail , brought out and hanged before their eyes ; still , do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 14]: You 'll find it your best policy , I have no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 5]: ` Come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 8]: cried Hugh , striding towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 9]: ` Dennis -- Barnaby -- come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 3]: ` Where ?
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 5]: To do what ? '
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 15]: said Gashford , slipping past him , and standing with his back against it .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 3]: ` Anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 3]: Anything ! '
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 16]: ` Stand aside , master , or the window will serve our turn as well .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 5]: Let us out ! '
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 49]: You are of such -- of such an impetuous nature , ' said Gashford , changing his manner for one of the utmost good fellowship and the pleasantest raillery ; ` you are such an excitable creature -- but you 'll drink with me before you go ? '
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 19]: ` Oh , yes -- certainly , ' growled Dennis , drawing his sleeve across his thirsty lips .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 6]: ` No malice , brother .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 6]: Drink with Muster Gashford ! '
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 12]: Hugh wiped his heated brow , and relaxed into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 6]: The artful secretary laughed outright .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 5]: ` Some liquor here !
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 13]: Be quick , or he 'll not stop , even for that .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 10]: He is a man of such desperate ardour ! '
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 30]: said the smooth secretary , whom Mr Dennis corroborated with sundry nods and muttered oaths -- ` Once roused , he is a fellow of such fierce determination ! '
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 19]: Hugh poised his sturdy arm aloft , and clapping Barnaby on the back , bade him fear nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 32]: They shook hands together -- poor Barnaby evidently possessed with the idea that he was among the most virtuous and disinterested heroes in the world -- and Gashford laughed again . '
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 81]: I hear , ' he said smoothly , as he stood among them with a great measure of liquor in his hand , and filled their glasses as quickly and as often as they chose , ' I hear -- but I can not say whether it be true or false -- that the men who are loitering in the streets to-night are half disposed to pull down a Romish chapel or two , and that they only want leaders .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 36]: I even heard mention of those in Duke Street , Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and in Warwick Street , Golden Square ; but common report , you know -- You are not going ? '
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 11]: -- ` To do nothing , rnaster , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 10]: ` No jails and halter for Barnaby and me .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 8]: They must be frightened out of that .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 7]: Leaders are wanted , are they ?
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 5]: Now boys ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 6]: A most impetuous fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 4]: cried the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 9]: A courageous , boisterous , most vehement fellow !
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 29]: A man who -- ' There was no need to finish the sentence , for they had rushed out of the house , and were far beyond hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 48]: He stopped in the middle of a laugh , listened , drew on his gloves , and , clasping his hands behind him , paced the deserted room for a long time , then bent his steps towards the busy town , and walked into the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 20]: They were filled with people , for the rumour of that day 's proceedings had made a great noise .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 27]: Those persons who did not care to leave home , were at their doors or windows , and one topic of discourse prevailed on every side .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 78]: Some reported that the riots were effectually put down ; others that they had broken out again : some said that Lord George Gordon had been sent under a strong guard to the Tower ; others that an attempt had been made upon the King 's life , that the soldiers had been again called out , and that the noise of musketry in a distant part of the town had been plainly heard within an hour .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 66]: As it grew darker , these stories became more direful and mysterious ; and often , when some frightened passenger ran past with tidings that the rioters were not far off , and were coming up , the doors were shut and barred , lower windows made secure , and as much consternation engendered , as if the city were invaded by a foreign army .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 78]: Gashford walked stealthily about , listening to all he heard , and diffusing or confirming , whenever he had an opportunity , such false intelligence as suited his own purpose ; and , busily occupied in this way , turned into Holborn for the twentieth time , when a great many women and children came flying along the street -- often panting and looking back -- and the confused murmur of numerous voices struck upon his ear .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 62]: Assured by these tokens , and by the red light which began to flash upon the houses on either side , that some of his friends were indeed approaching , he begged a moment 's shelter at a door which opened as he passed , and running with some other persons to an upper window , looked out upon the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 14]: They had torches among them , and the chief faces were distinctly visible .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 51]: That they had been engaged in the destruction of some building was sufficiently apparent , and that it was a Catholic place of worship was evident from the spoils they bore as trophies , which were easily recognisable for the vestments of priests , and rich fragments of altar furniture .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 56]: Covered with soot , and dirt , and dust , and lime ; their garments torn to rags ; their hair hanging wildly about them ; their hands and faces jagged and bleeding with the wounds of rusty nails ; Barnaby , Hugh , and Dennis hurried on before them all , like hideous madmen .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 112]: After them , the dense throng came fighting on : some singing ; some shouting in triumph ; some quarrelling among themselves ; some menacing the spectators as they passed ; some with great wooden fragments , on which they spent their rage as if they had been alive , rending them limb from limb , and hurling the scattered morsels high into the air ; some in a drunken state , unconscious of the hurts they had received from falling bricks , and stones , and beams ; one borne upon a shutter , in the very midst , covered with a dingy cloth , a senseless , ghastly heap .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 108]: Thus -- a vision of coarse faces , with here and there a blot of flaring , smoky light ; a dream of demon heads and savage eyes , and sticks and iron bars uplifted in the air , and whirled about ; a bewildering horror , in which so much was seen , and yet so little , which seemed so long , and yet so short , in which there were so many phantoms , not to be forgotten all through life , and yet so many things that could not be observed in one distracting glimpse -- it flitted onward , and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 18]: As it passed away upon its work of wrath and ruin , a piercing scream was heard .
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 22]: A knot of persons ran towards the spot ; Gashford , who just then emerged into the street , among them .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 42]: He was on the outskirts of the little concourse , and could not see or hear what passed within ; but one who had a better place , informed him that a widow woman had descried her son among the rioters .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 9]: said the secretary , turning his face homewards .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 11]: I think this looks a little more like business ! '
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 27]: Chapter 51 Promising as these outrages were to Gashford 's view , and much like business as they looked , they extended that night no farther .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 25]: The soldiers were again called out , again they took half-a-dozen prisoners , and again the crowd dispersed after a short and bloodless scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 23]: Hot and drunken though they were , they had not yet broken all bounds and set all law and government at defiance .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 40]: Something of their habitual deference to the authority erected by society for its own preservation yet remained among them , and had its majesty been vindicated in time , the secretary would have had to digest a bitter disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 50]: By midnight , the streets were clear and quiet , and , save that there stood in two parts of the town a heap of nodding walls and pile of rubbish , where there had been at sunset a rich and handsome building , everything wore its usual aspect .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 54]: Even the Catholic gentry and tradesmen , of whom there were many resident in different parts of the City and its suburbs , had no fear for their lives or property , and but little indignation for the wrong they had already sustained in the plunder and destruction of their temples of worship .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 124]: An honest confidence in the government under whose protection they had lived for many years , and a well-founded reliance on the good feeling and right thinking of the great mass of the community , with whom , notwithstanding their religious differences , they were every day in habits of confidential , affectionate , and friendly intercourse , reassured them , even under the excesses that had been committed ; and convinced them that they who were Protestants in anything but the name , were no more to be considered as abettors of these disgraceful occurrences , than they themselves were chargeable with the uses of the block , the rack , the gibbet , and the stake in cruel Mary 's reign .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 27]: The clock was on the stroke of one , when Gabriel Varden , with his lady and Miss Miggs , sat waiting in the little parlour .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 59]: This fact ; the toppling wicks of the dull , wasted candles ; the silence that prevailed ; and , above all , the nightcaps of both maid and matron , were sufficient evidence that they had been prepared for bed some time ago , and had some reason for sitting up so far beyond their usual hour .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 171]: If any other corroborative testimony had been required , it would have been abundantly furnished in the actions of Miss Miggs , who , having arrived at that restless state and sensitive condition of the nervous system which are the result of long watching , did , by a constant rubbing and tweaking of her nose , a perpetual change of position -LRB- arising from the sudden growth of imaginary knots and knobs in her chair -RRB- , a frequent friction of her eyebrows , the incessant recurrence of a small cough , a small groan , a gasp , a sigh , a sniff , a spasmodic start , and by other demonstrations of that nature , so file down and rasp , as it were , the patience of the locksmith , that after looking at her in silence for some time , he at last broke out into this apostrophe : -- ` Miggs , my good girl , go to bed -- do go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 26]: You 're really worse than the dripping of a hundred water-butts outside the window , or the scratching of as many mice behind the wainscot .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 6]: I ca n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 7]: Do go to bed , Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 7]: To oblige me -- do . '
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 26]: ` You have n't got nothing to untie , sir , ' returned Miss Miggs , ` and therefore your requests does not surprise me .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 58]: But missis has -- and while you sit up , mim ' -- she added , turning to the locksmith 's wife , ' I could n't , no , not if twenty times the quantity of cold water was aperiently running down my back at this moment , go to bed with a quiet spirit . '
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 63]: Having spoken these words , Miss Miggs made divers efforts to rub her shoulders in an impossible place , and shivered from head to foot ; thereby giving the beholders to understand that the imaginary cascade was still in full flow , but that a sense of duty upheld her under that and all other sufferings , and nerved her to endurance .
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 39]: Mrs Varden being too sleepy to speak , and Miss Miggs having , as the phrase is , said her say , the locksmith had nothing for it but to sigh and be as quiet as he could .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 13]: But to be quiet with such a basilisk before him was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 46]: If he looked another way , it was worse to feel that she was rubbing her cheek , or twitching her ear , or winking her eye , or making all kinds of extraordinary shapes with her nose , than to see her do it .
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 55]: If she was for a moment free from any of these complaints , it was only because of her foot being asleep , or of her arm having got the fidgets , or of her leg being doubled up with the cramp , or of some other horrible disorder which racked her whole frame .
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 193]: If she did enjoy a moment 's ease , then with her eyes shut and her mouth wide open , she would be seen to sit very stiff and upright in her chair ; then to nod a little way forward , and stop with a jerk ; then to nod a little farther forward , and stop with another jerk ; then to recover herself ; then to come forward again -- lower -- lower -- lower -- by very slow degrees , until , just as it seemed impossible that she could preserve her balance for another instant , and the locksmith was about to call out in an agony , to save her from dashing down upon her forehead and fracturing her skull , then all of a sudden and without the smallest notice , she would come upright and rigid again with her eyes open , and in her countenance an expression of defiance , sleepy but yet most obstinate , which plainly said , ` I 've never once closed 'em since I looked at you last , and I 'll take my oath of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 30]: At length , after the clock had struck two , there was a sound at the street door , as if somebody had fallen against the knocker by accident .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 27]: Miss Miggs immediately jumping up and clapping her hands , cried with a drowsy mingling of the sacred and profane , ` Ally Looyer , mim !
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 7]: there 's Simmuns 's knock ! '
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 6]: ` Who 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 3]: said Gabriel .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 4]: ` Me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 8]: cried the well-known voice of Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 10]: Gabriel opened the door , and gave him admission .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 59]: He did not cut a very insinuating figure , for a man of his stature suffers in a crowd ; and having been active in yesterday morning 's work , his dress was literally crushed from head to foot : his hat being beaten out of all shape , and his shoes trodden down at heel like slippers .
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 37]: His coat fluttered in strips about him , the buckles were torn away both from his knees and feet , half his neckerchief was gone , and the bosom of his shirt was rent to tatters .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 102]: Yet notwithstanding all these personal disadvantages ; despite his being very weak from heat and fatigue ; and so begrimed with mud and dust that he might have been in a case , for anything of the real texture -LRB- either of his skin or apparel -RRB- that the eye could discern ; he stalked haughtily into the parlour , and throwing himself into a chair , and endeavouring to thrust his hands into the pockets of his small-clothes , which were turned inside out and displayed upon his legs , like tassels , surveyed the household with a gloomy dignity .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 28]: ` Simon , ' said the locksmith gravely , ` how comes it that you return home at this time of night , and in this condition ?
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 19]: Give me an assurance that you have not been among the rioters , and I am satisfied . '
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 25]: ` Sir , ' replied Mr Tappertit , with a contemptuous look , ' I wonder at YOUR assurance in making such demands . '
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 11]: ` You have been drinking , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 33]: ` As a general principle , and in the most offensive sense of the words , sir , ' returned his journeyman with great self-possession , ' I consider you a liar .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 19]: In that last observation you have unintentionally -- unintentionally , sir , -- struck upon the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 72]: ` Martha , ' said the locksmith , turning to his wife , and shaking his head sorrowfully , while a smile at the absurd figure beside him still played upon his open face , ' I trust it may turn out that this poor lad is not the victim of the knaves and fools we have so often had words about , and who have done so much harm to-day .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 58]: If he has been at Warwick Street or Duke Street to-night -- ' ` He has been at neither , sir , ' cried Mr Tappertit in a loud voice , which he suddenly dropped into a whisper as he repeated , with eyes fixed upon the locksmith , ` he has been at neither . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 61]: I am glad of it , with all my heart , ' said the locksmith in a serious tone ; ` for if he had been , and it could be proved against him , Martha , your Great Association would have been to him the cart that draws men to the gallows and leaves them hanging in the air .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 11]: It would , as sure as we 're alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 44]: Mrs Varden was too much scared by Simon 's altered manner and appearance , and by the accounts of the rioters which had reached her ears that night , to offer any retort , or to have recourse to her usual matrimonial policy .
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 9]: Miss Miggs wrung her hands , and wept .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 29]: ` He was not at Duke Street , or at Warwick Street , G. Varden , ' said Simon , sternly ; ` but he WAS at Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 41]: Perhaps , sir , he kicked a county member , perhaps , sir , he tapped a lord -- you may stare , sir , I repeat it -- blood flowed from noses , and perhaps he tapped a lord .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 3]: Who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 39]: This , ' he added , putting his hand into his waistcoat-pocket , and taking out a large tooth , at the sight of which both Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed , ` this was a bishop 's .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 6]: Beware , G. Varden ! '
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 27]: ` Now , I would rather , ' said the locksmith hastily , ` have paid five hundred pounds , than had this come to pass .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 14]: You idiot , do you know what peril you stand in ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 18]: I know it , sir , ' replied his journeyman , ` and it is my glory .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 9]: I was there , everybody saw me there .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 7]: I was conspicuous , and prominent .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 7]: I will abide the consequences . '
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 62]: The locksmith , really disturbed and agitated , paced to and fro in silence -- glancing at his former ` prentice every now and then -- and at length stopping before him , said : ` Get to bed , and sleep for a couple of hours that you may wake penitent , and with some of your senses about you .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 16]: Be sorry for what you have done , and we will try to save you .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 51]: If I call him by five o'clock , ' said Varden , turning hurriedly to his wife , and he washes himself clean and changes his dress , he may get to the Tower Stairs , and away by the Gravesend tide-boat , before any search is made for him .
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 24]: From there he can easily get on to Canterbury , where your cousin will give him work till this storm has blown over .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 52]: I am not sure that I do right in screening him from the punishment he deserves , but he has lived in this house , man and boy , for a dozen years , and I should be sorry if for this one day 's work he made a miserable end .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 18]: Lock the front-door , Miggs , and show no light towards the street when you go upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 4]: Quick , Simon !
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 5]: Get to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 54]: ` And do you suppose , sir , ' retorted Mr Tappertit , with a thickness and slowness of speech which contrasted forcibly with the rapidity and earnestness of his kind-hearted master -- ` and do you suppose , sir , that I am base and mean enough to accept your servile proposition ?
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 4]: -- Miscreant ! '
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 12]: ` Whatever you please , Sim , but get to bed .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 6]: Every minute is of consequence .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 7]: The light here , Miggs ! '
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 7]: ` Yes yes , oh do !
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 12]: Go to bed directly , ' cried the two women together .
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 57]: Mr Tappertit stood upon his feet , and pushing his chair away to show that he needed no assistance , answered , swaying himself to and fro , and managing his head as if it had no connection whatever with his body : ` You spoke of Miggs , sir -- Miggs may be smothered ! '
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 5]: ` Oh Simmun ! '
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 9]: ejaculated that young lady in a faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 4]: ` Oh mim !
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 3]: Oh sir !
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 13]: Oh goodness gracious , what a turn he has give me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 44]: ` This family may ALL be smothered , sir , ' returned Mr Tappertit , after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable disdain , ` excepting Mrs V. I have come here , sir , for her sake , this night .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 9]: Mrs Varden , take this piece of paper .
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 7]: It 's a protection , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 6]: You may need it . '
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 19]: With these words he held out at arm 's length , a dirty , crumpled scrap of writing .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 41]: The locksmith took it from him , opened it , and read as follows : ` All good friends to our cause , I hope will be particular , and do no injury to the property of any true Protestant .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 20]: I am well assured that the proprietor of this house is a staunch and worthy friend to the cause .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 4]: GEORGE GORDON . '
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 6]: ` What 's this ! '
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 9]: said the locksmith , with an altered face .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 23]: ` Something that 'll do you good service , young feller , ' replied his journeyman , ` as you 'll find .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 17]: Keep that safe , and where you can lay your hand upon it in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 24]: And chalk `` No Popery '' on your door to-morrow night , and for a week to come -- that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 24]: ` This is a genuine document , ' said the locksmith , ' I know , for I have seen the hand before .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 6]: What threat does it imply ?
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 7]: What devil is abroad ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 15]: A fiery devil , ' retorted Sim ; ' a flaming , furious devil .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 18]: Do n't you put yourself in its way , or you 're done for , my buck .
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 8]: Be warned in time , G. Varden .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 3]: Farewell ! '
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 65]: But here the two women threw themselves in his way -- especially Miss Miggs , who fell upon him with such fervour that she pinned him against the wall -- and conjured him in moving words not to go forth till he was sober ; to listen to reason ; to think of it ; to take some rest , and then determine . '
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 17]: I tell you , ' said Mr Tappertit , ` that my mind is made up .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 9]: My bleeding country calls me and I go !
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 18]: Miggs , if you do n't get out of the way , I 'll pinch you . '
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 34]: Miss Miggs , still clinging to the rebel , screamed once vociferously -- but whether in the distraction of her mind , or because of his having executed his threat , is uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 20]: ` Release me , ' said Simon , struggling to free himself from her chaste , but spider-like embrace .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 5]: ` Let me go !
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 25]: I have made arrangements for you in an altered state of society , and mean to provide for you comfortably in life -- there !
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 6]: Will that satisfy you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 5]: ` Oh Simmun ! '
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 4]: cried Miss Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 6]: ` Oh my blessed Simmun !
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 3]: Oh mim !
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 10]: what are my feelings at this conflicting moment ! '
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 90]: Of a rather turbulent description , it would seem ; for her nightcap had been knocked off in the scuffle , and she was on her knees upon the floor , making a strange revelation of blue and yellow curl-papers , straggling locks of hair , tags of staylaces , and strings of it 's impossible to say what ; panting for breath , clasping her hands , turning her eyes upwards , shedding abundance of tears , and exhibiting various other symptoms of the acutest mental suffering . '
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 29]: I leave , ' said Simon , turning to his master , with an utter disregard of Miggs 's maidenly affliction , ' a box of things upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 7]: Do what you like with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 6]: I do n't want 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 10]: I 'm never coming back here , any more .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 25]: Provide yourself , sir , with a journeyman ; I 'm my country 's journeyman ; henceforward that 's MY line of business . '
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 29]: ` Be what you like in two hours ' time , but now go up to bed , ' returned the locksmith , planting himself in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 6]: ` Do you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 6]: Go to bed ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 15]: I hear you , and defy you , Varden , ' rejoined Simon Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 27]: ` This night , sir , I have been in the country , planning an expedition which shall fill your bell-hanging soul with wonder and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 7]: The plot demands my utmost energy .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 5]: Let me pass ! '
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 18]: ` I 'll knock you down if you come near the door , ' replied the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 9]: ` You had better go to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 56]: Simon made no answer , but gathering himself up as straight as he could , plunged head foremost at his old master , and the two went driving out into the workshop together , plying their hands and feet so briskly that they looked like half-a-dozen , while Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed for twelve .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 89]: It would have been easy for Varden to knock his old ` prentice down , and bind him hand and foot ; but as he was loth to hurt him in his then defenceless state , he contented himself with parrying his blows when he could , taking them in perfect good part when he could not , and keeping between him and the door , until a favourable opportunity should present itself for forcing him to retreat up-stairs , and shutting him up in his own room .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 37]: But , in the goodness of his heart , he calculated too much upon his adversary 's weakness , and forgot that drunken men who have lost the power of walking steadily , can often run .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 46]: Watching his time , Simon Tappertit made a cunning show of falling back , staggered unexpectedly forward , brushed past him , opened the door -LRB- he knew the trick of that lock well -RRB- , and darted down the street like a mad dog .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 18]: The locksmith paused for a moment in the excess of his astonishment , and then gave chase .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 52]: It was an excellent season for a run , for at that silent hour the streets were deserted , the air was cool , and the flying figure before him distinctly visible at a great distance , as it sped away , with a long gaunt shadow following at its heels .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 34]: But the short-winded locksmith had no chance against a man of Sim 's youth and spare figure , though the day had been when he could have run him down in no time .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 46]: The space between them rapidly increased , and as the rays of the rising sun streamed upon Simon in the act of turning a distant corner , Gabriel Varden was fain to give up , and sit down on a doorstep to fetch his breath .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 75]: Simon meanwhile , without once stopping , fled at the same degree of swiftness to The Boot , where , as he well knew , some of his company were lying , and at which respectable hostelry -- for he had already acquired the distinction of being in great peril of the law -- a friendly watch had been expecting him all night , and was even now on the look-out for his coming .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 24]: ` Go thy ways , Sim , go thy ways , ' said the locksmith , as soon as he could speak . '
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 29]: I have done my best for thee , poor lad , and would have saved thee , but the rope is round thy neck , I fear . '
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 40]: So saying , and shaking his head in a very sorrowful and disconsolate manner , he turned back , and soon re-entered his own house , where Mrs Varden and the faithful Miggs had been anxiously expecting his return .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 81]: Now Mrs Varden -LRB- and by consequence Miss Miggs likewise -RRB- was impressed with a secret misgiving that she had done wrong ; that she had , to the utmost of her small means , aided and abetted the growth of disturbances , the end of which it was impossible to foresee ; that she had led remotely to the scene which had just passed ; and that the locksmith 's time for triumph and reproach had now arrived indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 69]: And so strongly did Mrs Varden feel this , and so crestfallen was she in consequence , that while her husband was pursuing their lost journeyman , she secreted under her chair the little red-brick dwelling-house with the yellow roof , lest it should furnish new occasion for reference to the painful theme ; and now hid the same still more , with the skirts of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 38]: But it happened that the locksmith had been thinking of this very article on his way home , and that , coming into the room and not seeing it , he at once demanded where it was .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 44]: Mrs Varden had no resource but to produce it , which she did with many tears , and broken protestations that if she could have known -- ` Yes , yes , ' said Varden , ` of course -- I know that .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 11]: I do n't mean to reproach you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 23]: But recollect from this time that all good things perverted to evil purposes , are worse than those which are naturally bad .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 9]: A thoroughly wicked woman , is wicked indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 15]: When religion goes wrong , she is very wrong , for the same reason .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 12]: Let us say no more about it , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 22]: So he dropped the red-brick dwelling-house on the floor , and setting his heel upon it , crushed it into pieces .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 30]: The halfpence , and sixpences , and other voluntary contributions , rolled about in all directions , but nobody offered to touch them , or to take them up .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 34]: ` That , ' said the locksmith , ` is easily disposed of , and I would to Heaven that everything growing out of the same society could be settled as easily . '
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 52]: ` It happens very fortunately , Varden , ' said his wife , with her handkerchief to her eyes , ` that in case any more disturbances should happen -- which I hope not ; I sincerely hope not -- ' ' I hope so too , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 23]: -- That in case any should occur , we have the piece of paper which that poor misguided young man brought . '
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 16]: ` Ay , to be sure , ' said the locksmith , turning quickly round .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 9]: ` Where is that piece of paper ? '
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 25]: Mrs Varden stood aghast as he took it from her outstretched band , tore it into fragments , and threw them under the grate .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 6]: ` Not use it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 5]: ` Use it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 4]: cried the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 54]: Let them come and pull the roof about our ears ; let them burn us out of house and home ; I 'd neither have the protection of their leader , nor chalk their howl upon my door , though , for not doing it , they shot me on my own threshold .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 3]: Use it !
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 8]: Let them come and do their worst .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 22]: The first man who crosses my doorstep on such an errand as theirs , had better be a hundred miles away .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 6]: Let him look to it .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 7]: The others may have their will .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 29]: I would n't beg or buy them off , if , instead of every pound of iron in the place , there was a hundred weight of gold .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 7]: Get you to bed , Martha .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 12]: I shall take down the shutters and go to work . '
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 5]: ` So early ! '
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 4]: said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 13]: ` Ay , ' replied the locksmith cheerily , ` so early .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 35]: Come when they may , they shall not find us skulking and hiding , as if we feared to take our portion of the light of day , and left it all to them .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 14]: So pleasant dreams to you , my dear , and cheerful sleep ! '
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 31]: With that he gave his wife a hearty kiss , and bade her delay no longer , or it would be time to rise before she lay down to rest .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 49]: Mrs Varden quite amiably and meekly walked upstairs , followed by Miggs , who , although a good deal subdued , could not refrain from sundry stimulative coughs and sniffs by the way , or from holding up her hands in astonishment at the daring conduct of master .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 19]: Chapter 52 A mob is usually a creature of very mysterious existence , particularly in a large city .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 14]: Where it comes from or whither it goes , few men can tell .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 51]: Assembling and dispersing with equal suddenness , it is as difficult to follow to its various sources as the sea itself ; nor does the parallel stop here , for the ocean is not more fickle and uncertain , more terrible when roused , more unreasonable , or more cruel .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 39]: The people who were boisterous at Westminster upon the Friday morning , and were eagerly bent upon the work of devastation in Duke Street and Warwick Street at night , were , in the mass , the same .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 39]: Allowing for the chance accessions of which any crowd is morally sure in a town where there must always be a large number of idle and profligate persons , one and the same mob was at both places .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 44]: Yet they spread themselves in various directions when they dispersed in the afternoon , made no appointment for reassembling , had no definite purpose or design , and indeed , for anything they knew , were scattered beyond the hope of future union .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 34]: At The Boot , which , as has been shown , was in a manner the head-quarters of the rioters , there were not , upon this Friday night , a dozen people .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 21]: Some slept in the stable and outhouses , some in the common room , some two or three in beds .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 10]: The rest were in their usual homes or haunts .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 38]: Perhaps not a score in all lay in the adjacent fields and lanes , and under haystacks , or near the warmth of brick-kilns , who had not their accustomed place of rest beneath the open sky .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 32]: As to the public ways within the town , they had their ordinary nightly occupants , and no others ; the usual amount of vice and wretchedness , but no more .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 56]: The experience of one evening , however , had taught the reckless leaders of disturbance , that they had but to show themselves in the streets , to be immediately surrounded by materials which they could only have kept together when their aid was not required , at great risk , expense , and trouble .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 46]: Once possessed of this secret , they were as confident as if twenty thousand men , devoted to their will , had been encamped about them , and assumed a confidence which could not have been surpassed , though that had really been the case .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 9]: All day , Saturday , they remained quiet .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 36]: On Sunday , they rather studied how to keep their men within call , and in full hope , than to follow out , by any fierce measure , their first day 's proceedings . '
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 53]: I hope , ' said Dennis , as , with a loud yawn , he raised his body from a heap of straw on which he had been sleeping , and supporting his head upon his hand , appealed to Hugh on Sunday morning , ` that Muster Gashford allows some rest ?
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 13]: Perhaps he 'd have us at work again already , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 24]: ` It 's not his way to let matters drop , you may be sure of that , ' growled Hugh in answer .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 12]: ` I 'm in no humour to stir yet , though .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 29]: I 'm as stiff as a dead body , and as full of ugly scratches as if I had been fighting all day yesterday with wild cats . '
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 49]: ` You 've so much enthusiasm , that 's it , ' said Dennis , looking with great admiration at the uncombed head , matted beard , and torn hands and face of the wild figure before him ; ` you 're such a devil of a fellow .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 28]: You hurt yourself a hundred times more than you need , because you will be foremost in everything , and will do more than the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 39]: ` For the matter of that , ' returned Hugh , shaking back his ragged hair and glancing towards the door of the stable in which they lay ; ` there 's one yonder as good as me .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 8]: What did I tell you about him ?
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 15]: Did I say he was worth a dozen , when you doubted him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 51]: Mr Dennis rolled lazily over upon his breast , and resting his chin upon his hand in imitation of the attitude in which Hugh lay , said , as he too looked towards the door : ` Ay , ay , you knew him , brother , you knew him .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 20]: But who 'd suppose to look at that chap now , that he could be the man he is !
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 41]: Is n't it a thousand cruel pities , brother , that instead of taking his nat ` ral rest and qualifying himself for further exertions in this here honourable cause , he should be playing at soldiers like a boy ?
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 6]: And his cleanliness too ! '
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 37]: said Mr Dennis , who certainly had no reason to entertain a fellow feeling with anybody who was particular on that score ; ` what weaknesses he 's guilty of ; with respect to his cleanliness !
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 38]: At five o'clock this morning , there he was at the pump , though any one would think he had gone through enough , the day before yesterday , to be pretty fast asleep at that time .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 41]: But no -- when I woke for a minute or two , there he was at the pump , and if you 'd seen him sticking them peacock 's feathers into his hat when he 'd done washing -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 26]: I 'm sorry he 's such a imperfect character , but the best on us is incomplete in some pint of view or another . '
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 80]: The subject of this dialogue and of these concluding remarks , which were uttered in a tone of philosophical meditation , was , as the reader will have divined , no other than Barnaby , who , with his flag in hand , stood sentry in the little patch of sunlight at the distant door , or walked to and fro outside , singing softly to himself ; and keeping time to the music of some clear church bells .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 67]: Whether he stood still , leaning with both hands on the flagstaff , or , bearing it upon his shoulder , paced slowly up and down , the careful arrangement of his poor dress , and his erect and lofty bearing , showed how high a sense he had of the great importance of his trust , and how happy and how proud it made him .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 53]: To Hugh and his companion , who lay in a dark corner of the gloomy shed , he , and the sunlight , and the peaceful Sabbath sound to which he made response , seemed like a bright picture framed by the door , and set off by the stable 's blackness .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 47]: The whole formed such a contrast to themselves , as they lay wallowing , like some obscene animals , in their squalor and wickedness on the two heaps of straw , that for a few moments they looked on without speaking , and felt almost ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 42]: ` said Hugh at length , carrying it off with a laugh : ` He 's a rare fellow is Barnaby , and can do more , with less rest , or meat , or drink , than any of us .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 13]: As to his soldiering , I put him on duty there . '
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 37]: ` Then there was a object in it , and a proper good one too , I 'll be sworn , ' retorted Dennis with a broad grin , and an oath of the same quality .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 8]: ` What was it , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 47]: ` Why , you see , ' said Hugh , crawling a little nearer to him , ` that our noble captain yonder , came in yesterday morning rather the worse for liquor , and was -- like you and me -- ditto last night . '
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 20]: Dennis looked to where Simon Tappertit lay coiled upon a truss of hay , snoring profoundly , and nodded .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 35]: ` And our noble captain , ' continued Hugh with another laugh , ` our noble captain and I , have planned for to-morrow a roaring expedition , with good profit in it . '
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 6]: ` Again the Papists ? '
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 7]: asked Dennis , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 32]: ` Ay , against the Papists -- against one of 'em at least , that some of us , and I for one , owe a good heavy grudge to . '
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 19]: ` Not Muster Gashford 's friend that he spoke to us about in my house , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 8]: said Dennis , brimfull of pleasant expectation .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 9]: ` The same man , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 25]: ` That 's your sort , ' cried Mr Dennis , gaily shaking hands with him , ` that 's the kind of game .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 20]: Let 's have revenges and injuries , and all that , and we shall get on twice as fast .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 7]: Now you talk , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 25]: The captain , ' added Hugh , ` has thoughts of carrying off a woman in the bustle , and -- ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 7]: -- and so have I ! '
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 56]: Mr Dennis received this part of the scheme with a wry face , observing that as a general principle he objected to women altogether , as being unsafe and slippery persons on whom there was no calculating with any certainty , and who were never in the same mind for four-and-twenty hours at a stretch .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 111]: He might have expatiated on this suggestive theme at much greater length , but that it occurred to him to ask what connection existed between the proposed expedition and Barnaby 's being posted at the stable-door as sentry ; to which Hugh cautiously replied in these words : ` Why , the people we mean to visit , were friends of his , once upon a time , and I know that much of him to feel pretty sure that if he thought we were going to do them any harm , he 'd be no friend to our side , but would lend a ready hand to the other .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 58]: So I 've persuaded him -LRB- for I know him of old -RRB- that Lord George has picked him out to guard this place to-morrow while we 're away , and that it 's a great honour -- and so he 's on duty now , and as proud of it as if he was a general .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 20]: What do you say to me for a careful man as well as a devil of a one ? '
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 52]: Mr Dennis exhausted himself in compliments , and then added , ` But about the expedition itself -- ' ` About that , ' said Hugh , ` you shall hear all particulars from me and the great captain conjointly and both together -- for see , he 's waking up .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 5]: Rouse yourself , lion-heart .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 11]: Put a good face upon it , and drink again .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 11]: Another hair of the dog that bit you , captain !
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 4]: Call for drink !
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 49]: There 's enough of gold and silver cups and candlesticks buried underneath my bed , ' he added , rolling back the straw , and pointing to where the ground was newly turned , ` to pay for it , if it was a score of casks full .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 5]: Drink , captain ! '
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 40]: Mr Tappertit received these jovial promptings with a very bad grace , being much the worse , both in mind and body , for his two nights of debauch , and but indifferently able to stand upon his legs .
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 68]: With Hugh 's assistance , however , he contrived to stagger to the pump ; and having refreshed himself with an abundant draught of cold water , and a copious shower of the same refreshing liquid on his head and face , he ordered some rum and milk to be served ; and upon that innocent beverage and some biscuits and cheese made a pretty hearty meal .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 40]: That done , he disposed himself in an easy attitude on the ground beside his two companions -LRB- who were carousing after their own tastes -RRB- , and proceeded to enlighten Mr Dennis in reference to to-morrow 's project .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 24]: That their conversation was an interesting one , was rendered manifest by its length , and by the close attention of all three .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 48]: That it was not of an oppressively grave character , but was enlivened by various pleasantries arising out of the subject , was clear from their loud and frequent roars of laughter , which startled Barnaby on his post , and made him wonder at their levity .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 87]: But he was not summoned to join them , until they had eaten , and drunk , and slept , and talked together for some hours ; not , indeed , until the twilight ; when they informed him that they were about to make a slight demonstration in the streets -- just to keep the people 's hands in , as it was Sunday night , and the public might otherwise be disappointed -- and that he was free to accompany them if he would .
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 46]: Without the slightest preparation , saving that they carried clubs and wore the blue cockade , they sallied out into the streets ; and , with no more settled design than that of doing as much mischief as they could , paraded them at random .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 31]: Their numbers rapidly increasing , they soon divided into parties ; and agreeing to meet by-and-by , in the fields near Welbeck Street , scoured the town in various directions .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 23]: The largest body , and that which augmented with the greatest rapidity , was the one to which Hugh and Barnaby belonged .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 26]: This took its way towards Moorfields , where there was a rich chapel , and in which neighbourhood several Catholic families were known to reside .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 55]: Beginning with the private houses so occupied , they broke open the doors and windows ; and while they destroyed the furniture and left but the bare walls , made a sharp search for tools and engines of destruction , such as hammers , pokers , axes , saws , and such like instruments .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 32]: Many of the rioters made belts of cord , of handkerchiefs , or any material they found at hand , and wore these weapons as openly as pioneers upon a field-day .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 21]: There was not the least disguise or concealment -- indeed , on this night , very little excitement or hurry .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 33]: From the chapels , they tore down and took away the very altars , benches , pulpits , pews , and flooring ; from the dwelling-houses , the very wainscoting and stairs .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 22]: This Sunday evening 's recreation they pursued like mere workmen who had a certain task to do , and did it .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 67]: Fifty resolute men might have turned them at any moment ; a single company of soldiers could have scattered them like dust ; but no man interposed , no authority restrained them , and , except by the terrified persons who fled from their approach , they were as little heeded as if they were pursuing their lawful occupations with the utmost sobriety and good conduct .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 35]: In the same manner , they marched to the place of rendezvous agreed upon , made great fires in the fields , and reserving the most valuable of their spoils , burnt the rest .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 57]: Priestly garments , images of saints , rich stuffs and ornaments , altar-furniture and household goods , were cast into the flames , and shed a glare on the whole country round ; but they danced and howled , and roared about these fires till they were tired , and were never for an instant checked .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 40]: As the main body filed off from this scene of action , and passed down Welbeck Street , they came upon Gashford , who had been a witness of their proceedings , and was walking stealthily along the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 26]: Keeping up with him , and yet not seeming to speak , Hugh muttered in his ear : ` Is this better , master ? '
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 6]: ` It is not . '
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 7]: ` What would you have ? '
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 10]: ` Fevers are never at their height at once .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 9]: They must get on by degrees . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 37]: I would have you , ' said Gashford , pinching his arm with such malevolence that his nails seemed to meet in the skin ; ' I would have you put some meaning into your work .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 2]: Fools !
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 12]: Can you make no better bonfires than of rags and scraps ?
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 8]: Can you burn nothing whole ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 10]: A little patience , master , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 12]: ` Wait but a few hours , and you shall see .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 12]: Look for a redness in the sky , to-morrow night . '
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 27]: With that , he fell back into his place beside Barnaby ; and when the secretary looked after him , both were lost in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 96]: Chapter 53 The next day was ushered in by merry peals of bells , and by the firing of the Tower guns ; flags were hoisted on many of the church-steeples ; the usual demonstrations were made in honour of the anniversary of the King 's birthday ; and every man went about his pleasure or business as if the city were in perfect order , and there were no half-smouldering embers in its secret places , which , on the approach of night , would kindle up again and scatter ruin and dismay abroad .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 62]: The leaders of the riot , rendered still more daring by the success of last night and by the booty they had acquired , kept steadily together , and only thought of implicating the mass of their followers so deeply that no hope of pardon or reward might tempt them to betray their more notorious confederates into the hands of justice .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 23]: Indeed , the sense of having gone too far to be forgiven , held the timid together no less than the bold .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 91]: Many who would readily have pointed out the foremost rioters and given evidence against them , felt that escape by that means was hopeless , when their every act had been observed by scores of people who had taken no part in the disturbances ; who had suffered in their persons , peace , or property , by the outrages of the mob ; who would be most willing witnesses ; and whom the government would , no doubt , prefer to any King 's evidence that might be offered .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 79]: Many of this class had deserted their usual occupations on the Saturday morning ; some had been seen by their employers active in the tumult ; others knew they must be suspected , and that they would be discharged if they returned ; others had been desperate from the beginning , and comforted themselves with the homely proverb , that , being hanged at all , they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 46]: They all hoped and believed , in a greater or less degree , that the government they seemed to have paralysed , would , in its terror , come to terms with them in the end , and suffer them to make their own conditions .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 38]: The least sanguine among them reasoned with himself that , at the worst , they were too many to be all punished , and that he had as good a chance of escape as any other man .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 37]: The great mass never reasoned or thought at all , but were stimulated by their own headlong passions , by poverty , by ignorance , by the love of mischief , and the hope of plunder .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 34]: One other circumstance is worthy of remark ; and that is , that from the moment of their first outbreak at Westminster , every symptom of order or preconcerted arrangement among them vanished .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 24]: When they divided into parties and ran to different quarters of the town , it was on the spontaneous suggestion of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 40]: Each party swelled as it went along , like rivers as they roll towards the sea ; new leaders sprang up as they were wanted , disappeared when the necessity was over , and reappeared at the next crisis .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 48]: Each tumult took shape and form from the circumstances of the moment ; sober workmen , going home from their day 's labour , were seen to cast down their baskets of tools and become rioters in an instant ; mere boys on errands did the like .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 12]: In a word , a moral plague ran through the city .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 23]: The noise , and hurry , and excitement , had for hundreds and hundreds an attraction they had no firmness to resist .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 35]: The contagion spread like a dread fever : an infectious madness , as yet not near its height , seized on new victims every hour , and society began to tremble at their ravings .
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 34]: It was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon when Gashford looked into the lair described in the last chapter , and seeing only Barnaby and Dennis there , inquired for Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 23]: He was out , Barnaby told him ; had gone out more than an hour ago ; and had not yet returned .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 4]: ` Dennis ! '
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 23]: said the smiling secretary , in his smoothest voice , as he sat down cross-legged on a barrel , ` Dennis ! '
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 20]: The hangman struggled into a sitting posture directly , and with his eyes wide open , looked towards him .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 9]: ` How do you do , Dennis ? '
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 6]: said Gashford , nodding . '
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 16]: I hope you have suffered no inconvenience from your late exertions , Dennis ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 35]: I always will say of you , Muster Gashford , ' returned the hangman , staring at him , ` that that ` ere quiet way of yours might almost wake a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 27]: It is , ' he added , with a muttered oath -- still staring at him in a thoughtful manner -- ` so awful sly ! '
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 8]: ` So distinct , eh Dennis ? '
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 4]: ` Distinct ! '
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 34]: he answered , scratching his head , and keeping his eyes upon the secretary 's face ; ' I seem to hear it , Muster Gashford , in my wery bones . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 33]: I am very glad your sense of hearing is so sharp , and that I succeed in making myself so intelligible , ' said Gashford , in his unvarying , even tone .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 7]: ` Where is your friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 47]: Mr Dennis looked round as in expectation of beholding him asleep upon his bed of straw ; then remembering he had seen him go out , replied : ' I ca n't say where he is , Muster Gashford , I expected him back afore now .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 15]: I hope it is n't time that we was busy , Muster Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 18]: ` Nay , ' said the secretary , ` who should know that as well as you ?
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 8]: How can I tell you , Dennis ?
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 26]: You are perfect master of your own actions , you know , and accountable to nobody -- except sometimes to the law , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 38]: Dennis , who was very much baffled by the cool matter-of-course manner of this reply , recovered his self-possession on his professional pursuits being referred to , and pointing towards Barnaby , shook his head and frowned .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 3]: cried Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 41]: Do hush about that , Muster Gashford , ' said the hangman in a low voice , ` pop ` lar prejudices -- you always forget -- well , Barnaby , my lad , what 's the matter ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 12]: I hear him coming , ' he answered : ` Hark !
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 5]: Do you mark that ?
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 5]: That 's his foot !
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 14]: Bless you , I know his step , and his dog 's too .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 17]: Tramp , tramp , pit-pat , on they come together , and , ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 7]: -- and here they are ! '
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 41]: he cried , joyfully welcoming Hugh with both hands , and then patting him fondly on the back , as if instead of being the rough companion he was , he had been one of the most prepossessing of men .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 9]: ` Here he is , and safe too !
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 13]: I am glad to see him back again , old Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 41]: ` I 'm a Turk if he do n't give me a warmer welcome always than any man of sense , ' said Hugh , shaking hands with him with a kind of ferocious friendship , strange enough to see .
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 8]: ` How are you , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 4]: ` Hearty ! '
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 7]: cried Barnaby , waving his hat .
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 6]: And merrry too , Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 37]: And ready to do anything for the good cause , and the right , and to help the kind , mild , pale-faced gentleman -- the lord they used so ill -- eh , Hugh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 25]: returned his friend , dropping his hand , and looking at Gashford for an instant with a changed expression before he spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 7]: ` Good day , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 16]: ` And good day to you , ' replied the secretary , nursing his leg .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 14]: ` And many good days -- whole years of them , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 5]: You are heated . '
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 31]: ` So would you have been , master , ' said Hugh , wiping his face , ` if you 'd been running here as fast as I have . '
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 8]: ` You know the news , then ?
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 11]: Yes , I supposed you would have heard it . '
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 3]: ` News !
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 4]: what news ? '
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 6]: ` You do n't ? '
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 12]: cried Gashford , raising his eyebrows with an exclamation of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 19]: Come ; then I AM the first to make you acquainted with your distinguished position , after all .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 10]: Do you see the King 's Arms a-top ? '
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 26]: he smilingly asked , as he took a large paper from his pocket , unfolded it , and held it out for Hugh 's inspection .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 8]: ` What 's that to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 3]: ` Much .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 9]: A great deal , ' replied the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 6]: ` Read it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 23]: I told you , the first time I saw you , that I could n't read , ' said Hugh , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 13]: ` What in the Devil 's name 's inside of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 67]: ` It is a proclamation from the King in Council , ' said Gashford , ` dated to-day , and offering a reward of five hundred pounds -- five hundred pounds is a great deal of money , and a large temptation to some people -- to any one who will discover the person or persons most active in demolishing those chapels on Saturday night . '
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 9]: cried Hugh , with an indifferent air . '
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 6]: I knew of that . '
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 22]: ` Truly I might have known you did , ' said Gashford , smiling , and folding up the document again .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 21]: ` Your friend , I might have guessed -- indeed I did guess -- was sure to tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 5]: ` My friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 11]: stammered Hugh , with an unsuccessful effort to appear surprised .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 5]: ` What friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 17]: ` Tut tut -- do you suppose I do n't know where you have been ? '
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 29]: retorted Gashford , rubbing his hands , and beating the back of one on the palm of the other , and looking at him with a cunning eye .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 7]: ` How dull you think me !
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 7]: Shall I say his name ? '
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 14]: ` No , ' said Hugh , with a hasty glance towards Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 54]: ` You have also heard from him , no doubt , ' resumed the secretary , after a moment 's pause , ` that the rioters who have been taken -LRB- poor fellows -RRB- are committed for trial , and that some very active witnesses have had the temerity to appear against them .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 32]: Among others -- ' and here he clenched his teeth , as if he would suppress by force some violent words that rose upon his tongue ; and spoke very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 24]: ` Among others , a gentleman who saw the work going on in Warwick Street ; a Catholic gentleman ; one Haredale . '
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 15]: Hugh would have prevented his uttering the word , but it was out already .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 9]: Hearing the name , Barnaby turned swiftly round .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 9]: ` Duty , duty , bold Barnaby ! '
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 26]: cried Hugh , assuming his wildest and most rapid manner , and thrusting into his hand his staff and flag which leant against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 16]: ` Mount guard without loss of time , for we are off upon our expedition .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 8]: Up , Dennis , and get ready !
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 24]: Take care that no one turns the straw upon my bed , brave Barnaby ; we know what 's underneath it -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 6]: Now , master , quick !
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 29]: What you have to say , say speedily , for the little captain and a cluster of 'em are in the fields , and only waiting for us .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 11]: Sharp 's the word , and strike 's the action .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 3]: Quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 10]: Barnaby was not proof against this bustle and despatch .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 60]: The look of mingled astonishtnent and anger which had appeared in his face when he turned towards them , faded from it as the words passed from his memory , like breath from a polished mirror ; and grasping the weapon which Hugh forced upon him , he proudly took his station at the door , beyond their hearing .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 14]: ` You might have spoiled our plans , master , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 10]: ` YOU , too , of all men ! '
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 13]: ` Who would have supposed that HE would be so quick ? '
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 3]: urged Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 35]: ` He 's as quick sometimes -- I do n't mean with his hands , for that you know , but with his head -- as you or any man , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 22]: ` Dennis , it 's time we were going ; they 're waiting for us ; I came to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 7]: Reach me my stick and belt .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 6]: Lend a hand , master .
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 15]: Fling this over my shoulder , and buckle it behind , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 6]: ` Brisk as ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 13]: said the secretary , adjusting it for him as he desired . '
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 14]: A man need be brisk to-day ; there 's brisk work a-foot . '
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 8]: ` There is , is there ? '
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 3]: said Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 30]: He said it with such a provoking assumption of ignorance , that Hugh , looking over his shoulder and angrily down upon him , replied : ` Is there !
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 5]: You know there is !
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 42]: Who knows better than you , master , that the first great step to be taken is to make examples of these witnesses , and frighten all men from appearing against us or any of our body , any more ? '
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 98]: ` There 's one we know of , ' returned Gashford , with an expressive smile , ` who is at least as well informed upon that subject as you or I. ' ` If we mean the same gentleman , as I suppose we do , ' Hugh rejoined softly , ' I tell you this -- he 's as good and quick information about everything as -- ' here he paused and looked round , as if to make sure that the person in question was not within hearing , ` as Old Nick himself .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 7]: Have you done that , master ?
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 6]: How slow you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 14]: ` It 's quite fast now , ' said Gashford , rising . '
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 17]: I say -- you did n't find that your friend disapproved of to-day 's little expedition ?
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 24]: It is fortunate it jumps so well with the witness policy ; for , once planned , it must have been carried out .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 9]: And now you are going , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 9]: ` Now we are going , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 3]: Hugh replied .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 6]: ` Any parting words ? '
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 11]: ` Oh dear , no , ' said Gashford sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 4]: ` None ! '
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 6]: ` You 're sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 8]: cried Hugh , nudging the grinning Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 10]: ` Quite sure , eh , Muster Gashford ? '
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 4]: chuckled the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 69]: Gashford paused a moment , struggling with his caution and his malice ; then putting himself between the two men , and laying a hand upon the arm of each , said , in a cramped whisper : ` Do not , my good friends -- I am sure you will not -- forget our talk one night -- in your house , Dennis -- about this person .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 22]: No mercy , no quarter , no two beams of his house to be left standing where the builder placed them !
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 16]: Fire , the saying goes , is a good servant , but a bad master .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 10]: Makes it HIS master ; he deserves no better .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 39]: But I am sure you will be firm , I am sure you will be very resolute , I am sure you will remember that he thirsts for your lives , and those of all your brave companions .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 14]: If you ever acted like staunch fellows , you will do so to-day .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 13]: Wo n't you , Dennis -- wo n't you , Hugh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 33]: The two looked at him , and at each other ; then bursting into a roar of laughter , brandished their staves above their heads , shook hands , and hurried out .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 12]: When they had been gone a little time , Gashford followed .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 69]: They were yet in sight , and hastening to that part of the adjacent fields in which their fellows had already mustered ; Hugh was looking back , and flourishing his hat to Barnaby , who , delighted with his trust , replied in the same way , and then resumed his pacing up and down before the stable-door , where his feet had worn a path already .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 65]: And when Gashford himself was far distant , and looked back for the last time , he was still walking to and fro , with the same measured tread ; the most devoted and the blithest champion that ever maintained a post , and felt his heart lifted up with a brave sense of duty , and determination to defend it to the last .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 54]: Smiling at the simplicity of the poor idiot , Gashford betook himself to Welbeck Street by a different path from that which he knew the rioters would take , and sitting down behind a curtain in one of the upper windows of Lord George Gordon 's house , waited impatiently for their coming .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 35]: They were so long , that although he knew it had been settled they should come that way , he had a misgiving they must have changed their plans and taken some other route .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 27]: But at length the roar of voices was heard in the neighbouring fields , and soon afterwards they came thronging past , in a great body .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 65]: However , they were not all , nor nearly all , in one body , but were , as he soon found , divided into four parties , each of which stopped before the house to give three cheers , and then went on ; the leaders crying out in what direction they were going , and calling on the spectators to join them .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 57]: The first detachment , carrying , by way of banners , some relics of the havoc they had made in Moorfields , proclaimed that they were on their way to Chelsea , whence they would return in the same order , to make of the spoil they bore , a great bonfire , near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 34]: The second gave out that they were bound for Wapping , to destroy a chapel ; the third , that their place of destination was East Smithfield , and their object the same .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 12]: All this was done in broad , bright , summer day .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 67]: Gay carriages and chairs stopped to let them pass , or turned back to avoid them ; people on foot stood aside in doorways , or perhaps knocked and begged permission to stand at a window , or in the hall , until the rioters had passed : but nobody interfered with them ; and when they had gone by , everything went on as usual .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 19]: There still remained the fourth body , and for that the secretary looked with a most intense eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 6]: At last it came up .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 44]: It was numerous , and composed of picked men ; for as he gazed down among them , he recognised many upturned faces which he knew well -- those of Simon Tappertit , Hugh , and Dennis in the front , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 30]: They halted and cheered , as the others had done ; but when they moved again , they did not , like them , proclaim what design they had .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 27]: Hugh merely raised his hat upon the bludgeon he carried , and glancing at a spectator on the opposite side of the way , was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 27]: Gashford followed the direction of his glance instinctively , and saw , standing on the pavement , and wearing the blue cockade , Sir John Chester .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 49]: He held his hat an inch or two above his head , to propitiate the mob ; and , resting gracefully on his cane , smiling pleasantly , and displaying his dress and person to the very best advantage , looked on in the most tranquil state imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 25]: For all that , and quick and dexterous as he was , Gashford had seen him recognise Hugh with the air of a patron .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 19]: He had no longer any eyes for the crowd , but fixed his keen regards upon Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 83]: He stood in the same place and posture until the last man in the concourse had turned the corner of the street ; then very deliberately took the blue cockade out of his hat ; put it carefully in his pocket , ready for the next emergency ; refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff ; put up his box ; and was walking slowly off , when a passing carriage stopped , and a lady 's hand let down the glass .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 9]: Sir John 's hat was off again immediately .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 36]: After a minute 's conversation at the carriage-window , in which it was apparent that he was vastly entertaining on the subject of the mob , he stepped lightly in , and was driven away .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 19]: The secretary smiled , but he had other thoughts to dwell upon , and soon dismissed the topic .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 57]: Dinner was brought him , but he sent it down untasted ; and , in restless pacings up and down the room , and constant glances at the clock , and many futile efforts to sit down and read , or go to sleep , or look out of the window , consumed four weary hours .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 38]: When the dial told him thus much time had crept away , he stole upstairs to the top of the house , and coming out upon the roof sat down , with his face towards the east .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 125]: Heedless of the fresh air that blew upon his heated brow , of the pleasant meadows from which he turned , of the piles of roofs and chimneys upon which he looked , of the smoke and rising mist he vainly sought to pierce , of the shrill cries of children at their evening sports , the distant hum and turmoil of the town , the cheerful country breath that rustled past to meet it , and to droop , and die ; he watched , and watched , till it was dark save for the specks of light that twinkled in the streets below and far away -- and , as the darkness deepened , strained his gaze and grew more eager yet .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 11]: ` Nothing but gloom in that direction , still ! '
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 4]: he muttered restlessly .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 3]: ` Dog !
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 13]: where is the redness in the sky , you promised me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 61]: Chapter 54 Rumours of the prevailing disturbances had , by this time , begun to be pretty generally circulated through the towns and villages round London , and the tidings were everywhere received with that appetite for the marvellous and love of the terrible which have probably been among the natural characteristics of mankind since the creation of the world .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 92]: These accounts , however , appeared , to many persons at that day -- as they would to us at the present , but that we know them to be matter of history -- so monstrous and improbable , that a great number of those who were resident at a distance , and who were credulous enough on other points , were really unable to bring their minds to believe that such things could be ; and rejected the intelligence they received on all hands , as wholly fabulous and absurd .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 46]: Mr Willet -- not so much , perhaps , on account of his having argued and settled the matter with himself , as by reason of his constitutional obstinacy -- was one of those who positively refused to entertain the current topic for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 71]: On this very evening , and perhaps at the very time when Gashford kept his solitary watch , old John was so red in the face with perpetually shaking his head in contradiction of his three ancient cronies and pot companions , that he was quite a phenomenon to behold , and lighted up the Maypole Porch wherein they sat together , like a monstrous carbuncle in a fairy tale .
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 53]: ` Do you think , sir , ' said Mr Willet , looking hard at Solomon Daisy -- for it was his custom in cases of personal altercation to fasten upon the smallest man in the party -- ` do you think , sir , that I 'm a born fool ? '
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 32]: ` No , no , Johnny , ' returned Solomon , looking round upon the little circle of which he formed a part : ` We all know better than that .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 7]: You 're no fool , Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 5]: No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 24]: Mr Cobb and Mr Parkes shook their heads in unison , muttering , ` No , no , Johnny , not you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 73]: But as such compliments had usually the effect of making Mr Willet rather more dogged than before , he surveyed them with a look of deep disdain , and returned for answer : ` Then what do you mean by coming here , and telling me that this evening you 're a-going to walk up to London together -- you three -- you -- and have the evidence of your own senses ?
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 34]: A n't , ' said Mr Willet , putting his pipe in his mouth with an air of solemn disgust , ` a n't the evidence of MY senses enough for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 16]: ` But we have n't got it , Johnny , ' pleaded Parkes , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 10]: ` You have n't got it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 11]: repeated Mr Willet , eyeing him from top to toe .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 9]: ` You have n't got it , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 7]: You HAVE got it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 38]: Do n't I tell you that His blessed Majesty King George the Third would no more stand a rioting and rollicking in his streets , than he 'd stand being crowed over by his own Parliament ? '
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 22]: ` Yes , Johnny , but that 's your sense -- not your senses , ' said the adventurous Mr Parkes .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 6]: ` How do you know ?
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 7]: ` retorted John with great dignity .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 13]: ` You 're a contradicting pretty free , you are , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 8]: How do YOU know which it is ?
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 12]: I 'm not aware I ever told you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 32]: Mr Parkes , finding himself in the position of having got into metaphysics without exactly seeing his way out of them , stammered forth an apology and retreated from the argument .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 55]: There then ensued a silence of some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour , at the expiration of which period Mr Willet was observed to rumble and shake with laughter , and presently remarked , in reference to his late adversary , ` that he hoped he had tackled him enough . '
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 22]: Thereupon Messrs Cobb and Daisy laughed , and nodded , and Parkes was looked upon as thoroughly and effectually put down .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 25]: ` Do you suppose if all this was true , that Mr Haredale would be constantly away from home , as he is ? '
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 7]: said John , after another silence .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 32]: ` Do you think he would n't be afraid to leave his house with them two young women in it , and only a couple of men , or so ? '
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 49]: ` Ay , but then you know , ' returned Solomon Daisy , ` his house is a goodish way out of London , and they do say that the rioters wo n't go more than two miles , or three at the farthest , off the stones .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 30]: Besides , you know , some of the Catholic gentlefolks have actually sent trinkets and suchlike down here for safety -- at least , so the story goes . '
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 6]: ` The story goes ! '
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 5]: said Mr Willet testily .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 11]: The story goes that you saw a ghost last March .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 6]: But nobody believes it . '
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 49]: said Solomon , rising , to divert the attention of his two friends , who tittered at this retort : ` believed or disbelieved , it 's true ; and true or not , if we mean to go to London , we must be going at once .
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 12]: So shake hands , Johnny , and good night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 30]: I shall shake hands , ' returned the landlord , putting his into his pockets , ` with no man as goes to London on such nonsensical errands . '
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 76]: The three cronies were therefore reduced to the necessity of shaking his elbows ; having performed that ceremony , and brought from the house their hats , and sticks , and greatcoats , they bade him good night and departed ; promising to bring him on the morrow full and true accounts of the real state of the city , and if it were quiet , to give him the full merit of his victory .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 42]: John Willet looked after them , as they plodded along the road in the rich glow of a summer evening ; and knocking the ashes out of his pipe , laughed inwardly at their folly , until his sides were sore .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 53]: When he had quite exhausted himself -- which took some time , for he laughed as slowly as he thought and spoke -- he sat himself comfortably with his back to the house , put his legs upon the bench , then his apron over his face , and fell sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 49]: How long he slept , matters not ; but it was for no brief space , for when he awoke , the rich light had faded , the sombre hues of night were falling fast upon the landscape , and a few bright stars were already twinkling overhead .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 61]: The birds were all at roost , the daisies on the green had closed their fairy hoods , the honeysuckle twining round the porch exhaled its perfume in a twofold degree , as though it lost its coyness at that silent time and loved to shed its fragrance on the night ; the ivy scarcely stirred its deep green leaves .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 9]: How tranquil , and how beautiful it was !
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 22]: Was there no sound in the air , besides the gentle rustling of the trees and the grasshopper 's merry chirp ?
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 14]: Something very faint and distant , not unlike the murmuring in a sea-shell .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 15]: Now it grew louder , fainter now , and now it altogether died away .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 22]: Presently , it came again , subsided , came once more , grew louder , fainter -- swelled into a roar .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 12]: It was on the road , and varied with its windings .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 21]: All at once it burst into a distinct sound -- the voices , and the tramping feet of many men .
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 63]: It is questionable whether old John Willet , even then , would have thought of the rioters but for the cries of his cook and housemaid , who ran screaming upstairs and locked themselves into one of the old garrets , -- shrieking dismally when they had done so , by way of rendering their place of refuge perfectly secret and secure .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 32]: These two females did afterwards depone that Mr Willet in his consternation uttered but one word , and called that up the stairs in a stentorian voice , six distinct times .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 59]: But as this word was a monosyllable , which , however inoffensive when applied to the quadruped it denotes , is highly reprehensible when used in connection with females of unimpeachable character , many persons were inclined to believe that the young women laboured under some hallucination caused by excessive fear ; and that their ears deceived them .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 37]: Be this as it may , John Willet , in whom the very uttermost extent of dull-headed perplexity supplied the place of courage , stationed himself in the porch , and waited for their coming up .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 45]: Once , it dimly occurred to him that there was a kind of door to the house , which had a lock and bolts ; and at the same time some shadowy ideas of shutters to the lower windows , flitted through his brain .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 35]: But he stood stock still , looking down the road in the direction in which the noise was rapidly advancing , and did not so much as take his hands out of his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 7]: He had not to wait long .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 56]: A dark mass , looming through a cloud of dust , soon became visible ; the mob quickened their pace ; shouting and whooping like savages , they came rushing on pell mell ; and in a few seconds he was bandied from hand to hand , in the heart of a crowd of men .
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 17]: cried a voice he knew , as the man who spoke came cleaving through the throng .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 5]: ` Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 5]: Give him to me .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 5]: Do n't hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 6]: How now , old Jack !
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 21]: Mr Willet looked at him , and saw it was Hugh ; but he said nothing , and thought nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 10]: ` These lads are thirsty and must drink ! '
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 10]: cried Hugh , thrusting him back towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 7]: ` Bustle , Jack , bustle .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 22]: Show us the best -- the very best -- the over-proof that you keep for your own drinking , Jack ! '
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 13]: John faintly articulated the words , ` Who 's to pay ? '
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 11]: ` He says `` Who 's to pay ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 16]: cried Hugh , with a roar of laughter which was loudly echoed by the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 11]: Then turning to John , he added , ` Pay !
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 5]: Why , nobody . '
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 122]: John stared round at the mass of faces -- some grinning , some fierce , some lighted up by torches , some indistinct , some dusky and shadowy : some looking at him , some at his house , some at each other -- and while he was , as he thought , in the very act of doing so , found himself , without any consciousness of having moved , in the bar ; sitting down in an arm-chair , and watching the destruction of his property , as if it were some queer play or entertainment , of an astonishing and stupefying nature , but having no reference to himself -- that he could make out -- at all .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 318]: Here was the bar -- the bar that the boldest never entered without special invitation -- the sanctuary , the mystery , the hallowed ground : here it was , crammed with men , clubs , sticks , torches , pistols ; filled with a deafening noise , oaths , shouts , screams , hootings ; changed all at once into a bear-garden , a madhouse , an infernal temple : men darting in and out , by door and window , smashing the glass , turning the taps , drinking liquor out of China punchbowls , sitting astride of casks , smoking private and personal pipes , cutting down the sacred grove of lemons , hacking and hewing at the celebrated cheese , breaking open inviolable drawers , putting things in their pockets which did n't belong to them , dividing his own money before his own eyes , wantonly wasting , breaking , pulling down and tearing up : nothing quiet , nothing private : men everywhere -- above , below , overhead , in the bedrooms , in the kitchen , in the yard , in the stables -- clambering in at windows when there were doors wide open ; dropping out of windows when the stairs were handy ; leaping over the bannisters into chasms of passages : new faces and figures presenting themselves every instant -- some yelling , some singing , some fighting , some breaking glass and crockery , some laying the dust with the liquor they could n't drink , some ringing the bells till they pulled them down , others beating them with pokers till they beat them into fragments : more men still -- more , more , more -- swarming on like insects : noise , smoke , light , darkness , frolic , anger , laughter , groans , plunder , fear , and ruin !
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 44]: Nearly all the time while John looked on at this bewildering scene , Hugh kept near him ; and though he was the loudest , wildest , most destructive villain there , he saved his old master 's bones a score of times .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 73]: Nay , even when Mr Tappertit , excited by liquor , came up , and in assertion of his prerogative politely kicked John Willet on the shins , Hugh bade him return the compliment ; and if old John had had sufficient presence of mind to understand this whispered direction , and to profit by it , he might no doubt , under Hugh 's protection , have done so with impunity .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 28]: At length the band began to reassemble outside the house , and to call to those within , to join them , for they were losing time .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 60]: These murmurs increasing , and attaining a high pitch , Hugh , and some of those who yet lingered in the bar , and who plainly were the leaders of the troop , took counsel together , apart , as to what was to be done with John , to keep him quiet until their Chigwell work was over .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 72]: Some proposed to set the house on fire and leave him in it ; others , that he should be reduced to a state of temporary insensibility , by knocking on the head ; others , that he should be sworn to sit where he was until to-morrow at the same hour ; others again , that he should be gagged and taken off with them , under a sufficient guard .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 28]: All these propositions being overruled , it was concluded , at last , to bind him in his chair , and the word was passed for Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 9]: ` Look ` ee here , Jack ! '
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 28]: said Hugh , striding up to him : ` We are going to tie you , hand and foot , but otherwise you wo n't be hurt .
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 4]: D'ye hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 30]: John Willet looked at another man , as if he did n't know which was the speaker , and muttered something about an ordinary every Sunday at two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 18]: ` You wo n't be hurt I tell you , Jack -- do you hear me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 18]: roared Hugh , impressing the assurance upon him by means of a heavy blow on the back .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 14]: ` He 's so dead scared , he 's woolgathering , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 10]: Give him a drop of something to drink here .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 8]: Hand over , one of you . '
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 18]: A glass of liquor being passed forward , Hugh poured the contents down old John 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 80]: Mr Willet feebly smacked his lips , thrust his hand into his pocket , and inquired what was to pay ; adding , as he looked vacantly round , that he believed there was a trifle of broken glass -- ` He 's out of his senses for the time , it 's my belief , ' said Hugh , after shaking him , without any visible effect upon his system , until his keys rattled in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 7]: ` Where 's that Dennis ? '
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 42]: The word was again passed , and presently Mr Dennis , with a long cord bound about his middle , something after the manner of a friar , came hurrying in , attended by a body-guard of half-a-dozen of his men .
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 5]: Be alive here ! '
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 10]: cried Hugh , stamping his foot upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 5]: ` Make haste ! '
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 47]: Dennis , with a wink and a nod , unwound the cord from about his person , and raising his eyes to the ceiling , looked all over it , and round the walls and cornice , with a curious eye ; then shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 10]: ` Move , man , ca n't you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 11]: cried Hugh , with another impatient stamp of his foot .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 24]: ` Are we to wait here , till the cry has gone for ten miles round , and our work 's interrupted ? '
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 53]: ` It 's all very fine talking , brother , ' answered Dennis , stepping towards him ; ` but unless -- ' and here he whispered in his ear -- ` unless we do it over the door , it ca n't be done at all in this here room . '
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 6]: ` What ca n't ? '
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 3]: Hugh demanded .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 6]: ` What ca n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 3]: retorted Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 10]: ` Why , the old man ca n't . '
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 12]: ` Why , you were n't going to hang him ! '
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 6]: ` No , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 7]: returned the hangman with a stare .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 5]: ` What else ? '
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 55]: Hugh made no answer , but snatching the rope from his companion 's hand , proceeded to bind old John himself ; but his very first move was so bungling and unskilful , that Mr Dennis entreated , almost with tears in his eyes , that he might be permitted to perform the duty .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 10]: Hugh consenting , be achieved it in a twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 29]: ` There , ' he said , looking mournfully at John Willet , who displayed no more emotion in his bonds than he had shown out of them .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 10]: ` That 's what I call pretty and workmanlike .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 7]: He 's quite a picter now .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 38]: But , brother , just a word with you -- now that he 's ready trussed , as one may say , would n't it be better for all parties if we was to work him off ?
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 13]: It would read uncommon well in the newspapers , it would indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 12]: The public would think a great deal more on us ! '
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 53]: Hugh , inferring what his companion meant , rather from his gestures than his technical mode of expressing himself -LRB- to which , as he was ignorant of his calling , he wanted the clue -RRB- , rejected this proposition for the second time , and gave the word ` Forward ! '
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 10]: which was echoed by a hundred voices from without .
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 6]: ` To the Warren ! '
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 13]: shouted Dennis as he ran out , followed by the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 9]: A witness 's house , my lads ! '
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 18]: A loud yell followed , and the whole throng hurried off , mad for pillage and destruction .
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 97]: Hugh lingered behind for a few moments to stimulate himself with more drink , and to set all the taps running , a few of which had accidentally been spared ; then , glancing round the despoiled and plundered room , through whose shattered window the rioters had thrust the Maypole itself , -- for even that had been sawn down , -- lighted a torch , clapped the mute and motionless John Willet on the back , and waving his light above his head , and uttering a fierce shout , hastened after his companions .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 43]: Chapter 55 John Willet , left alone in his dismantled bar , continued to sit staring about him ; awake as to his eyes , certainly , but with all his powers of reason and reflection in a sound and dreamless sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 35]: He looked round upon the room which had been for years , and was within an hour ago , the pride of his heart ; and not a muscle of his face was moved .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 72]: The night , without , looked black and cold through the dreary gaps in the casement ; the precious liquids , now nearly leaked away , dripped with a hollow sound upon the floor ; the Maypole peered ruefully in through the broken window , like the bowsprit of a wrecked ship ; the ground might have been the bottom of the sea , it was so strewn with precious fragments .
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 78]: Currents of air rushed in , as the old doors jarred and creaked upon their hinges ; the candles flickered and guttered down , and made long winding-sheets ; the cheery deep-red curtains flapped and fluttered idly in the wind ; even the stout Dutch kegs , overthrown and lying empty in dark corners , seemed the mere husks of good fellows whose jollity had departed , and who could kindle with a friendly glow no more .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 11]: John saw this desolation , and yet saw it not .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 31]: He was perfectly contented to sit there , staring at it , and felt no more indignation or discomfort in his bonds than if they had been robes of honour .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 19]: So far as he was personally concerned , old Time lay snoring , and the world stood still .
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 61]: Save for the dripping from the barrels , the rustling of such light fragments of destruction as the wind affected , and the dull creaking of the open doors , all was profoundly quiet : indeed , these sounds , like the ticking of the death-watch in the night , only made the silence they invaded deeper and more apparent .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 12]: But quiet or noisy , it was all one to John .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 28]: If a train of heavy artillery could have come up and commenced ball practice outside the window , it would have been all the same to him .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 8]: He was a long way beyond surprise .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 8]: A ghost could n't have overtaken him .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 22]: By and by he heard a footstep -- a hurried , and yet cautious footstep -- coming on towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 14]: It stopped , advanced again , then seemed to go quite round it .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 16]: Having done that , it came beneath the window , and a head looked in .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 16]: It was strongly relieved against the darkness outside by the glare of the guttering candles .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 32]: A pale , worn , withered face ; the eyes -- but that was owing to its gaunt condition -- unnaturally large and bright ; the hair , a grizzled black .
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 25]: It gave a searching glance all round the room , and a deep voice said : ` Are you alone in this house ? '
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 18]: John made no sign , though the question was repeated twice , and he heard it distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 14]: After a moment 's pause , the man got in at the window .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 11]: John was not at all surprised at this , either .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 40]: There had been so much getting in and out of window in the course of the last hour or so , that he had quite forgotten the door , and seemed to have lived among such exercises from infancy .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 28]: The man wore a large , dark , faded cloak , and a slouched hat ; he walked up close to John , and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 7]: John returned the compliment with interest .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 10]: ` How long have you been sitting thus ? '
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 9]: John considered , but nothing came of it .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 9]: ` Which way have the party gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 42]: Some wandering speculations relative to the fashion of the stranger 's boots , got into Mr Willet 's mind by some accident or other , but they got out again in a hurry , and left him in his former state .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 32]: ` You would do well to speak , ' said the man ; ` you may keep a whole skin , though you have nothing else left that can be hurt .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 8]: Which way have the party gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 4]: ` That ! '
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 38]: said John , finding his voice all at once , and nodding with perfect good faith -- he could n't point ; he was so tightly bound -- in exactly the opposite direction to the right one .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 5]: ` You lie ! '
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 12]: said the man angrily , and with a threatening gesture . '
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 5]: I came that way .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 6]: You would betray me . '
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 42]: It was so evident that John 's imperturbability was not assumed , but was the result of the late proceedings under his roof , that the man stayed his hand in the very act of striking him , and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 18]: John looked after him without so much as a twitch in a single nerve of his face .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 49]: He seized a glass , and holding it under one of the little casks until a few drops were collected , drank them greedily off ; then throwing it down upon the floor impatiently , he took the vessel in his hands and drained it into his throat .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 36]: Some scraps of bread and meat were scattered about , and on these he fell next ; eating them with voracity , and pausing every now and then to listen for some fancied noise outside .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 42]: When he had refreshed himself in this manner with violent haste , and raised another barrel to his lips , he pulled his hat upon his brow as though he were about to leave the house , and turned to John .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 7]: ` Where are your servants ? '
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 32]: Mr Willet indistinctly remembered to have heard the rioters calling to them to throw the key of the room in which they were , out of window , for their keeping .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 9]: He therefore replied , ` Locked up . '
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 24]: ` Well for them if they remain quiet , and well for you if you do the like , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 11]: ` Now show me the way the party went . '
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 8]: This time Mr Willet indicated it correctly .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 51]: The man was hurrying to the door , when suddenly there came towards them on the wind , the loud and rapid tolling of an alarm-bell , and then a bright and vivid glare streamed up , which illumined , not only the whole chamber , but all the country .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 53]: It was not the sudden change from darkness to this dreadful light , it was not the sound of distant shrieks and shouts of triumph , it was not this dread invasion of the serenity and peace of night , that drove the man back as though a thunderbolt had struck him .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 5]: It was the Bell .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 43]: If the ghastliest shape the human mind has ever pictured in its wildest dreams had risen up before him , he could not have staggered backward from its touch , as he did from the first sound of that loud iron voice .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 58]: With eyes that started from his head , his limbs convulsed , his face most horrible to see , he raised one arm high up into the air , and holding something visionary back and down , with his other hand , drove at it as though he held a knife and stabbed it to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 52]: He clutched his hair , and stopped his ears , and travelled madly round and round ; then gave a frightful cry , and with it rushed away : still , still , the Bell tolled on and seemed to follow him -- louder and louder , hotter and hotter yet .
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 75]: The glare grew brighter , the roar of voices deeper ; the crash of heavy bodies falling , shook the air ; bright streams of sparks rose up into the sky ; but louder than them all -- rising faster far , to Heaven -- a million times more fierce and furious -- pouring forth dreadful secrets after its long silence -- speaking the language of the dead -- the Bell -- the Bell !
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 12]: What hunt of spectres could surpass that dread pursuit and flight !
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 18]: Had there been a legion of them on his track , he could have better borne it .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 17]: They would have had a beginning and an end , but here all space was full .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 28]: The one pursuing voice was everywhere : it sounded in the earth , the air ; shook the long grass , and howled among the trembling trees .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 78]: The echoes caught it up , the owls hooted as it flew upon the breeze , the nightingale was silent and hid herself among the thickest boughs : it seemed to goad and urge the angry fire , and lash it into madness ; everything was steeped in one prevailing red ; the glow was everywhere ; nature was drenched in blood : still the remorseless crying of that awful voice -- the Bell , the Bell !
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 9]: It ceased ; but not in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 7]: The knell was at his heart .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 23]: No work of man had ever voice like that which sounded there , and warned him that it cried unceasingly to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 13]: Who could hear that hell , and not know what it said !
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 30]: There was murder in its every note -- cruel , relentless , savage murder -- the murder of a confiding man , by one who held his every trust .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 8]: Its ringing summoned phantoms from their graves .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 77]: What face was that , in which a friendly smile changed to a look of half incredulous horror , which stiffened for a moment into one of pain , then changed again into an imploring glance at Heaven , and so fell idly down with upturned eyes , like the dead stags ' he had often peeped at when a little child : shrinking and shuddering -- there was a dreadful thing to think of now !
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 10]: -- and clinging to an apron as he looked !
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 74]: He sank upon the ground , and grovelling down as if he would dig himself a place to hide in , covered his face and ears : but no , no , no , -- a hundred walls and roofs of brass would not shut out that bell , for in it spoke the wrathful voice of God , and from that voice , the whole wide universe could not afford a refuge !
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 27]: While he rushed up and down , not knowing where to turn , and while he lay crouching there , the work went briskly on indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 24]: When they left the Maypole , the rioters formed into a solid body , and advanced at a quick pace towards the Warren .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 38]: Rumour of their approach having gone before , they found the garden-doors fast closed , the windows made secure , and the house profoundly dark : not a light being visible in any portion of the building .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 36]: After some fruitless ringing at the bells , and beating at the iron gates , they drew off a few paces to reconnoitre , and confer upon the course it would be best to take .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 25]: Very little conference was needed , when all were bent upon one desperate purpose , infuriated with liquor , and flushed with successful riot .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 52]: The word being given to surround the house , some climbed the gates , or dropped into the shallow trench and scaled the garden wall , while others pulled down the solid iron fence , and while they made a breach to enter by , made deadly weapons of the bars .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 59]: The house being completely encircled , a small number of men were despatched to break open a tool-shed in the garden ; and during their absence on this errand , the remainder contented themselves with knocking violently at the doors , and calling to those within , to come down and open them on peril of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 72]: No answer being returned to this repeated summons , and the detachment who had been sent away , coming back with an accession of pickaxes , spades , and hoes , they , -- together with those who had such arms already , or carried -LRB- as many did -RRB- axes , poles , and crowbars , -- struggled into the foremost rank , ready to beset the doors and windows .
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 64]: They had not at this time more than a dozen lighted torches among them ; but when these preparations were completed , flaming links were distributed and passed from hand to hand with such rapidity , that , in a minute 's time , at least two-thirds of the whole roaring mass bore , each man in his hand , a blazing brand .
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 21]: Whirling these about their heads they raised a loud shout , and fell to work upon the doors and windows .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 60]: Amidst the clattering of heavy blows , the rattling of broken glass , the cries and execrations of the mob , and all the din and turmoil of the scene , Hugh and his friends kept together at the turret-door where Mr Haredale had last admitted him and old John Willet ; and spent their united force on that .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 48]: It was a strong old oaken door , guarded by good bolts and a heavy bar , but it soon went crashing in upon the narrow stairs behind , and made , as it were , a platform to facilitate their tearing up into the rooms above .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 24]: Almost at the same moment , a dozen other points were forced , and at every one the crowd poured in like water .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 25]: A few armed servant-men were posted in the hall , and when the rioters forced an entrance there , they fired some half-a-dozen shots .
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 107]: But these taking no effect , and the concourse coming on like an army of devils , they only thought of consulting their own safety , and retreated , echoing their assailants ' cries , and hoping in the confusion to be taken for rioters themselves ; in which stratagem they succeeded , with the exception of one old man who was never heard of again , and was said to have had his brains beaten out with an iron bar -LRB- one of his fellows reported that he had seen the old man fall -RRB- , and to have been afterwards burnt in the flames .
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 27]: The besiegers being now in complete possession of the house , spread themselves over it from garret to cellar , and plied their demon labours fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 93]: While some small parties kindled bonfires underneath the windows , others broke up the furniture and cast the fragments down to feed the flames below ; where the apertures in the wall -LRB- windows no longer -RRB- were large enough , they threw out tables , chests of drawers , beds , mirrors , pictures , and flung them whole into the fire ; while every fresh addition to the blazing masses was received with shouts , and howls , and yells , which added new and dismal terrors to the conflagration .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 48]: Those who had axes and had spent their fury on the movables , chopped and tore down the doors and window frames , broke up the flooring , hewed away the rafters , and buried men who lingered in the upper rooms , in heaps of ruins .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 60]: Some searched the drawers , the chests , the boxes , writing-desks , and closets , for jewels , plate , and money ; while others , less mindful of gain and more mad for destruction , cast their whole contents into the courtyard without examination , and called to those below , to heap them on the blaze .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 86]: Men who had been into the cellars , and had staved the casks , rushed to and fro stark mad , setting fire to all they saw -- often to the dresses of their own friends -- and kindling the building in so many parts that some had no time for escape , and were seen , with drooping hands and blackened faces , hanging senseless on the window-sills to which they had crawled , until they were sucked and drawn into the burning gulf .
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 41]: The more the fire crackled and raged , the wilder and more cruel the men grew ; as though moving in that element they became fiends , and changed their earthly nature for the qualities that give delight in hell .
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 283]: The burning pile , revealing rooms and passages red hot , through gaps made in the crumbling walls ; the tributary fires that licked the outer bricks and stones , with their long forked tongues , and ran up to meet the glowing mass within ; the shining of the flames upon the villains who looked on and fed them ; the roaring of the angry blaze , so bright and high that it seemed in its rapacity to have swallowed up the very smoke ; the living flakes the wind bore rapidly away and hurried on with , like a storm of fiery snow ; the noiseless breaking of great beams of wood , which fell like feathers on the heap of ashes , and crumbled in the very act to sparks and powder ; the lurid tinge that overspread the sky , and the darkness , very deep by contrast , which prevailed around ; the exposure to the coarse , common gaze , of every little nook which usages of home had made a sacred place , and the destruction by rude hands of every little household favourite which old associations made a dear and precious thing : all this taking place -- not among pitying looks and friendly murmurs of compassion , but brutal shouts and exultations , which seemed to make the very rats who stood by the old house too long , creatures with some claim upon the pity and regard of those its roof had sheltered : -- combined to form a scene never to be forgotten by those who saw it and were not actors in the work , so long as life endured .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 5]: And who were they ?
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 27]: The alarm-bell rang -- and it was pulled by no faint or hesitating hands -- for a long time ; but not a soul was seen .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 37]: Some of the insurgents said that when it ceased , they heard the shrieks of women , and saw some garments fluttering in the air , as a party of men bore away no unresisting burdens .
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 21]: No one could say that this was true or false , in such an uproar ; but where was Hugh ?
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 14]: Who among them had seen him , since the forcing of the doors ?
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 7]: The cry spread through the body .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 4]: Where was Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 4]: ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 19]: he hoarsely cried , appearing from the darkness ; out of breath , and blackened with the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 32]: ` We have done all we can ; the fire is burning itself out ; and even the corners where it has n't spread , are nothing but heaps of ruins .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 23]: Disperse , my lads , while the coast 's clear ; get back by different ways ; and meet as usual ! '
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 37]: With that , he disappeared again , -- contrary to his wont , for he was always first to advance , and last to go away , -- leaving them to follow homewards as they would .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 13]: It was not an easy task to draw off such a throng .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 26]: If Bedlam gates had been flung wide open , there would not have issued forth such maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 36]: There were men there , who danced and trampled on the beds of flowers as though they trod down human enemies , and wrenched them from the stalks , like savages who twisted human necks .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 31]: There were men who cast their lighted torches in the air , and suffered them to fall upon their heads and faces , blistering the skin with deep unseemly burns .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 39]: There were men who rushed up to the fire , and paddled in it with their hands as if in water ; and others who were restrained by force from plunging in , to gratify their deadly longing .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 51]: On the skull of one drunken lad -- not twenty , by his looks -- who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth , the lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire , white hot ; melting his head like wax .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 61]: When the scattered parties were collected , men -- living yet , but singed as with hot irons -- were plucked out of the cellars , and carried off upon the shoulders of others , who strove to wake them as they went along , with ribald jokes , and left them , dead , in the passages of hospitals .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 33]: But of all the howling throng not one learnt mercy from , or sickened at , these sights ; nor was the fierce , besotted , senseless rage of one man glutted .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 22]: Slowly , and in small clusters , with hoarse hurrahs and repetitions of their usual cry , the assembly dropped away .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 49]: The last few red-eyed stragglers reeled after those who had gone before ; the distant noise of men calling to each other , and whistling for others whom they missed , grew fainter and fainter ; at length even these sounds died away , and silence reigned alone .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 3]: Silence indeed !
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 30]: The glare of the flames had sunk into a fitful , flashing light ; and the gentle stars , invisible till now , looked down upon the blackening heap .
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 27]: A dull smoke hung upon the ruin , as though to hide it from those eyes of Heaven ; and the wind forbore to move it .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 59]: Bare walls , roof open to the sky -- chambers , where the beloved dead had , many and many a fair day , risen to new life and energy ; where so many dear ones had been sad and merry ; which were connected with so many thoughts and hopes , regrets and changes -- all gone .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 25]: Nothing left but a dull and dreary blank -- a smouldering heap of dust and ashes -- the silence and solitude of utter desolation .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 51]: Chapter 56 The Maypole cronies , little drearning of the change so soon to come upon their favourite haunt , struck through the Forest path upon their way to London ; and avoiding the main road , which was hot and dusty , kept to the by-paths and the fields .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 36]: As they drew nearer to their destination , they began to make inquiries of the people whom they passed , concerning the riots , and the truth or falsehood of the stories they had heard .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 14]: The answers went far beyond any intelligence that had spread to quiet Chigwell .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 102]: One man told them that that afternoon the Guards , conveying to Newgate some rioters who had been re-examined , had been set upon by the mob and compelled to retreat ; another , that the houses of two witnesses near Clare Market were about to be pulled down when he came away ; another , that Sir George Saville 's house in Leicester Fields was to be burned that night , and that it would go hard with Sir George if he fell into the people 's hands , as it was he who had brought in the Catholic bill .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 60]: All accounts agreed that the mob were out , in stronger numbers and more numerous parties than had yet appeared ; that the streets were unsafe ; that no man 's house or life was worth an hour 's purchase ; that the public consternation was increasing every moment ; and that many families had already fled the city .
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 96]: One fellow who wore the popular colour , damned them for not having cockades in their hats , and bade them set a good watch to-morrow night upon their prison doors , for the locks would have a straining ; another asked if they were fire-proof , that they walked abroad without the distinguishing mark of all good and true men ; -- and a third who rode on horseback , and was quite alone , ordered them to throw each man a shilling , in his hat , towards the support of the rioters .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 43]: Although they were afraid to refuse compliance with this demand , and were much alarmed by these reports , they agreed , having come so far , to go forward , and see the real state of things with their own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 30]: So they pushed on quicker , as men do who are excited by portentous news ; and ruminating on what they had heard , spoke little to each other .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 40]: It was now night , and as they came nearer to the city they had dismal confirmation of this intelligence in three great fires , all close together , which burnt fiercely and were gloomily reflected in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 44]: Arriving in the immediate suburbs , they found that almost every house had chalked upon its door in large characters ` No Popery , ' that the shops were shut , and that alarm and anxiety were depicted in every face they passed .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 36]: Noting these things with a degree of apprehension which neither of the three cared to impart , in its full extent , to his companions , they came to a turnpike-gate , which was shut .
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 43]: They were passing through the turnstile on the path , when a horseman rode up from London at a hard gallop , and called to the toll-keeper in a voice of great agitation , to open quickly in the name of God .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 55]: The adjuration was so earnest and vehement , that the man , with a lantern in his hand , came running out -- toll-keeper though he was -- and was about to throw the gate open , when happening to look behind him , he exclaimed , ` Good Heaven , what 's that !
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 4]: Another fire ! '
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 55]: At this , the three turned their heads , and saw in the distance -- straight in the direction whence they had come -- a broad sheet of flame , casting a threatening light upon the clouds , which glimmered as though the conflagration were behind them , and showed like a wrathful sunset .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 23]: ` My mind misgives me , ' said the horseman , ` or I know from what far building those flames come .
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 9]: Do n't stand aghast , my good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 5]: Open the gate ! '
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 40]: ` Sir , ' cried the man , laying his hand upon his horse 's bridle as he let him through : ' I know you now , sir ; be advised by me ; do not go on .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 14]: I saw them pass , and know what kind of men they are .
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 6]: You will be murdered . '
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 6]: ` So be it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 17]: said the horseman , looking intently towards the fire , and not at him who spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 31]: ` But sir -- sir , ' cried the man , grasping at his rein more tightly yet , ` if you do go on , wear the blue riband .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 39]: Here , sir , ' he added , taking one from his own hat , ` it 's necessity , not choice , that makes me wear it ; it 's love of life and home , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 16]: Wear it for this one night , sir ; only for this one night . '
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 4]: ` Do ! '
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 10]: cried the three friends , pressing round his horse .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 15]: ` Mr Haredale -- worthy sir -- good gentleman -- pray be persuaded . '
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 6]: ` Who 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 9]: cried Mr Haredale , stooping down to look .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 9]: ` Did I hear Daisy 's voice ? '
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 12]: ` You did , sir , ' cried the little man .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 7]: ` Do be persuaded , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 6]: This gentleman says very true .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 8]: Your life may hang upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 18]: ` Are you , ' said Mr Haredale abruptly , ` afraid to come with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 5]: ` I , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 4]: -- N-n-no . '
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 8]: ` Put that riband in your hat .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 16]: If we meet the rioters , swear that I took you prisoner for wearing it .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 44]: I will tell them so with my own lips ; for as I hope for mercy when I die , I will take no quarter from them , nor shall they have quarter from me , if we come hand to hand to-night .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 8]: Up here -- behind me -- quick !
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 12]: Clasp me tight round the body , and fear nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 29]: In an instant they were riding away , at full gallop , in a dense cloud of dust , and speeding on , like hunters in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 53]: It was well the good horse knew the road he traversed , for never once -- no , never once in all the journey -- did Mr Haredale cast his eyes upon the ground , or turn them , for an instant , from the light towards which they sped so madly .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 24]: Once he said in a low voice , ` It is my house , ' but that was the only time he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 48]: When they came to dark and doubtful places , he never forgot to put his hand upon the little man to hold him more securely in his seat , but he kept his head erect and his eyes fixed on the fire , then , and always .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 57]: The road was dangerous enough , for they went the nearest way -- headlong -- far from the highway -- by lonely lanes and paths , where waggon-wheels had worn deep ruts ; where hedge and ditch hemmed in the narrow strip of ground ; and tall trees , arching overhead , made it profoundly dark .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 38]: But on , on , on , with neither stop nor stumble , till they reached the Maypole door , and could plainly see that the fire began to fade , as if for want of fuel .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 27]: ` Down -- for one moment -- for but one moment , ' said Mr Haredale , helping Daisy to the ground , and following himself .
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 15]: ` Willet -- Willet -- where are my niece and servants -- Willet ! '
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 11]: Crying to him distractedly , he rushed into the bar .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 30]: -- The landlord bound and fastened to his chair ; the place dismantled , stripped , and pulled about his ears ; -- nobody could have taken shelter here .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 53]: He was a strong man , accustomed to restrain himself , and suppress his strong emotions ; but this preparation for what was to follow -- though he had seen that fire burning , and knew that his house must be razed to the ground -- was more than he could bear .
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 17]: He covered his face with his hands for a moment , and turned away his head .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 32]: ` Johnny , Johnny , ' said Solomon -- and the simple-hearted fellow cried outright , and wrung his hands -- ` Oh dear old Johnny , here 's a change !
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 17]: That the Maypole bar should come to this , and we should live to see it !
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 22]: The old Warren too , Johnny -- Mr Haredale -- oh , Johnny , what a piteous sight this is ! '
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 32]: Pointing to Mr Haredale as he said these words , little Solomon Daisy put his elbows on the back of Mr Willet 's chair , and fairly blubbered on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 35]: While Solomon was speaking , old John sat , mute as a stock-fish , staring at him with an unearthly glare , and displaying , by every possible symptom , entire and complete unconsciousness .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 39]: But when Solomon was silent again , John followed , with his great round eyes , the direction of his looks , and did appear to have some dawning distant notion that somebody had come to see him .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 12]: ` You know us , do n't you , Johnny ? '
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 11]: said the little clerk , rapping himself on the breast .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 21]: ` Daisy , you know -- Chigwell Church -- bell-ringer -- little desk on Sundays -- eh , Johnny ? '
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 55]: Mr Willet reflected for a few moments , and then muttered , as it were mechanically : ` Let us sing to the praise and glory of -- ' ` Yes , to be sure , ' cried the little man , hastily ; ` that 's it -- that 's me , Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 10]: You 're all right now , a n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 9]: Say you 're all right , Johnny . '
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 5]: ` All right ? '
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 17]: pondered Mr Willet , as if that were a matter entirely between himself and his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 4]: ` All right ?
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 3]: Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 25]: ` They have n't been misusing you with sticks , or pokers , or any other blunt instruments -- have they , Johnny ? '
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 14]: asked Solomon , with a very anxious glance at Mr Willet 's head .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 11]: ` They did n't beat you , did they ? '
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 52]: John knitted his brow ; looked downwards , as if he were mentally engaged in some arithmetical calculation ; then upwards , as if the total would not come at his call ; then at Solomon Daisy , from his eyebrow to his shoe-buckle ; then very slowly round the bar .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 53]: And then a great , round , leaden-looking , and not at all transparent tear , came rolling out of each eye , and he said , as he shook his head : ` If they 'd only had the goodness to murder me , I 'd have thanked 'em kindly . '
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 20]: ` No , no , no , do n't say that , Johnny , ' whimpered his little friend .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 16]: ` It 's very , very bad , but not quite so bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 5]: No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 9]: ` Look ` ee here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 27]: cried John , turning his rueful eyes on Mr Haredale , who had dropped on one knee , and was hastily beginning to untie his bonds .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 8]: ` Look ` ee here , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 55]: The very Maypole -- the old dumb Maypole -- stares in at the winder , as if it said , `` John Willet , John Willet , let 's go and pitch ourselves in the nighest pool of water as is deep enough to hold us ; for our day is over ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 41]: ` Do n't , Johnny , do n't , ' cried his friend : no less affected with this mournful effort of Mr Willet 's imagination , than by the sepulchral tone in which he had spoken of the Maypole .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 8]: ` Please do n't , Johnny ! '
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 35]: ` Your loss is great , and your misfortune a heavy one , ' said Mr Haredale , looking restlessly towards the door : ` and this is not a time to comfort you .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 13]: If it were , I am in no condition to do so .
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 21]: Before I leave you , tell me one thing , and try to tell me plainly , I implore you .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 10]: Have you seen , or heard of Emma ? '
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 4]: said Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 9]: ` Nor any one but these bloodhounds ? '
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 53]: ` They rode away , I trust in Heaven , before these dreadful scenes began , ' said Mr Haredale , who , between his agitation , his eagerness to mount his horse again , and the dexterity with which the cords were tied , had scarcely yet undone one knot . '
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 6]: A knife , Daisy ! '
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 43]: ` You did n't , ' said John , looking about , as though he had lost his pocket-handkerchief , or some such slight article -- ` either of you gentlemen -- see a -- a coffin anywheres , did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 4]: ` Willet ! '
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 4]: cried Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 21]: Solomon dropped the knife , and instantly becoming limp from head to foot , exclaimed ` Good gracious ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 28]: -- Because , ' said John , not at all regarding them , ' a dead man called a little time ago , on his way yonder .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 26]: I could have told you what name was on the plate , if he had brought his coffin with him , and left it behind .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 11]: If he did n't , it do n't signify . '
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 67]: His landlord , who had listened to these words with breathless attention , started that moment to his feet ; and , without a word , drew Solomon Daisy to the door , mounted his horse , took him up behind again , and flew rather than galloped towards the pile of ruins , which that day 's sun had shone upon , a stately house .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 48]: Mr Willet stared after them , listened , looked down upon himself to make quite sure that he was still unbound , and , without any manifestation of impatience , disappointment , or surprise , gently relapsed into the condition from which he had so imperfectly recovered .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 36]: Mr Haredale tied his horse to the trunk of a tree , and grasping his companion 's arm , stole softly along the footpath , and into what had been the garden of his house .
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 29]: He stopped for an instant to look upon its smoking walls , and at the stars that shone through roof and floor upon the heap of crumbling ashes .
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 41]: Solomon glanced timidly in his face , but his lips were tightly pressed together , a resolute and stern expression sat upon his brow , and not a tear , a look , or gesture indicating grief , escaped him .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 40]: He drew his sword ; felt for a moment in his breast , as though he carried other arms about him ; then grasping Solomon by the wrist again , went with a cautious step all round the house .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 34]: He looked into every doorway and gap in the wall ; retraced his steps at every rustling of the air among the leaves ; and searched in every shadowed nook with outstretched hands .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 38]: Thus they made the circuit of the building : but they returned to the spot from which they had set out , without encountering any human being , or finding the least trace of any concealed straggler .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 12]: After a short pause , Mr Haredale shouted twice or thrice .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 18]: Then cried aloud , ` Is there any one in hiding here , who knows my voice !
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 7]: There is nothing to fear now .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 15]: If any of my people are near , I entreat them to answer ! '
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 23]: He called them all by name ; his voice was echoed in many mournful tones ; then all was silent as before .
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 15]: They were standing near the foot of the turret , where the alarm-bell hung .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 22]: The fire had raged there , and the floors had been sawn , and hewn , and beaten down , besides .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 27]: It was open to the night ; but a part of the staircase still remained , winding upward from a great mound of dust and cinders .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 58]: Fragments of the jagged and broken steps offered an insecure and giddy footing here and there , and then were lost again , behind protruding angles of the wall , or in the deep shadows cast upon it by other portions of the ruin ; for by this time the moon had risen , and shone brightly .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 37]: As they stood here , listening to the echoes as they died away , and hoping in vain to hear a voice they knew , some of the ashes in this turret slipped and rolled down .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 37]: Startled by the least noise in that melancholy place , Solomon looked up in his companion 's face , and saw that he had turned towards the spot , and that he watched and listened keenly .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 15]: He covered the little man 's mouth with his hand , and looked again .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 21]: Instantly , with kindling eyes , he bade him on his life keep still , and neither speak nor move .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 26]: Then holding his breath , and stooping down , he stole into the turret , with his drawn sword in his hand , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 51]: Terrified to be left there by himself , under such desolate circumstances , and after all he had seen and heard that night , Solomon would have followed , but there had been something in Mr Haredale 's manner and his look , the recollection of which held him spellbound .
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 21]: He stood rooted to the spot ; and scarcely venturing to breathe , looked up with mingled fear and wonder .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 30]: Again the ashes slipped and rolled -- very , very softly -- again -- and then again , as though they crumbled underneath the tread of a stealthy foot .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 36]: And now a figure was dimly visible ; climbing very softly ; and often stopping to look down ; now it pursued its difficult way ; and now it was hidden from the view again .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 33]: It emerged once more , into the shadowy and uncertain light -- higher now , but not much , for the way was steep and toilsome , and its progress very slow .
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 18]: What phantom of the brain did he pursue ; and why did he look down so constantly ?
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 6]: He knew he was alone .
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 14]: Surely his mind was not affected by that night 's loss and agony .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 16]: He was not about to throw himself headlong from the summit of the tottering wall .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 9]: Solomon turned sick , and clasped his hands .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 17]: His limbs trembled beneath him , and a cold sweat broke out upon his pallid face .
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 24]: If he complied with Mr Haredale 's last injunction now , it was because he had not the power to speak or move .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 28]: He strained his gaze , and fixed it on a patch of moonlight , into which , if he continued to ascend , he must soon emerge .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 13]: When he appeared there , he would try to call to him .
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 25]: Again the ashes slipped and crumbled ; some stones rolled down , and fell with a dull , heavy sound upon the ground below .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 10]: He kept his eyes upon the piece of moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 16]: The figure was coming on , for its shadow was already thrown upon the wall .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 32]: Now it appeared -- and now looked round at him -- and now -- The horror-stricken clerk uttered a scream that pierced the air , and cried , ` The ghost !
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 4]: The ghost ! '
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 40]: Long before the echo of his cry had died away , another form rushed out into the light , flung itself upon the foremost one , knelt down upon its breast , and clutched its throat with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 4]: ` Villain ! '
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 14]: cried Mr Haredale , in a terrible voice -- for it was he .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 30]: ` Dead and buried , as all men supposed through your infernal arts , but reserved by Heaven for this -- at last -- at last I have you .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 53]: You , whose hands are red with my brother 's blood , and that of his faithful servant , shed to conceal your own atrocious guilt -- You , Rudge , double murderer and monster , I arrest you in the name of God , who has delivered you into my hands .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 32]: Though you had the strength of twenty men , ' he added , as the murderer writhed and struggled , you could not escape me or loosen my grasp to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 36]: Chapter 57 Barnaby , armed as we have seen , continued to pace up and down before the stable-door ; glad to be alone again , and heartily rejoicing in the unaccustomed silence and tranquillity .
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 28]: After the whirl of noise and riot in which the last two days had been passed , the pleasures of solitude and peace were enhanced a thousandfold .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 32]: He felt quite happy ; and as he leaned upon his staff and mused , a bright smile overspread his face , and none but cheerful visions floated into his brain .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 28]: Had he no thoughts of her , whose sole delight he was , and whom he had unconsciously plunged in such bitter sorrow and such deep affliction ?
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 4]: Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 14]: She was at the heart of all his cheerful hopes and proud reflections .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 21]: It was she whom all this honour and distinction were to gladden ; the joy and profit were for her .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 15]: What delight it gave her to hear of the bravery of her poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 12]: He would have known that , without Hugh 's telling him .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 51]: And what a precious thing it was to know she lived so happily , and heard with so much pride -LRB- he pictured to himself her look when they told her -RRB- that he was in such high esteem : bold among the boldest , and trusted before them all !
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 123]: And when these frays were over , and the good lord had conquered his enemies , and they were all at peace again , and he and she were rich , what happiness they would have in talking of these troubled times when he was a great soldier : and when they sat alone together in the tranquil twilight , and she had no longer reason to be anxious for the morrow , what pleasure would he have in the reflection that this was his doing -- his -- poor foolish Barnaby 's ; and in patting her on the cheek , and saying with a merry laugh , ` Am I silly now , mother -- am I silly now ? '
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 40]: With a lighter heart and step , and eyes the brighter for the happy tear that dimmed them for a moment , Barnaby resumed his walk ; and singing gaily to himself , kept guard upon his quiet post .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 70]: His comrade Grip , the partner of his watch , though fond of basking in the sunshine , preferred to-day to walk about the stable ; having a great deal to do in the way of scattering the straw , hiding under it such small articles as had been casually left about , and haunting Hugh 's bed , to which he seemed to have taken a particular attachment .
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 122]: Sometimes Barnaby looked in and called him , and then he came hopping out ; but he merely did this as a concession to his master 's weakness , and soon returned again to his own grave pursuits : peering into the straw with his bill , and rapidly covering up the place , as if , Midas-like , he were whispering secrets to the earth and burying them ; constantly busying himself upon the sly ; and affecting , whenever Barnaby came past , to look up in the clouds and have nothing whatever on his mind : in short , conducting himself , in many respects , in a more than usually thoughtful , deep , and mysterious manner .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 56]: As the day crept on , Barnaby , who had no directions forbidding him to eat and drink upon his post , but had been , on the contrary , supplied with a bottle of beer and a basket of provisions , determined to break his fast , which he had not done since morning .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 33]: To this end , he sat down on the ground before the door , and putting his staff across his knees in case of alarm or surprise , summoned Grip to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 45]: This call , the bird obeyed with great alacrity ; crying , as he sidled up to his master , ` I 'm a devil , I 'm a Polly , I 'm a kettle , I 'm a Protestant , No Popery ! '
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 23]: Having learnt this latter sentiment from the gentry among whom he had lived of late , he delivered it with uncommon emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 7]: ` Well said , Grip ! '
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 13]: cried his master , as he fed him with the daintiest bits .
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 8]: ` Well said , old boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 20]: ` Never say die , bow wow wow , keep up your spirits , Grip Grip Grip , Holloa !
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 16]: We 'll all have tea , I 'm a Protestant kettle , No Popery ! '
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 4]: cried the raven .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 8]: ` Gordon for ever , Grip ! '
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 3]: cried Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 29]: The raven , placing his head upon the ground , looked at his master sideways , as though he would have said , ` Say that again ! '
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 14]: Perfectly understanding his desire , Barnaby repeated the phrase a great many times .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 63]: The bird listened with profound attention ; sometimes repeating the popular cry in a low voice , as if to compare the two , and try if it would at all help him to this new accomplishment ; sometimes flapping his wings , or barking ; and sometimes in a kind of desperation drawing a multitude of corks , with extraordinary viciousness .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 38]: Barnaby was so intent upon his favourite , that he was not at first aware of the approach of two persons on horseback , who were riding at a foot-pace , and coming straight towards his post .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 51]: When he perceived them , however , which he did when they were within some fifty yards of him , he jumped hastily up , and ordering Grip within doors , stood with both hands on his staff , waiting until he should know whether they were friends or foes .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 45]: He had hardly done so , when he observed that those who advanced were a gentleman and his servant ; almost at the same moment he recognised Lord George Gordon , before whom he stood uncovered , with his eyes turned towards the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 5]: ` Good day ! '
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 16]: said Lord George , not reining in his horse until he was close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 10]: ` All quiet , sir , all safe ! '
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 3]: cried Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 15]: ` The rest are away -- they went by that path -- that one .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 5]: A grand party ! '
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 4]: ` Ay ? '
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 9]: said Lord George , looking thoughtfully at him .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 5]: ` And you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 20]: They left me here to watch -- to mount guard -- to keep everything secure till they come back .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 11]: I 'll do it , sir , for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 15]: You 're a good gentleman ; a kind gentleman -- ay , you are .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 19]: There are many against you , but we 'll be a match for them , never fear ! '
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 32]: said Lord George -- pointing to the raven who was peeping out of the stable-door -- but still looking thoughtfully , and in some perplexity , it seemed , at Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 9]: ` Why , do n't you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 8]: retorted Barnaby , with a wondering laugh .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 7]: ` Not know what HE is !
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 7]: A bird , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 10]: My bird -- my friend -- Grip . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 19]: A devil , a kettle , a Grip , a Polly , a Protestant , no Popery ! '
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 4]: cried the raven .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 58]: ` Though , indeed , ' added Barnaby , laying his hand upon the neck of Lord George 's horse , and speaking softly : ` you had good reason to ask me what he is , for sometimes it puzzles me -- and I am used to him -- to think he 's only a bird .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 23]: He 's my brother , Grip is -- always with me -- always talking -- always merry -- eh , Grip ? '
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 54]: The raven answered by an affectionate croak , and hopping on his master 's arm , which he held downward for that purpose , submitted with an air of perfect indifference to be fondled , and turned his restless , curious eye , now upon Lord George , and now upon his man .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 34]: Lord George , biting his nails in a discomfited manner , regarded Barnaby for some time in silence ; then beckoning to his servant , said : ` Come hither , John . '
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 9]: John Grueby touched his hat , and came .
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 11]: ` Have you ever seen this young man before ? '
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 8]: his master asked in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 11]: ` Twice , my lord , ' said John . '
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 12]: I saw him in the crowd last night and Saturday . '
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 19]: ` Did -- did it seem to you that his manner was at all wild or strange ? '
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 6]: Lord George demanded , faltering .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 11]: ` Mad , ' said John , with emphatic brevity .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 12]: ` And why do you think him mad , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 10]: said his master , speaking in a peevish tone .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 9]: ` Do n't use that word too freely .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 8]: Why do you think him mad ? '
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 34]: ` My lord , ' John Grueby answered , ` look at his dress , look at his eyes , look at his restless way , hear him cry `` No Popery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 6]: Mad , my lord . '
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 57]: ` So because one man dresses unlike another , ' returned his angry master , glancing at himself ; ` and happens to differ from other men in his carriage and manner , and to advocate a great cause which the corrupt and irreligious desert , he is to be accounted mad , is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 19]: ` Stark , staring , raving , roaring mad , my lord , ' returned the unmoved John .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 10]: ` Do you say this to my face ? '
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 9]: cried his master , turning sharply upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 16]: ` To any man , my lord , who asks me , ' answered John .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 41]: ` Mr Gashford , I find , was right , ' said Lord George ; ' I thought him prejudiced , though I ought to have known a man like him better than to have supposed it possible ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 31]: I shall never have Mr Gashford 's good word , my lord , ' replied John , touching his hat respectfully , ` and I do n't covet it . '
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 24]: ` You are an ill-conditioned , most ungrateful fellow , ' said Lord George : ' a spy , for anything I know .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 15]: Mr Gashford is perfectly correct , as I might have felt convinced he was .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 11]: I have done wrong to retain you in my service .
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 33]: It is a tacit insult to him as my choice and confidential friend to do so , remembering the cause you sided with , on the day he was maligned at Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 15]: You will leave me to-night -- nay , as soon as we reach home .
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 6]: The sooner the better . '
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 15]: ` If it comes to that , I say so too , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 7]: Let Mr Gashford have his will .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 23]: As to my being a spy , my lord , you know me better than to believe it , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 8]: I do n't know much about causes .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 21]: My cause is the cause of one man against two hundred ; and I hope it always will be . '
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 19]: ` You have said quite enough , ' returned Lord George , motioning him to go back . '
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 8]: I desire to hear no more . '
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 34]: ` If you 'll let me have another word , my lord , ' returned John Grueby , ` I 'd give this silly fellow a caution not to stay here by himself .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 26]: The proclamation is in a good many hands already , and it 's well known that he was concerned in the business it relates to .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 17]: He had better get to a place of safety if he can , poor creature . '
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 9]: ` You hear what this man says ? '
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 18]: cried Lord George , addressing Barnaby , who had looked on and wondered while this dialogue passed .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 22]: ` He thinks you may be afraid to remain upon your post , and are kept here perhaps against your will .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 7]: What do you say ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 47]: I think , young man , ' said John , in explanation , ` that the soldiers may turn out and take you ; and that if they do , you will certainly be hung by the neck till you 're dead -- dead -- dead .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 16]: And I think you had better go from here , as fast as you can .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 7]: That 's what I think . '
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 12]: ` He 's a coward , Grip , a coward ! '
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 15]: cried Barnaby , putting the raven on the ground , and shouldering his staff .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 5]: ` Let them come !
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 4]: Gordon for ever !
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 5]: Let them come ! '
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 8]: said Lord George , ` let them !
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 21]: Let us see who will venture to attack a power like ours ; the solemn league of a whole people .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 4]: THIS a madman !
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 8]: You have said well , very well .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 14]: I am proud to be the leader of such men as you . '
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 13]: Bamaby 's heart swelled within his bosom as he heard these words .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 55]: He took Lord George 's hand and carried it to his lips ; patted his horse 's crest , as if the affection and admiration he had conceived for the man extended to the animal he rode ; then unfurling his flag , and proudly waving it , resumed his pacing up and down .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 28]: Lord George , with a kindling eye and glowing cheek , took off his hat , and flourishing it above his head , bade him exultingly Farewell !
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 20]: -- then cantered off at a brisk pace ; after glancing angrily round to see that his servant followed .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 55]: Honest John set spurs to his horse and rode after his master , but not before he had again warned Barnaby to retreat , with many significant gestures , which indeed he continued to make , and Barnaby to resist , until the windings of the road concealed them from each other 's view .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 46]: Left to himself again with a still higher sense of the importance of his post , and stimulated to enthusiasm by the special notice and encouragement of his leader , Barnaby walked to and fro in a delicious trance rather than as a waking man .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 10]: The sunshine which prevailed around was in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 7]: He had but one desire ungratified .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 8]: If she could only see him now !
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 38]: The day wore on ; its heat was gently giving place to the cool of evening ; a light wind sprung up , fanning his long hair , and making the banner rustle pleasantly above his head .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 21]: There was a freedom and freshness in the sound and in the time , which chimed exactly with his mood .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 6]: He was happier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 65]: He was leaning on his staff looking towards the declining sun , and reflecting with a smile that he stood sentinel at that moment over buried gold , when two or three figures appeared in the distance , making towards the house at a rapid pace , and motioning with their hands as though they urged its inmates to retreat from some approaching danger .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 34]: As they drew nearer , they became more earnest in their gestures ; and they were no sooner within hearing , than the foremost among them cried that the soldiers were coming up .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 16]: At these words , Barnaby furled his flag , and tied it round the pole .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 24]: His heart beat high while he did so , but he had no more fear or thought of retreating than the pole itself .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 29]: The friendly stragglers hurried past him , after giving him notice of his danger , and quickly passed into the house , where the utmost confusion immediately prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 53]: As those within hastily closed the windows and the doors , they urged him by looks and signs to fly without loss of time , and called to him many times to do so ; but he only shook his head indignantly in answer , and stood the firmer on his post .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 30]: Finding that he was not to be persuaded , they took care of themselves ; and leaving the place with only one old woman in it , speedily withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 88]: As yet there had been no symptom of the news having any better foundation than in the fears of those who brought it , but The Boot had not been deserted five minutes , when there appeared , coming across the fields , a body of men who , it was easy to see , by the glitter of their arms and ornaments in the sun , and by their orderly and regular mode of advancing -- for they came on as one man -- were soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 54]: In a very little time , Barnaby knew that they were a strong detachment of the Foot Guards , having along with them two gentlemen in private clothes , and a small party of Horse ; the latter brought up the rear , and were not in number more than six or eight .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 26]: They advanced steadily ; neither quickening their pace as they came nearer , nor raising any cry , nor showing the least emotion or anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 40]: Though this was a matter of course in the case of regular troops , even to Barnaby , there was something particularly impressive and disconcerting in it to one accustomed to the noise and tumult of an undisciplined mob .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 20]: For all that , he stood his ground not a whit the less resolutely , and looked on undismayed .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 11]: Presently , they marched into the yard , and halted .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 16]: The commanding-officer despatched a messenger to the horsemen , one of whom came riding back .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 31]: Some words passed between them , and they glanced at Barnaby ; who well remembered the man he had unhorsed at Westminster , and saw him now before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 25]: The man being speedily dismissed , saluted , and rode back to his comrades , who were drawn up apart at a short distance .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 11]: The officer then gave the word to prime and load .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 43]: The heavy ringing of the musket-stocks upon the ground , and the sharp and rapid rattling of the ramrods in their barrels , were a kind of relief to Batnahy , deadly though he knew the purport of such sounds to be .
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 65]: When this was done , other commands were given , and the soldiers instantaneously formed in single file all round the house and stables ; completely encircling them in every part , at a distance , perhaps , of some half-dozen yards ; at least that seemed in Barnaby 's eyes to be about the space left between himself and those who confronted him .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 10]: The horsemen remained drawn up by themselves as before .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 22]: The two gentlemen in private clothes who had kept aloof , now rode forward , one on either side the officer .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 20]: The proclamation having been produced and read by one of them , the officer called on Barnaby to surrender .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 26]: He made no answer , but stepping within the door , before which he had kept guard , held his pole crosswise to protect it .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 16]: In the midst of a profound silence , he was again called upon to yield .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 6]: Still he offered no reply .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 43]: Indeed he had enough to do , to run his eye backward and forward along the half-dozen men who immediately fronted him , and settle hurriedly within himself at which of them he would strike first , when they pressed on him .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 24]: He caught the eye of one in the centre , and resolved to hew that fellow down , though he died for it .
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 20]: Again there was a dead silence , and again the same voice called upon him to deliver himself up .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 17]: Next moment he was back in the stable , dealing blows about him like a madman .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 37]: Two of the men lay stretched at his feet : the one he had marked , dropped first -- he had a thought for that , even in the hot blood and hurry of the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 5]: Another blow -- another !
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 36]: Down , mastered , wounded in the breast by a heavy blow from the butt-end of a gun -LRB- he saw the weapon in the act of falling -RRB- -- breathless -- and a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 17]: An exclamation of surprise from the officer recalled him , in some degree , to himself .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 4]: He looked round .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 42]: Grip , after working in secret all the afternoon , and with redoubled vigour while everybody 's attention was distracted , had plucked away the straw from Hugh 's bed , and turned up the loose ground with his iron bill .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 17]: The hole had been recklessly filled to the brim , and was merely sprinkled with earth .
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 16]: Golden cups , spoons , candlesticks , coined guineas -- all the riches were revealed .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 25]: They brought spades and a sack ; dug up everything that was hidden there ; and carried away more than two men could lift .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 18]: They handcuffed him and bound his arms , searched him , and took away all he had .
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 15]: Nobody questioned or reproached him , or seemed to have much curiosity about him .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 25]: The two men he had stunned , were carried off by their companions in the same business-like way in which everything else was done .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 34]: Finally , he was left under a guard of four soldiers with fixed bayonets , while the officer directed in person the search of the house and the other buildings connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 5]: This was soon completed .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 31]: The soldiers formed again in the yard ; he was marched out , with his guard about him ; and ordered to fall in , where a space was left .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 20]: The others closed up all round , and so they moved away , with the prisoner in the centre .
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 45]: When they came into the streets , he felt he was a sight ; and looking up as they passed quickly along , could see people running to the windows a little too late , and throwing up the sashes to look after him .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 45]: Sometimes he met a staring face beyond the heads about him , or under the arms of his conductors , or peering down upon him from a waggon-top or coach-box ; but this was all he saw , being surrounded by so many men .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 29]: The very noises of the streets seemed muffled and subdued ; and the air came stale and hot upon him , like the sickly breath of an oven .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 4]: Tramp , tramp .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 4]: Tramp , tramp .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 41]: Heads erect , shoulders square , every man stepping in exact time -- all so orderly and regular -- nobody looking at him -- nobody seeming conscious of his presence , -- he could hardly believe he was a Prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 76]: But at the word , though only thought , not spoken , he felt the handcuffs galling his wrists , the cord pressing his arms to his sides : the loaded guns levelled at his head ; and those cold , bright , sharp , shining points turned towards him : the mere looking down at which , now that he was bound and helpless , made the warm current of his life run cold .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 102]: Chapter 58 They were not long in reaching the barracks , for the officer who commanded the party was desirous to avoid rousing the people by the display of military force in the streets , and was humanely anxious to give as little opportunity as possible for any attempt at rescue ; knowing that it must lead to bloodshed and loss of life , and that if the civil authorities by whom he was accompanied , empowered him to order his men to fire , many innocent persons would probably fall , whom curiosity or idleness had attracted to the spot .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 35]: He therefore led the party briskly on , avoiding with a merciful prudence the more public and crowded thoroughfares , and pursuing those which he deemed least likely to be infested by disorderly persons .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 87]: This wise proceeding not only enabled them to gain their quarters without any interruption , but completely baffled a body of rioters who had assembled in one of the main streets , through which it was considered certain they would pass , and who remained gathered together for the purpose of releasing the prisoner from their hands , long after they had deposited him in a place of security , closed the barrack-gates , and set a double guard at every entrance for its better protection .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 45]: Arrived at this place , poor Barnaby was marched into a stone-floored room , where there was a very powerful smell of tobacco , a strong thorough draught of air , and a great wooden bedstead , large enough for a score of men .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 41]: Several soldiers in undress were lounging about , or eating from tin cans ; military accoutrements dangled on rows of pegs along the whitewashed wall ; and some half-dozen men lay fast asleep upon their backs , snoring in concert .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 29]: After remaining here just long enough to note these things , he was marched out again , and conveyed across the parade-ground to another portion of the building .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 20]: Perhaps a man never sees so much at a glance as when he is in a situation of extremity .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 46]: The chances are a hundred to one , that if Barnaby had lounged in at the gate to look about him , he would have lounged out again with a very imperfect idea of the place , and would have remembered very little about it .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 16]: But as he was taken handcuffed across the gravelled area , nothing escaped his notice .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 232]: The dry , arid look of the dusty square , and of the bare brick building ; the clothes hanging at some of the windows ; and the men in their shirt-sleeves and braces , lolling with half their bodies out of the others ; the green sun-blinds at the officers ' quarters , and the little scanty trees in front ; the drummer-boys practising in a distant courtyard ; the men at drill on the parade ; the two soldiers carrying a basket between them , who winked to each other as he went by , and slily pointed to their throats ; the spruce serjeant who hurried past with a cane in his hand , and under his arm a clasped book with a vellum cover ; the fellows in the ground-floor rooms , furbishing and brushing up their different articles of dress , who stopped to look at him , and whose voices as they spoke together echoed loudly through the empty galleries and passages ; -- everything , down to the stand of muskets before the guard-house , and the drum with a pipe-clayed belt attached , in one corner , impressed itself upon his observation , as though he had noticed them in the same place a hundred times , or had been a whole day among them , in place of one brief hurried minute .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 41]: He was taken into a small paved back yard , and there they opened a great door , plated with iron , and pierced some five feet above the ground with a few holes to let in air and light .
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 29]: Into this dungeon he was walked straightway ; and having locked him up there , and placed a sentry over him , they left him to his meditations .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 34]: The cell , or black hole , for it had those words painted on the door , was very dark , and having recently accommodated a drunken deserter , by no means clean .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 43]: Barnaby felt his way to some straw at the farther end , and looking towards the door , tried to accustom himself to the gloom , which , coming from the bright sunshine out of doors , was not an easy task .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 34]: There was a kind of portico or colonnade outside , and this obstructed even the little light that at the best could have found its way through the small apertures in the door .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 80]: The footsteps of the sentinel echoed monotonously as he paced its stone pavement to and fro -LRB- reminding Barnaby of the watch he had so lately kept himself -RRB- ; and as he passed and repassed the door , he made the cell for an instant so black by the interposition of his body , that his going away again seemed like the appearance of a new ray of light , and was quite a circumstance to look for .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 35]: When the prisoner had sat sometime upon the ground , gazing at the chinks , and listening to the advancing and receding footsteps of his guard , the man stood still upon his post .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 61]: Barnaby , quite unable to think , or to speculate on what would be done with him , had been lulled into a kind of doze by his regular pace ; but his stopping roused him ; and then he became aware that two men were in conversation under the colonnade , and very near the door of his cell .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 79]: How long they had been talking there , he could not tell , for he had fallen into an unconsciousness of his real position , and when the footsteps ceased , was answering aloud some question which seemed to have been put to him by Hugh in the stable , though of the fancied purport , either of question or reply , notwithstanding that he awoke with the latter on his lips , he had no recollection whatever .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 31]: The first words that reached his ears , were these : ` Why is he brought here then , if he has to be taken away again so soon ? '
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 9]: ` Why where would you have him go !
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 18]: Damme , he 's not as safe anywhere as among the king 's troops , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 7]: What WOULD you do with him ?
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 37]: Would you hand him over to a pack of cowardly civilians , that shake in their shoes till they wear the soles out , with trembling at the threats of the ragamuffins he belongs to ? '
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 7]: ` That 's true enough . '
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 4]: ` True enough !
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 7]: -- I 'll tell you what .
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 36]: I wish , Tom Green , that I was a commissioned instead of a non-commissioned officer , and that I had the command of two companies -- only two companies -- of my own regiment .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 26]: Call me out to stop these riots -- give me the needful authority , and half-a-dozen rounds of ball cartridge -- ' ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 5]: said the other voice .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 16]: ` That 's all very well , but they wo n't give the needful authority .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 17]: If the magistrate wo n't give the word , what 's the officer to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 25]: Not very well knowing , as it seemed , how to overcome this difficulty , the other man contented himself with damning the magistrates .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 11]: ` With all my heart , ' said his friend .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 10]: ` Where 's the use of a magistrate ? '
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 5]: returned the other voice .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 20]: ` What 's a magistrate in this case , but an impertinent , unnecessary , unconstitutional sort of interference ?
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 5]: Here 's a proclamation .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 10]: Here 's a man referred to in that proclamation .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 13]: Here 's proof against him , and a witness on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 2]: Damme !
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 9]: Take him out and shoot him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 6]: Who wants a magistrate ? '
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 11]: ` When does he go before Sir John Fielding ? '
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 8]: asked the man who had spoken first .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 11]: ` To-night at eight o'clock , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 5]: ` Mark what follows .
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 7]: The magistrate commits him to Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 7]: Our people take him to Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 6]: The rioters pelt our people .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 7]: Our people retire before the rioters .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 14]: Stones are thrown , insults are offered , not a shot 's fired .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 5]: Because of the magistrates .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 5]: Damn the magistrates ! '
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 46]: When he had in some degree relieved his mind by cursing the magistrates in various other forms of speech , the man was silent , save for a low growling , still having reference to those authorities , which from time to time escaped him .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 62]: Barnaby , who had wit enough to know that this conversation concerned , and very nearly concerned , himself , remained perfectly quiet until they ceased to speak , when he groped his way to the door , and peeping through the air-holes , tried to make out what kind of men they were , to whom he had been listening .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 34]: The one who condemned the civil power in such strong terms , was a serjeant -- engaged just then , as the streaming ribands in his cap announced , on the recruiting service .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 28]: He stood leaning sideways against a pillar nearly opposite the door , and as he growled to himself , drew figures on the pavement with his cane .
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 18]: The other man had his back towards the dungeon , and Barnaby could only see his form .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 23]: To judge from that , he was a gallant , manly , handsome fellow , but he had lost his left arm .
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 21]: It had been taken off between the elbow and the shoulder , and his empty coat-sleeve hung across his breast .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 25]: It was probably this circumstance which gave him an interest beyond any that his companion could boast of , and attracted Barnaby 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 17]: There was something soldierly in his bearing , and he wore a jaunty cap and jacket .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 13]: Perhaps he had been in the service at one time or other .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 22]: If he had , it could not have been very long ago , for he was but a young fellow now .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 40]: ` Well , well , ' he said thoughtfully ; ` let the fault be where it may , it makes a man sorrowful to come back to old England , and see her in this condition . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 33]: I suppose the pigs will join 'em next , ' said the serjeant , with an imprecation on the rioters , ` now that the birds have set 'em the example . '
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 5]: ` The birds ! '
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 4]: repeated Tom Green .
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 22]: ` Ah -- birds , ' said the serjeant testily ; ` that 's English , a n't it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 9]: I do n't know what you mean . '
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 9]: ` Go to the guard-house , and see .
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 41]: You 'll find a bird there , that 's got their cry as pat as any of 'em , and bawls `` No Popery , '' like a man -- or like a devil , as he says he is .
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 5]: I should n't wonder .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 8]: The devil 's loose in London somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 21]: Damme if I would n't twist his neck round , on the chance , if I had MY way . '
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 30]: The young man had taken two or three steps away , as if to go and see this creature , when he was arrested by the voice of Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 24]: ` It 's mine , ' he called out , half laughing and half weeping -- ` my pet , my friend Grip .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 11]: Do n't hurt him , he has done no harm .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 9]: I taught him ; it 's my fault .
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 9]: Let me have him , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 10]: He 's the only friend I have left now .
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 40]: He 'll not dance , or talk , or whistle for you , I know ; but he will for me , because he knows me and loves me -- though you would n't think it -- very well .
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 11]: You would n't hurt a bird , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 32]: You 're a brave soldier , sir , and would n't harm a woman or a child -- no , no , nor a poor bird , I 'm certain . '
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 33]: This latter adjuration was addressed to the serjeant , whom Barnaby judged from his red coat to be high in office , and able to seal Grip 's destiny by a word .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 62]: But that gentleman , in reply , surlily damned him for a thief and rebel as he was , and with many disinterested imprecations on his own eyes , liver , blood , and body , assured him that if it rested with him to decide , he would put a final stopper on the bird , and his master too .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 16]: ` You talk boldly to a caged man , ' said Barnaby , in anger .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 36]: ` If I was on the other side of the door and there were none to part us , you 'd change your note -- ay , you may toss your head -- you would !
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 6]: Kill the bird -- do .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 25]: Kill anything you can , and so revenge yourself on those who with their bare hands untied could do as much to you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 33]: Having vented his defiance , he flung himself into the furthest corner of his prison , and muttering , ` Good bye , Grip -- good bye , dear old Grip ! '
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 21]: shed tears for the first time since he had been taken captive ; and hid his face in the straw .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 26]: He had had some fancy at first , that the one-armed man would help him , or would give him a kind word in answer .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 12]: He hardly knew why , but he hoped and thought so .
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 29]: The young fellow had stopped when he called out , and checking himself in the very act of turning round , stood listening to every word he said .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 23]: Perhaps he built his feeble trust on this ; perhaps on his being young , and having a frank and honest manner .
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 10]: However that might be , he built on sand .
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 18]: The other went away directly he had finished speaking , and neither answered him , nor returned .
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 3]: No matter .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 14]: They were all against him here : he might have known as much .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 9]: Good bye , old Grip , good bye !
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 19]: After some time , they came and unlocked the door , and called to him to come out .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 20]: He rose directly , and complied , for he would not have THEM think he was subdued or frightened .
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 14]: He walked out like a man , and looked from face to face .
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 12]: None of them returned his gaze or seemed to notice it .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 42]: They marched him back to the parade by the way they had brought him , and there they halted , among a body of soldiers , at least twice as numerous as that which had taken him prisoner in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 49]: The officer he had seen before , bade him in a few brief words take notice that if he attempted to escape , no matter how favourable a chance he might suppose he had , certain of the men had orders to fire upon him , that moment .
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 14]: They then closed round him as before , and marched him off again .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 25]: In the same unbroken order they arrived at Bow Street , followed and beset on all sides by a crowd which was continually increasing .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 18]: Here he was placed before a blind gentleman , and asked if he wished to say anything .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 3]: Not he .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 8]: What had he got to tell them ?
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 31]: After a very little talking , which he was careless of and quite indifferent to , they told him he was to go to Newgate , and took him away .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 59]: He went out into the street , so surrounded and hemmed in on every side by soldiers , that he could see nothing ; but he knew there was a great crowd of people , by the murmur ; and that they were not friendly to the soldiers , was soon rendered evident by their yells and hisses .
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 13]: How often and how eagerly he listened for the voice of Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 11]: There was not a voice he knew among them all .
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 6]: Was Hugh a prisoner too ?
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 5]: Was there no hope !
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 42]: As they came nearer and nearer to the prison , the hootings of the people grew more violent ; stones were thrown ; and every now and then , a rush was made against the soldiers , which they staggered under .
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 41]: One of them , close before him , smarting under a blow upon the temple , levelled his musket , but the officer struck it upwards with his sword , and ordered him on peril of his life to desist .
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 32]: This was the last thing he saw with any distinctness , for directly afterwards he was tossed about , and beaten to and fro , as though in a tempestuous sea .
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 14]: But go where he would , there were the same guards about him .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 27]: Twice or thrice he was thrown down , and so were they ; but even then , he could not elude their vigilance for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 27]: They were up again , and had closed about him , before he , with his wrists so tightly bound , could scramble to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 54]: Fenced in , thus , he felt himself hoisted to the top of a low flight of steps , and then for a moment he caught a glimpse of the fighting in the crowd , and of a few red coats sprinkled together , here and there , struggling to rejoin their fellows .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 26]: Next moment , everything was dark and gloomy , and he was standing in the prison lobby ; the centre of a group of men .
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 17]: A smith was speedily in attendance , who riveted upon him a set of heavy irons .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 85]: Stumbling on as well as he could , beneath the unusual burden of these fetters , he was conducted to a strong stone cell , where , fastening the door with locks , and bolts , and chains , they left him , well secured ; having first , unseen by him , thrust in Grip , who , with his head drooping and his deep black plumes rough and rumpled , appeared to comprehend and to partake , his master 's fallen fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 57]: Chapter 59 It is necessary at this juncture to return to Hugh , who , having , as we have seen , called to the rioters to disperse from about the Warren , and meet again as usual , glided back into the darkness from which he had emerged , and reappeared no more that night .
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 39]: He paused in the copse which sheltered him from the observation of his mad companions , and waited to ascertain whether they drew off at his bidding , or still lingered and called to him to join them .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 121]: Some few , he saw , were indisposed to go away without him , and made towards the spot where he stood concealed as though they were about to follow in his footsteps , and urge him to come back ; but these men , being in their turn called to by their friends , and in truth not greatly caring to venture into the dark parts of the grounds , where they might be easily surprised and taken , if any of the neighbours or retainers of the family were watching them from among the trees , soon abandoned the idea , and hastily assembling such men as they found of their mind at the moment , straggled off .
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 66]: When he was satisfied that the great mass of the insurgents were imitating this example , and that the ground was rapidly clearing , he plunged into the thickest portion of the little wood ; and , crashing the branches as he went , made straight towards a distant light : guided by that , and by the sullen glow of the fire behind him .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 57]: As he drew nearer and nearer to the twinkling beacon towards which he bent his course , the red glare of a few torches began to reveal itself , and the voices of men speaking together in a subdued tone broke the silence which , save for a distant shouting now and then , already prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 44]: At length he cleared the wood , and , springing across a ditch , stood in a dark lane , where a small body of ill-looking vagabonds , whom he had left there some twenty minutes before , waited his coming with impatience .
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 24]: They were gathered round an old post-chaise or chariot , driven by one of themselves , who sat postilion-wise upon the near horse .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 18]: The blinds were drawn up , and Mr Tappertit and Dennis kept guard at the two windows .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 44]: The former assumed the command of the party , for he challenged Hugh as he advanced towards them ; and when he did so , those who were resting on the ground about the carriage rose to their feet and clustered round him .
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 14]: said Simon , in a low voice ; ` is all right ? '
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 13]: ` Right enough , ' replied Hugh , in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 14]: ` They 're dispersing now -- had begun before I came away . '
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 8]: ` And is the coast clear ? '
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 15]: ` Clear enough before our men , I take it , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 22]: ` There are not many who , knowing of their work over yonder , will want to meddle with 'em to-night .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 9]: -- Who 's got some drink here ? '
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 16]: Everybody had some plunder from the cellar ; half-a-dozen flasks and bottles were offered directly .
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 20]: He selected the largest , and putting it to his mouth , sent the wine gurgling down his throat .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 26]: Having emptied it , he threw it down , and stretched out his hand for another , which he emptied likewise , at a draught .
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 12]: Another was given him , and this he half emptied too .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 22]: Reserving what remained to finish with , he asked : ` Have you got anything to eat , any of you ?
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 9]: I 'm as ravenous as a hungry wolf .
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 12]: Which of you was in the larder -- come ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 20]: I was , brother , ' said Dennis , pulling off his hat , and fumbling in the crown .
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 20]: ` There 's a matter of cold venison pasty somewhere or another here , if that 'll do . '
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 4]: ` Do ! '
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 9]: cried Hugh , seating himself on the pathway .
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 5]: ` Bring it out !
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 9]: Show a light here , and gather round !
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 9]: Let me sup in state , my lads !
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 56]: Entering into his boisterous humour , for they all had drunk deeply , and were as wild as he , they crowded about him , while two of their number who had torches , held them up , one on either side of him , that his banquet might not be despatched in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 63]: Mr Dennis , having by this time succeeded in extricating from his hat a great mass of pasty , which had been wedged in so tightly that it was not easily got out , put it before him ; and Hugh , having borrowed a notched and jagged knife from one of the company , fell to work upon it vigorously . '
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 28]: I should recommend you to swallow a little fire every day , about an hour afore dinner , brother , ' said Dennis , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 15]: ` It seems to agree with you , and to stimulate your appetite . '
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 37]: Hugh looked at him , and at the blackened faces by which he was surrounded , and , stopping for a moment to flourish his knife above his head , answered with a roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 10]: ` Keep order , there , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 4]: said Simon Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 52]: ` Why , is n't a man allowed to regale himself , noble captain , ' retorted his lieutenant , parting the men who stood between them , with his knife , that he might see him , -- ` to regale himself a little bit after such work as mine ?
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 5]: What a hard captain !
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 5]: What a strict captain !
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 5]: What a tyrannical captain !
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 6]: Ha ha ha ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 35]: I wish one of you fellers would hold a bottle to his mouth to keep him quiet , ' said Simon , ` unless you want the military to be down upon us . '
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 11]: ` And what if they are down upon us ! '
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 3]: retorted Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 4]: ` Who cares ?
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 4]: Who 's afraid ?
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 11]: Let 'em come , I say , let 'em come .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 6]: The more , the merrier .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 22]: Give me bold Barnaby at my side , and we two will settle the military , without troubling any of you .
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 8]: Barnaby 's the man for the military .
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 5]: Barnaby 's health ! '
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 49]: But as the majority of those present were by no means anxious for a second engagement that night , being already weary and exhausted , they sided with Mr Tappertit , and pressed him to make haste with his supper , for they had already delayed too long .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 53]: Knowing , even in the height of his frenzy , that they incurred great danger by lingering so near the scene of the late outrages , Hugh made an end of his meal without more remonstrance , and rising , stepped up to Mr Tappertit , and smote him on the back .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 13]: ` Now then , ' he cried , ` I 'm ready .
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 10]: There are brave birds inside this cage , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 11]: Delicate birds , -- tender , loving , little doves .
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 13]: I caged 'em -- I caged 'em -- one more peep ! '
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 41]: He thrust the little man aside as he spoke , and mounting on the steps , which were half let down , pulled down the blind by force , and stared into the chaise like an ogre into his larder .
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 15]: and did you scratch , and pinch , and struggle , pretty mistress ? '
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 33]: he cried , as he grasped a little hand that sought in vain to free itself from his grip : ` you , so bright-eyed , and cherry-lipped , and daintily made ?
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 10]: But I love you better for it , mistress .
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 5]: Ay , I do .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 21]: You should stab me and welcome , so that it pleased you , and you had to cure me afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 9]: I love to see you proud and scornful .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 22]: It makes you handsomer than ever ; and who so handsome as you at any time , my pretty one ! '
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 14]: said Mr Tappertit , who had waited during this speech with considerable impatience .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 7]: ` There 's enough of that .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 4]: Come down . '
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 53]: The little hand seconded this admonition by thrusting Hugh 's great head away with all its force , and drawing up the blind , amidst his noisy laughter , and vows that he must have another look , for the last glimpse of that sweet face had provoked him past all bearing .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 127]: However , as the suppressed impatience of the party now broke out into open murmurs , he abandoned this design , and taking his seat upon the bar , contented himself with tapping at the front windows of the carriage , and trying to steal a glance inside ; Mr Tappertit , mounting the steps and hanging on by the door , issued his directions to the driver with a commanding voice and attitude ; the rest got up behind , or ran by the side of the carriage , as they could ; some , in imitation of Hugh , endeavoured to see the face he had praised so highly , and were reminded of their impertinence by hints from the cudgel of Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 39]: Thus they pursued their journey by circuitous and winding roads ; preserving , except when they halted to take breath , or to quarrel about the best way of reaching London , pretty good order and tolerable silence .
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 90]: In the mean time , Dolly -- beautiful , bewitching , captivating little Dolly -- her hair dishevelled , her dress torn , her dark eyelashes wet with tears , her bosom heaving -- her face , now pale with fear , now crimsoned with indignation -- her whole self a hundred times more beautiful in this heightened aspect than ever she had been before -- vainly strove to comfort Emma Haredale , and to impart to her the consolation of which she stood in so much need herself .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 43]: The soldiers were sure to come ; they must be rescued ; it would be impossible to convey them through the streets of London when they set the threats of their guards at defiance , and shrieked to the passengers for help .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 27]: If they did this when they came into the more frequented ways , she was certain -- she was quite certain -- they must be released .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 63]: So poor Dolly said , and so poor Dolly tried to think ; but the invariable conclusion of all such arguments was , that Dolly burst into tears ; cried , as she wrung her hands , what would they do or think , or who would comfort them , at home , at the Golden Key ; and sobbed most piteously .
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 37]: Miss Haredale , whose feelings were usually of a quieter kind than Dolly 's , and not so much upon the surface , was dreadfully alarmed , and indeed had only just recovered from a swoon .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 113]: She was very pale , and the hand which Dolly held was quite cold ; but she bade her , nevertheless , remember that , under Providence , much must depend upon their own discretion ; that if they remained quiet and lulled the vigilance of the ruffians into whose hands they had fallen , the chances of their being able to procure assistance when they reached the town , were very much increased ; that unless society were quite unhinged , a hot pursuit must be immediately commenced ; and that her uncle , she might be sure , would never rest until he had found them out and rescued them .
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 89]: But as she said these latter words , the idea that he had fallen in a general massacre of the Catholics that night -- no very wild or improbable supposition after what they had seen and undergone -- struck her dumb ; and , lost in the horrors they had witnessed , and those they might be yet reserved for , she sat incapable of thought , or speech , or outward show of grief : as rigid , and almost as white and cold , as marble .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 29]: Oh , how many , many times , in that long ride , did Dolly think of her old lover , -- poor , fond , slighted Joe !
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 42]: How many , many times , did she recall that night when she ran into his arms from the very man now projecting his hateful gaze into the darkness where she sat , and leering through the glass in monstrous admiration !
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 85]: And when she thought of Joe , and what a brave fellow he was , and how he would have rode boldly up , and dashed in among these villains now , yes , though they were double the number -- and here she clenched her little hand , and pressed her foot upon the ground -- the pride she felt for a moment in having won his heart , faded in a burst of tears , and she sobbed more bitterly than ever .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 88]: As the night wore on , and they proceeded by ways which were quite unknown to them -- for they could recognise none of the objects of which they sometimes caught a hurried glimpse -- their fears increased ; nor were they without good foundation ; it was not difficult for two beautiful young women to find , in their being borne they knew not whither by a band of daring villains who eyed them as some among these fellows did , reasons for the worst alarm .
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 30]: When they at last entered London , by a suburb with which they were wholly unacquainted , it was past midnight , and the streets were dark and empty .
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 31]: Nor was this the worst , for the carriage stopping in a lonely spot , Hugh suddenly opened the door , jumped in , and took his seat between them .
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 9]: It was in vain they cried for help .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 28]: He put his arm about the neck of each , and swore to stifle them with kisses if they were not as silent as the grave . '
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 22]: I come here to keep you quiet , ' he said , ` and that 's the means I shall take .
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 25]: So do n't be quiet , pretty mistresses -- make a noise -- do -- and I shall like it all the better . '
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 33]: They were proceeding at a rapid pace , and apparently with fewer attendants than before , though it was so dark -LRB- the torches being extinguished -RRB- that this was mere conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 32]: They shrunk from his touch , each into the farthest corner of the carriage ; but shrink as Dolly would , his arm encircled her waist , and held her fast .
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 61]: She neither cried nor spoke , for terror and disgust deprived her of the power ; but she plucked at his hand as though she would die in the effort to disengage herself ; and crouching on the ground , with her head averted and held down , repelled him with a strength she wondered at as much as he .
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 5]: The carriage stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 32]: ` Lift this one out , ' said Hugh to the man who opened the door , as he took Miss Haredale 's hand , and felt how heavily it fell .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 6]: ` She 's fainted . '
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 16]: ` So much the better , ' growled Dennis -- it was that amiable gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 5]: ` She 's quiet .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 16]: I always like 'em to faint , unless they 're very tender and composed . '
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 9]: ` Can you take her by yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 4]: asked Hugh . '
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 8]: I do n't know till I try .
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 23]: I ought to be able to ; I 've lifted up a good many in my time , ' said the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 4]: ` Up then !
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 16]: She 's no small weight , brother ; none of these here fine gals are .
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 3]: Up again !
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 6]: Now we have her . '
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 19]: Having by this time hoisted the young lady into his arms , he staggered off with his burden .
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 16]: ` Look ye , pretty bird , ' said Hugh , drawing Dolly towards him .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 13]: ` Remember what I told you -- a kiss for every cry .
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 9]: Scream , if you love me , darling .
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 5]: Scream once , mistress .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 12]: Pretty mistress , only once , if you love me . '
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 53]: Thrusting his face away with all her force , and holding down her head , Dolly submitted to be carried out of the chaise , and borne after Miss Haredale into a miserable cottage , where Hugh , after hugging her to his breast , set her gently down upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 3]: Poor Dolly !
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 19]: Do what she would , she only looked the better for it , and tempted them the more .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 25]: When her eyes flashed angrily , and her ripe lips slightly parted , to give her rapid breathing vent , who could resist it ?
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 55]: When she wept and sobbed as though her heart would break , and bemoaned her miseries in the sweetest voice that ever fell upon a listener 's ear , who could be insensible to the little winning pettishness which now and then displayed itself , even in the sincerity and earnestness of her grief ?
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 73]: When , forgetful for a moment of herself , as she was now , she fell on her knees beside her friend , and bent over her , and laid her cheek to hers , and put her arms about her , what mortal eyes could have avoided wandering to the delicate bodice , the streaming hair , the neglected dress , the perfect abandonment and unconsciousness of the blooming little beauty ?
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 37]: Who could look on and see her lavish caresses and endearments , and not desire to be in Emma Haredale 's place ; to be either her or Dolly ; either the hugging or the hugged ?
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 3]: Not Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 4]: Not Dennis . '
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 69]: I tell you what it is , young women , ' said Mr Dennis , ' I a n't much of a lady 's man myself , nor am I a party in the present business further than lending a willing hand to my friends : but if I see much more of this here sort of thing , I shall become a principal instead of a accessory .
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 6]: I tell you candid . '
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 9]: ` Why have you brought us here ? '
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 3]: said Emma .
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 8]: ` Are we to be murdered ? '
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 4]: ` Murdered ! '
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 16]: cried Dennis , sitting down upon a stool , and regarding her with great favour .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 14]: ` Why , my dear , who 'd murder sich chickabiddies as you ?
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 26]: If you was to ask me , now , whether you was brought here to be married , there might be something in it . '
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 19]: And here he exchanged a grin with Hugh , who removed his eyes from Dolly for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 19]: ` No , no , ' said Dennis , ` there 'll be no murdering , my pets .
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 5]: Nothing of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 5]: Quite the contrairy . '
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 18]: ` You are an older man than your companion , sir , ' said Emma , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 8]: ` Have you no pity for us ?
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 11]: Do you not consider that we are women ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 11]: I do indeed , my dear , ' retorted Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 17]: ` It would be very hard not to , with two such specimens afore my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 7]: Oh yes , I consider that .
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 8]: We all consider that , miss . '
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 33]: He shook his head waggishly , leered at Hugh again , and laughed very much , as if he had said a noble thing , and rather thought he was coming out .
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 10]: ` There 'll be no murdering , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 6]: Not a bit on it .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 61]: I tell you what though , brother , ' said Dennis , cocking his hat for the convenience of scratching his head , and looking gravely at Hugh , ` it 's worthy of notice , as a proof of the amazing equalness and dignity of our law , that it do n't make no distinction between men and women .
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 50]: I 've heerd the judge say , sometimes , to a highwayman or housebreaker as had tied the ladies neck and heels -- you 'll excuse me making mention of it , my darlings -- and put 'em in a cellar , that he showed no consideration to women .
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 44]: Now , I say that there judge did n't know his business , brother ; and that if I had been that there highwayman or housebreaker , I should have made answer : `` What are you a talking of , my lord ?
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 22]: I showed the women as much consideration as the law does , and what more would you have me do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 51]: If you was to count up in the newspapers the number of females as have been worked off in this here city alone , in the last ten year , ' said Mr Dennis thoughtfully , ` you 'd be surprised at the total -- quite amazed , you would .
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 12]: There 's a dignified and equal thing ; a beautiful thing !
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 9]: But we 've no security for its lasting .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 28]: Now that they 've begun to favour these here Papists , I should n't wonder if they went and altered even THAT , one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 9]: Upon my soul , I should n't . '
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 26]: The subject , perhaps from being of too exclusive and professional a nature , failed to interest Hugh as much as his friend had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 38]: But he had no time to pursue it , for at this crisis Mr Tappertit entered precipitately ; at sight of whom Dolly uttered a scream of joy , and fairly threw herself into his arms . '
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 11]: I knew it , I was sure of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 3]: cried Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 9]: ` My dear father 's at the door .
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 6]: Thank God , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 5]: Bless you , Sim .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 7]: Heaven bless you for this ! '
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 90]: Simon Tappertit , who had at first implicitly believed that the locksmith 's daughter , unable any longer to suppress her secret passion for himself , was about to give it full vent in its intensity , and to declare that she was his for ever , looked extremely foolish when she said these words ; -- the more so , as they were received by Hugh and Dennis with a loud laugh , which made her draw back , and regard him with a fixed and earnest look .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 27]: ` Miss Haredale , ' said Sim , after a very awkward silence , ' I hope you 're as comfortable as circumstances will permit of .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 22]: Dolly Varden , my darling -- my own , my lovely one -- I hope YOU 'RE pretty comfortable likewise . '
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 4]: Poor little Dolly !
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 20]: She saw how it was ; hid her face in her hands ; and sobbed more bitterly than ever .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 74]: ` You meet in me , Miss V. , ' said Simon , laying his hand upon his breast , ` not a ` prentice , not a workman , not a slave , not the wictim of your father 's tyrannical behaviour , but the leader of a great people , the captain of a noble band , in which these gentlemen are , as I may say , corporals and serjeants .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 32]: You behold in me , not a private individual , but a public character ; not a mender of locks , but a healer of the wounds of his unhappy country .
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 20]: Dolly V. , sweet Dolly V. , for how many years have I looked forward to this present meeting !
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 15]: For how many years has it been my intention to exalt and ennoble you !
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 4]: I redeem it .
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 7]: Behold in me , your husband .
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 17]: Yes , beautiful Dolly -- charmer -- enslaver -- S. Tappertit is all your own ! '
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 10]: As he said these words he advanced towards her .
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 17]: Dolly retreated till she could go no farther , and then sank down upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 72]: Thinking it very possible that this might be maiden modesty , Simon essayed to raise her ; on which Dolly , goaded to desperation , wound her hands in his hair , and crying out amidst her tears that he was a dreadful little wretch , and always had been , shook , and pulled , and beat him , until he was fain to call for help , most lustily .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 13]: Hugh had never admired her half so much as at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 31]: ` She 's in an excited state to-night , ' said Simon , as he smoothed his rumpled feathers , ` and do n't know when she 's well off .
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 17]: Let her be by herself till to-morrow , and that 'll bring her down a little .
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 8]: Carry her into the next house ! '
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 8]: Hugh had her in his arms directly .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 41]: It might be that Mr Tappertit 's heart was really softened by her distress , or it might be that he felt it in some degree indecorous that his intended bride should be struggling in the grasp of another man .
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 41]: He commanded him , on second thoughts , to put her down again , and looked moodily on as she flew to Miss Haredale 's side , and clinging to her dress , hid her flushed face in its folds .
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 24]: ` They shall remain here together till to-morrow , ' said Simon , who had now quite recovered his dignity -- 'till to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 4]: Come away ! '
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 6]: ` Come away , captain .
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 8]: ` What are you laughing at ? '
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 4]: demanded Simon sternly .
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 41]: ` Nothing , captain , nothing , ' Hugh rejoined ; and as he spoke , and clapped his hand upon the shoulder of the little man , he laughed again , for some unknown reason , with tenfold violence .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 61]: Mr Tappertit surveyed him from head to foot with lofty scorn -LRB- this only made him laugh the more -RRB- , and turning to the prisoners , said : ` You 'll take notice , ladies , that this place is well watched on every side , and that the least noise is certain to be attended with unpleasant consequences .
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 14]: You 'll hear -- both of you -- more of our intentions to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 63]: In the mean time , do n't show yourselves at the window , or appeal to any of the people you may see pass it ; for if you do , it 'll be known directly that you come from a Catholic house , and all the exertions our men can make , may not be able to save your lives . '
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 22]: With this last caution , which was true enough , he turned to the door , followed by Hugh and Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 46]: They paused for a moment , going out , to look at them clasped in each other 's arms , and then left the cottage ; fastening the door , and setting a good watch upon it , and indeed all round the house . '
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 21]: I say , ' growled Dennis , as they walked away in company , ` that 's a dainty pair .
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 14]: Muster Gashford 's one is as handsome as the other , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 5]: said Hugh , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 7]: ` Do n't you mention names .
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 8]: It 's a bad habit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 34]: I would n't like to be HIM , then -LRB- as you do n't like names -RRB- , when he breaks it out to her ; that 's all , ' said Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 28]: ` She 's one of them fine , black-eyed , proud gals , as I would n't trust at such times with a knife too near 'em .
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 11]: I 've seen some of that sort , afore now .
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 94]: I recollect one that was worked off , many year ago -- and there was a gentleman in that case too -- that says to me , with her lip a trembling , but her hand as steady as ever I see one : `` Dennis , I 'm near my end , but if I had a dagger in these fingers , and he was within my reach , I 'd strike him dead afore me ; '' -- ah , she did -- and she 'd have done it too ! '
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 5]: Strike who dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 3]: demanded Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 9]: ` How should I know , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 3]: answered Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 9]: ` SHE never said ; not she . '
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 38]: Hugh looked , for a moment , as though he would have made some further inquiry into this incoherent recollection ; but Simon Tappertit , who had been meditating deeply , gave his thoughts a new direction .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 4]: ` Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 3]: said Sim .
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 7]: ` You have done well to-day .
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 5]: You shall be rewarded .
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 6]: So have you , Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 16]: -- There 's no young woman YOU want to carry off , is there ? '
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 22]: ` N -- no , ' returned that gentleman , stroking his grizzly beard , which was some two inches long .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 9]: ` None in partickler , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 23]: ` Very good , ' said Sim ; ` then we 'll find some other way of making it up to you .
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 32]: As to you , old boy ' -- he turned to Hugh -- ` you shall have Miggs -LRB- her that I promised you , you know -RRB- within three days .
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 2]: Mind .
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 8]: I pass my word for it . '
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 56]: Hugh thanked him heartily ; and as he did so , his laughing fit returned with such violence that he was obliged to hold his side with one hand , and to lean with the other on the shoulder of his small captain , without whose support he would certainly have rolled upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 90]: Chapter 60 The three worthies turned their faces towards The Boot , with the intention of passing the night in that place of rendezvous , and of seeking the repose they so much needed in the shelter of their old den ; for now that the mischief and destruction they had purposed were achieved , and their prisoners were safely bestowed for the night , they began to be conscious of exhaustion , and to feel the wasting effects of the madness which had led to such deplorable results .
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 95]: Notwithstanding the lassitude and fatigue which oppressed him now , in common with his two companions , and indeed with all who had taken an active share in that night 's work , Hugh 's boisterous merriment broke out afresh whenever he looked at Simon Tappertit , and vented itself -- much to that gentleman 's indignation -- in such shouts of laughter as bade fair to bring the watch upon them , and involve them in a skirmish , to which in their present worn-out condition they might prove by no means equal .
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 79]: Even Mr Dennis , who was not at all particular on the score of gravity or dignity , and who had a great relish for his young friend 's eccentric humours , took occasion to remonstrate with him on this imprudent behaviour , which he held to be a species of suicide , tantamount to a man 's working himself off without being overtaken by the law , than which he could imagine nothing more ridiculous or impertinent .
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 45]: Not abating one jot of his noisy mirth for these remonstrances , Hugh reeled along between them , having an arm of each , until they hove in sight of The Boot , and were within a field or two of that convenient tavern .
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 18]: He happened by great good luck to have roared and shouted himself into silence by this time .
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 48]: They were proceeding onward without noise , when a scout who had been creeping about the ditches all night , to warn any stragglers from encroaching further on what was now such dangerous ground , peeped cautiously from his hiding-place , and called to them to stop .
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 3]: ` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 4]: and why ? '
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 21]: Because -LRB- the scout replied -RRB- the house was filled with constables and soldiers ; having been surprised that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 16]: The inmates had fled or been taken into custody , he could not say which .
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 28]: He had prevented a great many people from approaching nearer , and he believed they had gone to the markets and such places to pass the night .
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 14]: He had seen the distant fires , but they were all out now .
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 29]: He had heard the people who passed and repassed , speaking of them too , and could report that the prevailing opinion was one of apprehension and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 36]: He had not heard a word of Barnaby -- did n't even know his name -- but it had been said in his hearing that some man had been taken and carried off to Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 12]: Whether this was true or false , he could not affirm .
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 20]: The three took counsel together , on hearing this , and debated what it might be best to do .
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 90]: Hugh , deeming it possible that Barnaby was in the hands of the soldiers , and at that moment under detention at The Boot , was for advancing stealthily , and firing the house ; but his companions , who objected to such rash measures unless they had a crowd at their backs , represented that if Barnaby were taken he had assuredly been removed to a stronger prison ; they would never have dreamed of keeping him all night in a place so weak and open to attack .
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 46]: Yielding to this reasoning , and to their persuasions , Hugh consented to turn back and to repair to Fleet Market ; for which place , it seemed , a few of their boldest associates had shaped their course , on receiving the same intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 50]: Feeling their strength recruited and their spirits roused , now that there was a new necessity for action , they hurried away , quite forgetful of the fatigue under which they had been sinking but a few minutes before ; and soon arrived at their new place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 29]: Fleet Market , at that time , was a long irregular row of wooden sheds and penthouses , occupying the centre of what is now called Farringdon Street .
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 85]: They were jumbled together in a most unsightly fashion , in the middle of the road ; to the great obstruction of the thoroughfare and the annoyance of passengers , who were fain to make their way , as they best could , among carts , baskets , barrows , trucks , casks , bulks , and benches , and to jostle with porters , hucksters , waggoners , and a motley crowd of buyers , sellers , pick-pockets , vagrants , and idlers .
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 31]: The air was perfumed with the stench of rotten leaves and faded fruit ; the refuse of the butchers ' stalls , and offal and garbage of a hundred kinds .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 28]: It was indispensable to most public conveniences in those days , that they should be public nuisances likewise ; and Fleet Market maintained the principle to admiration .
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 53]: To this place , perhaps because its sheds and baskets were a tolerable substitute for beds , or perhaps because it afforded the means of a hasty barricade in case of need , many of the rioters had straggled , not only that night , but for two or three nights before .
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 40]: It was now broad day , but the morning being cold , a group of them were gathered round a fire in a public-house , drinking hot purl , and smoking pipes , and planning new schemes for to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 29]: Hugh and his two friends being known to most of these men , were received with signal marks of approbation , and inducted into the most honourable seats .
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 21]: The room-door was closed and fastened to keep intruders at a distance , and then they proceeded to exchange news .
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 17]: ` The soldiers have taken possession of The Boot , I hear , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 8]: ` Who knows anything about it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 70]: Several cried that they did ; but the majority of the company having been engaged in the assault upon the Warren , and all present having been concerned in one or other of the night 's expeditions , it proved that they knew no more than Hugh himself ; having been merely warned by each other , or by the scout , and knowing nothing of their own knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 24]: ` We left a man on guard there to-day , ' said Hugh , looking round him , ` who is not here .
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 17]: You know who it is -- Barnaby , who brought the soldier down , at Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 10]: Has any man seen or heard of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 49]: They shook their heads , and murmured an answer in the negative , as each man looked round and appealed to his fellow ; when a noise was heard without , and a man was heard to say that he wanted Hugh -- that he must see Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 24]: ` He is but one man , ' cried Hugh to those who kept the door ; ` let him come in . '
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 6]: ` Ay , ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 4]: muttered the others .
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 6]: ` Let him come in .
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 6]: Let him come in . '
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 8]: The door was accordingly unlocked and opened .
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 52]: A one-armed man , with his head and face tied up with a bloody cloth , as though he had been severely beaten , his clothes torn , and his remaining hand grasping a thick stick , rushed in among them , and panting for breath , demanded which was Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 14]: ` Here he is , ' replied the person he inquired for . '
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 4]: I am Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 9]: What do you want with me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 12]: I have a message for you , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 7]: ` You know one Barnaby . '
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 5]: ` What of him ?
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 7]: Did he send the message ? '
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 4]: He 's taken .
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 11]: He 's in one of the strong cells in Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 15]: He defended himself as well as he could , but was overpowered by numbers .
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 6]: That 's his message . '
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 8]: ` When did you see him ? '
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 5]: asked Hugh , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 17]: ` On his way to prison , where he was taken by a party of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 12]: They took a by-road , and not the one we expected .
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 28]: I was one of the few who tried to rescue him , and he called to me , and told me to tell Hugh where he was .
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 10]: We made a good struggle , though it failed .
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 4]: Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 29]: He pointed to his dress and to his bandaged head , and still panting for breath , glanced round the room ; then faced towards Hugh again . '
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 35]: I know you by sight , ' he said , ` for I was in the crowd on Friday , and on Saturday , and yesterday , but I did n't know your name .
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 9]: You 're a bold fellow , I know .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 4]: So is he .
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 14]: He fought like a lion tonight , but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 13]: I did my best , considering that I want this limb . '
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 49]: Again he glanced inquisitively round the room or seemed to do so , for his face was nearly hidden by the bandage -- and again facing sharply towards Hugh , grasped his stick as if he half expected to be set upon , and stood on the defensive .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 20]: If he had any such apprehension , however , he was speedily reassured by the demeanour of all present .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 9]: None thought of the bearer of the tidings .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 9]: He was lost in the news he brought .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 13]: Oaths , threats , and execrations , were vented on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 36]: Some cried that if they bore this tamely , another day would see them all in jail ; some , that they should have rescued the other prisoners , and this would not have happened .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 17]: One man cried in a loud voice , ` Who 'll follow me to Newgate ! '
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 13]: and there was a loud shout and general rush towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 84]: But Hugh and Dennis stood with their backs against it , and kept them back , until the clamour had so far subsided that their voices could be heard , when they called to them together that to go now , in broad day , would be madness ; and that if they waited until night and arranged a plan of attack , they might release , not only their own companions , but all the prisoners , and burn down the jail .
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 17]: ` Not that jail alone , ' cried Hugh , ` but every jail in London .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 11]: They shall have no place to put their prisoners in .
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 14]: We 'll burn them all down ; make bonfires of them every one !
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 3]: Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 10]: he cried , catching at the hangman 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 12]: ` Let all who 're men here , join with us .
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 5]: Shake hands upon it .
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 12]: Barnaby out of jail , and not a jail left standing !
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 4]: Who joins ? '
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 4]: Every man there .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 31]: And they swore a great oath to release their friends from Newgate next night ; to force the doors and burn the jail ; or perish in the fire themselves .
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 93]: Chapter 61 On that same night -- events so crowd upon each other in convulsed and distracted times , that more than the stirring incidents of a whole life often become compressed into the compass of four-and-twenty hours -- on that same night , Mr Haredale , having strongly bound his prisoner , with the assistance of the sexton , and forced him to mount his horse , conducted him to Chigwell ; bent upon procuring a conveyance to London from that place , and carrying him at once before a justice .
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 82]: The disturbed state of the town would be , he knew , a sufficient reason for demanding the murderer 's committal to prison before daybreak , as no man could answer for the security of any of the watch-houses or ordinary places of detention ; and to convey a prisoner through the streets when the mob were again abroad , would not only be a task of great danger and hazard , but would be to challenge an attempt at rescue .
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 32]: Directing the sexton to lead the horse , he walked close by the murderer 's side , and in this order they reached the village about the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 32]: The people were all awake and up , for they were fearful of being burnt in their beds , and sought to comfort and assure each other by watching in company .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 16]: A few of the stoutest-hearted were armed and gathered in a body on the green .
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 36]: To these , who knew him well , Mr Haredale addressed himself , briefly narrating what had happened , and beseeching them to aid in conveying the criminal to London before the dawn of day .
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 20]: But not a man among them dared to help him by so much as the motion of a finger .
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 40]: The rioters , in their passage through the village , had menaced with their fiercest vengeance , any person who should aid in extinguishing the fire , or render the least assistance to him , or any Catholic whomsoever .
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 11]: Their threats extended to their lives and all they possessed .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 20]: They were assembled for their own protection , and could not endanger themselves by lending any aid to him .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 49]: This they told him , not without hesitation and regret , as they kept aloof in the moonlight and glanced fearfully at the ghostly rider , who , with his head drooping on his breast and his hat slouched down upon his brow , neither moved nor spoke .
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 62]: Finding it impossible to persuade them , and indeed hardly knowing how to do so after what they had seen of the fury of the crowd , Mr Haredale besought them that at least they would leave him free to act for himself , and would suffer him to take the only chaise and pair of horses that the place afforded .
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 32]: This was not acceded to without some difficulty , but in the end they told him to do what he would , and go away from them in heaven 's name .
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 108]: Leaving the sexton at the horse 's bridle , he drew out the chaise with his own hands , and would have harnessed the horses , but that the post-boy of the village -- a soft-hearted , good-for-nothing , vagabond kind of fellow -- was moved by his earnestness and passion , and , throwing down a pitchfork with which he was armed , swore that the rioters might cut him into mincemeat if they liked , but he would not stand by and see an honest gentleman who had done no wrong , reduced to such extremity , without doing what he could to help him .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 16]: Mr Haredale shook him warmly by the hand , and thanked him from his heart .
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 18]: In five minutes ' time the chaise was ready , and this good scapegrace in his saddle .
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 51]: The murderer was put inside , the blinds were drawn up , the sexton took his seat upon the bar , Mr Haredale mounted his horse and rode close beside the door ; and so they started in the dead of night , and in profound silence , for London .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 26]: The consternation was so extreme that even the horses which had escaped the flames at the Warren , could find no friends to shelter them .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 51]: They passed them on the road , browsing on the stunted grass ; and the driver told them , that the poor beasts had wandered to the village first , but had been driven away , lest they should bring the vengeance of the crowd on any of the inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 21]: Nor was this feeling confined to such small places , where the people were timid , ignorant , and unprotected .
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 74]: When they came near London they met , in the grey light of morning , more than one poor Catholic family who , terrified by the threats and warnings of their neighbours , were quitting the city on foot , and who told them they could hire no cart or horse for the removal of their goods , and had been compelled to leave them behind , at the mercy of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 55]: Near Mile End they passed a house , the master of which , a Catholic gentleman of small means , having hired a waggon to remove his furniture by midnight , had had it all brought down into the street , to wait the vehicle 's arrival , and save time in the packing .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 76]: But the man with whom he made the bargain , alarmed by the fires that night , and by the sight of the rioters passing his door , had refused to keep it : and the poor gentleman , with his wife and servant and their little children , were sitting trembling among their goods in the open street , dreading the arrival of day and not knowing where to turn or what to do .
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 13]: It was the same , they heard , with the public conveyances .
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 21]: The panic was so great that the mails and stage-coaches were afraid to carry passengers who professed the obnoxious religion .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 64]: If the drivers knew them , or they admitted that they held that creed , they would not take them , no , though they offered large sums ; and yesterday , people had been afraid to recognise Catholic acquaintance in the streets , lest they should be marked by spies , and burnt out , as it was called , in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 74]: One mild old man -- a priest , whose chapel was destroyed ; a very feeble , patient , inoffensive creature -- who was trudging away , alone , designing to walk some distance from town , and then try his fortune with the coaches , told Mr Haredale that he feared he might not find a magistrate who would have the hardihood to commit a prisoner to jail , on his complaint .
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 18]: But notwithstanding these discouraging accounts they went on , and reached the Mansion House soon after sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 78]: Mr Haredale threw himself from his horse , but he had no need to knock at the door , for it was already open , and there stood upon the step a portly old man , with a very red , or rather purple face , who with an anxious expression of countenance , was remonstrating with some unseen personage upstairs , while the porter essayed to close the door by degrees and get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 48]: With the intense impatience and excitement natural to one in his condition , Mr Haredale thrust himself forward and was about to speak , when the fat old gentleman interposed : ` My good sir , ' said he , ` pray let me get an answer .
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 10]: This is the sixth time I have been here .
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 7]: I was here five times yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 7]: My house is threatened with destruction .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 25]: It is to be burned down to-night , and was to have been last night , but they had other business on their hands .
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 8]: Pray let me get an answer . '
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 23]: ` My good sir , ' returned Mr Haredale , shaking his head , ` my house is burned to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 8]: But heaven forbid that yours should be .
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 4]: Get your answer .
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 9]: Be brief , in mercy to me . '
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 11]: ` Now , you hear this , my lord ? '
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 23]: -- said the old gentleman , calling up the stairs , to where the skirt of a dressing-gown fluttered on the landing-place .
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 17]: ` Here is a gentleman here , whose house was actually burnt down last night . '
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 28]: ` Dear me , dear me , ' replied a testy voice , ' I am very sorry for it , but what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 8]: I ca n't build it up again .
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 22]: The chief magistrate of the city ca n't go and be a rebuilding of people 's houses , my good sir .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 5]: Stuff and nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 42]: ` But the chief magistrate of the city can prevent people 's houses from having any need to be rebuilt , if the chief magistrate 's a man , and not a dummy -- ca n't he , my lord ? '
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 9]: cried the old gentleman in a choleric manner .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 21]: ` You are disrespectable , sir , ' said the Lord Mayor -- ` leastways , disrespectful I mean . '
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 7]: ` Disrespectful , my lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 6]: returned the old gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 7]: I was respectful five times yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 8]: I ca n't be respectful for ever .
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 24]: Men ca n't stand on being respectful when their houses are going to be burnt over their heads , with them in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 9]: What am I to do , my lord ?
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 9]: AM I to have any protection ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 33]: I told you yesterday , sir , ' said the Lord Mayor , ` that you might have an alderman in your house , if you could get one to come . '
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 12]: ` What the devil 's the good of an alderman ? '
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 7]: returned the choleric old gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 14]: -- To awe the crowd , sir , ' said the Lord Mayor .
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 8]: ` Oh Lord ha ' mercy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 29]: whimpered the old gentleman , as he wiped his forehead in a state of ludicrous distress , ` to think of sending an alderman to awe a crowd !
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 30]: Why , my lord , if they were even so many babies , fed on mother 's milk , what do you think they 'd care for an alderman !
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 5]: Will YOU come ? '
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 4]: ` I ! '
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 13]: said the Lord Mayor , most emphatically : ` Certainly not . '
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 17]: ` Then what , ' returned the old gentleman , ` what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 7]: Am I a citizen of England ?
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 10]: Am I to have the benefit of the laws ?
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 14]: Am I to have any return for the King 's taxes ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 26]: I do n't know , I am sure , ' said the Lord Mayor ; ` what a pity it is you 're a Catholic !
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 21]: Why could n't you be a Protestant , and then you would n't have got yourself into such a mess ?
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 13]: I 'm sure I do n't know what 's to be done .
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 12]: -- There are great people at the bottom of these riots .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 16]: -- Oh dear me , what a thing it is to be a public character !
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 13]: -- You must look in again in the course of the day .
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 6]: -- Would a javelin-man do ?
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 57]: -- Or there 's Philips the constable , -- HE 'S disengaged , -- he 's not very old for a man at his time of life , except in his legs , and if you put him up at a window he 'd look quite young by candle-light , and might frighten 'em very much .
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 4]: -- Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 3]: -- well !
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 8]: -- we 'll see about it . '
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 33]: cried Mr Haredale , pressing the door open as the porter strove to shut it , and speaking rapidly , ` My Lord Mayor , I beg you not to go away .
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 14]: I have a man here , who committed a murder eight-and-twenty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 19]: Half-a-dozen words from me , on oath , will justify you in committing him to prison for re-examination .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 17]: I only seek , just now , to have him consigned to a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 13]: The least delay may involve his being rescued by the rioters . '
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 6]: ` Oh dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 5]: cried the Lord Mayor .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 12]: ` God bless my soul -- and body -- oh Lor !
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 4]: -- well I !
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 15]: -- there are great people at the bottom of these riots , you know .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 7]: -- You really must n't . '
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 63]: ` My lord , ' said Mr Haredale , ` the murdered gentleman was my brother ; I succeeded to his inheritance ; there were not wanting slanderous tongues at that time , to whisper that the guilt of this most foul and cruel deed was mine -- mine , who loved him , as he knows , in Heaven , dearly .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 35]: The time has come , after all these years of gloom and misery , for avenging him , and bringing to light a crime so artful and so devilish that it has no parallel .
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 21]: Every second 's delay on your part loosens this man 's bloody hands again , and leads to his escape .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 18]: My lord , I charge you hear me , and despatch this matter on the instant . '
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 6]: ` Oh dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 36]: cried the chief magistrate ; ` these a n't business hours , you know -- I wonder at you -- how ungentlemanly it is of you -- you must n't -- you really must n't .
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 12]: -- And I suppose you are a Catholic too ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 8]: I am , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 27]: ` God bless my soul , I believe people turn Catholics a ` purpose to vex and worrit me , ' cried the Lord Mayor . '
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 28]: I wish you would n't come here ; they 'll be setting the Mansion House afire next , and we shall have you to thank for it .
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 24]: You must lock your prisoner up , sir -- give him to a watchman -- and -- call again at a proper time .
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 8]: Then we 'll see about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 38]: Before Mr Haredale could answer , the sharp closing of a door and drawing of its bolts , gave notice that the Lord Mayor had retreated to his bedroom , and that further remonstrance would be unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 16]: The two clients retreated likewise , and the porter shut them out into the street .
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 26]: ` That 's the way he puts me off , ' said the old gentleman , ' I can get no redress and no help .
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 10]: What are you going to do , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 19]: ` To try elsewhere , ' answered Mr Haredale , who was by this time on horseback . '
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 29]: I feel for you , I assure you -- and well I may , for we are in a common cause , ' said the old gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 19]: I may not have a house to offer you to-night ; let me tender it while I can .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 43]: On second thoughts though , ' he added , putting up a pocket-book he had produced while speaking , ` I 'll not give you a card , for if it was found upon you , it might get you into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 25]: Langdale -- that 's my name -- vintner and distiller -- Holborn Hill -- you 're heartily welcome , if you 'll come . '
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 70]: Mr Haredale bowed , and rode off , close beside the chaise as before ; determining to repair to the house of Sir John Fielding , who had the reputation of being a bold and active magistrate , and fully resolved , in case the rioters should come upon them , to do execution on the murderer with his own hands , rather than suffer him to be released .
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 36]: They arrived at the magistrate 's dwelling , however , without molestation -LRB- for the mob , as we have seen , were then intent on deeper schemes -RRB- , and knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 30]: As it had been pretty generally rumoured that Sir John was proscribed by the rioters , a body of thief-takers had been keeping watch in the house all night .
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 31]: To one of them Mr Haredale stated his business , which appearing to the man of sufficient moment to warrant his arousing the justice , procured him an immediate audience .
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 31]: No time was lost in committing the murderer to Newgate ; then a new building , recently completed at a vast expense , and considered to be of enormous strength .
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 66]: The warrant being made out , three of the thief-takers bound him afresh -LRB- he had been struggling , it seemed , in the chaise , and had loosened his manacles -RRB- ; gagged him lest they should meet with any of the mob , and he should call to them for help ; and seated themselves , along with him , in the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 48]: These men being all well armed , made a formidable escort ; but they drew up the blinds again , as though the carriage were empty , and directed Mr Haredale to ride forward , that he might not attract attention by seeming to belong to it .
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 44]: The wisdom of this proceeding was sufficiently obvious , for as they hurried through the city they passed among several groups of men , who , if they had not supposed the chaise to be quite empty , would certainly have stopped it .
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 44]: But those within keeping quite close , and the driver tarrying to be asked no questions , they reached the prison without interruption , and , once there , had him out , and safe within its gloomy walls , in a twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 22]: With eager eyes and strained attention , Mr Haredale saw him chained , and locked and barred up in his cell .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 62]: Nay , when he had left the jail , and stood in the free street , without , he felt the iron plates upon the doors , with his hands , and drew them over the stone wall , to assure himself that it was real ; and to exult in its being so strong , and rough , and cold .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 69]: It was not until he turned his back upon the jail , and glanced along the empty streets , so lifeless and quiet in the bright morning , that he felt the weight upon his heart ; that he knew he was tortured by anxiety for those he had left at home ; and that home itself was but another bead in the long rosary of his regrets .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 37]: Chapter 62 The prisoner , left to himself , sat down upon his bedstead : and resting his elbows on his knees , and his chin upon his hands , remained in that attitude for hours .
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 14]: It would be hard to say , of what nature his reflections were .
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 33]: They had no distinctness , and , saving for some flashes now and then , no reference to his condition or the train of circumstances by which it had been brought about .
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 101]: The cracks in the pavement of his cell , the chinks in the wall where stone was joined to stone , the bars in the window , the iron ring upon the floor , -- such things as these , subsiding strangely into one another , and awakening an indescribable kind of interest and amusement , engrossed his whole mind ; and although at the bottom of his every thought there was an uneasy sense of guilt , and dread of death , he felt no more than that vague consciousness of it , which a sleeper has of pain .
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 90]: It pursues him through his dreams , gnaws at the heart of all his fancied pleasures , robs the banquet of its taste , music of its sweetness , makes happiness itself unhappy , and yet is no bodily sensation , but a phantom without shape , or form , or visible presence ; pervading everything , but having no existence ; recognisable everywhere , but nowhere seen , or touched , or met with face to face , until the sleep is past , and waking agony returns .
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 11]: After a long time the door of his cell opened .
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 17]: He looked up ; saw the blind man enter ; and relapsed into his former position .
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 40]: Guided by his breathing , the visitor advanced to where he sat ; and stopping beside him , and stretching out his hand to assure himself that he was right , remained , for a good space , silent .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 7]: ` This is bad , Rudge .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 10]: This is bad , ' he said at length .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 22]: The prisoner shuffled with his feet upon the ground in turning his body from him , but made no other answer .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 7]: ` How were you taken ? '
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 4]: ` And where ?
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 10]: You never told me more than half your secret .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 8]: No matter ; I know it now .
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 10]: How was it , and where , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 10]: he asked again , coming still nearer to him .
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 9]: ` At Chigwell , ' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 4]: ` At Chigwell !
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 6]: How came you there ? '
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 17]: ` Because I went there to avoid the man I stumbled on , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 14]: ` Because I was chased and driven there , by him and Fate .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 16]: Because I was urged to go there , by something stronger than my own will .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 28]: When I found him watching in the house she used to live in , night after night , I knew I never could escape him -- never !
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 38]: and when I heard the Bell -- ' He shivered ; muttered that it was very cold ; paced quickly up and down the narrow cell ; and sitting down again , fell into his old posture .
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 33]: ` You were saying , ' said the blind man , after another pause , ` that when you heard the Bell -- ' ` Let it be , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 7]: he retorted in a hurried voice .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 7]: ` It hangs there yet . '
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 23]: The blind man turned a wistful and inquisitive face towards him , but he continued to speak , without noticing him . '
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 11]: I went to Chigwell , in search of the mob .
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 24]: I have been so hunted and beset by this man , that I knew my only hope of safety lay in joining them .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 15]: They had gone on before ; I followed them when it left off . '
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 7]: ` When what left off ? '
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 4]: ` The Bell .
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 6]: They had quitted the place .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 43]: I hoped that some of them might be still lingering among the ruins , and was searching for them when I heard -- ' he drew a long breath , and wiped his forehead with his sleeve -- ` his voice . '
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 5]: ` Saying what ? '
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 5]: ` No matter what .
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 38]: I was then at the foot of the turret , where I did the -- ' ` Ay , ' said the blind man , nodding his head with perfect composure , ' I understand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 22]: I climbed the stair , or so much of it as was left ; meaning to hide till he had gone .
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 19]: But he heard me ; and followed almost as soon as I set foot upon the ashes . '
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 24]: ` You might have hidden in the wall , and thrown him down , or stabbed him , ' said the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 4]: ` Might I ?
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 31]: Between that man and me , was one who led him on -- I saw it , though he did not -- and raised above his head a bloody hand .
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 40]: It was in the room above that HE and I stood glaring at each other on the night of the murder , and before he fell he raised his hand like that , and fixed his eyes on me .
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 9]: I knew the chase would end there . '
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 17]: ` You have a strong fancy , ' said the blind man , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 15]: ` Strengthen yours with blood , and see what it will come to . '
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 28]: He groaned , and rocked himself , and looking up for the first time , said , in a low , hollow voice : ` Eight-and-twenty years !
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 3]: Eight-and-twenty years !
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 20]: He has never changed in all that time , never grown older , nor altered in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 43]: He has been before me in the dark night , and the broad sunny day ; in the twilight , the moonlight , the sunlight , the light of fire , and lamp , and candle ; and in the deepest gloom .
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 4]: Always the same !
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 25]: In company , in solitude , on land , on shipboard ; sometimes leaving me alone for months , and sometimes always with me .
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 65]: I have seen him , at sea , come gliding in the dead of night along the bright reflection of the moon in the calm water ; and I have seen him , on quays and market-places , with his hand uplifted , towering , the centre of a busy crowd , unconscious of the terrible form that had its silent stand among them .
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 2]: Fancy !
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 4]: Are you real ?
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 3]: Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 26]: Are these iron fetters , riveted on me by the smith 's hammer , or are they fancies I can shatter at a blow ? '
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 7]: The blind man listened in silence .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 3]: ` Fancy !
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 8]: Do I fancy that I killed him ?
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 42]: Do I fancy that as I left the chamber where he lay , I saw the face of a man peeping from a dark door , who plainly showed me by his fearful looks that he suspected what I had done ?
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 26]: Do I remember that I spoke fairly to him -- that I drew nearer -- nearer yet -- with the hot knife in my sleeve ?
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 7]: Do I fancy how HE died ?
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 32]: Did he stagger back into the angle of the wall into which I had hemmed him , and , bleeding inwardly , stand , not fail , a corpse before me ?
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 25]: Did I see him , for an instant , as I see you now , erect and on his feet -- but dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 30]: The blind man , who knew that he had risen , motioned him to sit down again upon his bedstead ; but he took no notice of the gesture .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 19]: ` It was then I thought , for the first time , of fastening the murder upon him .
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 22]: It was then I dressed him in my clothes , and dragged him down the back-stairs to the piece of water .
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 18]: Do I remember listening to the bubbles that came rising up when I had rolled him in ?
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 30]: Do I remember wiping the water from my face , and because the body splashed it there , in its descent , feeling as if it MUST be blood ?
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 10]: ` Did I go home when I had done ?
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 6]: And oh , my God !
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 7]: how long it took to do !
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 11]: Did I stand before my wife , and tell her ?
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 48]: Did I see her fall upon the ground ; and , when I stooped to raise her , did she thrust me back with a force that cast me off as if I had been a child , staining the hand with which she clasped my wrist ?
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 4]: Is THAT fancy ?
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 80]: ` Did she go down upon her knees , and call on Heaven to witness that she and her unborn child renounced me from that hour ; and did she , in words so solemn that they turned me cold -- me , fresh from the horrors my own hands had made -- warn me to fly while there was time ; for though she would be silent , being my wretched wife , she would not shelter me ?
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 39]: Did I go forth that night , abjured of God and man , and anchored deep in hell , to wander at my cable 's length about the earth , and surely be drawn down at last ? '
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 6]: ` Why did you return ?
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 5]: said the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 6]: ` Why is blood red ?
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 14]: I could no more help it , than I could live without breath .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 25]: I struggled against the impulse , but I was drawn back , through every difficult and adverse circumstance , as by a mighty engine .
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 5]: Nothing could stop me .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 10]: The day and hour were none of my choice .
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 20]: Sleeping and waking , I had been among the old haunts for years -- had visited my own grave .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 6]: Why did I come back ?
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 17]: Because this jail was gaping for me , and he stood beckoning at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 7]: ` You were not known ? '
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 6]: said the blind man . '
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 11]: I was a man who had been twenty-two years dead .
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 6]: I was not known . '
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 10]: ` You should have kept your secret better . '
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 4]: ` MY secret ?
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 2]: MINE ?
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 15]: It was a secret , any breath of air could whisper at its will .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 26]: The stars had it in their twinkling , the water in its flowing , the leaves in their rustling , the seasons in their return .
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 11]: It lurked in strangers ' faces , and their voices .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 9]: Everything had lips on which it always trembled .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 5]: -- MY secret ! '
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 18]: ` It was revealed by your own act at any rate , ' said the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 7]: ` The act was not mine .
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 10]: I did it , but it was not mine .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 17]: I was forced at times to wander round , and round , and round that spot .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 23]: If you had chained me up when the fit was on me , I should have broken away , and gone there .
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 30]: As truly as the loadstone draws iron towards it , so he , lying at the bottom of his grave , could draw me near him when he would .
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 4]: Was that fancy ?
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 21]: Did I like to go there , or did I strive and wrestle with the power that forced me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 11]: The blind man shrugged his shoulders , and smiled incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 18]: The prisoner again resumed his old attitude , and for a long time both were mute . '
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 63]: I suppose then , ' said his visitor , at length breaking silence , ` that you are penitent and resigned ; that you desire to make peace with everybody -LRB- in particular , with your wife who has brought you to this -RRB- ; and that you ask no greater favour than to be carried to Tyburn as soon as possible ?
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 12]: That being the case , I had better take my leave .
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 12]: I am not good enough to be company for you . '
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 28]: ` Have I not told you , ' said the other fiercely , ` that I have striven and wrestled with the power that brought me here ?
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 28]: Has my whole life , for eight-and-twenty years , been one perpetual struggle and resistance , and do you think I want to lie down and die ?
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 13]: Do all men shrink from death -- I most of all ! '
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 6]: ` That 's better said .
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 41]: That 's better spoken , Rudge -- but I 'll not call you that again -- than anything you have said yet , ' returned the blind man , speaking more familiarly , and laying his hands upon his arm .
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 27]: ` Lookye , -- I never killed a man myself , for I have never been placed in a position that made it worth my while .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 34]: Farther , I am not an advocate for killing men , and I do n't think I should recommend it or like it -- for it 's very hazardous -- under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 57]: But as you had the misfortune to get into this trouble before I made your acquaintance , and as you have been my companion , and have been of use to me for a long time now , I overlook that part of the matter , and am only anxious that you should n't die unnecessarily .
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 18]: Now , I do not consider that , at present , it is at all necessary . '
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 8]: ` What else is left me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 4]: returned the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 13]: ` To eat my way through these walls with my teeth ? '
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 11]: ` Something easier than that , ' returned his friend .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 35]: ` Promise me that you will talk no more of these fancies of yours -- idle , foolish things , quite beneath a man -- and I 'll tell you what I mean . '
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 9]: ` Tell me , ' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 29]: ` Your worthy lady with the tender conscience ; your scrupulous , virtuous , punctilious , but not blindly affectionate wife -- ' ` What of her ? '
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 8]: ` Is now in London . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 12]: A curse upon her , be she where she may ! '
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 6]: ` That 's natural enough .
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 24]: If she had taken her annuity as usual , you would not have been here , and we should have been better off .
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 8]: But that 's apart from the business .
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 5]: She 's in London .
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 64]: Scared , as I suppose , and have no doubt , by my representation when I waited upon her , that you were close at hand -LRB- which I , of course , urged only as an inducement to compliance , knowing that she was not pining to see you -RRB- , she left that place , and travelled up to London . '
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 7]: ` How do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 18]: ` From my friend the noble captain -- the illustrious general -- the bladder , Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 35]: I learnt from him the last time I saw him , which was yesterday , that your son who is called Barnaby -- not after his father , I suppose -- ' ` Death !
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 7]: does that matter now ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 59]: -- You are impatient , ' said the blind man , calmly ; ` it 's a good sign , and looks like life -- that your son Barnaby had been lured away from her by one of his companions who knew him of old , at Chigwell ; and that he is now among the rioters . '
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 8]: ` And what is that to me ?
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 17]: If father and son be hanged together , what comfort shall I find in that ? '
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 28]: ` Stay -- stay , my friend , ' returned the blind man , with a cunning look , ` you travel fast to journeys ' ends .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 22]: Suppose I track my lady out , and say thus much : `` You want your son , ma'am -- good .
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 22]: I , knowing those who tempt him to remain among them , can restore him to you , ma'am -- good .
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 15]: You must pay a price , ma'am , for his restoration -- good again .
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 22]: The price is small , and easy to be paid -- dear ma'am , that 's best of all . '' '
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 7]: ` What mockery is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 11]: ` Very likely , she may reply in those words .
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 49]: `` No mockery at all , '' I answer : `` Madam , a person said to be your husband -LRB- identity is difficult of proof after the lapse of many years -RRB- is in prison , his life in peril -- the charge against him , murder .
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 15]: Now , ma'am , your husband has been dead a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 56]: The gentleman never can be confounded with him , if you will have the goodness to say a few words , on oath , as to when he died , and how ; and that this person -LRB- who I am told resembles him in some degree -RRB- is no more he than I am .
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 10]: Such testimony will set the question quite at rest .
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 51]: Pledge yourself to me to give it , ma ' am , and I will undertake to keep your son -LRB- a fine lad -RRB- out of harm 's way until you have done this trifling service , when he shall he delivered up to you , safe and sound .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 35]: On the other hand , if you decline to do so , I fear he will be betrayed , and handed over to the law , which will assuredly sentence him to suffer death .
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 14]: It is , in fact , a choice between his life and death .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 7]: If you refuse , he swings .
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 24]: If you comply , the timber is not grown , nor the hemp sown , that shall do him any harm . '' '
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 11]: ` There is a gleam of hope in this ! '
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 5]: cried the prisoner . '
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 4]: A gleam ! '
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 14]: returned his friend , ' a noon-blaze ; a full and glorious daylight .
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 8]: I hear the tread of distant feet .
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 5]: Rely on me . '
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 8]: ` When shall I hear more ? '
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 7]: ` As soon as I do .
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 6]: I should hope , to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 13]: They are coming to say that our time for talk is over .
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 8]: I hear the jingling of the keys .
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 15]: Not another word of this just now , or they may overhear us . '
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 34]: As he said these words , the lock was turned , and one of the prison turnkeys appearing at the door , announced that it was time for visitors to leave the jail .
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 5]: ` So soon ! '
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 5]: said Stagg , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 8]: ` But it ca n't be helped .
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 5]: Cheer up , friend .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 17]: This mistake will soon be set at rest , and then you are a man again !
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 39]: If this charitable gentleman will lead a blind man -LRB- who has nothing in return but prayers -RRB- to the prison-porch , and set him with his face towards the west , he will do a worthy deed .
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 6]: Thank you , good sir .
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 7]: I thank you very kindly . '
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 23]: So saying , and pausing for an instant at the door to turn his grinning face towards his friend , he departed .
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 53]: When the officer had seen him to the porch , he returned , and again unlocking and unbarring the door of the cell , set it wide open , informing its inmate that he was at liberty to walk in the adjacent yard , if he thought proper , for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 64]: The prisoner answered with a sullen nod ; and being left alone again , sat brooding over what he had heard , and pondering upon the hopes the recent conversation had awakened ; gazing abstractedly , the while he did so , on the light without , and watching the shadows thrown by one wall on another , and on the stone-paved ground .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 24]: It was a dull , square yard , made cold and gloomy by high walls , and seeming to chill the very sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 33]: The stone , so bare , and rough , and obdurate , filled even him with longing thoughts of meadow-land and trees ; and with a burning wish to be at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 30]: As he looked , he rose , and leaning against the door-post , gazed up at the bright blue sky , smiling even on that dreary home of crime .
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 29]: He seemed , for a moment , to remember lying on his back in some sweet-scented place , and gazing at it through moving branches , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 32]: His attention was suddenly attracted by a clanking sound -- he knew what it was , for he had startled himself by making the same noise in walking to the door .
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 19]: Presently a voice began to sing , and he saw the shadow of a figure on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 39]: It stopped -- was silent all at once , as though the person for a moment had forgotten where he was , but soon remembered -- and so , with the same clanking noise , the shadow disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 29]: He walked out into the court and paced it to and fro ; startling the echoes , as he went , with the harsh jangling of his fetters .
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 15]: There was a door near his , which , like his , stood ajar .
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 28]: He had not taken half-a-dozen turns up and down the yard , when , standing still to observe this door , he heard the clanking sound again .
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 39]: A face looked out of the grated window -- he saw it very dimly , for the cell was dark and the bars were heavy -- and directly afterwards , a man appeared , and came towards him .
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 17]: For the sense of loneliness he had , he might have been in jail a year .
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 26]: Made eager by the hope of companionship , he quickened his pace , and hastened to meet the man half way -- What was this !
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 3]: His son !
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 11]: They stood face to face , staring at each other .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 25]: He shrinking and cowed , despite himself ; Barnahy struggling with his imperfect memory , and wondering where he had seen that face before .
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 28]: He was not uncertain long , for suddenly he laid hands upon him , and striving to bear him to the ground , cried : ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 6]: You are the robber ! '
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 20]: He said nothing in reply at first , but held down his head , and struggled with him silently .
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 30]: Finding the younger man too strong for him , he raised his face , looked close into his eyes , and said , ' I am your father . '
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 26]: God knows what magic the name had for his ears ; but Barnaby released his hold , fell back , and looked at him aghast .
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 21]: Suddenly he sprung towards him , put his arms about his neck , and pressed his head against his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 13]: Yes , yes , he was ; he was sure he was .
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 30]: But where had he been so long , and why had he left his mother by herself , or worse than by herself , with her poor foolish boy ?
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 11]: And had she really been as happy as they said ?
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 5]: And where was she ?
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 5]: Was she near there ?
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 11]: She was not happy now , and he in jail ?
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 4]: Ah , no .
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 39]: Not a word was said in answer ; but Grip croaked loudly , and hopped about them , round and round , as if enclosing them in a magic circle , and invoking all the powers of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 62]: Chapter 63 During the whole of this day , every regiment in or near the metropolis was on duty in one or other part of the town ; and the regulars and militia , in obedience to the orders which were sent to every barrack and station within twenty-four hours ' journey , began to pour in by all the roads .
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 86]: But the disturbance had attained to such a formidable height , and the rioters had grown , with impunity , to be so audacious , that the sight of this great force , continually augmented by new arrivals , instead of operating as a check , stimulated them to outrages of greater hardihood than any they had yet committed ; and helped to kindle a flame in London , the like of which had never been beheld , even in its ancient and rebellious times .
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 41]: All yesterday , and on this day likewise , the commander-in-chief endeavoured to arouse the magistrates to a sense of their duty , and in particular the Lord Mayor , who was the faintest-hearted and most timid of them all .
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 72]: With this object , large bodies of the soldiery were several times despatched to the Mansion House to await his orders : but as he could , by no threats or persuasions , be induced to give any , and as the men remained in the open street , fruitlessly for any good purpose , and thrivingly for a very bad one ; these laudable attempts did harm rather than good .
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 54]: For the crowd , becoming speedily acquainted with the Lord Mayor 's temper , did not fail to take advantage of it by boasting that even the civil authorities were opposed to the Papists , and could not find it in their hearts to molest those who were guilty of no other offence .
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 68]: These vaunts they took care to make within the hearing of the soldiers ; and they , being naturally loth to quarrel with the people , received their advances kindly enough : answering , when they were asked if they desired to fire upon their countrymen , ` No , they would be damned if they did ; ' and showing much honest simplicity and good nature .
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 27]: The feeling that the military were No-Popery men , and were ripe for disobeying orders and joining the mob , soon became very prevalent in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 63]: Rumours of their disaffection , and of their leaning towards the popular cause , spread from mouth to mouth with astonishing rapidity ; and whenever they were drawn up idly in the streets or squares , there was sure to be a crowd about them , cheering and shaking hands , and treating them with a great show of confidence and affection .
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 24]: By this time , the crowd was everywhere ; all concealment and disguise were laid aside , and they pervaded the whole town .
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 42]: If any man among them wanted money , he had but to knock at the door of a dwelling-house , or walk into a shop , and demand it in the rioters name ; and his demand was instantly complied with .
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 34]: The peaceable citizens being afraid to lay hands upon them , singly and alone , it may be easily supposed that when gathered together in bodies , they were perfectly secure from interruption .
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 20]: They assembled in the streets , traversed them at their will and pleasure , and publicly concerted their plans .
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 61]: Business was quite suspended ; the greater part of the shops were closed ; most of the houses displayed a blue flag in token of their adherence to the popular side ; and even the Jews in Houndsditch , Whitechapel , and those quarters , wrote upon their doors or window-shutters , ` This House is a True Protestant . '
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 21]: The crowd was the law , and never was the law held in greater dread , or more implicitly obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 38]: It was about six o'clock in the evening , when a vast mob poured into Lincoln 's Inn Fields by every avenue , and divided -- evidently in pursuance of a previous design -- into several parties .
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 78]: It must not be understood that this arrangement was known to the whole crowd , but that it was the work of a few leaders ; who , mingling with the men as they came upon the ground , and calling to them to fall into this or that parry , effected it as rapidly as if it had been determined on by a council of the whole number , and every man had known his place .
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 28]: It was perfectly notorious to the assemblage that the largest body , which comprehended about two-thirds of the whole , was designed for the attack on Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 58]: It comprehended all the rioters who had been conspicuous in any of their former proceedings ; all those whom they recommended as daring hands and fit for the work ; all those whose companions had been taken in the riots ; and a great number of people who were relatives or friends of felons in the jail .
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 24]: This last class included , not only the most desperate and utterly abandoned villains in London , but some who were comparatively innocent .
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 25]: There was more than one woman there , disguised in man 's attire , and bent upon the rescue of a child or brother .
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 33]: There were the two sons of a man who lay under sentence of death , and who was to be executed along with three others , on the next day but one .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 65]: There was a great parry of boys whose fellow-pickpockets were in the prison ; and at the skirts of all , a score of miserable women , outcasts from the world , seeking to release some other fallen creature as miserable as themselves , or moved by a general sympathy perhaps -- God knows -- with all who were without hope , and wretched .
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 90]: Old swords , and pistols without ball or powder ; sledge-hammers , knives , axes , saws , and weapons pillaged from the butchers ' shops ; a forest of iron bars and wooden clubs ; long ladders for scaling the walls , each carried on the shoulders of a dozen men ; lighted torches ; tow smeared with pitch , and tar , and brimstone ; staves roughly plucked from fence and paling ; and even crutches taken from crippled beggars in the streets ; composed their arms .
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 19]: When all was ready , Hugh and Dennis , with Simon Tappertit between them , led the way .
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 14]: Roaring and chafing like an angry sea , the crowd pressed after them .
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 40]: Instead of going straight down Holborn to the jail , as all expected , their leaders took the way to Clerkenwell , and pouring down a quiet street , halted before a locksmith 's house -- the Golden Key .
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 15]: ` Beat at the door , ' cried Hugh to the men about him .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 9]: ` We want one of his craft to-night .
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 10]: Beat it in , if no one answers . '
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 5]: The shop was shut .
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 18]: Both door and shutters were of a strong and sturdy kind , and they knocked without effect .
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 16]: But the impatient crowd raising a cry of ` Set fire to the house ! '
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 24]: and torches being passed to the front , an upper window was thrown open , and the stout old locksmith stood before them .
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 8]: ` What now , you villains ! '
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 7]: ` Where is my daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 34]: ` Ask no questions of us , old man , ' retorted Hugh , waving his comrades to be silent , ` but come down , and bring the tools of your trade .
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 5]: We want you . '
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 5]: ` Want me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 36]: cried the locksmith , glancing at the regimental dress he wore : ` Ay , and if some that I could name possessed the hearts of mice , ye should have had me long ago .
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 14]: Mark me , my lad -- and you about him do the same .
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 21]: There are a score among ye whom I see now and know , who are dead men from this hour .
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 2]: Begone !
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 9]: and rob an undertaker 's while you can !
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 9]: You 'll want some coffins before long . '
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 7]: ` Will you come down ? '
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 11]: ` Will you give me my daughter , ruffian ? '
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 5]: cried the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 10]: I know nothing of her , ' Hugh rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 6]: ` Burn the door ! '
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 21]: cried the locksmith , in a voice that made them falter -- presenting , as he spoke , a gun .
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 8]: ` Let an old man do that .
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 7]: You can spare him better . '
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 27]: The young fellow who held the light , and who was stooping down before the door , rose hastily at these words , and fell back .
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 22]: The locksmith ran his eye along the upturned faces , and kept the weapon levelled at the threshold of his house .
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 18]: It had no other rest than his shoulder , but was as steady as the house itself .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 25]: ` Let the man who does it , take heed to his prayers , ' he said firmly ; ' I warn him . '
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 42]: Snatching a torch from one who stood near him , Hugh was stepping forward with an oath , when he was arrested by a shrill and piercing shriek , and , looking upward , saw a fluttering garment on the house-top .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 21]: There was another shriek , and another , and then a shrill voice cried , ` Is Simmun below ! '
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 35]: At the same moment a lean neck was stretched over the parapet , and Miss Miggs , indistinctly seen in the gathering gloom of evening , screeched in a frenzied manner , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 14]: dear gentlemen , let me hear Simmuns 's answer from his own lips .
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 6]: Speak to me , Simmun .
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 5]: Speak to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 45]: Mr Tappertit , who was not at all flattered by this compliment , looked up , and bidding her hold her peace , ordered her to come down and open the door , for they wanted her master , and would take no denial .
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 6]: ` Oh good gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 4]: cried Miss Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 19]: ` Oh my own precious , precious Simmun -- ' ` Hold your nonsense , will you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 13]: retorted Mr Tappertit ; ` and come down and open the door .
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 17]: -- G. Varden , drop that gun , or it will be worse for you . '
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 11]: ` Do n't mind his gun , ' screamed Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 17]: ` Simmun and gentlemen , I poured a mug of table-beer right down the barrel . '
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 16]: The crowd gave a loud shout , which was followed by a roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 23]: ` It would n't go off , not if you was to load it up to the muzzle , ' screamed Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 86]: ` Simmun and gentlemen , I 'm locked up in the front attic , through the little door on the right hand when you think you 've got to the very top of the stairs -- and up the flight of corner steps , being careful not to knock your heads against the rafters , and not to tread on one side in case you should fall into the two-pair bedroom through the lath and plasture , which do not bear , but the contrairy .
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 56]: Simmun and gentlemen , I 've been locked up here for safety , but my endeavours has always been , and always will be , to be on the right side -- the blessed side and to prenounce the Pope of Babylon , and all her inward and her outward workings , which is Pagin .
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 55]: My sentiments is of little consequences , I know , ' cried Miggs , with additional shrillness , ` for my positions is but a servant , and as sich , of humilities , still I gives expressions to my feelings , and places my reliances on them which entertains my own opinions ! '
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 64]: Without taking much notice of these outpourings of Miss Miggs after she had made her first announcement in relation to the gun , the crowd raised a ladder against the window where the locksmith stood , and notwithstanding that he closed , and fastened , and defended it manfully , soon forced an entrance by shivering the glass and breaking in the frames .
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 41]: After dealing a few stout blows about him , he found himself defenceless , in the midst of a furious crowd , which overflowed the room and softened off in a confused heap of faces at the door and window .
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 35]: They were very wrathful with him -LRB- for he had wounded two men -RRB- , and even called out to those in front , to bring him forth and hang him on a lamp-post .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 28]: But Gabriel was quite undaunted , and looked from Hugh and Dennis , who held him by either arm , to Simon Tappertit , who confronted him .
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 36]: ` You have robbed me of my daughter , ' said the locksmith , ` who is far dearer to me than my life ; and you may take my life , if you will .
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 37]: I bless God that I have been enabled to keep my wife free of this scene ; and that He has made me a man who will not ask mercy at such hands as yours . '
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 26]: ` And a wery game old gentleman you are , ' said Mr Dennis , approvingly ; ` and you express yourself like a man .
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 25]: What 's the odds , brother , whether it 's a lamp-post to-night , or a feather-bed ten year to come , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 13]: The locksmith glanced at him disdainfully , but returned no other answer .
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 23]: ` For my part , ' said the hangman , who particularly favoured the lamp-post suggestion , ' I honour your principles .
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 5]: They 're mine exactly .
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 29]: In such sentiments as them , ' and here he emphasised his discourse with an oath , ` I 'm ready to meet you or any man halfway .
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 11]: -- Have you got a bit of cord anywheres handy ?
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 14]: Do n't put yourself out of the way , if you have n't .
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 6]: A handkecher will do . '
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 28]: ` Do n't be a fool , master , ' whispered Hugh , seizing Varden roughly by the shoulder ; ` but do as you 're bid .
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 10]: You 'll soon hear what you 're wanted for .
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 4]: Do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 21]: ` I 'll do nothing at your request , or that of any scoundrel here , ' returned the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 22]: ` If you want any service from me , you may spare yourselves the pains of telling me what it is .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 14]: I tell you , beforehand , I 'll do nothing for you . '
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 55]: Mr Dennis was so affected by this constancy on the part of the staunch old man , that he protested -- almost with tears in his eyes -- that to baulk his inclinations would be an act of cruelty and hard dealing to which he , for one , never could reconcile his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 43]: The gentleman , he said , had avowed in so many words that he was ready for working off ; such being the case , he considered it their duty , as a civilised and enlightened crowd , to work him off .
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 32]: It was not often , he observed , that they had it in their power to accommodate themselves to the wishes of those from whom they had the misfortune to differ .
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 51]: Having now found an individual who expressed a desire which they could reasonably indulge -LRB- and for himself he was free to confess that in his opinion that desire did honour to his feelings -RRB- , he hoped they would decide to accede to his proposition before going any further .
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 82]: It was an experiment which , skilfully and dexterously performed , would be over in five minutes , with great comfort and satisfaction to all parties ; and though it did not become him -LRB- Mr Dennis -RRB- to speak well of himself he trusted he might be allowed to say that he had practical knowledge of the subject , and , being naturally of an obliging and friendly disposition , would work the gentleman off with a deal of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 49]: These remarks , which were addressed in the midst of a frightful din and turmoil to those immediately about him , were received with great favour ; not so much , perhaps , because of the hangman 's eloquence , as on account of the locksmith 's obstinacy .
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 39]: Gabriel was in imminent peril , and he knew it ; but he preserved a steady silence ; and would have done so , if they had been debating whether they should roast him at a slow fire .
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 64]: As the hangman spoke , there was some stir and confusion on the ladder ; and directly he was silent -- so immediately upon his holding his peace , that the crowd below had no time to learn what he had been saying , or to shout in response -- some one at the window cried : ` He has a grey head .
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 12]: He is an old man : Do n't hurt him ! '
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 36]: The locksmith turned , with a start , towards the place from which the words had come , and looked hurriedly at the people who were hanging on the ladder and clinging to each other .
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 27]: ` Pay no respect to my grey hair , young man , ' he said , answering the voice and not any one he saw . '
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 6]: I do n't ask it .
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 22]: My heart is green enough to scorn and despise every man among you , band of robbers that you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 15]: This incautious speech by no means tended to appease the ferocity of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 40]: They cried again to have him brought out ; and it would have gone hard with the honest locksmith , but that Hugh reminded them , in answer , that they wanted his services , and must have them .
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 20]: ` So , tell him what we want , ' he said to Simon Tappertit , ` and quickly .
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 17]: And open your ears , master , if you would ever use them after to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 20]: Gabriel folded his arms , which were now at liberty , and eyed his old ` prentice in silence .
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 18]: ` Lookye , Varden , ' said Sim , ` we 're bound for Newgate . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 10]: I know you are , ' returned the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 11]: ` You never said a truer word than that . '
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 26]: ` To burn it down , I mean , ' said Simon , ` and force the gates , and set the prisoners at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 13]: You helped to make the lock of the great door . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 8]: I did , ' said the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 17]: ` You owe me no thanks for that -- as you 'll find before long . '
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 20]: ` Maybe , ' returned his journeyman , ` but you must show us how to force it . '
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 5]: ` Must I ! '
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 12]: ` Yes ; for you know , and I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 16]: You must come along with us , and pick it with your own hands . '
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 37]: ` When I do , ' said the locksmith quietly , ` my hands shall drop off at the wrists , and you shall wear them , Simon Tappertit , on your shoulders for epaulettes . '
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 22]: ` We 'll see that , ' cried Hugh , interposing , as the indignation of the crowd again burst forth .
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 18]: ` You fill a basket with the tools he 'll want , while I bring him downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 9]: Open the doors below , some of you .
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 8]: And light the great captain , others !
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 20]: Is there no business afoot , my lads , that you can do nothing but stand and grumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 38]: They looked at one another , and quickly dispersing , swarmed over the house , plundering and breaking , according to their custom , and carrying off such articles of value as happened to please their fancy .
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 27]: They had no great length of time for these proceedings , for the basket of tools was soon prepared and slung over a man 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 30]: The preparations being now completed , and everything ready for the attack , those who were pillaging and destroying in the other rooms were called down to the workshop .
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 53]: They were about to issue forth , when the man who had been last upstairs , stepped forward , and asked if the young woman in the garret -LRB- who was making a terrible noise , he said , and kept on screaming without the least cessation -RRB- was to be released ?
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 54]: For his own part , Simon Tappertit would certainly have replied in the negative , but the mass of his companions , mindful of the good service she had done in the matter of the gun , being of a different opinion , he had nothing for it but to answer , Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 31]: The man , accordingly , went back again to the rescue , and presently returned with Miss Miggs , limp and doubled up , and very damp from much weeping .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 90]: As the young lady had given no tokens of consciousness on their way downstairs , the bearer reported her either dead or dying ; and being at some loss what to do with her , was looking round for a convenient bench or heap of ashes on which to place her senseless form , when she suddenly came upon her feet by some mysterious means , thrust back her hair , stared wildly at Mr Tappertit , cried , ` My Simmuns 's life is not a wictim ! '
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 22]: and dropped into his arms with such promptitude that he staggered and reeled some paces back , beneath his lovely burden .
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 5]: ` Oh bother ! '
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 4]: said Mr Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 3]: ` Here .
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 7]: Catch hold of her , somebody .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 15]: Lock her up again ; she never ought to have been let out . '
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 5]: ` My Simmun ! '
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 10]: cried Miss Miggs , in tears , and faintly .
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 10]: ` My for ever , ever blessed Simmun ! '
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 29]: ` Hold up , will you , ' said Mr Tappertit , in a very unresponsive tone , ` I 'll let you fall if you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 12]: What are you sliding your feet off the ground for ? '
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 6]: ` My angel Simmuns ! '
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 11]: murmured Miggs -- ` he promised -- ' ` Promised !
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 16]: Well , and I 'll keep my promise , ' answered Simon , testily . '
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 11]: I mean to provide for you , do n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 4]: Stand up ! '
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 7]: ` Where am I to go ?
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 14]: What is to become of me after my actions of this night ! '
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 3]: cried Miggs .
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 13]: ` What resting-places now remains but in the silent tombses ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 29]: I wish you was in the silent tombses , I do , ' cried Mr Tappertit , ` and boxed up tight , in a good strong one .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 28]: Here , ' he cried to one of the bystanders , in whose ear he whispered for a moment : ` Take her off , will you .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 5]: You understand where ? '
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 41]: The fellow nodded ; and taking her in his arms , notwithstanding her broken protestations , and her struggles -LRB- which latter species of opposition , involving scratches , was much more difficult of resistance -RRB- , carried her away .
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 64]: They who were in the house poured out into the street ; the locksmith was taken to the head of the crowd , and required to walk between his two conductors ; the whole body was put in rapid motion ; and without any shouts or noise they bore down straight on Newgate , and halted in a dense mass before the prison-gate .
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 33]: Chapter 64 Breaking the silence they had hitherto preserved , they raised a great cry as soon as they were ranged before the jail , and demanded to speak to the governor .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 42]: This visit was not wholly unexpected , for his house , which fronted the street , was strongly barricaded , the wicket-gate of the prison was closed up , and at no loophole or grating was any person to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 29]: Before they had repeated their summons many times , a man appeared upon the roof of the governor 's house , and asked what it was they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 15]: Some said one thing , some another , and some only groaned and hissed .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 43]: It being now nearly dark , and the house high , many persons in the throng were not aware that any one had come to answer them , and continued their clamour until the intelligence was gradually diffused through the whole concourse .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 37]: Ten minutes or more elapsed before any one voice could be heard with tolerable distinctness ; during which interval the figure remained perched alone , against the summer-evening sky , looking down into the troubled street .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 20]: ` Are you , ' said Hugh at length , ` Mr Akerman , the head jailer here ? '
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 12]: ` Of course he is , brother , ' whispered Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 15]: But Hugh , without minding him , took his answer from the man himself .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 4]: I am . '
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 16]: ` You have got some friends of ours in your custody , master . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 11]: I have a good many people in my custody . '
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 53]: He glanced downward , as he spoke , into the jail : and the feeling that he could see into the different yards , and that he overlooked everything which was hidden from their view by the rugged walls , so lashed and goaded the mob , that they howled like wolves .
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 19]: ` Deliver up our friends , ' said Hugh , ` and you may keep the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 10]: ` It 's my duty to keep them all .
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 7]: I shall do my duty . '
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 30]: ` If you do n't throw the doors open , we shall break 'em down , ' said Hugh ; ` for we will have the rioters out . '
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 55]: ` All I can do , good people , ' Akerman replied , ` is to exhort you to disperse ; and to remind you that the consequences of any disturbance in this place , will be very severe , and bitterly repented by most of you , when it is too late . '
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 24]: He made as though he would retire when he said these words , but he was checked by the voice of the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 14]: ` Mr Akerman , ' cried Gabriel , ` Mr Akerman . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 25]: I will hear no more from any of you , ' replied the governor , turning towards the speaker , and waving his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 14]: ` But I am not one of them , ' said Gabriel . '
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 19]: I am an honest man , Mr Akerman ; a respectable tradesman -- Gabriel Varden , the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 5]: You know me ? '
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 7]: ` You among the crowd ! '
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 8]: cried the governor in an altered voice .
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 24]: ` Brought here by force -- brought here to pick the lock of the great door for them , ' rejoined the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 31]: ` Bear witness for me , Mr Akerman , that I refuse to do it ; and that I will not do it , come what may of my refusal .
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 14]: If any violence is done to me , please to remember this . '
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 11]: ` Is there no way -LRB- if helping you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 4]: said the governor .
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 6]: ` None , Mr Akerman .
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 12]: You 'll do your duty , and I 'll do mine .
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 22]: Once again , you robbers and cut-throats , ' said the locksmith , turning round upon them , ' I refuse .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 6]: Howl till you 're hoarse .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 4]: I refuse . '
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 6]: ` Stay -- stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 6]: said the jailer , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 99]: ` Mr Varden , I know you for a worthy man , and one who would do no unlawful act except upon compulsion -- ' ` Upon compulsion , sir , ' interposed the locksmith , who felt that the tone in which this was said , conveyed the speaker 's impression that he had ample excuse for yielding to the furious multitude who beset and hemmed him in , on every side , and among whom he stood , an old man , quite alone ; ` upon compulsion , sir , I 'll do nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 22]: ` Where is that man , ' said the keeper , anxiously , ` who spoke to me just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 4]: ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 3]: Hugh replied .
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 27]: ` Do you know what the guilt of murder is , and that by keeping that honest tradesman at your side you endanger his life ! '
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 21]: ` We know it very well , ' he answered , ` for what else did we bring him here ?
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 15]: Let 's have our friends , master , and you shall have your friend .
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 7]: Is that fair , lads ? '
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 10]: The mob replied to him with a loud Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 10]: ` You see how it is , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 3]: cried Varden .
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 11]: ` Keep 'em out , in King George 's name .
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 6]: Remember what I have said .
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 6]: There was no more parley .
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 38]: A shower of stones and other missiles compelled the keeper of the jail to retire ; and the mob , pressing on , and swarming round the walls , forced Gabriel Varden close up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 49]: In vain the basket of tools was laid upon the ground before him , and he was urged in turn by promises , by blows , by offers of reward , and threats of instant death , to do the office for which they had brought him there .
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 15]: ` No , ' cried the sturdy locksmith , ' I will not ! '
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 17]: He had never loved his life so well as then , but nothing could move him .
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 72]: The savage faces that glared upon him , look where he would ; the cries of those who thirsted , like wild animals , for his blood ; the sight of men pressing forward , and trampling down their fellows , as they strove to reach him , and struck at him above the heads of other men , with axes and with iron bars ; all failed to daunt him .
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 31]: He looked from man to man , and face to face , and still , with quickened breath and lessening colour , cried firmly , ' I will not ! '
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 15]: Dennis dealt him a blow upon the face which felled him to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 26]: He sprung up again like a man in the prime of life , and with blood upon his forehead , caught him by the throat .
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 6]: ` You cowardly dog ! '
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 9]: he said : ` Give me my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 6]: Give me my daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 4]: They struggled together .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 24]: Some cried ` Kill him , ' and some -LRB- but they were not near enough -RRB- strove to trample him to death .
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 22]: Tug as he would at the old man 's wrists , the hangman could not force him to unclench his hands .
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 15]: ` Is this all the return you make me , you ungrateful monster ? '
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 11]: he articulated with great difficulty , and with many oaths .
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 7]: ` Give me my daughter ! '
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 23]: cried the locksmith , who was now as fierce as those who gathered round him : ` Give me my daughter ! '
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 71]: He was down again , and up , and down once more , and buffeting with a score of them , who bandied him from hand to hand , when one tall fellow , fresh from a slaughter-house , whose dress and great thigh-boots smoked hot with grease and blood , raised a pole-axe , and swearing a horrible oath , aimed it at the old man 's uncovered head .
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 35]: At that instant , and in the very act , he fell himself , as if struck by lightning , and over his body a one-armed man came darting to the locksmith 's side .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 16]: Another man was with him , and both caught the locksmith roughly in their grasp .
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 7]: ` Leave him to us ! '
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 20]: they cried to Hugh -- struggling , as they spoke , to force a passage backward through the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 6]: ` Leave him to us .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 25]: Why do you waste your whole strength on such as he , when a couple of men can finish him in as many minutes !
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 4]: You lose time .
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 4]: Remember the prisoners !
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 4]: remember Barnaby ! '
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 7]: The cry ran through the mob .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 24]: Hammers began to rattle on the walls ; and every man strove to reach the prison , and be among the foremost rank .
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 47]: Fighting their way through the press and struggle , as desperately as if they were in the midst of enemies rather than their own friends , the two men retreated with the locksmith between them , and dragged him through the very heart of the concourse .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 76]: And now the strokes began to fall like hail upon the gate , and on the strong building ; for those who could not reach the door , spent their fierce rage on anything -- even on the great blocks of stone , which shivered their weapons into fragments , and made their hands and arms to tingle as if the walls were active in their stout resistance , and dealt them back their blows .
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 92]: The clash of iron ringing upon iron , mingled with the deafening tumult and sounded high above it , as the great sledge-hammers rattled on the nailed and plated door : the sparks flew off in showers ; men worked in gangs , and at short intervals relieved each other , that all their strength might be devoted to the work ; but there stood the portal still , as grim and dark and strong as ever , and , saving for the dints upon its battered surface , quite unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 104]: While some brought all their energies to bear upon this toilsome task ; and some , rearing ladders against the prison , tried to clamber to the summit of the walls they were too short to scale ; and some again engaged a body of police a hundred strong , and beat them back and trod them under foot by force of numbers ; others besieged the house on which the jailer had appeared , and driving in the door , brought out his furniture , and piled it up against the prison-gate , to make a bonfire which should burn it down .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 53]: As soon as this device was understood , all those who had laboured hitherto , cast down their tools and helped to swell the heap ; which reached half-way across the street , and was so high , that those who threw more fuel on the top , got up by ladders .
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 40]: When all the keeper 's goods were flung upon this costly pile , to the last fragment , they smeared it with the pitch , and tar , and rosin they had brought , and sprinkled it with turpentine .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 20]: To all the woodwork round the prison-doors they did the like , leaving not a joist or beam untouched .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 26]: This infernal christening performed , they fired the pile with lighted matches and with blazing tow , and then stood by , awaiting the result .
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 27]: The furniture being very dry , and rendered more combustible by wax and oil , besides the arts they had used , took fire at once .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 21]: The flames roared high and fiercely , blackening the prison-wall , and twining up its loftly front like burning serpents .
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 297]: At first they crowded round the blaze , and vented their exultation only in their looks : but when it grew hotter and fiercer -- when it crackled , leaped , and roared , like a great furnace -- when it shone upon the opposite houses , and lighted up not only the pale and wondering faces at the windows , but the inmost corners of each habitation -- when through the deep red heat and glow , the fire was seen sporting and toying with the door , now clinging to its obdurate surface , now gliding off with fierce inconstancy and soaring high into the sky , anon returning to fold it in its burning grasp and lure it to its ruin -- when it shone and gleamed so brightly that the church clock of St Sepulchre 's so often pointing to the hour of death , was legible as in broad day , and the vane upon its steeple-top glittered in the unwonted light like something richly jewelled -- when blackened stone and sombre brick grew ruddy in the deep reflection , and windows shone like burnished gold , dotting the longest distance in the fiery vista with their specks of brightness -- when wall and tower , and roof and chimney-stack , seemed drunk , and in the flickering glare appeared to reel and stagger -- when scores of objects , never seen before , burst out upon the view , and things the most familiar put on some new aspect -- then the mob began to join the whirl , and with loud yells , and shouts , and clamour , such as happily is seldom heard , bestirred themselves to feed the fire , and keep it at its height .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 107]: Although the heat was so intense that the paint on the houses over against the prison , parched and crackled up , and swelling into boils , as it were from excess of torture , broke and crumbled away ; although the glass fell from the window-sashes , and the lead and iron on the roofs blistered the incautious hand that touched them , and the sparrows in the eaves took wing , and rendered giddy by the smoke , fell fluttering down upon the blazing pile ; still the fire was tended unceasingly by busy hands , and round it , men were going always .
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 65]: They never slackened in their zeal , or kept aloof , but pressed upon the flames so hard , that those in front had much ado to save themselves from being thrust in ; if one man swooned or dropped , a dozen struggled for his place , and that although they knew the pain , and thirst , and pressure to be unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 89]: Those who fell down in fainting-fits , and were not crushed or burnt , were carried to an inn-yard close at hand , and dashed with water from a pump ; of which buckets full were passed from man to man among the crowd ; but such was the strong desire of all to drink , and such the fighting to be first , that , for the most part , the whole contents were spilled upon the ground , without the lips of one man being moistened .
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 62]: Meanwhile , and in the midst of all the roar and outcry , those who were nearest to the pile , heaped up again the burning fragments that came toppling down , and raked the fire about the door , which , although a sheet of flame , was still a door fast locked and barred , and kept them out .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 67]: Great pieces of blazing wood were passed , besides , above the people 's heads to such as stood about the ladders , and some of these , climbing up to the topmost stave , and holding on with one hand by the prison wall , exerted all their skill and force to cast these fire-brands on the roof , or down into the yards within .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 68]: In many instances their efforts were successful ; which occasioned a new and appalling addition to the horrors of the scene : for the prisoners within , seeing from between their bars that the fire caught in many places and thrived fiercely , and being all locked up in strong cells for the night , began to know that they were in danger of being burnt alive .
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 74]: This terrible fear , spreading from cell to cell and from yard to yard , vented itself in such dismal cries and wailings , and in such dreadful shrieks for help , that the whole jail resounded with the noise ; which was loudly heard even above the shouting of the mob and roaring of the flames , and was so full of agony and despair , that it made the boldest tremble .
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 37]: It was remarkable that these cries began in that quarter of the jail which fronted Newgate Street , where , it was well known , the men who were to suffer death on Thursday were confined .
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 98]: And not only were these four who had so short a time to live , the first to whom the dread of being burnt occurred , but they were , throughout , the most importunate of all : for they could be plainly heard , notwithstanding the great thickness of the walls , crying that the wind set that way , and that the flames would shortly reach them ; and calling to the officers of the jail to come and quench the fire from a cistern which was in their yard , and full of water .
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 72]: Judging from what the crowd outside the walls could hear from time to time , these four doomed wretches never ceased to call for help ; and that with as much distraction , and in as great a frenzy of attachment to existence , as though each had an honoured , happy life before him , instead of eight-and-forty hours of miserable imprisonment , and then a violent and shameful death .
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 34]: But the anguish and suffering of the two sons of one of these men , when they heard , or fancied that they heard , their father 's voice , is past description .
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 48]: After wringing their hands and rushing to and fro as if they were stark mad , one mounted on the shoulders of his brother , and tried to clamber up the face of the high wall , guarded at the top with spikes and points of iron .
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 66]: And when he fell among the crowd , he was not deterred by his bruises , but mounted up again , and fell again , and , when he found the feat impossible , began to beat the stones and tear them with his hands , as if he could that way make a breach in the strong building , and force a passage in .
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 54]: At last , they cleft their way among the mob about the door , though many men , a dozen times their match , had tried in vain to do so , and were seen , in -- yes , in -- the fire , striving to prize it down , with crowbars .
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 13]: Nor were they alone affected by the outcry from within the prison .
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 77]: The women who were looking on , shrieked loudly , beat their hands together , stopped their ears ; and many fainted : the men who were not near the walls and active in the siege , rather than do nothing , tore up the pavement of the street , and did so with a haste and fury they could not have surpassed if that had been the jail , and they were near their object .
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 13]: Not one living creature in the throng was for an instant still .
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 7]: The whole great mass were mad .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 3]: A shout !
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 2]: Another !
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 13]: Another yet , though few knew why , or what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 18]: But those around the gate had seen it slowly yield , and drop from its topmost hinge .
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 39]: It hung on that side by but one , but it was upright still , because of the bar , and its having sunk , of its own weight , into the heap of ashes at its foot .
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 25]: There was now a gap at the top of the doorway , through which could be descried a gloomy passage , cavernous and dark .
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 5]: Pile up the fire !
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 4]: It burnt fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 10]: The door was red-hot , and the gap wider .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 25]: They vainly tried to shield their faces with their hands , and standing as if in readiness for a spring , watched the place .
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 27]: Dark figures , some crawling on their hands and knees , some carried in the arms of others , were seen to pass along the roof .
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 11]: It was plain the jail could hold out no longer .
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 16]: The keeper , and his officers , and their wives and children , were escaping .
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 5]: Pile up the fire !
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 20]: The door sank down again : it settled deeper in the cinders -- tottered -- yielded -- was down !
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 30]: As they shouted again , they fell back , for a moment , and left a clear space about the fire that lay between them and the jail entry .
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 36]: Hugh leapt upon the blazing heap , and scattering a train of sparks into the air , and making the dark lobby glitter with those that hung upon his dress , dashed into the jail .
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 4]: The hangman followed .
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 43]: And then so many rushed upon their track , that the fire got trodden down and thinly strewn about the street ; but there was no need of it now , for , inside and out , the prison was in flames .
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 48]: Chapter 65 During the whole course of the terrible scene which was now at its height , one man in the jail suffered a degree of fear and mental torment which had no parallel in the endurance , even of those who lay under sentence of death .
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 41]: When the rioters first assembled before the building , the murderer was roused from sleep -- if such slumbers as his may have that blessed name -- by the roar of voices , and the struggling of a great crowd .
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 19]: He started up as these sounds met his ear , and , sitting on his bedstead , listened .
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 12]: After a short interval of silence the noise burst out again .
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 23]: Still listening attentively , he made out , in course of time , that the jail was besieged by a furious multitude .
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 28]: His guilty conscience instantly arrayed these men against himself , and brought the fear upon him that he would be singled out , and torn to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 17]: Once impressed with the terror of this conceit , everything tended to confirm and strengthen it .
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 45]: His double crime , the circumstances under which it had been committed , the length of time that had elapsed , and its discovery in spite of all , made him , as it were , the visible object of the Almighty 's wrath .
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 36]: In all the crime and vice and moral gloom of the great pest-house of the capital , he stood alone , marked and singled out by his great guilt , a Lucifer among the devils .
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 21]: The other prisoners were a host , hiding and sheltering each other -- a crowd like that without the walls .
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 32]: He was one man against the whole united concourse ; a single , solitary , lonely man , from whom the very captives in the jail fell off and shrunk appalled .
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 56]: It might be that the intelligence of his capture having been bruited abroad , they had come there purposely to drag him out and kill him in the street ; or it might be that they were the rioters , and , in pursuance of an old design , had come to sack the prison .
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 16]: But in either case he had no belief or hope that they would spare him .
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 18]: Every shout they raised , and every sound they made , was a blow upon his heart .
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 94]: As the attack went on , he grew more wild and frantic in his terror : tried to pull away the bars that guarded the chimney and prevented him from climbing up : called loudly on the turnkeys to cluster round the cell and save him from the fury of the rabble ; or put him in some dungeon underground , no matter of what depth , how dark it was , or loathsome , or beset with rats and creeping things , so that it hid him and was hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 9]: But no one came , or answered him .
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 17]: Fearful , even while he cried to them , of attracting attention , he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 28]: By and bye , he saw , as he looked from his grated window , a strange glimmering on the stone walls and pavement of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 29]: It was feeble at first , and came and went , as though some officers with torches were passing to and fro upon the roof of the prison .
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 23]: Soon it reddened , and lighted brands came whirling down , spattering the ground with fire , and burning sullenly in corners .
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 37]: One rolled beneath a wooden bench , and set it in a blaze ; another caught a water-spout , and so went climbing up the wall , leaving a long straight track of fire behind it .
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 31]: After a time , a slow thick shower of burning fragments , from some upper portion of the prison which was blazing nigh , began to fall before his door .
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 45]: Remembering that it opened outwards , he knew that every spark which fell upon the heap , and in the act lost its bright life , and died an ugly speck of dust and rubbish , helped to entomb him in a living grave .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 127]: Still , though the jail resounded with shrieks and cries for help , -- though the fire bounded up as if each separate flame had had a tiger 's life , and roared as though , in every one , there were a hungry voice -- though the heat began to grow intense , and the air suffocating , and the clamour without increased , and the danger of his situation even from one merciless element was every moment more extreme , -- still he was afraid to raise his voice again , lest the crowd should break in , and should , of their own ears or from the information given them by the other prisoners , get the clue to his place of confinement .
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 63]: Thus fearful alike , of those within the prison and of those without ; of noise and silence ; light and darkness ; of being released , and being left there to die ; he was so tortured and tormented , that nothing man has ever done to man in the horrible caprice of power and cruelty , exceeds his self-inflicted punishment .
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 9]: Now , now , the door was down .
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 94]: Now they came rushing through the jail , calling to each other in the vaulted passages ; clashing the iron gates dividing yard from yard ; beating at the doors of cells and wards ; wrenching off bolts and locks and bars ; tearing down the door-posts to get men out ; endeavouring to drag them by main force through gaps and windows where a child could scarcely pass ; whooping and yelling without a moment 's rest ; and running through the heat and flames as if they were cased in metal .
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 19]: By their legs , their arms , the hair upon their heads , they dragged the prisoners out .
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 50]: Some threw themselves upon the captives as they got towards the door , and tried to file away their irons ; some danced about them with a frenzied joy , and rent their clothes , and were ready , as it seemed , to tear them limb from limb .
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 58]: Now a party of a dozen men came darting through the yard into which the murderer cast fearful glances from his darkened window ; dragging a prisoner along the ground whose dress they had nearly torn from his body in their mad eagerness to set him free , and who was bleeding and senseless in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 54]: Now a score of prisoners ran to and fro , who had lost themselves in the intricacies of the prison , and were so bewildered with the noise and glare that they knew not where to turn or what to do , and still cried out for help , as loudly as before .
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 71]: Anon some famished wretch whose theft had been a loaf of bread , or scrap of butcher 's meat , came skulking past , barefooted -- going slowly away because that jail , his house , was burning ; not because he had any other , or had friends to meet , or old haunts to revisit , or any liberty to gain , but liberty to starve and die .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 70]: And then a knot of highwaymen went trooping by , conducted by the friends they had among the crowd , who muffled their fetters as they went along , with handkerchiefs and bands of hay , and wrapped them in coats and cloaks , and gave them drink from bottles , and held it to their lips , because of their handcuffs which there was no time to remove .
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 54]: All this , and Heaven knows how much more , was done amidst a noise , a hurry , and distraction , like nothing that we know of , even in our dreams ; which seemed for ever on the rise , and never to decrease for the space of a single instant .
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 49]: He was still looking down from his window upon these things , when a band of men with torches , ladders , axes , and many kinds of weapons , poured into the yard , and hammering at his door , inquired if there were any prisoner within .
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 77]: He left the window when he saw them coming , and drew back into the remotest corner of the cell ; but although he returned them no answer , they had a fancy that some one was inside , for they presently set ladders against it , and began to tear away the bars at the casement ; not only that , indeed , but with pickaxes to hew down the very stones in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 37]: As soon as they had made a breach at the window , large enough for the admission of a man 's head , one of them thrust in a torch and looked all round the room .
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 28]: He followed this man 's gaze until it rested on himself , and heard him demand why he had not answered , but made him no reply .
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 54]: In the general surprise and wonder , they were used to this ; without saying anything more , they enlarged the breach until it was large enough to admit the body of a man , and then came dropping down upon the floor , one after another , until the cell was full .
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 30]: They caught him up among them , handed him to the window , and those who stood upon the ladders passed him down upon the pavement of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 35]: Then the rest came out , one after another , and , bidding him fly , and lose no time , or the way would be choked up , hurried away to rescue others .
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 12]: It seemed not a minute 's work from first to last .
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 30]: He staggered to his feet , incredulous of what had happened , when the yard was filled again , and a crowd rushed on , hurrying Barnaby among them .
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 11]: In another minute -- not so much : another minute !
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 11]: the same instant , with no lapse or interval between !
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 36]: -- he and his son were being passed from hand to hand , through the dense crowd in the street , and were glancing backward at a burning pile which some one said was Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 50]: From the moment of their first entrance into the prison , the crowd dispersed themselves about it , and swarmed into every chink and crevice , as if they had a perfect acquaintance with its innermost parts , and bore in their minds an exact plan of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 65]: For this immediate knowledge of the place , they were , no doubt , in a great degree , indebted to the hangman , who stood in the lobby , directing some to go this way , some that , and some the other ; and who materially assisted in bringing about the wonderful rapidity with which the release of the prisoners was effected .
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 20]: But this functionary of the law reserved one important piece of intelligence , and kept it snugly to himself .
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 124]: When he had issued his instructions relative to every other part of the building , and the mob were dispersed from end to end , and busy at their work , he took a bundle of keys from a kind of cupboard in the wall , and going by a kind of passage near the chapel -LRB- it joined the governors house , and was then on fire -RRB- , betook himself to the condemned cells , which were a series of small , strong , dismal rooms , opening on a low gallery , guarded , at the end at which he entered , by a strong iron wicket , and at its opposite extremity by two doors and a thick grate .
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 44]: Having double locked the wicket , and assured himself that the other entrances were well secured , he sat down on a bench in the gallery , and sucked the head of his stick with the utmost complacency , tranquillity , and contentment .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 40]: It would have been strange enough , a man 's enjoying himself in this quiet manner , while the prison was burning , and such a tumult was cleaving the air , though he had been outside the walls .
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 56]: But here , in the very heart of the building , and moreover with the prayers and cries of the four men under sentence sounding in his ears , and their hands , stretched our through the gratings in their cell-doors , clasped in frantic entreaty before his very eyes , it was particularly remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 86]: Indeed , Mr Dennis appeared to think it an uncommon circumstance , and to banter himself upon it ; for he thrust his hat on one side as some men do when they are in a waggish humour , sucked the head of his stick with a higher relish , and smiled as though he would say , ` Dennis , you 're a rum dog ; you 're a queer fellow ; you 're capital company , Dennis , and quite a character ! '
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 132]: He sat in this way for some minutes , while the four men in the cells , who were certain that somebody had entered the gallery , but could not see who , gave vent to such piteous entreaties as wretches in their miserable condition may be supposed to have been inspired with : urging , whoever it was , to set them at liberty , for the love of Heaven ; and protesting , with great fervour , and truly enough , perhaps , for the time , that if they escaped , they would amend their ways , and would never , never , never again do wrong before God or man , but would lead penitent and sober lives , and sorrowfully repent the crimes they had committed .
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 92]: The terrible energy with which they spoke , would have moved any person , no matter how good or just -LRB- if any good or just person could have strayed into that sad place that night -RRB- , to have set them at liberty : and , while he would have left any other punishment to its free course , to have saved them from this last dreadful and repulsive penalty ; which never turned a man inclined to evil , and has hardened thousands who were half inclined to good .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 51]: Mr Dennis , who had been bred and nurtured in the good old school , and had administered the good old laws on the good old plan , always once and sometimes twice every six weeks , for a long time , bore these appeals with a deal of philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 40]: Being at last , however , rather disturbed in his pleasant reflection by their repetition , he rapped at one of the doors with his stick , and cried : ` Hold your noise there , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 25]: At this they all cried together that they were to be hanged on the next day but one ; and again implored his aid .
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 3]: ` Aid !
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 4]: For what ! '
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 14]: said Mr Dennis , playfully rapping the knuckles of the hand nearest him .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 6]: ` To save us ! '
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 3]: they cried .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 28]: ` Oh , certainly , ' said Mr Dennis , winking at the wall in the absence of any friend with whom he could humour the joke .
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 16]: ` And so you 're to be worked off , are you , brothers ? '
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 21]: ` Unless we are released to-night , ' one of them cried , ` we are dead men ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 65]: I tell you what it is , ' said the hangman , gravely ; ` I 'm afraid , my friend , that you 're not in that ` ere state of mind that 's suitable to your condition , then ; you 're not a-going to be released : do n't think it -- Will you leave off that ` ere indecent row ?
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 13]: I wonder you a n't ashamed of yourselves , I do . '
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 30]: He followed up this reproof by rapping every set of knuckles one after the other , and having done so , resumed his seat again with a cheerful countenance .
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 78]: ` You 've had law , ' he said , crossing his legs and elevating his eyebrows : ` laws have been made a ' purpose for you ; a wery handsome prison 's been made a ' purpose for you ; a parson 's kept a purpose for you ; a constitootional officer 's appointed a ' purpose for you ; carts is maintained a ' purpose for you -- and yet you 're not contented !
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 14]: -- WILL you hold that noise , you sir in the furthest ? '
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 7]: A groan was the only answer .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 32]: ` So well as I can make out , ' said Mr Dennis , in a tone of mingled badinage and remonstrance , ` there 's not a man among you .
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 43]: I begin to think I 'm on the opposite side , and among the ladies ; though for the matter of that , I 've seen a many ladies face it out , in a manner that did honour to the sex .
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 14]: -- You in number two , do n't grind them teeth of yours .
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 25]: Worse manners , ' said the hangman , rapping at the door with his stick , ' I never see in this place afore .
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 6]: I 'm ashamed of you .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 9]: You 're a disgrace to the Bailey . '
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 35]: After pausing for a moment to hear if anything could be pleaded in justification , Mr Dennis resumed in a sort of coaxing tone : ` Now look ` ee here , you four .
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 24]: I 'm come here to take care of you , and see that you a n't burnt , instead of the other thing .
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 42]: It 's no use your making any noise , for you wo n't be found out by them as has broken in , and you 'll only be hoarse when you come to the speeches , -- which is a pity .
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 17]: What I say in respect to the speeches always is , `` Give it mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 5]: That 's my maxim .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 4]: Give it mouth .
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 85]: I 've heerd , ' said the hangman , pulling off his hat to take his handkerchief from the crown and wipe his face , and then putting it on again a little more on one side than before , ` I 've heerd a eloquence on them boards -- you know what boards I mean -- and have heerd a degree of mouth given to them speeches , that they was as clear as a bell , and as good as a play .
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 5]: There 's a pattern !
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 28]: And always , when a thing of this natur 's to come off , what I stand up for , is , a proper frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 23]: Let 's have a proper frame of mind , and we can go through with it , creditable -- pleasant -- sociable .
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 21]: Whatever you do -LRB- and I address myself in particular , to you in the furthest -RRB- , never snivel .
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 35]: I 'd sooner by half , though I lose by it , see a man tear his clothes a ' purpose to spile 'em before they come to me , than find him snivelling .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 15]: It 's ten to one a better frame of mind , every way ! '
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 80]: While the hangman addressed them to this effect , in the tone and with the air of a pastor in familiar conversation with his flock , the noise had been in some degree subdued ; for the rioters were busy in conveying the prisoners to the Sessions House , which was beyond the main walls of the prison , though connected with it , and the crowd were busy too , in passing them from thence along the street .
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 59]: But when he had got thus far in his discourse , the sound of voices in the yard showed plainly that the mob had returned and were coming that way ; and directly afterwards a violent crashing at the grate below , gave note of their attack upon the cells -LRB- as they were called -RRB- at last .
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 77]: It was in vain the hangman ran from door to door , and covered the grates , one after another , with his hat , in futile efforts to stifle the cries of the four men within ; it was in vain he dogged their outstretched hands , and beat them with his stick , or menaced them with new and lingering pains in the execution of his office ; the place resounded with their cries .
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 87]: These , together with the feeling that they were now the last men in the jail , so worked upon and stimulated the besiegers , that in an incredibly short space of time they forced the strong grate down below , which was formed of iron rods two inches square , drove in the two other doors , as if they had been but deal partitions , and stood at the end of the gallery with only a bar or two between them and the cells .
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 19]: cried Hugh , who was the first to look into the dusky passage : ` Dennis before us !
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 6]: Well done , old boy .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 20]: Be quick , and open here , for we shall be suffocated in the smoke , going out . '
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 12]: ` Go out at once , then , ' said Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 8]: ` What do you want here ? '
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 4]: ` Want ! '
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 3]: echoed Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 6]: ` The four men . '
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 5]: ` Four devils ! '
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 4]: cried the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 13]: ` Do n't you know they 're left for death on Thursday ?
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 12]: Do n't you respect the law -- the constitootion -- nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 7]: Let the four men be . '
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 9]: ` Is this a time for joking ? '
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 6]: ` Do you hear 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 21]: Pull away these bars that have got fixed between the door and the ground ; and let us in . '
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 50]: ` Brother , ' said the hangman , in a low voice , as he stooped under pretence of doing what Hugh desired , but only looked up in his face , ` ca n't you leave these here four men to me , if I 've the whim !
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 23]: You do what you like , and have what you like of everything for your share , -- give me my share .
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 13]: I want these four men left alone , I tell you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 19]: ` Pull the bars down , or stand out of the way , ' was Hugh 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 25]: ` You can turn the crowd if you like , you know that well enough , brother , ' said the hangman , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 9]: You WILL come in , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 15]: ` You wo n't let these men alone , and leave 'em to me ?
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 12]: You 've no respect for nothing -- have n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 22]: said the hangman , retreating to the door by which he had entered , and regarding his companion with a scowl .
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 13]: ` You WILL come in , will you , brother ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 6]: I tell you , yes .
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 6]: What the devil ails you ?
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 6]: Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 33]: ` No matter where I 'm going , ' rejoined the hangman , looking in again at the iron wicket , which he had nearly shut upon himself , and held ajar .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 7]: ` Remember where you 're coming .
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 5]: That 's all ! '
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 32]: With that , he shook his likeness at Hugh , and giving him a grin , compared with which his usual smile was amiable , disappeared , and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 69]: Hugh paused no longer , but goaded alike by the cries of the convicts , and by the impatience of the crowd , warned the man immediately behind him -- the way was only wide enough for one abreast -- to stand back , and wielded a sledge-hammer with such strength , that after a few blows the iron bent and broke , and gave them free admittance .
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 34]: It the two sons of one of these men , of whom mention has been made , were furious in their zeal before , they had now the wrath and vigour of lions .
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 55]: Calling to the man within each cell , to keep as far back as he could , lest the axes crashing through the door should wound him , a party went to work upon each one , to beat it in by sheer strength , and force the bolts and staples from their hold .
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 49]: But although these two lads had the weakest party , and the worst armed , and did not begin until after the others , having stopped to whisper to him through the grate , that door was the first open , and that man was the first out .
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 43]: As they dragged him into the gallery to knock off his irons , he fell down among them , a mere heap of chains , and was carried out in that state on men 's shoulders , with no sign of life .
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 89]: The release of these four wretched creatures , and conveying them , astounded and bewildered , into the streets so full of life -- a spectacle they had never thought to see again , until they emerged from solitude and silence upon that last journey , when the air should be heavy with the pent-up breath of thousands , and the streets and houses should be built and roofed with human faces , not with bricks and tiles and stones -- was the crowning horror of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 61]: Their pale and haggard looks and hollow eyes ; their staggering feet , and hands stretched out as if to save themselves from falling ; their wandering and uncertain air ; the way they heaved and gasped for breath , as though in water , when they were first plunged into the crowd ; all marked them for the men .
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 26]: No need to say ` this one was doomed to die ; ' for there were the words broadly stamped and branded on his face .
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 49]: The crowd fell off , as if they had been laid out for burial , and had risen in their shrouds ; and many were seen to shudder , as though they had been actually dead men , when they chanced to touch or brush against their garments .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 31]: At the bidding of the mob , the houses were all illuminated that night -- lighted up from top to bottom as at a time of public gaiety and joy .
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 52]: Many years afterwards , old people who lived in their youth near this part of the city , remembered being in a great glare of light , within doors and without , and as they looked , timid and frightened children , from the windows , seeing a FACE go by .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 29]: Though the whole great crowd and all its other terrors had faded from their recollection , this one object remained ; alone , distinct , and well remembered .
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 47]: Even in the unpractised minds of infants , one of these doomed men darting past , and but an instant seen , was an image of force enough to dim the whole concourse ; to find itself an all-absorbing place , and hold it ever after .
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 82]: When this last task had been achieved , the shouts and cries grew fainter ; the clank of fetters , which had resounded on all sides as the prisoners escaped , was heard no more ; all the noises of the crowd subsided into a hoarse and sullen murmur as it passed into the distance ; and when the human tide had rolled away , a melancholy heap of smoking ruins marked the spot where it had lately chafed and roared .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 62]: Chapter 66 Although he had had no rest upon the previous night , and had watched with little intermission for some weeks past , sleeping only in the day by starts and snatches , Mr Haredale , from the dawn of morning until sunset , sought his niece in every place where he deemed it possible she could have taken refuge .
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 35]: All day long , nothing , save a draught of water , passed his lips ; though he prosecuted his inquiries far and wide , and never so much as sat down , once .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 37]: In every quarter he could think of ; at Chigwell and in London ; at the houses of the tradespeople with whom he dealt , and of the friends he knew ; he pursued his search .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 25]: A prey to the most harrowing anxieties and apprehensions , he went from magistrate to magistrate , and finally to the Secretary of State .
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 111]: The only comfort he received was from this minister , who assured him that the Government , being now driven to the exercise of the extreme prerogatives of the Crown , were determined to exert them ; that a proclamation would probably be out upon the morrow , giving to the military , discretionary and unlimited power in the suppression of the riots ; that the sympathies of the King , the Administration , and both Houses of Parliament , and indeed of all good men of every religious persuasion , were strongly with the injured Catholics ; and that justice should be done them at any cost or hazard .
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 96]: He told him , moreover , that other persons whose houses had been burnt , had for a time lost sight of their children or their relatives , but had , in every case , within his knowledge , succeeded in discovering them ; that his complaint should be remembered , and fully stated in the instructions given to the officers in command , and to all the inferior myrmidons of justice ; and that everything that could be done to help him , should be done , with a goodwill and in good faith .
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 60]: Grateful for this consolation , feeble as it was in its reference to the past , and little hope as it afforded him in connection with the subject of distress which lay nearest to his heart ; and really thankful for the interest the minister expressed , and seemed to feel , in his condition ; Mr Haredale withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 27]: He found himself , with the night coming on , alone in the streets ; and destitute of any place in which to lay his head .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 16]: He entered an hotel near Charing Cross , and ordered some refreshment and a bed .
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 41]: He saw that his faint and worn appearance attracted the attention of the landlord and his waiters ; and thinking that they might suppose him to be penniless , took out his purse , and laid it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 14]: It was not that , the landlord said , in a faltering voice .
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 20]: If he were one of those who had suffered by the rioters , he durst not give him entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 19]: He had a family of children , and had been twice warned to be careful in receiving guests .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 12]: He heartily prayed his forgiveness , but what could he do ?
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 10]: No man felt that more sincerely than Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 12]: He told the man as much , and left the house .
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 89]: Feeling that he might have anticipated this occurrence , after what he had seen at Chigwell in the morning , where no man dared to touch a spade , though he offered a large reward to all who would come and dig among the ruins of his house , he walked along the Strand ; too proud to expose himself to another refusal , and of too generous a spirit to involve in distress or ruin any honest tradesman who might be weak enough to give him shelter .
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 63]: He wandered into one of the streets by the side of the river , and was pacing in a thoughtful manner up and down , thinking of things that had happened long ago , when he heard a servant-man at an upper window call to another on the opposite side of the street , that the mob were setting fire to Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 3]: To Newgate !
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 5]: where that man was !
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 17]: His failing strength returned , his energies came back with tenfold vigour , on the instant .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 57]: If it were possible -- if they should set the murderer free -- was he , after all he had undergone , to die with the suspicion of having slain his own brother , dimly gathering about him -- He had no consciousness of going to the jail ; but there he stood , before it .
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 28]: There was the crowd wedged and pressed together in a dense , dark , moving mass ; and there were the flames soaring up into the air .
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 21]: His head turned round and round , lights flashed before his eyes , and he struggled hard with two men .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 9]: ` Nay , nay , ' said one .
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 9]: ` Be more yourself , my good sir .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 5]: We attract attention here .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 3]: Come away .
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 10]: What can you do among so many men ? '
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 22]: ` The gentleman 's always for doing something , ' said the other , forcing him along as he spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 6]: I like him for that .
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 8]: I do like him for that . '
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 16]: They had by this time got him into a court , hard by the prison .
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 24]: He looked from one to the other , and as he tried to release himself , felt that he tottered on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 20]: He who had spoken first , was the old gentleman whom he had seen at the Lord Mayor 's .
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 16]: The other was John Grueby , who had stood by him so manfully at Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 7]: ` What does this mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 5]: he asked them faintly .
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 7]: ` How came we together ? '
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 19]: ` On the skirts of the crowd , ' returned the distiller ; ` but come with us .
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 5]: Pray come with us .
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 9]: You seem to know my friend here ? '
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 17]: ` Surely , ' said Mr Haredale , looking in a kind of stupor at John .
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 23]: ` He 'll tell you then , ' returned the old gentleman , ` that I am a man to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 5]: He 's my servant .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 56]: He was lately -LRB- as you know , I have no doubt -RRB- in Lord George Gordon 's service ; but he left it , and brought , in pure goodwill to me and others , who are marked by the rioters , such intelligence as he had picked up , of their designs . '
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 18]: -- ` On one condition , please , sir , ' said John , touching his hat .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 16]: No evidence against my lord -- a misled man -- a kind-hearted man , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 7]: My lord never intended this . '
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 16]: ` The condition will be observed , of course , ' rejoined the old distiller .
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 8]: ` It 's a point of honour .
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 13]: But come with us , sir ; pray come with us . '
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 41]: John Grueby added no entreaties , but he adopted a different kind of persuasion , by putting his arm through one of Mr Haredale 's , while his master took the other , and leading him away with all speed .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 75]: Sensible , from a strange lightness in his head , and a difficulty in fixing his thoughts on anything , even to the extent of bearing his companions in his mind for a minute together without looking at them , that his brain was affected by the agitation and suffering through which he had passed , and to which he was still a prey , Mr Haredale let them lead him where they would .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 29]: As they went along , he was conscious of having no command over what he said or thought , and that he had a fear of going mad .
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 29]: The distiller lived , as he had told him when they first met , on Holborn Hill , where he had great storehouses and drove a large trade .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 67]: They approached his house by a back entrance , lest they should attract the notice of the crowd , and went into an upper room which faced towards the street ; the windows , however , in common with those of every other room in the house , were boarded up inside , in order that , out of doors , all might appear quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 36]: They laid him on a sofa in this chamber , perfectly insensible ; but John immediately fetching a surgeon , who took from him a large quantity of blood , he gradually came to himself .
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 37]: As he was , for the time , too weak to walk , they had no difficulty in persuading him to remain there all night , and got him to bed without loss of a minute .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 40]: That done , they gave him cordial and some toast , and presently a pretty strong composing-draught , under the influence of which he soon fell into a lethargy , and , for a time , forgot his troubles .
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 62]: The vintner , who was a very hearty old fellow and a worthy man , had no thoughts of going to bed himself , for he had received several threatening warnings from the rioters , and had indeed gone out that evening to try and gather from the conversation of the mob whether his house was to be the next attacked .
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 84]: He sat all night in an easy-chair in the same room -- dozing a little now and then -- and received from time to time the reports of John Grueby and two or three other trustworthy persons in his employ , who went out into the streets as scouts ; and for whose entertainment an ample allowance of good cheer -LRB- which the old vintner , despite his anxiety , now and then attacked himself -RRB- was set forth in an adjoining chamber .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 51]: These accounts were of a sufficiently alarming nature from the first ; but as the night wore on , they grew so much worse , and involved such a fearful amount of riot and destruction , that in comparison with these new tidings all the previous disturbances sunk to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 77]: The first intelligence that came , was of the taking of Newgate , and the escape of all the prisoners , whose track , as they made up Holborn and into the adjacent streets , was proclaimed to those citizens who were shut up in their houses , by the rattling of their chains , which formed a dismal concert , and was heard in every direction , as though so many forges were at work .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 44]: The flames too , shone so brightly through the vintner 's skylights , that the rooms and staircases below were nearly as light as in broad day ; while the distant shouting of the mob seemed to shake the very walls and ceilings .
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 17]: At length they were heard approaching the house , and some minutes of terrible anxiety ensued .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 20]: They came close up , and stopped before it ; but after giving three loud yells , went on .
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 25]: And although they returned several times that night , creating new alarms each time , they did nothing there ; having their hands full .
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 34]: Shortly after they had gone away for the first time , one of the scouts came running in with the news that they had stopped before Lord Mansfield 's house in Bloomsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 79]: Soon afterwards there came another , and another , and then the first returned again , and so , by little and little , their tale was this : -- That the mob gathering round Lord Mansfield 's house , had called on those within to open the door , and receiving no reply -LRB- for Lord and Lady Mansfield were at that moment escaping by the backway -RRB- , forced an entrance according to their usual custom .
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 110]: That they then began to demolish the house with great fury , and setting fire to it in several parts , involved in a common ruin the whole of the costly furniture , the plate and jewels , a beautiful gallery of pictures , the rarest collection of manuscripts ever possessed by any one private person in the world , and worse than all , because nothing could replace this loss , the great Law Library , on almost every page of which were notes in the Judge 's own hand , of inestimable value , -- being the results of the study and experience of his whole life .
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 46]: That while they were howling and exulting round the fire , a troop of soldiers , with a magistrate among them , came up , and being too late -LRB- for the mischief was by that time done -RRB- , began to disperse the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 67]: That the Riot Act being read , and the crowd still resisting , the soldiers received orders to fire , and levelling their muskets shot dead at the first discharge six men and a woman , and wounded many persons ; and loading again directly , fired another volley , but over the people 's heads it was supposed , as none were seen to fall .
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 70]: That thereupon , and daunted by the shrieks and tumult , the crowd began to disperse , and the soldiers went away , leaving the killed and wounded on the ground : which they had no sooner done than the rioters came back again , and taking up the dead bodies , and the wounded people , formed into a rude procession , having the bodies in the front .
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 43]: That in this order they paraded off with a horrible merriment ; fixing weapons in the dead men 's hands to make them look as if alive ; and preceded by a fellow ringing Lord Mansfield 's dinner-bell with all his might .
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 81]: The scouts reported further , that this party meeting with some others who had been at similar work elsewhere , they all united into one , and drafting off a few men with the killed and wounded , marched away to Lord Mansfield 's country seat at Caen Wood , between Hampstead and Highgate ; bent upon destroying that house likewise , and lighting up a great fire there , which from that height should be seen all over London .
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 32]: But in this , they were disappointed , for a party of horse having arrived before them , they retreated faster than they went , and came straight back to town .
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 90]: There being now a great many parties in the streets , each went to work according to its humour , and a dozen houses were quickly blazing , including those of Sir John Fielding and two other justices , and four in Holborn -- one of the greatest thoroughfares in London -- which were all burning at the same time , and burned until they went out of themselves , for the people cut the engine hose , and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the flames .
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 28]: At one house near Moorfields , they found in one of the rooms some canary birds in cages , and these they cast into the fire alive .
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 51]: The poor little creatures screamed , it was said , like infants , when they were flung upon the blaze ; and one man was so touched that he tried in vain to save them , which roused the indignation of the crowd , and nearly cost him his life .
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 60]: At this same house , one of the fellows who went through the rooms , breaking the furniture and helping to destroy the building , found a child 's doll -- a poor toy -- which he exhibited at the window to the mob below , as the image of some unholy saint which the late occupants had worshipped .
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 60]: While he was doing this , another man with an equally tender conscience -LRB- they had both been foremost in throwing down the canary birds for roasting alive -RRB- , took his seat on the parapet of the house , and harangued the crowd from a pamphlet circulated by the Association , relative to the true principles of Christianity !
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 36]: Meanwhile the Lord Mayor , with his hands in his pockets , looked on as an idle man might look at any other show , and seemed mightily satisfied to have got a good place .
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 67]: Such were the accounts brought to the old vintner by his servants as he sat at the side of Mr Haredale 's bed , having been unable even to doze , after the first part of the night ; too much disturbed by his own fears ; by the cries of the mob , the light of the fires , and the firing of the soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 57]: Such , with the addition of the release of all the prisoners in the New Jail at Clerkenwell , and as many robberies of passengers in the streets , as the crowd had leisure to indulge in , were the scenes of which Mr Haredale was happily unconscious , and which were all enacted before midnight .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 20]: Chapter 67 When darkness broke away and morning began to dawn , the town wore a strange aspect indeed .
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 9]: Sleep had hardly been thought of all night .
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 62]: The general alarm was so apparent in the faces of the inhabitants , and its expression was so aggravated by want of rest -LRB- few persons , with any property to lose , having dared go to bed since Monday -RRB- , that a stranger coming into the streets would have supposed some mortal pest or plague to have been raging .
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 17]: In place of the usual cheerfulness and animation of morning , everything was dead and silent .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 42]: The shops remained closed , offices and warehouses were shut , the coach and chair stands were deserted , no carts or waggons rumbled through the slowly waking streets , the early cries were all hushed ; a universal gloom prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 72]: Great numbers of people were out , even at daybreak , but they flitted to and fro as though they shrank from the sound of their own footsteps ; the public ways were haunted rather than frequented ; and round the smoking ruins people stood apart from one another and in silence , not venturing to condemn the rioters , or to be supposed to do so , even in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 66]: At the Lord President 's in Piccadilly , at Lambeth Palace , at the Lord Chancellor 's in Great Ormond Street , in the Royal Exchange , the Bank , the Guildhall , the Inns of Court , the Courts of Law , and every chamber fronting the streets near Westminster Hall and the Houses of Parliament , parties of soldiers were posted before daylight .
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 62]: A body of Horse Guards paraded Palace Yard ; an encampment was formed in the Park , where fifteen hundred men and five battalions of Militia were under arms ; the Tower was fortified , the drawbridges were raised , the cannon loaded and pointed , and two regiments of artillery busied in strengthening the fortress and preparing it for defence .
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 53]: A numerous detachment of soldiers were stationed to keep guard at the New River Head , which the people had threatened to attack , and where , it was said , they meant to cut off the main-pipes , so that there might be no water for the extinction of the flames .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 76]: In the Poultry , and on Cornhill , and at several other leading points , iron chains were drawn across the street ; parties of soldiers were distributed in some of the old city churches while it was yet dark ; and in several private houses -LRB- among them , Lord Rockingham 's in Grosvenor Square -RRB- ; which were blockaded as though to sustain a siege , and had guns pointed from the windows .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 127]: When the sun rose , it shone into handsome apartments filled with armed men ; the furniture hastily heaped away in corners , and made of little or no account , in the terror of the time -- on arms glittering in city chambers , among desks and stools , and dusty books -- into little smoky churchyards in odd lanes and by-ways , with soldiers lying down among the tombs , or lounging under the shade of the one old tree , and their pile of muskets sparkling in the light -- on solitary sentries pacing up and down in courtyards , silent now , but yesterday resounding with the din and hum of business -- everywhere on guard-rooms , garrisons , and threatening preparations .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 16]: As the day crept on , still more unusual sights were witnessed in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 39]: The gates of the King 's Bench and Fleet Prisons being opened at the usual hour , were found to have notices affixed to them , announcing that the rioters would come that night to burn them down .
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 87]: The wardens , too well knowing the likelihood there was of this promise being fulfilled , were fain to set their prisoners at liberty , and give them leave to move their goods ; so , all day , such of them as had any furniture were occupied in conveying it , some to this place , some to that , and not a few to the brokers ' shops , where they gladly sold it , for any wretched price those gentry chose to give .
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 65]: There were some broken men among these debtors who had been in jail so long , and were so miserable and destitute of friends , so dead to the world , and utterly forgotten and uncared for , that they implored their jailers not to set them free , and to send them , if need were , to some other place of custody .
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 70]: But they , refusing to comply , lest they should incur the anger of the mob , turned them into the streets , where they wandered up and down hardly remembering the ways untrodden by their feet so long , and crying -- such abject things those rotten-hearted jails had made them -- as they slunk off in their rags , and dragged their slipshod feet along the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 49]: Even of the three hundred prisoners who had escaped from Newgate , there were some -- a few , but there were some -- who sought their jailers out and delivered themselves up : preferring imprisonment and punishment to the horrors of such another night as the last .
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 52]: Many of the convicts , drawn back to their old place of captivity by some indescribable attraction , or by a desire to exult over it in its downfall and glut their revenge by seeing it in ashes , actually went back in broad noon , and loitered about the cells .
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 54]: Fifty were retaken at one time on this next day , within the prison walls ; but their fate did not deter others , for there they went in spite of everything , and there they were taken in twos and threes , twice or thrice a day , all through the week .
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 62]: Of the fifty just mentioned , some were occupied in endeavouring to rekindle the fire ; but in general they seemed to have no object in view but to prowl and lounge about the old place : being often found asleep in the ruins , or sitting talking there , or even eating and drinking , as in a choice retreat .
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 61]: Besides the notices on the gates of the Fleet and the King 's Bench , many similar announcements were left , before one o'clock at noon , at the houses of private individuals ; and further , the mob proclaimed their intention of seizing on the Bank , the Mint , the Arsenal at Woolwich , and the Royal Palaces .
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 60]: The notices were seldom delivered by more than one man , who , if it were at a shop , went in , and laid it , with a bloody threat perhaps , upon the counter ; or if it were at a private house , knocked at the door , and thrust it in the servant 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 33]: Notwithstanding the presence of the military in every quarter of the town , and the great force in the Park , these messengers did their errands with impunity all through the day .
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 30]: So did two boys who went down Holborn alone , armed with bars taken from the railings of Lord Mansfield 's house , and demanded money for the rioters .
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 27]: So did a tall man on horseback who made a collection for the same purpose in Fleet Street , and refused to take anything but gold .
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 50]: A rumour had now got into circulation , too , which diffused a greater dread all through London , even than these publicly announced intentions of the rioters , though all men knew that if they were successfully effected , there must ensue a national bankruptcy and general ruin .
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 21]: It was said that they meant to throw the gates of Bedlam open , and let all the madmen loose .
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 54]: This suggested such dreadful images to the people 's minds , and was indeed an act so fraught with new and unimaginable horrors in the contemplation , that it beset them more than any loss or cruelty of which they could foresee the worst , and drove many sane men nearly mad themselves .
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 52]: So the day passed on : the prisoners moving their goods ; people running to and fro in the streets , carrying away their property ; groups standing in silence round the ruins ; all business suspended ; and the soldiers disposed as has been already mentioned , remaining quite inactive .
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 13]: So the day passed on , and dreaded night drew near again .
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 75]: At last , at seven o'clock in the evening , the Privy Council issued a solemn proclamation that it was now necessary to employ the military , and that the officers had most direct and effectual orders , by an immediate exertion of their utmost force , to repress the disturbances ; and warning all good subjects of the King to keep themselves , their servants , and apprentices , within doors that night .
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 32]: There was then delivered out to every soldier on duty , thirty-six rounds of powder and ball ; the drums beat ; and the whole force was under arms at sunset .
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 46]: The City authorities , stimulated by these vigorous measures , held a Common Council ; passed a vote thanking the military associations who had tendered their aid to the civil authorities ; accepted it ; and placed them under the direction of the two sheriffs .
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 55]: At the Queen 's palace , a double guard , the yeomen on duty , the groom-porters , and all other attendants , were stationed in the passages and on the staircases at seven o'clock , with strict instructions to be watchful on their posts all night ; and all the doors were locked .
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 36]: The gentlemen of the Temple , and the other Inns , mounted guard within their gates , and strengthened them with the great stones of the pavement , which they took up for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 50]: In Lincoln 's Inn , they gave up the hall and commons to the Northumberland Militia , under the command of Lord Algernon Percy ; in some few of the city wards , the burgesses turned out , and without making a very fierce show , looked brave enough .
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 43]: Some hundreds of stout gentlemen threw themselves , armed to the teeth , into the halls of the different companies , double-locked and bolted all the gates , and dared the rioters -LRB- among themselves -RRB- to come on at their peril .
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 84]: These arrangements being all made simultaneously , or nearly so , were completed by the time it got dark ; and then the streets were comparatively clear , and were guarded at all the great corners and chief avenues by the troops : while parties of the officers rode up and down in all directions , ordering chance stragglers home , and admonishing the residents to keep within their houses , and , if any firing ensued , not to approach the windows .
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 35]: More chains were drawn across such of the thoroughfares as were of a nature to favour the approach of a great crowd , and at each of these points a considerable force was stationed .
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 46]: All these precautions having been taken , and it being now quite dark , those in command awaited the result in some anxiety : and not without a hope that such vigilant demonstrations might of themselves dishearten the populace , and prevent any new outrages .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 92]: But in this reckoning they were cruelly mistaken , for in half an hour , or less , as though the setting in of night had been their preconcerted signal , the rioters having previously , in small parties , prevented the lighting of the street lamps , rose like a great sea ; and that in so many places at once , and with such inconceivable fury , that those who had the direction of the troops knew not , at first , where to turn or what to do .
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 89]: One after another , new fires blazed up in every quarter of the town , as though it were the intention of the insurgents to wrap the city in a circle of flames , which , contracting by degrees , should burn the whole to ashes ; the crowd swarmed and roared in every street ; and none but rioters and soldiers being out of doors , it seemed to the latter as if all London were arrayed against them , and they stood alone against the town .
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 35]: In two hours , six-and-thirty fires were raging -- six-and-thirty great conflagrations : among them the Borough Clink in Tooley Street , the King 's Bench , the Fleet , and the New Bridewell .
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 30]: In almost every street , there was a battle ; and in every quarter the muskets of the troops were heard above the shouts and tumult of the mob .
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 29]: The firing began in the Poultry , where the chain was drawn across the road , where nearly a score of people were killed on the first discharge .
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 55]: Their bodies having been hastily carried into St Mildred 's Church by the soldiers , the latter fired again , and following fast upon the crowd , who began to give way when they saw the execution that was done , formed across Cheapside , and charged them at the point of the bayonet .
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 8]: The streets were now a dreadful spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 37]: The shouts of the rabble , the shrieks of women , the cries of the wounded , and the constant firing , formed a deafening and an awful accompaniment to the sights which every corner presented .
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 33]: Wherever the road was obstructed by the chains , there the fighting and the loss of life were greatest ; but there was hot work and bloodshed in almost every leading thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 68]: At Holborn Bridge , and on Holborn Hill , the confusion was greater than in any other part ; for the crowd that poured out of the city in two great streams , one by Ludgate Hill , and one by Newgate Street , united at that spot , and formed a mass so dense , that at every volley the people seemed to fall in heaps .
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 36]: At this place a large detachment of soldiery were posted , who fired , now up Fleet Market , now up Holborn , now up Snow Hill -- constantly raking the streets in each direction .
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 28]: At this place too , several large fires were burning , so that all the terrors of that terrible night seemed to be concentrated in one spot .
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 66]: Full twenty times , the rioters , headed by one man who wielded an axe in his right hand , and bestrode a brewer 's horse of great size and strength , caparisoned with fetters taken out of Newgate , which clanked and jingled as he went , made an attempt to force a passage at this point , and fire the vintner 's house .
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 51]: Full twenty times they were repulsed with loss of life , and still came back again ; and though the fellow at their head was marked and singled out by all , and was a conspicuous object as the only rioter on horseback , not a man could hit him .
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 46]: So surely as the smoke cleared away , so surely there was he ; calling hoarsely to his companions , brandishing his axe above his head , and dashing on as though he bore a charmed life , and was proof against ball and powder .
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 17]: This man was Hugh ; and in every part of the riot , he was seen .
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 81]: He headed two attacks upon the Bank , helped to break open the Toll-houses on Blackfriars Bridge , and cast the money into the street : fired two of the prisons with his own hand : was here , and there , and everywhere -- always foremost -- always active -- striking at the soldiers , cheering on the crowd , making his horse 's iron music heard through all the yell and uproar : but never hurt or stopped .
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 31]: Turn him at one place , and he made a new struggle in anotlter ; force him to retreat at this point , and he advanced on that , directly .
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 80]: Driven from Holborn for the twentieth time , he rode at the head of a great crowd straight upon Saint Paul 's , attacked a guard of soldiers who kept watch over a body of prisoners within the iron railings , forced them to retreat , rescued the men they had in custody , and with this accession to his party , came back again , mad with liquor and excitement , and hallooing them on like a demon .
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 65]: It would have been no easy task for the most careful rider to sit a horse in the midst of such a throng and tumult ; but though this madman rolled upon his back -LRB- he had no saddle -RRB- like a boat upon the sea , he never for an instant lost his seat , or failed to guide him where he would .
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 93]: Through the very thickest of the press , over dead bodies and burning fragments , now on the pavement , now in the road , now riding up a flight of steps to make himself the more conspicuous to his party , and now forcing a passage through a mass of human beings , so closely squeezed together that it seemed as if the edge of a knife would scarcely part them , -- on he went , as though he could surmount all obstacles by the mere exercise of his will .
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 63]: And perhaps his not being shot was in some degree attributable to this very circumstance ; for his extreme audacity , and the conviction that he must be one of those to whom the proclamation referred , inspired the soldiers with a desire to take him alive , and diverted many an aim which otherwise might have been more near the mark .
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 93]: The vintner and Mr Haredale , unable to sit quietly listening to the noise without seeing what went on , had climbed to the roof of the house , and hiding behind a stack of chimneys , were looking cautiously down into the street , almost hoping that after so many repulses the rioters would be foiled , when a great shout proclaimed that a parry were coming round the other way ; and the dismal jingling of those accursed fetters warned them next moment that they too were led by Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 31]: The soldiers had advanced into Fleet Market and were dispersing the people there ; so that they came on with hardly any check , and were soon before the house .
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 11]: ` All 's over now , ' said the vintner .
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 11]: ` Fifty thousand pounds will be scattered in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 5]: We must save ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 20]: We can do no more , and shall have reason to be thankful if we do as much . '
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 36]: Their first impulse was , to clamber along the roofs of the houses , and , knocking at some garret window for admission , pass down that way into the street , and so escape .
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 72]: But another fierce cry from below , and a general upturning of the faces of the crowd , apprised them that they were discovered , and even that Mr Haredale was recognised ; for Hugh , seeing him plainly in the bright glare of the fire , which in that part made it as light as day , called to him by his name , and swore to have his life .
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 24]: ` Leave me here , ' said Mr Haredale , ` and in Heaven 's name , my good friend , save yourself !
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 4]: Come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 35]: he muttered , as he turned towards Hugh and faced him without any further effort at concealment : ` This roof is high , and if we close , we will die together ! '
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 17]: ` Madness , ' said the honest vintner , pulling him back , ` sheer madness .
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 5]: Hear reason , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 7]: My good sir , hear reason .
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 31]: I could never make myself heard by knocking at a window now ; and even if I could , no one would be bold enough to connive at my escape .
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 23]: Through the cellars , there 's a kind of passage into the back street by which we roll casks in and out .
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 15]: We shall have time to get down there before they can force an entry .
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 25]: Do not delay an instant , but come with me -- for both our sakes -- for mine -- my dear good sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 19]: As he spoke , and drew Mr Haredale back , they had both a glimpse of the street .
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 74]: It was but a glimpse , but it showed them the crowd , gathering and clustering round the house : some of the armed men pressing to the front to break down the doors and windows , some bringing brands from the nearest fire , some with lifted faces following their course upon the roof and pointing them out to their companions : all raging and roaring like the flames they lighted up .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 83]: They saw some men thirsting for the treasures of strong liquor which they knew were stored within ; they saw others , who had been wounded , sinking down into the opposite doorways and dying , solitary wretches , in the midst of all the vast assemblage ; here a frightened woman trying to escape ; and there a lost child ; and there a drunken ruffian , unconscious of the death-wound on his head , raving and fighting to the last .
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 73]: All these things , and even such trivial incidents as a man with his hat off , or turning round , or stooping down , or shaking hands with another , they marked distinctly ; yet in a glance so brief , that , in the act of stepping back , they lost the whole , and saw but the pale faces of each other , and the red sky above them .
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 52]: Mr Haredale yielded to the entreaties of his companion -- more because he was resolved to defend him , than for any thought he had of his own life , or any care he entertained for his own safety -- and quickly re-entering the house , they descended the stairs together .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 64]: Loud blows were thundering on the shutters , crowbars were already thrust beneath the door , the glass fell from the sashes , a deep light shone through every crevice , and they heard the voices of the foremost in the crowd so close to every chink and keyhole , that they seemed to be hoarsely whispering their threats into their very ears .
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 24]: They had but a moment reached the bottom of the cellar-steps and shut the door behind them , when the mob broke in .
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 40]: The vaults were profoundly dark , and having no torch or candle -- for they had been afraid to carry one , lest it should betray their place of refuge -- they were obliged to grope with their hands .
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 90]: But they were not long without light , for they had not gone far when they heard the crowd forcing the door ; and , looking back among the low-arched passages , could see them in the distance , hurrying to and fro with flashing links , broaching the casks , staving the great vats , turning off upon the right hand and the left , into the different cellars , and lying down to drink at the channels of strong spirits which were already flowing on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 86]: They hurried on , not the less quickly for this ; and had reached the only vault which lay between them and the passage out , when suddenly , from the direction in which they were going , a strong light gleamed upon their faces ; and before they could slip aside , or turn back , or hide themselves , two men -LRB- one bearing a torch -RRB- came upon them , and cried in an astonished whisper , ` Here they are ! '
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 14]: At the same instant they pulled off what they wore upon their heads .
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 22]: Mr Haredale saw before him Edward Chester , and then saw , when the vintner gasped his name , Joe Willet .
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 58]: Ay , the same Joe , though with an arm the less , who used to make the quarterly journey on the grey mare to pay the bill to the purple-faced vintner ; and that very same purple-faced vintner , formerly of Thames Street , now looked him in the face , and challenged him by name .
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 21]: ` Give me your hand , ' said Joe softly , taking it whether the astonished vintner would or no .
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 24]: ` Do n't fear to shake it ; it 's a friendly one and a hearty one , though it has no fellow .
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 12]: Why , how well you look and how bluff you are !
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 9]: And you -- God bless you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 6]: Take heart , take heart .
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 5]: We 'll find them .
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 12]: Be of good cheer ; we have not been idle . '
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 29]: There was something so honest and frank in Joe 's speech , that Mr Haredale put his hand in his involuntarily , though their meeting was suspicious enough .
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 59]: But his glance at Edward Chester , and that gentleman 's keeping aloof , were not lost upon Joe , who said bluntly , glancing at Edward while he spoke : ` Times are changed , Mr Haredale , and times have come when we ought to know friends from enemies , and make no confusion of names .
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 29]: Let me tell you that but for this gentleman , you would most likely have been dead by this time , or badly wounded at the best . '
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 7]: ` What do you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 5]: cried Mr Haredale . '
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 49]: I say , ' said Joe , ` first , that it was a bold thing to be in the crowd at all disguised as one of them ; though I wo n't say much about that , on second thoughts , for that 's my case too .
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 30]: Secondly , that it was a brave and glorious action -- that 's what I call it -- to strike that fellow off his horse before their eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 4]: ` What fellow !
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 4]: Whose eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 7]: ` What fellow , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 26]: cried Joe : ' a fellow who has no goodwill to you , and who has the daring and devilry in him of twenty fellows .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 6]: I know him of old .
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 15]: Once in the house , HE would have found you , here or anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 23]: The rest owe you no particular grudge , and , unless they see you , will only think of drinking themselves dead .
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 5]: But we lose time .
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 5]: Are you ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 7]: ` Quite , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 12]: ` Put out the torch , Joe , and go on .
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 11]: And be silent , there 's a good fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 51]: ` Silent or not silent , ' murmured Joe , as he dropped the flaring link upon the ground , crushed it with his foot , and gave his hand to Mr Haredale , ` it was a brave and glorious action ; -- no man can alter that . '
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 27]: Both Mr Haredale and the worthy vintner were too amazed and too much hurried to ask any further questions , so followed their conductors in silence .
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 57]: It seemed , from a short whispering which presently ensued between them and the vintner relative to the best way of escape , that they had entered by the back-door , with the connivance of John Grueby , who watched outside with the key in his pocket , and whom they had taken into their confidence .
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 41]: A party of the crowd coming up that way , just as they entered , John had double-locked the door again , and made off for the soldiers , so that means of retreat was cut off from under them .
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 58]: However , as the front-door had been forced , and this minor crowd , being anxious to get at the liquor , had no fancy for losing time in breaking down another , but had gone round and got in from Holborn with the rest , the narrow lane in the rear was quite free of people .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 54]: So , when they had crawled through the passage indicated by the vintner -LRB- which was a mere shelving-trap for the admission of casks -RRB- , and had managed with some difficulty to unchain and raise the door at the upper end , they emerged into the street without being observed or interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 72]: Joe still holding Mr Haredale tight , and Edward taking the same care of the vintner , they hurried through the streets at a rapid pace ; occasionally standing aside to let some fugitives go by , or to keep out of the way of the soldiers who followed them , and whose questions , when they halted to put any , were speedily stopped by one whispered word from Joe .
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 52]: Chapter 68 While Newgate was burning on the previous night , Barnaby and his father , having been passed among the crowd from hand to hand , stood in Smithfield , on the outskirts of the mob , gazing at the flames like men who had been suddenly roused from sleep .
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 54]: Some moments elapsed before they could distinctly remember where they were , or how they got there ; or recollected that while they were standing idle and listless spectators of the fire , they had tools in their hands which had been hurriedly given them that they might free themselves from their fetters .
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 55]: Barnaby , heavily ironed as he was , if he had obeyed his first impulse , or if he had been alone , would have made his way back to the side of Hugh , who to his clouded intellect now shone forth with the new lustre of being his preserver and truest friend .
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 40]: But his father 's terror of remaining in the streets , communicated itself to him when he comprehended the full extent of his fears , and impressed him with the same eagerness to fly to a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 46]: In a corner of the market among the pens for cattle , Barnaby knelt down , and pausing every now and then to pass his hand over his father 's face , or look up to him with a smile , knocked off his irons .
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 52]: When he had seen him spring , a free man , to his feet , and had given vent to the transport of delight which the sight awakened , he went to work upon his own , which soon fell rattling down upon the ground , and left his limbs unfettered .
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 79]: Gliding away together when this task was accomplished , and passing several groups of men , each gathered round a stooping figure to hide him from those who passed , but unable to repress the clanking sound of hammers , which told that they too were busy at the same work , -- the two fugitives made towards Clerkenwell , and passing thence to Islington , as the nearest point of egress , were quickly in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 40]: After wandering about for a long time , they found in a pasture near Finchley a poor shed , with walls of mud , and roof of grass and brambles , built for some cowherd , but now deserted .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 12]: Here , they lay down for the rest of the night .
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 35]: They wandered to and fro when it was day , and once Barnaby went off alone to a cluster of little cottages two or three miles away , to purchase some bread and milk .
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 22]: But finding no better shelter , they returned to the same place , and lay down again to wait for night .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 92]: Heaven alone can tell , with what vague hopes of duty , and affection ; with what strange promptings of nature , intelligible to him as to a man of radiant mind and most enlarged capacity ; with what dim memories of children he had played with when a child himself , who had prattled of their fathers , and of loving them , and being loved ; with how many half-remembered , dreamy associations of his mother 's grief and tears and widowhood ; he watched and tended this man .
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 74]: But that a vague and shadowy crowd of such ideas came slowly on him ; that they taught him to be sorry when he looked upon his haggard face , that they overflowed his eyes when he stooped to kiss him , that they kept him waking in a tearful gladness , shading him from the sun , fanning him with leaves , soothing him when he started in his sleep -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 24]: what a troubled sleep it was -- and wondering when SHE would come to join them and be happy , is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 69]: He sat beside him all that day ; listening for her footsteps in every breath of air , looking for her shadow on the gently-waving grass , twining the hedge flowers for her pleasure when she came , and his when he awoke ; and stooping down from time to time to listen to his mutterings , and wonder why he was so restless in that quiet place .
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 70]: The sun went down , and night came on , and he was still quite tranquil ; busied with these thoughts , as if there were no other people in the world , and the dull cloud of smoke hanging on the immense city in the distance , hid no vices , no crimes , no life or death , or cause of disquiet -- nothing but clear air .
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 48]: But the hour had now come when he must go alone to find out the blind man -LRB- a task that filled him with delight -RRB- and bring him to that place ; taking especial care that he was not watched or followed on his way back .
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 58]: He listened to the directions he must observe , repeated them again and again , and after twice or thrice returning to surprise his father with a light-hearted laugh , went forth , at last , upon his errand : leaving Grip , whom he had carried from the jail in his arms , to his care .
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 37]: Fleet of foot , and anxious to return , he sped swiftly on towards the city , but could not reach it before the fires began , and made the night angry with their dismal lustre .
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 61]: When he entered the town -- it might be that he was changed by going there without his late companions , and on no violent errand ; or by the beautiful solitude in which he had passed the day , or by the thoughts that had come upon him , -- but it seemed peopled by a legion of devils .
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 27]: This flight and pursuit , this cruel burning and destroying , these dreadful cries and stunning noises , were THEY the good lord 's noble cause !
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 17]: Though almost stupefied by the bewildering scene , still be found the blind man 's house .
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 7]: It was shut up and tenantless .
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 12]: He waited for a long while , but no one came .
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 61]: At last he withdrew ; and as he knew by this time that the soldiers were firing , and many people must have been killed , he went down into Holborn , where he heard the great crowd was , to try if he could find Hugh , and persuade him to avoid the danger , and return with him .
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 42]: If he had been stunned and shocked before , his horror was increased a thousandfold when he got into this vortex of the riot , and not being an actor in the terrible spectacle , had it all before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 31]: But there , in the midst , towering above them all , close before the house they were attacking now , was Hugh on horseback , calling to the rest !
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 78]: Sickened by the sights surrounding him on every side , and by the heat and roar , and crash , he forced his way among the crowd -LRB- where many recognised him , and with shouts pressed back to let him pass -RRB- , and in time was nearly up with Hugh , who was savagely threatening some one , but whom or what he said , he could not , in the great confusion , understand .
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 33]: At that moment the crowd forced their way into the house , and Hugh -- it was impossible to see by what means , in such a concourse -- fell headlong down .
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 11]: Barnaby was beside him when he staggered to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 26]: It was well he made him hear his voice , or Hugh , with his uplifted axe , would have cleft his skull in twain .
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 5]: ` Barnaby -- you !
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 11]: Whose hand was that , that struck me down ? '
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 5]: ` Not mine . '
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 3]: ` Whose !
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 7]: -- I say , whose ! '
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 11]: he cried , reeling back , and looking wildly round .
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 6]: ` What are you doing ?
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 4]: Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 4]: Show me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 33]: ` You are hurt , ' said Barnaby -- as indeed he was , in the head , both by the blow he had received , and by his horse 's hoof .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 7]: ` Come away with me . '
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 23]: As he spoke , he took the horse 's bridle in his hand , turned him , and dragged Hugh several paces .
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 20]: This brought them out of the crowd , which was pouring from the street into the vintner 's cellars .
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 9]: ` Where 's -- where 's Dennis ? '
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 16]: said Hugh , coming to a stop , and checking Barnaby with his strong arm .
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 8]: ` Where has he been all day ?
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 18]: What did he mean by leaving me as he did , in the jail , last night ?
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 9]: Tell me , you -- d'ye hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 18]: With a flourish of his dangerous weapon , he fell down upon the ground like a log .
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 47]: After a minute , though already frantic with drinking and with the wound in his head , he crawled to a stream of burning spirit which was pouring down the kennel , and began to drink at it as if it were a brook of water .
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 11]: Barnaby drew him away , and forced him to rise .
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 24]: Though he could neither stand nor walk , he involuntarily staggered to his horse , climbed upon his back , and clung there .
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 43]: After vainly attempting to divest the animal of his clanking trappings , Barnaby sprung up behind him , snatched the bridle , turned into Leather Lane , which was close at hand , and urged the frightened horse into a heavy trot .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 35]: He looked back , once , before he left the street ; and looked upon a sight not easily to be erased , even from his remembrance , so long as he had life .
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 19]: The vintner 's house with a half-a-dozen others near at hand , was one great , glowing blaze .
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 63]: All night , no one had essayed to quench the flames , or stop their progress ; but now a body of soldiers were actively engaged in pulling down two old wooden houses , which were every moment in danger of taking fire , and which could scarcely fail , if they were left to burn , to extend the conflagration immensely .
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 172]: The tumbling down of nodding walls and heavy blocks of wood , the hooting and the execrations of the crowd , the distant firing of other military detachments , the distracted looks and cries of those whose habitations were in danger , the hurrying to and fro of frightened people with their goods ; the reflections in every quarter of the sky , of deep , red , soaring flames , as though the last day had come and the whole universe were burning ; the dust , and smoke , and drift of fiery particles , scorching and kindling all it fell upon ; the hot unwholesome vapour , the blight on everything ; the stars , and moon , and very sky , obliterated ; -- made up such a sum of dreariness and ruin , that it seemed as if the face of Heaven were blotted out , and night , in its rest and quiet , and softened light , never could look upon the earth again .
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 27]: But there was a worse spectacle than this -- worse by far than fire and smoke , or even the rabble 's unappeasable and maniac rage .
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 50]: The gutters of the street , and every crack and fissure in the stones , ran with scorching spirit , which being dammed up by busy hands , overflowed the road and pavement , and formed a great pool , into which the people dropped down dead by dozens .
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 40]: They lay in heaps all round this fearful pond , husbands and wives , fathers and sons , mothers and daughters , women with children in their arms and babies at their breasts , and drank until they died .
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 57]: While some stooped with their lips to the brink and never raised their heads again , others sprang up from their fiery draught , and danced , half in a mad triumph , and half in the agony of suffocation , until they fell , and steeped their corpses in the liquor that had killed them .
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 19]: Nor was even this the worst or most appalling kind of death that happened on this fatal night .
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 92]: From the burning cellars , where they drank out of hats , pails , buckets , tubs , and shoes , some men were drawn , alive , but all alight from head to foot ; who , in their unendurable anguish and suffering , making for anything that had the look of water , rolled , hissing , in this hideous lake , and splashed up liquid fire which lapped in all it met with as it ran along the surface , and neither spared the living nor the dead .
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 45]: On this last night of the great riots -- for the last night it was -- the wretched victims of a senseless outcry , became themselves the dust and ashes of the flames they had kindled , and strewed the public streets of London .
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 53]: With all he saw in this last glance fixed indelibly upon his mind , Barnaby hurried from the city which enclosed such horrors ; and holding down his head that he might not even see the glare of the fires upon the quiet landscape , was soon in the still country roads .
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 43]: He stopped at about half-a-mile from the shed where his father lay , and with some difficulty making Hugh sensible that he must dismount , sunk the horse 's furniture in a pool of stagnant water , and turned the animal loose .
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 19]: That done , he supported his companion as well as he could , and led him slowly forward .
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 51]: Chapter 69 It was the dead of night , and very dark , when Barnaby , with his stumbling comrade , approached the place where he had left his father ; but he could see him stealing away into the gloom , distrustful even of him , and rapidly retreating .
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 34]: After calling to him twice or thrice that there was nothing to fear , but without effect , he suffered Hugh to sink upon the ground , and followed to bring him back .
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 31]: He continued to creep away , until Barnaby was close upon him ; then turned , and said in a terrible , though suppressed voice : ` Let me go .
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 7]: Do not lay hands upon me .
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 15]: You have told her ; and you and she together have betrayed me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 8]: Barnaby looked at him , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 8]: ` You have seen your mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 9]: ` No , ' cried Barnaby , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 13]: ` Not for a long time -- longer than I can tell .
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 7]: A whole year , I think .
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 5]: Is she here ? '
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 49]: His father looked upon him steadfastly for a few moments , and then said -- drawing nearer to him as he spoke , for , seeing his face , and hearing his words , it was impossible to doubt his truth : ` What man is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 5]: ` Hugh -- Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 3]: Only Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 4]: You know him .
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 6]: HE will not harm you .
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 8]: Why , you 're afraid of Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 10]: Afraid of gruff , old , noisy Hugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 36]: ` What man is he , I ask you , ' he rejoined so fiercely , that Barnaby stopped in his laugh , and shrinking back , surveyed him with a look of terrified amazement .
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 8]: ` Why , how stern you are !
Parsing [sent. 10565 len. 12]: You make me fear you , though you are my father .
Parsing [sent. 10566 len. 9]: Why do you speak to me so ? '
Parsing [sent. 10567 len. 46]: -- ' I want , ' he answered , putting away the hand which his son , with a timid desire to propitiate him , laid upon his sleeve , -- ' I want an answer , and you give me only jeers and questions .
Parsing [sent. 10568 len. 22]: Who have you brought with you to this hiding-place , poor fool ; and where is the blind man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10569 len. 6]: I do n't know where .
Parsing [sent. 10570 len. 6]: His house was close shut .
Parsing [sent. 10571 len. 15]: I waited , but no person came ; that was no fault of mine .
Parsing [sent. 10572 len. 19]: This is Hugh -- brave Hugh , who broke into that ugly jail , and set us free .
Parsing [sent. 10573 len. 2]: Aha !
Parsing [sent. 10574 len. 8]: You like him now , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 10575 len. 6]: You like him now ! '
Parsing [sent. 10576 len. 10]: ` Why does he lie upon the ground ? '
Parsing [sent. 10577 len. 12]: ` He has had a fall , and has been drinking .
Parsing [sent. 10578 len. 23]: The fields and trees go round , and round , and round with him , and the ground heaves under his feet .
Parsing [sent. 10579 len. 4]: You know him ?
Parsing [sent. 10580 len. 3]: You remember ?
Parsing [sent. 10581 len. 3]: See ! '
Parsing [sent. 10582 len. 23]: They had by this time returned to where he lay , and both stooped over him to look into his face . '
Parsing [sent. 10583 len. 10]: I recollect the man , ' his father murmured .
Parsing [sent. 10584 len. 9]: ` Why did you bring him here ? '
Parsing [sent. 10585 len. 15]: ` Because he would have been killed if I had left him over yonder .
Parsing [sent. 10586 len. 8]: They were firing guns and shedding blood .
Parsing [sent. 10587 len. 11]: Does the sight of blood turn you sick , father ?
Parsing [sent. 10588 len. 9]: I see it does , by your face .
Parsing [sent. 10589 len. 12]: That 's like me -- What are you looking at ? '
Parsing [sent. 10590 len. 5]: ` At nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 10591 len. 28]: said the murderer softly , as he started back a pace or two , and gazed with sunken jaw and staring eyes above his son 's head .
Parsing [sent. 10592 len. 5]: ` At nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 10593 len. 40]: He remained in the same attitude and with the same expression on his face for a minute or more ; then glanced slowly round as if he had lost something ; and went shivering back , towards the shed .
Parsing [sent. 10594 len. 10]: ` Shall I bring him in , father ? '
Parsing [sent. 10595 len. 10]: asked Barnaby , who had looked on , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 10596 len. 29]: He only answered with a suppressed groan , and lying down upon the ground , wrapped his cloak about his head , and shrunk into the darkest corner .
Parsing [sent. 10597 len. 66]: Finding that nothing would rouse Hugh now , or make him sensible for a moment , Barnaby dragged him along the grass , and laid him on a little heap of refuse hay and straw which had been his own bed ; first having brought some water from a running stream hard by , and washed his wound , and laved his hands and face .
Parsing [sent. 10598 len. 25]: Then he lay down himself , between the two , to pass the night ; and looking at the stars , fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 10599 len. 37]: Awakened early in the morning , by the sunshine and the songs of birds , and hum of insects , he left them sleeping in the hut , and walked into the sweet and pleasant air .
Parsing [sent. 10600 len. 52]: But he felt that on his jaded senses , oppressed and burdened with the dreadful scenes of last night , and many nights before , all the beauties of opening day , which he had so often tasted , and in which he had had such deep delight , fell heavily .
Parsing [sent. 10601 len. 30]: He thought of the blithe mornings when he and the dogs went bounding on together through the woods and fields ; and the recollection filled his eyes with tears .
Parsing [sent. 10602 len. 89]: He had no consciousness , God help him , of having done wrong , nor had he any new perception of the merits of the cause in which he had been engaged , or those of the men who advocated it ; but he was full of cares now , and regrets , and dismal recollections , and wishes -LRB- quite unknown to him before -RRB- that this or that event had never happened , and that the sorrow and suffering of so many people had been spared .
Parsing [sent. 10603 len. 80]: And now he began to think how happy they would be -- his father , mother , he , and Hugh -- if they rambled away together , and lived in some lonely place , where there were none of these troubles ; and that perhaps the blind man , who had talked so wisely about gold , and told him of the great secrets he knew , could teach them how to live without being pinched by want .
Parsing [sent. 10604 len. 41]: As this occurred to him , he was the more sorry that he had not seen him last night ; and he was still brooding over this regret , when his father came , and touched him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 10605 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10606 len. 10]: cried Barnaby , starting from his fit of thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 10607 len. 7]: ` Is it only you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10608 len. 8]: ` Who should it be ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10609 len. 15]: I almost thought , ' he answered , ` it was the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 10610 len. 11]: I must have some talk with him , father . '
Parsing [sent. 10611 len. 30]: ` And so must I , for without seeing him , I do n't know where to fly or what to do , and lingering here , is death .
Parsing [sent. 10612 len. 13]: You must go to him again , and bring him here . '
Parsing [sent. 10613 len. 5]: ` Must I ! '
Parsing [sent. 10614 len. 12]: cried Barnaby , delighted ; ` that 's brave , father .
Parsing [sent. 10615 len. 9]: That 's what I want to do . '
Parsing [sent. 10616 len. 12]: ` But you must bring only him , and none other .
Parsing [sent. 10617 len. 26]: And though you wait at his door a whole day and night , still you must wait , and not come back without him . '
Parsing [sent. 10618 len. 12]: ` Do n't you fear that , ' he cried gaily .
Parsing [sent. 10619 len. 10]: ` He shall come , he shall come . '
Parsing [sent. 10620 len. 33]: ` Trim off these gewgaws , ' said his father , plucking the scraps of ribbon and the feathers from his hat , ` and over your own dress wear my cloak .
Parsing [sent. 10621 len. 19]: Take heed how you go , and they will be too busy in the streets to notice you .
Parsing [sent. 10622 len. 19]: Of your coming back you need take no account , for he 'll manage that , safely . '
Parsing [sent. 10623 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 10624 len. 3]: said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 10625 len. 7]: ` To be sure he will !
Parsing [sent. 10626 len. 16]: A wise man , father , and one who can teach us to be rich .
Parsing [sent. 10627 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10628 len. 9]: I know him , I know him . '
Parsing [sent. 10629 len. 14]: He was speedily dressed , and as well disguised as he could be .
Parsing [sent. 10630 len. 42]: With a lighter heart he then set off upon his second journey , leaving Hugh , who was still in a drunken stupor , stretched upon the ground within the shed , and his father walking to and fro before it .
Parsing [sent. 10631 len. 45]: The murderer , full of anxious thoughts , looked after him , and paced up and down , disquieted by every breath of air that whispered among the boughs , and by every light shadow thrown by the passing clouds upon the daisied ground .
Parsing [sent. 10632 len. 29]: He was anxious for his safe return , and yet , though his own life and safety hung upon it , felt a relief while he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 10633 len. 39]: In the intense selfishness which the constant presence before him of his great crimes , and their consequences here and hereafter , engendered , every thought of Barnaby , as his son , was swallowed up and lost .
Parsing [sent. 10634 len. 52]: Still , his presence was a torture and reproach ; in his wild eyes , there were terrible images of that guilty night ; with his unearthly aspect , and his half-formed mind , he seemed to the murderer a creature who had sprung into existence from his victim 's blood .
Parsing [sent. 10635 len. 54]: He could not bear his look , his voice , his touch ; and yet he was forced , by his own desperate condition and his only hope of cheating the gibbet , to have him by his side , and to know that he was inseparable from his single chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 10636 len. 31]: He walked to and fro , with little rest , all day , revolving these things in his mind ; and still Hugh lay , unconscious , in the shed .
Parsing [sent. 10637 len. 28]: At length , when the sun was setting , Barnaby returned , leading the blind man , and talking earnestly to him as they came along together .
Parsing [sent. 10638 len. 45]: The murderer advanced to meet them , and bidding his son go on and speak to Hugh , who had just then staggered to his feet , took his place at the blind man 's elbow , and slowly followed , towards the shed .
Parsing [sent. 10639 len. 8]: ` Why did you send HIM ? '
Parsing [sent. 10640 len. 3]: said Stagg .
Parsing [sent. 10641 len. 20]: ` Do n't you know it was the way to have him lost , as soon as found ? '
Parsing [sent. 10642 len. 10]: ` Would you have had me come myself ? '
Parsing [sent. 10643 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 10644 len. 3]: ` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 10645 len. 3]: Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 10646 len. 16]: I was before the jail on Tuesday night , but missed you in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 10647 len. 8]: I was out last night , too .
Parsing [sent. 10648 len. 24]: There was good work last night -- gay work -- profitable work ' -- he added , rattling the money in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 10649 len. 12]: ` Have you -- ' -- ` Seen your good lady ?
Parsing [sent. 10650 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 10651 len. 13]: ` Do you mean to tell me more , or not ? '
Parsing [sent. 10652 len. 17]: ` I 'll tell you all , ' returned the blind man , with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 10653 len. 13]: ` Excuse me -- but I love to see you so impatient .
Parsing [sent. 10654 len. 7]: There 's energy in it . '
Parsing [sent. 10655 len. 14]: ` Does she consent to say the word that may save me ? '
Parsing [sent. 10656 len. 18]: ` No , ' returned the blind man emphatically , as he turned his face towards him .
Parsing [sent. 10657 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 10658 len. 4]: Thus it is .
Parsing [sent. 10659 len. 23]: She has been at death 's door since she lost her darling -- has been insensible , and I know not what .
Parsing [sent. 10660 len. 19]: I tracked her to a hospital , and presented myself -LRB- with your leave -RRB- at her bedside .
Parsing [sent. 10661 len. 24]: Our talk was not a long one , for she was weak , and there being people near I was not quite easy .
Parsing [sent. 10662 len. 25]: But I told her all that you and I agreed upon , and pointed out the young gentleman 's position , in strong terms .
Parsing [sent. 10663 len. 22]: She tried to soften me , but that , of course -LRB- as I told her -RRB- , was lost time .
Parsing [sent. 10664 len. 14]: She cried and moaned , you may be sure ; all women do .
Parsing [sent. 10665 len. 48]: Then , of a sudden , she found her voice and strength , and said that Heaven would help her and her innocent son ; and that to Heaven she appealed against us -- which she did ; in really very pretty language , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 10666 len. 60]: I advised her , as a friend , not to count too much on assistance from any such distant quarter -- recommended her to think of it -- told her where I lived -- said I knew she would send to me before noon , next day -- and left her , either in a faint or shamming . '
Parsing [sent. 10667 len. 55]: When he had concluded this narration , during which he had made several pauses , for the convenience of cracking and eating nuts , of which he seemed to have a pocketful , the blind man pulled a flask from his pocket , took a draught himself , and offered it to his companion .
Parsing [sent. 10668 len. 10]: ` You wo n't , wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10669 len. 11]: he said , feeling that he pushed it from him .
Parsing [sent. 10670 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 10671 len. 12]: Then the gallant gentleman who 's lodging with you , will .
Parsing [sent. 10672 len. 5]: Hallo , bully ! '
Parsing [sent. 10673 len. 4]: ` Death ! '
Parsing [sent. 10674 len. 8]: said the other , holding him back .
Parsing [sent. 10675 len. 12]: ` Will you tell me what I am to do ! '
Parsing [sent. 10676 len. 3]: ` Do !
Parsing [sent. 10677 len. 3]: Nothing easier .
Parsing [sent. 10678 len. 44]: Make a moonlight flitting in two hours ' time with the young gentleman -LRB- he 's quite ready to go ; I have been giving him good advice as we came along -RRB- , and get as far from London as you can .
Parsing [sent. 10679 len. 14]: Let me know where you are , and leave the rest to me .
Parsing [sent. 10680 len. 41]: She MUST come round ; she ca n't hold out long ; and as to the chances of your being retaken in the meanwhile , why it was n't one man who got out of Newgate , but three hundred .
Parsing [sent. 10681 len. 9]: Think of that , for your comfort . '
Parsing [sent. 10682 len. 6]: ` We must support life .
Parsing [sent. 10683 len. 3]: How ? '
Parsing [sent. 10684 len. 4]: ` How ! '
Parsing [sent. 10685 len. 5]: repeated the blind man .
Parsing [sent. 10686 len. 6]: ` By eating and drinking .
Parsing [sent. 10687 len. 13]: And how get meat and drink , but by paying for it !
Parsing [sent. 10688 len. 3]: Money ! '
Parsing [sent. 10689 len. 7]: he cried , slapping his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 10690 len. 6]: ` Is money the word ?
Parsing [sent. 10691 len. 9]: Why , the streets have been running money .
Parsing [sent. 10692 len. 25]: Devil send that the sport 's not over yet , for these are jolly times ; golden , rare , roaring , scrambling times .
Parsing [sent. 10693 len. 4]: Hallo , bully !
Parsing [sent. 10694 len. 2]: Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 10695 len. 2]: Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 10696 len. 6]: Drink , bully , drink .
Parsing [sent. 10697 len. 5]: Where are ye there !
Parsing [sent. 10698 len. 3]: Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 10699 len. 39]: With such vociferations , and with a boisterous manner which bespoke his perfect abandonment to the general licence and disorder , he groped his way towards the shed , where Hugh and Barnaby were sitting on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 10700 len. 6]: ` Put it about ! '
Parsing [sent. 10701 len. 9]: he cried , handing his flask to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10702 len. 9]: ` The kennels run with wine and gold .
Parsing [sent. 10703 len. 10]: Guineas and strong water flow from the very pumps .
Parsing [sent. 10704 len. 10]: About with it , do n't spare it ! '
Parsing [sent. 10705 len. 61]: Exhausted , unwashed , unshorn , begrimed with smoke and dust , his hair clotted with blood , his voice quite gone , so that he spoke in whispers ; his skin parched up by fever , his whole body bruised and cut , and beaten about , Hugh still took the flask , and raised it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 10706 len. 24]: He was in the act of drinking , when the front of the shed was suddenly darkened , and Dennis stood before them .
Parsing [sent. 10707 len. 37]: ` No offence , no offence , ' said that personage in a conciliatory tone , as Hugh stopped in his draught , and eyed him , with no pleasant look , from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 10708 len. 6]: ` No offence , brother .
Parsing [sent. 10709 len. 6]: Barnaby here too , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 10710 len. 6]: How are you , Barnaby ?
Parsing [sent. 10711 len. 5]: And two other gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 10712 len. 6]: Your humble servant , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 10713 len. 9]: No offence to YOU either , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 10714 len. 5]: Eh , brothers ? '
Parsing [sent. 10715 len. 27]: Notwithstanding that he spoke in this very friendly and confident manner , he seemed to have considerable hesitation about entering , and remained outside the roof .
Parsing [sent. 10716 len. 54]: He was rather better dressed than usual : wearing the same suit of threadbare black , it is true , but having round his neck an unwholesome-looking cravat of a yellowish white ; and , on his hands , great leather gloves , such as a gardener might wear in following his trade .
Parsing [sent. 10717 len. 35]: His shoes were newly greased , and ornamented with a pair of rusty iron buckles ; the packthread at his knees had been renewed ; and where he wanted buttons , he wore pins .
Parsing [sent. 10718 len. 44]: Altogether , he had something the look of a tipstaff , or a bailiff 's follower , desperately faded , but who had a notion of keeping up the appearance of a professional character , and making the best of the worst means .
Parsing [sent. 10719 len. 34]: ` You 're very snug here , ' said Mr Dennis , pulling out a mouldy pocket-handkerchief , which looked like a decomposed halter , and wiping his forehead in a nervous manner .
Parsing [sent. 10720 len. 19]: ` Not snug enough to prevent your finding us , it seems , ' Hugh answered , sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 10721 len. 45]: ` Why I 'll tell you what , brother , ' said Dennis , with a friendly smile , ` when you do n't want me to know which way you 're riding , you must wear another sort of bells on your horse .
Parsing [sent. 10722 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10723 len. 24]: I know the sound of them you wore last night , and have got quick ears for 'em ; that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 10724 len. 10]: Well , but how are you , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 10725 len. 16]: He had by this time approached , and now ventured to sit down by him .
Parsing [sent. 10726 len. 6]: ` How am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 10727 len. 3]: answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10728 len. 6]: ` Where were you yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 10729 len. 12]: Where did you go when you left me in the jail ?
Parsing [sent. 10730 len. 6]: Why did you leave me ?
Parsing [sent. 10731 len. 20]: And what did you mean by rolling your eyes and shaking your fist at me , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10732 len. 5]: I shake my fist !
Parsing [sent. 10733 len. 7]: -- at you , brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 10734 len. 14]: said Dennis , gently checking Hugh 's uplifted hand , which looked threatening .
Parsing [sent. 10735 len. 12]: ` Your stick , then ; it 's all one . '
Parsing [sent. 10736 len. 11]: ` Lord love you , brother , I meant nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10737 len. 8]: You do n't understand me by half .
Parsing [sent. 10738 len. 47]: I should n't wonder now , ' he added , in the tone of a desponding and an injured man , ` but you thought , because I wanted them chaps left in the prison , that I was a going to desert the banners ? '
Parsing [sent. 10739 len. 14]: Hugh told him , with an oath , that he had thought so .
Parsing [sent. 10740 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 10741 len. 27]: said Mr Dennis , mournfully , ` if you a n't enough to make a man mistrust his feller-creeturs , I do n't know what is .
Parsing [sent. 10742 len. 4]: Desert the banners !
Parsing [sent. 10743 len. 2]: Me !
Parsing [sent. 10744 len. 12]: Ned Dennis , as was so christened by his own father !
Parsing [sent. 10745 len. 11]: -- Is this axe your ` n , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 10746 len. 38]: Yes , it 's mine , ' said Hugh , in the same sullen manner as before ; ` it might have hurt you , if you had come in its way once or twice last night .
Parsing [sent. 10747 len. 5]: Put it down . '
Parsing [sent. 10748 len. 7]: ` Might have hurt me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10749 len. 21]: said Mr Dennis , still keeping it in his hand , and feeling the edge with an air of abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 10750 len. 6]: ` Might have hurt me !
Parsing [sent. 10751 len. 13]: and me exerting myself all the time to the wery best advantage .
Parsing [sent. 10752 len. 5]: Here 's a world !
Parsing [sent. 10753 len. 22]: And you 're not a-going to ask me to take a sup out of that ` ere bottle , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 10754 len. 6]: Hugh passed it towards him .
Parsing [sent. 10755 len. 23]: As he raised it to his lips , Barnaby jumped up , and motioning them to be silent , looked eagerly out .
Parsing [sent. 10756 len. 9]: ` What 's the matter , Barnaby ? '
Parsing [sent. 10757 len. 20]: said Dennis , glancing at Hugh and dropping the flask , but still holding the axe in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10758 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 10759 len. 4]: he answered softly .
Parsing [sent. 10760 len. 11]: ` What do I see glittering behind the hedge ? '
Parsing [sent. 10761 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 10762 len. 20]: cried the hangman , raising his voice to its highest pitch , and laying hold of him and Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10763 len. 7]: ` Not SOLDIERS , surely ! '
Parsing [sent. 10764 len. 27]: That moment , the shed was filled with armed men ; and a body of horse , galloping into the field , drew up before it .
Parsing [sent. 10765 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 10766 len. 33]: said Dennis , who remained untouched among them when they had seized their prisoners ; ` it 's them two young ones , gentlemen , that the proclamation puts a price on .
Parsing [sent. 10767 len. 7]: This other 's an escaped felon .
Parsing [sent. 10768 len. 62]: -- I 'm sorry for it , brother , ' he added , in a tone of resignation , addressing himself to Hugh ; ` but you 've brought it on yourself ; you forced me to do it ; you would n't respect the soundest constitootional principles , you know ; you went and wiolated the wery framework of society .
Parsing [sent. 10769 len. 20]: I had sooner have given away a trifle in charity than done this , I would upon my soul .
Parsing [sent. 10770 len. 28]: -- If you 'll keep fast hold on 'em , gentlemen , I think I can make a shift to tie 'em better than you can . '
Parsing [sent. 10771 len. 14]: But this operation was postponed for a few moments by a new occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 10772 len. 37]: The blind man , whose ears were quicker than most people 's sight , had been alarmed , before Barnaby , by a rustling in the bushes , under cover of which the soldiers had advanced .
Parsing [sent. 10773 len. 34]: He retreated instantly -- had hidden somewhere for a minute -- and probably in his confusion mistaking the point at which he had emerged , was now seen running across the open meadow .
Parsing [sent. 10774 len. 15]: An officer cried directly that he had helped to plunder a house last night .
Parsing [sent. 10775 len. 9]: He was loudly called on , to surrender .
Parsing [sent. 10776 len. 17]: He ran the harder , and in a few seconds would have been out of gunshot .
Parsing [sent. 10777 len. 10]: The word was given , and the men fired .
Parsing [sent. 10778 len. 19]: There was a breathless pause and a profound silence , during which all eyes were fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 10779 len. 18]: He had been seen to start at the discharge , as if the report had frightened him .
Parsing [sent. 10780 len. 20]: But he neither stopped nor slackened his pace in the least , and ran on full forty yards further .
Parsing [sent. 10781 len. 22]: Then , without one reel or stagger , or sign of faintness , or quivering of any limb , he dropped .
Parsing [sent. 10782 len. 16]: Some of them hurried up to where he lay ; -- the hangman with them .
Parsing [sent. 10783 len. 35]: Everything had passed so quickly , that the smoke had not yet scattered , but curled slowly off in a little cloud , which seemed like the dead man 's spirit moving solemnly away .
Parsing [sent. 10784 len. 23]: There were a few drops of blood upon the grass -- more , when they turned him over -- that was all .
Parsing [sent. 10785 len. 4]: ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 10786 len. 4]: Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 10787 len. 24]: said the hangman , stooping one knee beside the body , and gazing up with a disconsolate face at the officer and men .
Parsing [sent. 10788 len. 8]: ` Here 's a pretty sight ! '
Parsing [sent. 10789 len. 12]: ` Stand out of the way , ' replied the officer .
Parsing [sent. 10790 len. 3]: ` Serjeant !
Parsing [sent. 10791 len. 8]: see what he had about him . '
Parsing [sent. 10792 len. 26]: The man turned his pockets out upon the grass , and counted , besides some foreign coins and two rings , five-and-forty guineas in gold .
Parsing [sent. 10793 len. 35]: These were bundled up in a handkerchief and carried away ; the body remained there for the present , but six men and the serjeant were left to take it to the nearest public-house .
Parsing [sent. 10794 len. 32]: ` Now then , if you 're going , ' said the serjeant , clapping Dennis on the back , and pointing after the officer who was walking towards the shed .
Parsing [sent. 10795 len. 15]: To which Mr Dennis only replied , ` Do n't talk to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10796 len. 19]: and then repeated what he had said before , namely , ` Here 's a pretty sight ! '
Parsing [sent. 10797 len. 21]: ` It 's not one that you care for much , I should think , ' observed the serjeant coolly .
Parsing [sent. 10798 len. 23]: ` Why , who , ' said Mr Dennis rising , ` should care for it , if I do n't ? '
Parsing [sent. 10799 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10800 len. 14]: I did n't know you was so tender-hearted , ' said the serjeant .
Parsing [sent. 10801 len. 6]: ` That 's all ! '
Parsing [sent. 10802 len. 4]: ` Tender-hearted ! '
Parsing [sent. 10803 len. 3]: echoed Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 10804 len. 3]: ` Tender-hearted !
Parsing [sent. 10805 len. 5]: Look at this man .
Parsing [sent. 10806 len. 6]: Do you call THIS constitootional ?
Parsing [sent. 10807 len. 17]: Do you see him shot through and through instead of being worked off like a Briton ?
Parsing [sent. 10808 len. 11]: Damme , if I know which party to side with .
Parsing [sent. 10809 len. 8]: You 're as bad as the other .
Parsing [sent. 10810 len. 22]: What 's to become of the country if the military power 's to go a superseding the ciwilians in this way ?
Parsing [sent. 10811 len. 22]: Where 's this poor feller-creetur 's rights as a citizen , that he did n't have ME in his last moments !
Parsing [sent. 10812 len. 4]: I was here .
Parsing [sent. 10813 len. 4]: I was willing .
Parsing [sent. 10814 len. 4]: I was ready .
Parsing [sent. 10815 len. 31]: These are nice times , brother , to have the dead crying out against us in this way , and sleep comfortably in our beds arterwards ; wery nice ! '
Parsing [sent. 10816 len. 19]: Whether he derived any material consolation from binding the prisoners , is uncertain ; most probably he did .
Parsing [sent. 10817 len. 31]: At all events his being summoned to that work , diverted him , for the time , from these painful reflections , and gave his thoughts a more congenial occupation .
Parsing [sent. 10818 len. 55]: They were not all three carried off together , but in two parties ; Barnaby and his father , going by one road in the centre of a body of foot ; and Hugh , fast bound upon a horse , and strongly guarded by a troop of cavalry , being taken by another .
Parsing [sent. 10819 len. 23]: They had no opportunity for the least communication , in the short interval which preceded their departure ; being kept strictly apart .
Parsing [sent. 10820 len. 33]: Hugh only observed that Barnaby walked with a drooping head among his guard , and , without raising his eyes , that he tried to wave his fettered hand when he passed .
Parsing [sent. 10821 len. 34]: For himself , he buoyed up his courage as he rode along , with the assurance that the mob would force his jail wherever it might be , and set him at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 10822 len. 52]: But when they got into London , and more especially into Fleet Market , lately the stronghold of the rioters , where the military were rooting out the last remnant of the crowd , he saw that this hope was gone , and felt that he was riding to his death .
Parsing [sent. 10823 len. 43]: Chapter 70 Mr Dennis having despatched this piece of business without any personal hurt or inconvenience , and having now retired into the tranquil respectability of private life , resolved to solace himself with half an hour or so of female society .
Parsing [sent. 10824 len. 39]: With this amiable purpose in his mind , he bent his steps towards the house where Dolly and Miss Haredale were still confined , and whither Miss Miggs had also been removed by order of Mr Simon Tappertit .
Parsing [sent. 10825 len. 49]: As he walked along the streets with his leather gloves clasped behind him , and his face indicative of cheerful thought and pleasant calculation , Mr Dennis might have been likened unto a farmer ruminating among his crops , and enjoying by anticipation the bountiful gifts of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 10826 len. 44]: Look where he would , some heap of ruins afforded him rich promise of a working off ; the whole town appeared to have been ploughed and sown , and nurtured by most genial weather ; and a goodly harvest was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 10827 len. 62]: Having taken up arms and resorted to deeds of violence , with the great main object of preserving the Old Bailey in all its purity , and the gallows in all its pristine usefulness and moral grandeur , it would perhaps be going too far to assert that Mr Dennis had ever distinctly contemplated and foreseen this happy state of things .
Parsing [sent. 10828 len. 25]: He rather looked upon it as one of those beautiful dispensations which are inscrutably brought about for the behoof and advantage of good men .
Parsing [sent. 10829 len. 54]: He felt , as it were , personally referred to , in this prosperous ripening for the gibbet ; and had never considered himself so much the pet and favourite child of Destiny , or loved that lady so well or with such a calm and virtuous reliance , in all his life .
Parsing [sent. 10830 len. 72]: As to being taken up , himself , for a rioter , and punished with the rest , Mr Dennis dismissed that possibility from his thoughts as an idle chimera ; arguing that the line of conduct he had adopted at Newgate , and the service he had rendered that day , would be more than a set-off against any evidence which might identify him as a member of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 10831 len. 25]: That any charge of companionship which might be made against him by those who were themselves in danger , would certainly go for nought .
Parsing [sent. 10832 len. 48]: And that if any trivial indiscretion on his part should unluckily come out , the uncommon usefulness of his office , at present , and the great demand for the exercise of its functions , would certainly cause it to be winked at , and passed over .
Parsing [sent. 10833 len. 49]: In a word , he had played his cards throughout , with great care ; had changed sides at the very nick of time ; had delivered up two of the most notorious rioters , and a distinguished felon to boot ; and was quite at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 10834 len. 42]: Saving -- for there is a reservation ; and even Mr Dennis was not perfectly happy -- saving for one circumstance ; to wit , the forcible detention of Dolly and Miss Haredale , in a house almost adjoining his own .
Parsing [sent. 10835 len. 64]: This was a stumbling-block ; for if they were discovered and released , they could , by the testimony they had it in their power to give , place him in a situation of great jeopardy ; and to set them at liberty , first extorting from them an oath of secrecy and silence , was a thing not to be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 10836 len. 62]: It was more , perhaps , with an eye to the danger which lurked in this quarter , than from his abstract love of conversation with the sex , that the hangman , quickening his steps , now hastened into their society , cursing the amorous natures of Hugh and Mr Tappertit with great heartiness , at every step he took .
Parsing [sent. 10837 len. 24]: When be entered the miserable room in which they were confined , Dolly and Miss Haredale withdrew in silence to the remotest corner .
Parsing [sent. 10838 len. 34]: But Miss Miggs , who was particularly tender of her reputation , immediately fell upon her knees and began to scream very loud , crying , ` What will become of me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10839 len. 8]: -- ` Where is my Simmuns ! '
Parsing [sent. 10840 len. 15]: -- ` Have mercy , good gentlemen , on my sex 's weaknesses ! '
Parsing [sent. 10841 len. 18]: -- with other doleful lamentations of that nature , which she delivered with great propriety and decorum .
Parsing [sent. 10842 len. 26]: ` Miss , miss , ' whispered Dennis , beckoning to her with his forefinger , ` come here -- I wo n't hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 10843 len. 10]: Come here , my lamb , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10844 len. 39]: On hearing this tender epithet , Miss Miggs , who had left off screaming when he opened his lips , and had listened to him attentively , began again , crying : ` Oh I 'm his lamb !
Parsing [sent. 10845 len. 7]: He says I 'm his lamb !
Parsing [sent. 10846 len. 12]: Oh gracious , why was n't I born old and ugly !
Parsing [sent. 10847 len. 46]: Why was I ever made to be the youngest of six , and all of 'em dead and in their blessed graves , excepting one married sister , which is settled in Golden Lion Court , number twenty-sivin , second bell-handle on the -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 10848 len. 14]: ` Do n't I say I a n't a-going to hurt you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10849 len. 8]: said Dennis , pointing to a chair .
Parsing [sent. 10850 len. 11]: ` Why miss , what 's the matter ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10851 len. 12]: I do n't know what may n't be the matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 10852 len. 9]: cried Miss Miggs , clasping her hands distractedly .
Parsing [sent. 10853 len. 8]: ` Anything may be the matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 10854 len. 14]: ` But nothing is , I tell you , ' said the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 10855 len. 18]: ` First stop that noise and come and sit down here , will you , chuckey ? '
Parsing [sent. 10856 len. 68]: The coaxing tone in which he said these latter words might have failed in its object , if he had not accompanied them with sundry sharp jerks of his thumb over one shoulder , and with divers winks and thrustings of his tongue into his cheek , from which signals the damsel gathered that he sought to speak to her apart , concerning Miss Haredale and Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 10857 len. 45]: Her curiosity being very powerful , and her jealousy by no means inactive , she arose , and with a great deal of shivering and starting back , and much muscular action among all the small bones in her throat , gradually approached him .
Parsing [sent. 10858 len. 9]: ` Sit down , ' said the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 10859 len. 76]: Suiting the action to the word , he thrust her rather suddenly and prematurely into a chair , and designing to reassure her by a little harmless jocularity , such as is adapted to please and fascinate the sex , converted his right forefinger into an ideal bradawl or gimlet , and made as though he would screw the same into her side -- whereat Miss Miggs shrieked again , and evinced symptoms of faintness .
Parsing [sent. 10860 len. 17]: ` Lovey , my dear , ' whispered Dennis , drawing his chair close to hers .
Parsing [sent. 10861 len. 12]: ` When was your young man here last , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 10862 len. 9]: ` MY young man , good gentleman ! '
Parsing [sent. 10863 len. 9]: answered Miggs in a tone of exquisite distress .
Parsing [sent. 10864 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10865 len. 8]: Simmuns , you know -- him ? '
Parsing [sent. 10866 len. 3]: said Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 10867 len. 5]: ` Mine indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10868 len. 20]: cried Miggs , with a burst of bitterness -- and as she said it , she glanced towards Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 10869 len. 7]: ` MINE , good gentleman ! '
Parsing [sent. 10870 len. 11]: This was just what Mr Dennis wanted , and expected .
Parsing [sent. 10871 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10872 len. 53]: he said , looking so soothingly , not to say amorously on Miggs , that she sat , as she afterwards remarked , on pins and needles of the sharpest Whitechapel kind , not knowing what intentions might be suggesting that expression to his features : ' I was afraid of that .
Parsing [sent. 10873 len. 6]: I saw as much myself .
Parsing [sent. 10874 len. 5]: It 's her fault .
Parsing [sent. 10875 len. 7]: She WILL entice 'em . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10876 len. 78]: I would n't , ' cried Miggs , folding her hands and looking upwards with a kind of devout blankness , ' I would n't lay myself out as she does ; I would n't be as bold as her ; I would n't seem to say to all male creeturs `` Come and kiss me '' ' -- and here a shudder quite convulsed her frame -- ` for any earthly crowns as might be offered .
Parsing [sent. 10877 len. 13]: Worlds , ' Miggs added solemnly , ` should not reduce me .
Parsing [sent. 10878 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10879 len. 7]: Not if I was Wenis . '
Parsing [sent. 10880 len. 18]: ` Well , but you ARE Wenus , you know , ' said Mr Dennis , confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 10881 len. 41]: ` No , I am not , good gentleman , ' answered Miggs , shaking her head with an air of self-denial which seemed to imply that she might be if she chose , but she hoped she knew better .
Parsing [sent. 10882 len. 10]: ` No , I am not , good gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 10883 len. 8]: Do n't charge me with it . '
Parsing [sent. 10884 len. 79]: Up to this time she had turned round , every now and then , to where Dolly and Miss Haredale had retired and uttered a scream , or groan , or laid her hand upon her heart and trembled excessively , with a view of keeping up appearances , and giving them to understand that she conversed with the visitor , under protest and on compulsion , and at a great personal sacrifice , for their common good .
Parsing [sent. 10885 len. 52]: But at this point , Mr Dennis looked so very full of meaning , and gave such a singularly expressive twitch to his face as a request to her to come still nearer to him , that she abandoned these little arts , and gave him her whole and undivided attention .
Parsing [sent. 10886 len. 10]: ` When was Simmuns here , I say ? '
Parsing [sent. 10887 len. 7]: quoth Dennis , in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 10888 len. 14]: ` Not since yesterday morning ; and then only for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 10889 len. 9]: Not all day , the day before . '
Parsing [sent. 10890 len. 14]: ` You know he meant all along to carry off that one ! '
Parsing [sent. 10891 len. 26]: said Dennis , indicating Dolly by the slightest possible jerk of his head : -- ` And to hand you over to somebody else . '
Parsing [sent. 10892 len. 65]: Miss Miggs , who had fallen into a terrible state of grief when the first part of this sentence was spoken , recovered a little at the second , and seemed by the sudden check she put upon her tears , to intimate that possibly this arrangement might meet her views ; and that it might , perhaps , remain an open question . '
Parsing [sent. 10893 len. 50]: -- But unfort ` nately , ' pursued Dennis , who observed this : ` somebody else was fond of her too , you see ; and even if he was n't , somebody else is took for a rioter , and it 's all over with him . '
Parsing [sent. 10894 len. 4]: Miss Miggs relapsed .
Parsing [sent. 10895 len. 21]: ` Now I want , ' said Dennis , ` to clear this house , and to see you righted .
Parsing [sent. 10896 len. 17]: What if I was to get her off , out of the way , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 10897 len. 26]: Miss Miggs , brightening again , rejoined , with many breaks and pauses from excess of feeling , that temptations had been Simmuns 's bane .
Parsing [sent. 10898 len. 15]: That it was not his faults , but hers -LRB- meaning Dolly 's -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 10899 len. 25]: That men did not see through these dreadful arts as women did , and therefore was caged and trapped , as Simmun had been .
Parsing [sent. 10900 len. 25]: That she had no personal motives to serve -- far from it -- on the contrary , her intentions was good towards all parties .
Parsing [sent. 10901 len. 53]: But forasmuch as she knowed that Simmun , if united to any designing and artful minxes -LRB- she would name no names , for that was not her dispositions -RRB- -- to ANY designing and artful minxes -- must be made miserable and unhappy for life , she DID incline towards prewentions .
Parsing [sent. 10902 len. 10]: Such , she added , was her free confessions .
Parsing [sent. 10903 len. 25]: But as this was private feelings , and might perhaps be looked upon as wengeance , she begged the gentleman would say no more .
Parsing [sent. 10904 len. 31]: Whatever he said , wishing to do her duty by all mankind , even by them as had ever been her bitterest enemies , she would not listen to him .
Parsing [sent. 10905 len. 40]: With that she stopped her ears , and shook her head from side to side , to intimate to Mr Dennis that though he talked until he had no breath left , she was as deaf as any adder .
Parsing [sent. 10906 len. 51]: ` Lookee here , my sugar-stick , ' said Mr Dennis , ` if your view 's the same as mine , and you 'll only be quiet and slip away at the right time , I can have the house clear to-morrow , and be out of this trouble .
Parsing [sent. 10907 len. 4]: -- Stop though !
Parsing [sent. 10908 len. 6]: there 's the other . '
Parsing [sent. 10909 len. 7]: ` Which other , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10910 len. 16]: asked Miggs -- still with her fingers in her ears and her head shaking obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 10911 len. 35]: ` Why , the tallest one , yonder , ' said Dennis , as he stroked his chin , and added , in an undertone to himself , something about not crossing Muster Gashford .
Parsing [sent. 10912 len. 70]: Miss Miggs replied -LRB- still being profoundly deaf -RRB- that if Miss Haredale stood in the way at all , he might make himself quite easy on that score ; as she had gathered , from what passed between Hugh and Mr Tappertit when they were last there , that she was to be removed alone -LRB- not by them , but by somebody else -RRB- , to-morrow night .
Parsing [sent. 10913 len. 46]: Mr Dennis opened his eyes very wide at this piece of information , whistled once , considered once , and finally slapped his head once and nodded once , as if he had got the clue to this mysterious removal , and so dismissed it .
Parsing [sent. 10914 len. 30]: Then he imparted his design concerning Dolly to Miss Miggs , who was taken more deaf than before , when he began ; and so remained , all through .
Parsing [sent. 10915 len. 6]: The notable scheme was this .
Parsing [sent. 10916 len. 112]: Mr Dennis was immediately to seek out from among the rioters , some daring young fellow -LRB- and he had one in his eye , he said -RRB- , who , terrified by the threats he could hold out to him , and alarmed by the capture of so many who were no better and no worse than he , would gladly avail himself of any help to get abroad , and out of harm 's way , with his plunder , even though his journey were incumbered by an unwilling companion ; indeed , the unwilling companion being a beautiful girl , would probably be an additional inducement and temptation .
Parsing [sent. 10917 len. 81]: Such a person found , he proposed to bring him there on the ensuing night , when the tall one was taken off , and Miss Miggs had purposely retired ; and then that Dolly should be gagged , muffled in a cloak , and carried in any handy conveyance down to the river 's side ; where there were abundant means of getting her smuggled snugly off in any small craft of doubtful character , and no questions asked .
Parsing [sent. 10918 len. 48]: With regard to the expense of this removal , he would say , at a rough calculation , that two or three silver tea or coffee-pots , with something additional for drink -LRB- such as a muffineer , or toast-rack -RRB- , would more than cover it .
Parsing [sent. 10919 len. 73]: Articles of plate of every kind having been buried by the rioters in several lonely parts of London , and particularly , as he knew , in St James 's Square , which , though easy of access , was little frequented after dark , and had a convenient piece of water in the midst , the needful funds were close at hand , and could be had upon the shortest notice .
Parsing [sent. 10920 len. 13]: With regard to Dolly , the gentleman would exercise his own discretion .
Parsing [sent. 10921 len. 18]: He would be bound to do nothing but to take her away , and keep her away .
Parsing [sent. 10922 len. 11]: All other arrangements and dispositions would rest entirely with himself .
Parsing [sent. 10923 len. 67]: If Miss Miggs had had her hearing , no doubt she would have been greatly shocked by the indelicacy of a young female 's going away with a stranger by night -LRB- for her moral feelings , as we have said , were of the tenderest kind -RRB- ; but directly Mr Dennis ceased to speak , she reminded him that he had only wasted breath .
Parsing [sent. 10924 len. 66]: She then went on to say -LRB- still with her fingers in her ears -RRB- that nothing less than a severe practical lesson would save the locksmith 's daughter from utter ruin ; and that she felt it , as it were , a moral obligation and a sacred duty to the family , to wish that some one would devise one for her reformation .
Parsing [sent. 10925 len. 88]: Miss Miggs remarked , and very justly , as an abstract sentiment which happened to occur to her at the moment , that she dared to say the locksmith and his wife would murmur , and repine , if they were ever , by forcible abduction , or otherwise , to lose their child ; but that we seldom knew , in this world , what was best for us : such being our sinful and imperfect natures , that very few arrived at that clear understanding .
Parsing [sent. 10926 len. 78]: Having brought their conversation to this satisfactory end , they parted : Dennis , to pursue his design , and take another walk about his farm ; Miss Miggs , to launch , when he left her , into such a burst of mental anguish -LRB- which she gave them to understand was occasioned by certain tender things he had had the presumption and audacity to say -RRB- , that little Dolly 's heart was quite melted .
Parsing [sent. 10927 len. 61]: Indeed , she said and did so much to soothe the outraged feelings of Miss Miggs , and looked so beautiful while doing so , that if that young maid had not had ample vent for her surpassing spite , in a knowledge of the mischief that was brewing , she must have scratched her features , on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 10928 len. 58]: Chapter 71 All next day , Emma Haredale , Dolly , and Miggs , remained cooped up together in what had now been their prison for so many days , without seeing any person , or hearing any sound but the murmured conversation , in an outer room , of the men who kept watch over them .
Parsing [sent. 10929 len. 32]: There appeared to be more of these fellows than there had been hitherto ; and they could no longer hear the voices of women , which they had before plainly distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 10930 len. 33]: Some new excitement , too , seemed to prevail among them ; for there was much stealthy going in and out , and a constant questioning of those who were newly arrived .
Parsing [sent. 10931 len. 27]: They had previously been quite reckless in their behaviour ; often making a great uproar ; quarrelling among themselves , fighting , dancing , and singing .
Parsing [sent. 10932 len. 46]: They were now very subdued and silent , conversing almost in whispers , and stealing in and out with a soft and stealthy tread , very different from the boisterous trampling in which their arrivals and departures had hitherto been announced to the trembling captives .
Parsing [sent. 10933 len. 31]: Whether this change was occasioned by the presence among them of some person of authority in their ranks , or by any other cause , they were unable to decide .
Parsing [sent. 10934 len. 43]: Sometimes they thought it was in part attributable to there being a sick man in the chamber , for last night there had been a shuffling of feet , as though a burden were brought in , and afterwards a moaning noise .
Parsing [sent. 10935 len. 63]: But they had no means of ascertaining the truth : for any question or entreaty on their parts only provoked a storm of execrations , or something worse ; and they were too happy to be left alone , unassailed by threats or admiration , to risk even that comfort , by any voluntary communication with those who held them in durance .
Parsing [sent. 10936 len. 77]: It was sufficiently evident , both to Emma and to the locksmith 's poor little daughter herself , that she , Dolly , was the great object of attraction ; and that so soon as they should have leisure to indulge in the softer passion , Hugh and Mr Tappertit would certainly fall to blows for her sake ; in which latter case , it was not very difficult to see whose prize she would become .
Parsing [sent. 10937 len. 77]: With all her old horror of that man revived , and deepened into a degree of aversion and abhorrence which no language can describe ; with a thousand old recollections and regrets , and causes of distress , anxiety , and fear , besetting her on all sides ; poor Dolly Varden -- sweet , blooming , buxom Dolly -- began to hang her head , and fade , and droop , like a beautiful flower .
Parsing [sent. 10938 len. 17]: The colour fled from her cheeks , her courage forsook her , her gentle heart failed .
Parsing [sent. 10939 len. 72]: Unmindful of all her provoking caprices , forgetful of all her conquests and inconstancy , with all her winning little vanities quite gone , she nestled all the livelong day in Emma Haredale 's bosom ; and , sometimes calling on her dear old grey-haired father , sometimes on her mother , and sometimes even on her old home , pined slowly away , like a poor bird in its cage .
Parsing [sent. 10940 len. 59]: Light hearts , light hearts , that float so gaily on a smooth stream , that are so sparkling and buoyant in the sunshine -- down upon fruit , bloom upon flowers , blush in summer air , life of the winged insect , whose whole existence is a day -- how soon ye sink in troubled water !
Parsing [sent. 10941 len. 39]: Poor Dolly 's heart -- a little , gentle , idle , fickle thing ; giddy , restless , fluttering ; constant to nothing but bright looks , and smiles and laughter -- Dolly 's heart was breaking .
Parsing [sent. 10942 len. 11]: Emma had known grief , and could bear it better .
Parsing [sent. 10943 len. 32]: She had little comfort to impart , but she could soothe and tend her , and she did so ; and Dolly clung to her like a child to its nurse .
Parsing [sent. 10944 len. 60]: In endeavouring to inspire her with some fortitude , she increased her own ; and though the nights were long , and the days dismal , and she felt the wasting influence of watching and fatigue , and had perhaps a more defined and clear perception of their destitute condition and its worst dangers , she uttered no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 10945 len. 79]: Before the ruffians , in whose power they were , she bore herself so calmly , and with such an appearance , in the midst of all her terror , of a secret conviction that they dared not harm her , that there was not a man among them but held her in some degree of dread ; and more than one believed she had a weapon hidden in her dress , and was prepared to use it .
Parsing [sent. 10946 len. 62]: Such was their condition when they were joined by Miss Miggs , who gave them to understand that she too had been taken prisoner because of her charms , and detailed such feats of resistance she had performed -LRB- her virtue having given her supernatural strength -RRB- , that they felt it quite a happiness to have her for a champion .
Parsing [sent. 10947 len. 106]: Nor was this the only comfort they derived at first from Miggs 's presence and society : for that young lady displayed such resignation and long-suffering , and so much meek endurance , under her trials , and breathed in all her chaste discourse a spirit of such holy confidence and resignation , and devout belief that all would happen for the best , that Emma felt her courage strengthened by the bright example ; never doubting but that everything she said was true , and that she , like them , was torn from all she loved , and agonised by doubt and apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 10948 len. 53]: As to poor Dolly , she was roused , at first , by seeing one who came from home ; but when she heard under what circumstances she had left it , and into whose hands her father had fallen , she wept more bitterly than ever , and refused all comfort .
Parsing [sent. 10949 len. 61]: Miss Miggs was at some trouble to reprove her for this state of mind , and to entreat her to take example by herself , who , she said , was now receiving back , with interest , tenfold the amount of her subscriptions to the red-brick dwelling-house , in the articles of peace of mind and a quiet conscience .
Parsing [sent. 10950 len. 60]: And , while on serious topics , Miss Miggs considered it her duty to try her hand at the conversion of Miss Haredale ; for whose improvement she launched into a polemical address of some length , in the course whereof , she likened herself unto a chosen missionary , and that young lady to a cannibal in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 10951 len. 90]: Indeed , she returned so often to these sublects , and so frequently called upon them to take a lesson from her , -- at the same time vaunting and , as it were , rioting in , her huge unworthiness , and abundant excess of sin , -- that , in the course of a short time , she became , in that small chamber , rather a nuisance than a comfort , and rendered them , if possible , even more unhappy than they had been before .
Parsing [sent. 10952 len. 31]: The night had now come ; and for the first time -LRB- for their jailers had been regular in bringing food and candles -RRB- , they were left in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 10953 len. 35]: Any change in their condition in such a place inspired new fears ; and when some hours had passed , and the gloom was still unbroken , Emma could no longer repress her alarm .
Parsing [sent. 10954 len. 4]: They listened attentively .
Parsing [sent. 10955 len. 40]: There was the same murmuring in the outer room , and now and then a moan which seemed to be wrung from a person in great pain , who made an effort to subdue it , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 10956 len. 49]: Even these men seemed to be in darkness too ; for no light shone through the chinks in the door , nor were they moving , as their custom was , but quite still : the silence being unbroken by so much as the creaking of a board .
Parsing [sent. 10957 len. 90]: At first , Miss Miggs wondered greatly in her own mind who this sick person might be ; but arriving , on second thoughts , at the conclusion that he was a part of the schemes on foot , and an artful device soon to be employed with great success , she opined , for Miss Haredale 's comfort , that it must be some misguided Papist who had been wounded : and this happy supposition encouraged her to say , under her breath , ` Ally Looyer ! '
Parsing [sent. 10958 len. 3]: several times .
Parsing [sent. 10959 len. 48]: ` Is it possible , ' said Emma , with some indignation , ` that you who have seen these men committing the outrages you have told us of , and who have fallen into their hands , like us , can exult in their cruelties ! '
Parsing [sent. 10960 len. 20]: ` Personal considerations , miss , ' rejoined Miggs , ` sinks into nothing , afore a noble cause .
Parsing [sent. 10961 len. 3]: Ally Looyer !
Parsing [sent. 10962 len. 3]: Ally Looyer !
Parsing [sent. 10963 len. 7]: Ally Looyer , good gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 10964 len. 40]: It seemed from the shrill pertinacity with which Miss Miggs repeated this form of acclamation , that she was calling the same through the keyhole of the door ; but in the profound darkness she could not be seen .
Parsing [sent. 10965 len. 50]: ` If the time has come -- Heaven knows it may come at any moment -- when they are bent on prosecuting the designs , whatever they may be , with which they have brought us here , can you still encourage , and take part with them ? '
Parsing [sent. 10966 len. 4]: demanded Emma . '
Parsing [sent. 10967 len. 17]: I thank my goodness-gracious-blessed-stars I can , miss , ' returned Miggs , with increased energy .
Parsing [sent. 10968 len. 9]: -- ` Ally Looyer , good gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 10969 len. 23]: Even Dolly , cast down and disappointed as she was , revived at this , and bade Miggs hold her tongue directly .
Parsing [sent. 10970 len. 13]: ` WHICH , was you pleased to observe , Miss Varden ? '
Parsing [sent. 10971 len. 12]: said Miggs , with a strong emphasis on the irrelative pronoun .
Parsing [sent. 10972 len. 5]: Dolly repeated her request .
Parsing [sent. 10973 len. 7]: ` Ho , gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10974 len. 7]: cried Miggs , with hysterical derision .
Parsing [sent. 10975 len. 6]: ` Ho , gracious me !
Parsing [sent. 10976 len. 8]: Yes , to be sure I will .
Parsing [sent. 10977 len. 3]: Ho yes !
Parsing [sent. 10978 len. 30]: I am a abject slave , and a toiling , moiling , constant-working , always-being-found-fault-with , never-giving-satisfactions , nor-having-no-time-to-clean-oneself , potter 's wessel -- a n't I , miss !
Parsing [sent. 10979 len. 3]: Ho yes !
Parsing [sent. 10980 len. 65]: My situations is lowly , and my capacities is limited , and my duties is to humble myself afore the base degenerating daughters of their blessed mothers as is -- fit to keep companies with holy saints but is born to persecutions from wicked relations -- and to demean myself before them as is no better than Infidels -- a n't it , miss !
Parsing [sent. 10981 len. 3]: Ho yes !
Parsing [sent. 10982 len. 60]: My only becoming occupations is to help young flaunting pagins to brush and comb and titiwate theirselves into whitening and suppulchres , and leave the young men to think that there a n't a bit of padding in it nor no pinching ins nor fillings out nor pomatums nor deceits nor earthly wanities -- a n't it , miss !
Parsing [sent. 10983 len. 12]: Yes , to be sure it is -- ho yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 10984 len. 73]: Having delivered these ironical passages with a most wonderful volubility , and with a shrillness perfectly deafening -LRB- especially when she jerked out the interjections -RRB- , Miss Miggs , from mere habit , and not because weeping was at all appropriate to the occasion , which was one of triumph , concluded by bursting into a flood of tears , and calling in an impassioned manner on the name of Simmuns .
Parsing [sent. 10985 len. 41]: What Emma Haredale and Dolly would have done , or how long Miss Miggs , now that she had hoisted her true colours , would have gone on waving them before their astonished senses , it is impossible to tell .
Parsing [sent. 10986 len. 27]: Nor is it necessary to speculate on these matters , for a startling interruption occurred at that moment , which took their whole attention by storm .
Parsing [sent. 10987 len. 37]: This was a violent knocking at the door of the house , and then its sudden bursting open ; which was immediately succeeded by a scuffle in the room without , and the clash of weapons .
Parsing [sent. 10988 len. 58]: Transported with the hope that rescue had at length arrived , Emma and Dolly shrieked aloud for help ; nor were their shrieks unanswered ; for after a hurried interval , a man , bearing in one hand a drawn sword , and in the other a taper , rushed into the chamber where they were confined .
Parsing [sent. 10989 len. 39]: It was some check upon their transport to find in this person an entire stranger , but they appealed to him , nevertheless , and besought him , in impassioned language , to restore them to their friends .
Parsing [sent. 10990 len. 10]: ` For what other purpose am I here ? '
Parsing [sent. 10991 len. 15]: he answered , closing the door , and standing with his back against it .
Parsing [sent. 10992 len. 24]: ` With what object have I made my way to this place , through difficulty and danger , but to preserve you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10993 len. 27]: With a joy for which it was impossible to find adequate expression , they embraced each other , and thanked Heaven for this most timely aid .
Parsing [sent. 10994 len. 35]: Their deliverer stepped forward for a moment to put the light upon the table , and immediately returning to his former position against the door , bared his head , and looked on smilingly .
Parsing [sent. 10995 len. 11]: ` You have news of my uncle , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10996 len. 8]: said Emma , turning hastily towards him .
Parsing [sent. 10997 len. 9]: ` And of my father and mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 10998 len. 3]: added Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 10999 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 11000 len. 5]: ` Good news . '
Parsing [sent. 11001 len. 8]: ` They are alive and unhurt ? '
Parsing [sent. 11002 len. 6]: they both cried at once .
Parsing [sent. 11003 len. 10]: ` Yes , and unhurt , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 11004 len. 8]: ` And close at hand ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11005 len. 21]: I did not say close at hand , ' he answered smoothly ; ` they are at no great distance .
Parsing [sent. 11006 len. 22]: YOUR friends , sweet one , ' he added , addressing Dolly , ` are within a few hours ' journey .
Parsing [sent. 11007 len. 13]: You will be restored to them , I hope , to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 11008 len. 10]: ` My uncle , sir -- ' faltered Emma .
Parsing [sent. 11009 len. 43]: ` Your uncle , dear Miss Haredale , happily -- I say happily , because he has succeeded where many of our creed have failed , and is safe -- has crossed the sea , and is out of Britain . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11010 len. 12]: I thank God for it , ' said Emma , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 11011 len. 5]: ` You say well .
Parsing [sent. 11012 len. 31]: You have reason to be thankful : greater reason than it is possible for you , who have seen but one night of these cruel outrages , to imagine . '
Parsing [sent. 11013 len. 17]: ` Does he desire , ' said Emma , ` that I should follow him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11014 len. 10]: ` Do you ask if he desires it ? '
Parsing [sent. 11015 len. 6]: cried the stranger in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 11016 len. 6]: ` IF he desires it !
Parsing [sent. 11017 len. 34]: But you do not know the danger of remaining in England , the difficulty of escape , or the price hundreds would pay to secure the means , when you make that inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 11018 len. 3]: Pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 11019 len. 14]: I had forgotten that you could not , being prisoner here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11020 len. 61]: I gather , sir , ' said Emma , after a moment 's pause , ` from what you hint at , but fear to tell me , that I have witnessed but the beginning , and the least , of the violence to which we are exposed , and that it has not yet slackened in its fury ? '
Parsing [sent. 11021 len. 41]: He shrugged his shoulders , shook his head , lifted up his hands ; and with the same smooth smile , which was not a pleasant one to see , cast his eyes upon the ground , and remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 11022 len. 23]: ` You may venture , sir , to speak plain , ' said Emma , ` and to tell me the worst .
Parsing [sent. 11023 len. 9]: We have undergone some preparation for it . '
Parsing [sent. 11024 len. 45]: But here Dolly interposed , and entreated her not to hear the worst , but the best ; and besought the gentleman to tell them the best , and to keep the remainder of his news until they were safe among their friends again .
Parsing [sent. 11025 len. 25]: ` It is told in three words , ' he said , glancing at the locksmith 's daughter with a look of some displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 11026 len. 28]: ` The people have risen , to a man , against us ; the streets are filled with soldiers , who support them and do their bidding .
Parsing [sent. 11027 len. 40]: We have no protection but from above , and no safety but in flight ; and that is a poor resource ; for we are watched on every hand , and detained here , both by force and fraud .
Parsing [sent. 11028 len. 43]: Miss Haredale , I can not bear -- believe me , that I can not bear -- by speaking of myself , or what I have done , or am prepared to do , to seem to vaunt my services before you .
Parsing [sent. 11029 len. 30]: But , having powerful Protestant connections , and having my whole wealth embarked with theirs in shipping and commerce , I happily possessed the means of saving your uncle .
Parsing [sent. 11030 len. 38]: I have the means of saving you ; and in redemption of my sacred promise , made to him , I am here ; pledged not to leave you until I have placed you in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 11031 len. 39]: The treachery or penitence of one of the men about you , led to the discovery of your place of confinement ; and that I have forced my way here , sword in hand , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 11032 len. 20]: ` You bring , ' said Emma , faltering , ` some note or token from my uncle ? '
Parsing [sent. 11033 len. 25]: ` No , he does n't , ' cried Dolly , pointing at him earnestly ; ` now I am sure he does n't .
Parsing [sent. 11034 len. 10]: Do n't go with him for the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 11035 len. 18]: ` Hush , pretty fool -- be silent , ' he replied , frowning angrily upon her .
Parsing [sent. 11036 len. 46]: ` No , Miss Haredale , I have no letter , nor any token of any kind ; for while I sympathise with you , and such as you , on whom misfortune so heavy and so undeserved has fallen , I value my life .
Parsing [sent. 11037 len. 20]: I carry , therefore , no writing which , found upon me , would lead to its certain loss .
Parsing [sent. 11038 len. 40]: I never thought of bringing any other token , nor did Mr Haredale think of entrusting me with one -- possibly because he had good experience of my faith and honesty , and owed his life to me . '
Parsing [sent. 11039 len. 22]: There was a reproof conveyed in these words , which to a nature like Emma Haredale 's , was well addressed .
Parsing [sent. 11040 len. 40]: But Dolly , who was differently constituted , was by no means touched by it , and still conjured her , in all the terms of affection and attachment she could think of , not to be lured away .
Parsing [sent. 11041 len. 41]: ` Time presses , ' said their visitor , who , although he sought to express the deepest interest , had something cold and even in his speech , that grated on the ear ; ` and danger surrounds us .
Parsing [sent. 11042 len. 30]: If I have exposed myself to it , in vain , let it be so ; but if you and he should ever meet again , do me justice .
Parsing [sent. 11043 len. 41]: If you decide to remain -LRB- as I think you do -RRB- , remember , Miss Haredale , that I left you with a solemn caution , and acquitting myself of all the consequences to which you expose yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 11044 len. 6]: ` Stay , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11045 len. 10]: cried Emma -- one moment , I beg you .
Parsing [sent. 11046 len. 20]: Can not we -- and she drew Dolly closer to her -- ` can not we go together ? '
Parsing [sent. 11047 len. 39]: ` The task of conveying one female in safety through such scenes as we must encounter , to say nothing of attracting the attention of those who crowd the streets , ' he answered , ` is enough .
Parsing [sent. 11048 len. 13]: I have said that she will be restored to her friends to-night .
Parsing [sent. 11049 len. 25]: If you accept the service I tender , Miss Haredale , she shall be instantly placed in safe conduct , and that promise redeemed .
Parsing [sent. 11050 len. 6]: Do you decide to remain ?
Parsing [sent. 11051 len. 20]: People of all ranks and creeds are flying from the town , which is sacked from end to end .
Parsing [sent. 11052 len. 9]: Let me be of use in some quarter .
Parsing [sent. 11053 len. 8]: Do you stay , or go ? '
Parsing [sent. 11054 len. 23]: ` Dolly , ' said Emma , in a hurried manner , ` my dear girl , this is our last hope .
Parsing [sent. 11055 len. 18]: If we part now , it is only that we may meet again in happiness and honour .
Parsing [sent. 11056 len. 8]: I will trust to this gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 11057 len. 5]: ` No no-no ! '
Parsing [sent. 11058 len. 7]: cried Dolly , clinging to her .
Parsing [sent. 11059 len. 9]: ` Pray , pray , do not ! '
Parsing [sent. 11060 len. 24]: ` You hear , ' said Emma , ` that to-night -- only to-night -- within a few hours -- think of that !
Parsing [sent. 11061 len. 28]: -- you will be among those who would die of grief to lose you , and who are now plunged in the deepest misery for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 11062 len. 25]: Pray for me , dear girl , as I will for you ; and never forget the many quiet hours we have passed together .
Parsing [sent. 11063 len. 8]: Say one `` God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11064 len. 6]: Say that at parting ! '
Parsing [sent. 11065 len. 45]: But Dolly could say nothing ; no , not when Emma kissed her cheek a hundred times , and covered it with tears , could she do more than hang upon her neck , and sob , and clasp , and hold her tight .
Parsing [sent. 11066 len. 37]: ` We have time for no more of this , ' cried the man , unclenching her hands , and pushing her roughly off , as he drew Emma Haredale towards the door : ` Now !
Parsing [sent. 11067 len. 5]: Quick , outside there !
Parsing [sent. 11068 len. 5]: are you ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 11069 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 11070 len. 10]: cried a loud voice , which made him start .
Parsing [sent. 11071 len. 4]: ` Quite ready !
Parsing [sent. 11072 len. 9]: Stand back here , for your lives ! '
Parsing [sent. 11073 len. 75]: And in an instant he was felled like an ox in the butcher 's shambles -- struck down as though a block of marble had fallen from the roof and crushed him -- and cheerful light , and beaming faces came pouring in -- and Emma was clasped in her uncle 's embrace , and Dolly , with a shriek that pierced the air , fell into the arms of her father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 11074 len. 64]: What fainting there was , what laughing , what crying , what sobbing , what smiling , how much questioning , no answering , all talking together , all beside themselves with joy ; what kissing , congratulating , embracing , shaking of hands , and falling into all these raptures , over and over and over again ; no language can describe .
Parsing [sent. 11075 len. 37]: At length , and after a long time , the old locksmith went up and fairly hugged two strangers , who had stood apart and left them to themselves ; and then they saw -- whom ?
Parsing [sent. 11076 len. 8]: Yes , Edward Chester and Joseph Willet .
Parsing [sent. 11077 len. 5]: ` See here ! '
Parsing [sent. 11078 len. 4]: cried the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 11079 len. 4]: ` See here !
Parsing [sent. 11080 len. 11]: where would any of us have been without these two ?
Parsing [sent. 11081 len. 31]: Oh , Mr Edward , Mr Edward -- oh , Joe , Joe , how light , and yet how full , you have made my old heart to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 11082 len. 31]: ` It was Mr Edward that knocked him down , sir , ' said Joe : ' I longed to do it , but I gave it up to him .
Parsing [sent. 11083 len. 8]: Come , you brave and honest gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 11084 len. 15]: Get your senses together , for you have n't long to lie here . '
Parsing [sent. 11085 len. 30]: He had his foot upon the breast of their sham deliverer , in the absence of a spare arm ; and gave him a gentle roll as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 11086 len. 29]: Gashford , for it was no other , crouching yet malignant , raised his scowling face , like sin subdued , and pleaded to be gently used . '
Parsing [sent. 11087 len. 45]: I have access to all my lord 's papers , Mr Haredale , ' he said , in a submissive voice : Mr Haredale keeping his back towards him , and not once looking round : ` there are very important documents among them .
Parsing [sent. 11088 len. 23]: There are a great many in secret drawers , and distributed in various places , known only to my lord and me .
Parsing [sent. 11089 len. 16]: I can give some very valuable information , and render important assistance to any inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 11090 len. 13]: You will have to answer it , if I receive ill usage .
Parsing [sent. 11091 len. 4]: ` Pah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11092 len. 7]: cried Joe , in deep disgust .
Parsing [sent. 11093 len. 13]: ` Get up , man ; you 're waited for , outside .
Parsing [sent. 11094 len. 8]: Get up , do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11095 len. 33]: Gashford slowly rose ; and picking up his hat , and looking with a baffled malevolence , yet with an air of despicable humility , all round the room , crawled out .
Parsing [sent. 11096 len. 44]: ` And now , gentlemen , ' said Joe , who seemed to be the spokesman of the party , for all the rest were silent ; ` the sooner we get back to the Black Lion , the better , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 11097 len. 65]: Mr Haredale nodded assent , and drawing his niece 's arm through his , and taking one of her hands between his own , passed out straightway ; followed by the locksmith , Mrs Varden , and Dolly -- who would scarcely have presented a sufficient surface for all the hugs and caresses they bestowed upon her though she had been a dozen Dollys .
Parsing [sent. 11098 len. 6]: Edward Chester and Joe followed .
Parsing [sent. 11099 len. 11]: And did Dolly never once look behind -- not once ?
Parsing [sent. 11100 len. 28]: Was there not one little fleeting glimpse of the dark eyelash , almost resting on her flushed cheek , and of the downcast sparkling eye it shaded ?
Parsing [sent. 11101 len. 30]: Joe thought there was -- and he is not likely to have been mistaken ; for there were not many eyes like Dolly 's , that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 11102 len. 93]: The outer room through which they had to pass , was full of men ; among them , Mr Dennis in safe keeping ; and there , had been since yesterday , lying in hiding behind a wooden screen which was now thrown down , Simon Tappertit , the recreant ` prentice , burnt and bruised , and with a gun-shot wound in his body ; and his legs -- his perfect legs , the pride and glory of his life , the comfort of his existence -- crushed into shapeless ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 11103 len. 64]: Wondering no longer at the moans they had heard , Dolly kept closer to her father , and shuddered at the sight ; but neither bruises , burns , nor gun-shot wound , nor all the torture of his shattered limbs , sent half so keen a pang to Simon 's breast , as Dolly passing out , with Joe for her preserver .
Parsing [sent. 11104 len. 36]: A coach was ready at the door , and Dolly found herself safe and whole inside , between her father and mother , with Emma Haredale and her uncle , quite real , sitting opposite .
Parsing [sent. 11105 len. 15]: But there was no Joe , no Edward ; and they had said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 11106 len. 12]: They had only bowed once , and kept at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 11107 len. 3]: Dear heart !
Parsing [sent. 11108 len. 11]: what a long way it was to the Black Lion !
Parsing [sent. 11109 len. 64]: Chapter 72 The Black Lion was so far off , and occupied such a length of time in the getting at , that notwithstanding the strong presumptive evidence she had about her of the late events being real and of actual occurrence , Dolly could not divest herself of the belief that she must be in a dream which was lasting all night .
Parsing [sent. 11110 len. 58]: Nor was she quite certain that she saw and heard with her own proper senses , even when the coach , in the fulness of time , stopped at the Black Lion , and the host of that tavern approached in a gush of cheerful light to help them to dismount , and give them hearty welcome .
Parsing [sent. 11111 len. 60]: There too , at the coach door , one on one side , one upon the other , were already Edward Chester and Joe Willet , who must have followed in another coach : and this was such a strange and unaccountable proceeding , that Dolly was the more inclined to favour the idea of her being fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 11112 len. 56]: But when Mr Willet appeared -- old John himself -- so heavy-headed and obstinate , and with such a double chin as the liveliest imagination could never in its boldest flights have conjured up in all its vast proportions -- then she stood corrected , and unwillingly admitted to herself that she was broad awake .
Parsing [sent. 11113 len. 17]: And Joe had lost an arm -- he -- that well-made , handsome , gallant fellow !
Parsing [sent. 11114 len. 92]: As Dolly glanced towards him , and thought of the pain he must have suffered , and the far-off places in which he had been wandering , and wondered who had been his nurse , and hoped that whoever it was , she had been as kind and gentle and considerate as she would have been , the tears came rising to her bright eyes , one by one , little by little , until she could keep them back no longer , and so before them all , wept bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 11115 len. 16]: ` We are all safe now , Dolly , ' said her father , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 11116 len. 9]: ` We shall not be separated any more .
Parsing [sent. 11117 len. 10]: Cheer up , my love , cheer up ! '
Parsing [sent. 11118 len. 16]: The locksmith 's wife knew better perhaps , than he , what ailed her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 11119 len. 30]: But Mrs Varden being quite an altered woman -- for the riots had done that good -- added her word to his , and comforted her with similar representations .
Parsing [sent. 11120 len. 21]: ` Mayhap , ' said Mr Willet , senior , looking round upon the company , ` she 's hungry .
Parsing [sent. 11121 len. 16]: That 's what it is , depend upon it -- I am , myself . '
Parsing [sent. 11122 len. 49]: The Black Lion , who , like old John , had been waiting supper past all reasonable and conscionable hours , hailed this as a philosophical discovery of the profoundest and most penetrating kind ; and the table being already spread , they sat down to supper straightway .
Parsing [sent. 11123 len. 20]: The conversation was not of the liveliest nature , nor were the appetites of some among them very keen .
Parsing [sent. 11124 len. 28]: But , in both these respects , old John more than atoned for any deficiency on the part of the rest , and very much distinguished himself .
Parsing [sent. 11125 len. 121]: It was not in point of actual conversation that Mr Willet shone so brilliantly , for he had none of his old cronies to ` tackle , ' and was rather timorous of venturing on Joe ; having certain vague misgivings within him , that he was ready on the shortest notice , and on receipt of the slightest offence , to fell the Black Lion to the floor of his own parlour , and immediately to withdraw to China or some other remote and unknown region , there to dwell for evermore , or at least until he had got rid of his remaining arm and both legs , and perhaps an eye or so , into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 11126 len. 54]: It was with a peculiar kind of pantomime that Mr Willet filled up every pause ; and in this he was considered by the Black Lion , who had been his familiar for some years , quite to surpass and go beyond himself , and outrun the expectations of his most admiring friends .
Parsing [sent. 11127 len. 39]: The subject that worked in Mr Willet 's mind , and occasioned these demonstrations , was no other than his son 's bodily disfigurement , which he had never yet got himself thoroughly to believe , or comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 11128 len. 49]: Shortly after their first meeting , he had been observed to wander , in a state of great perplexity , to the kitchen , and to direct his gaze towards the fire , as if in search of his usual adviser in all matters of doubt and difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 11129 len. 157]: But there being no boiler at the Black Lion , and the rioters having so beaten and battered his own that it was quite unfit for further service , he wandered out again , in a perfect bog of uncertainty and mental confusion , and in that state took the strangest means of resolving his doubts : such as feeling the sleeve of his son 's greatcoat as deeming it possible that his arm might be there ; looking at his own arms and those of everybody else , as if to assure himself that two and not one was the usual allowance ; sitting by the hour together in a brown study , as if he were endeavouring to recall Joe 's image in his younger days , and to remember whether he really had in those times one arm or a pair ; and employing himself in many other speculations of the same kind .
Parsing [sent. 11130 len. 40]: Finding himself at this supper , surrounded by faces with which he had been so well acquainted in old times , Mr Willet recurred to the subject with uncommon vigour ; apparently resolved to understand it now or never .
Parsing [sent. 11131 len. 116]: Sometimes , after every two or three mouthfuls , he laid down his knife and fork , and stared at his son with all his might -- particularly at his maimed side ; then , he looked slowly round the table until he caught some person 's eye , when he shook his head with great solemnity , patted his shoulder , winked , or as one may say -- for winking was a very slow process with him -- went to sleep with one eye for a minute or two ; and so , with another solemn shaking of his head , took up his knife and fork again , and went on eating .
Parsing [sent. 11132 len. 62]: Sometimes , he put his food into his mouth abstractedly , and , with all his faculties concentrated on Joe , gazed at him in a fit of stupefaction as he cut his meat with one hand , until he was recalled to himself by symptoms of choking on his own part , and was by that means restored to consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 11133 len. 41]: At other times he resorted to such small devices as asking him for the salt , the pepper , the vinegar , the mustard -- anything that was on his maimed side -- and watching him as he handed it .
Parsing [sent. 11134 len. 89]: By dint of these experiments , he did at last so satisfy and convince himself , that , after a longer silence than he had yet maintained , he laid down his knife and fork on either side his plate , drank a long draught from a tankard beside him -LRB- still keeping his eyes on Joe -RRB- , and leaning backward in his chair and fetching a long breath , said , as he looked all round the board : ` It 's been took off ! '
Parsing [sent. 11135 len. 5]: ` By George ! '
Parsing [sent. 11136 len. 19]: said the Black Lion , striking the table with his hand , ` he 's got it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11137 len. 29]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Mr Willet , with the look of a man who felt that he had earned a compliment , and deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 11138 len. 7]: ` That 's where it is .
Parsing [sent. 11139 len. 7]: It 's been took off . '
Parsing [sent. 11140 len. 16]: ` Tell him where it was done , ' said the Black Lion to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 11141 len. 11]: ` At the defence of the Savannah , father . '
Parsing [sent. 11142 len. 21]: ` At the defence of the Salwanners , ' repeated Mr Willet , softly ; again looking round the table .
Parsing [sent. 11143 len. 13]: ` In America , where the war is , ' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 11144 len. 14]: ` In America , where the war is , ' repeated Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 11145 len. 19]: ` It was took off in the defence of the Salwanners in America where the war is . '
Parsing [sent. 11146 len. 156]: Continuing to repeat these words to himself in a low tone of voice -LRB- the same information had been conveyed to him in the same terms , at least fifty times before -RRB- , Mr Willet arose from table , walked round to Joe , felt his empty sleeve all the way up , from the cuff , to where the stump of his arm remained ; shook his hand ; lighted his pipe at the fire , took a long whiff , walked to the door , turned round once when he had reached it , wiped his left eye with the back of his forefinger , and said , in a faltering voice : ` My son 's arm -- was took off -- at the defence of the -- Salwanners -- in America -- where the war is ' -- with which words he withdrew , and returned no more that night .
Parsing [sent. 11147 len. 23]: Indeed , on various pretences , they all withdrew one after another , save Dolly , who was left sitting there alone .
Parsing [sent. 11148 len. 37]: It was a great relief to be alone , and she was crying to her heart 's content , when she heard Joe 's voice at the end of the passage , bidding somebody good night .
Parsing [sent. 11149 len. 3]: Good night !
Parsing [sent. 11150 len. 12]: Then he was going elsewhere -- to some distance , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 11151 len. 17]: To what kind of home COULD he be going , now that it was so late !
Parsing [sent. 11152 len. 13]: She heard him walk along the passage , and pass the door .
Parsing [sent. 11153 len. 9]: But there was a hesitation in his footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 11154 len. 14]: He turned back -- Dolly 's heart beat high -- he looked in .
Parsing [sent. 11155 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 11156 len. 18]: -- he did n't say Dolly , but there was comfort in his not saying Miss Varden .
Parsing [sent. 11157 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 11158 len. 4]: sobbed Dolly . '
Parsing [sent. 11159 len. 21]: I am sorry you take on so much , for what is past and gone , ' said Joe kindly .
Parsing [sent. 11160 len. 4]: ` Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 11161 len. 10]: I ca n't bear to see you do it .
Parsing [sent. 11162 len. 6]: Think of it no longer .
Parsing [sent. 11163 len. 8]: You are safe and happy now . '
Parsing [sent. 11164 len. 5]: Dolly cried the more .
Parsing [sent. 11165 len. 26]: ` You must have suffered very much within these few days -- and yet you 're not changed , unless it 's for the better .
Parsing [sent. 11166 len. 12]: They said you were , but I do n't see it .
Parsing [sent. 11167 len. 24]: You were -- you were always very beautiful , ' said Joe , ` but you are more beautiful than ever , now .
Parsing [sent. 11168 len. 4]: You are indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11169 len. 16]: There can be no harm in my saying so , for you must know it .
Parsing [sent. 11170 len. 12]: You are told so very often , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 11171 len. 18]: As a general principle , Dolly DID know it , and WAS told so , very often .
Parsing [sent. 11172 len. 75]: But the coachmaker had turned out , years ago , to be a special donkey ; and whether she had been afraid of making similar discoveries in others , or had grown by dint of long custom to be careless of compliments generally , certain it is that although she cried so much , she was better pleased to be told so now , than ever she had been in all her life . '
Parsing [sent. 11173 len. 21]: I shall bless your name , ' sobbed the locksmith 's little daughter , ` as long as I live .
Parsing [sent. 11174 len. 15]: I shall never hear it spoken without feeling as if my heart would burst .
Parsing [sent. 11175 len. 17]: I shall remember it in my prayers , every night and morning till I die ! '
Parsing [sent. 11176 len. 5]: ` Will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11177 len. 5]: said Joe , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 11178 len. 5]: ` Will you indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 11179 len. 20]: It makes me -- well , it makes me very glad and proud to hear you say so . '
Parsing [sent. 11180 len. 12]: Dolly still sobbed , and held her handkerchief to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11181 len. 8]: Joe still stood , looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 11182 len. 54]: ` Your voice , ' said Joe , ` brings up old times so pleasantly , that , for the moment , I feel as if that night -- there can be no harm in talking of that night now -- had come back , and nothing had happened in the mean time .
Parsing [sent. 11183 len. 37]: I feel as if I had n't suffered any hardships , but had knocked down poor Tom Cobb only yesterday , and had come to see you with my bundle on my shoulder before running away .
Parsing [sent. 11184 len. 5]: -- You remember ? '
Parsing [sent. 11185 len. 2]: Remember !
Parsing [sent. 11186 len. 5]: But she said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 11187 len. 8]: She raised her eyes for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 11188 len. 14]: It was but a glance ; a little , tearful , timid glance .
Parsing [sent. 11189 len. 11]: It kept Joe silent though , for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 11190 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 11191 len. 14]: he said stoutly , ` it was to be otherwise , and was .
Parsing [sent. 11192 len. 19]: I have been abroad , fighting all the summer and frozen up all the winter , ever since .
Parsing [sent. 11193 len. 18]: I have come back as poor in purse as I went , and crippled for life besides .
Parsing [sent. 11194 len. 54]: But , Dolly , I would rather have lost this other arm -- ay , I would rather have lost my head -- than have come back to find you dead , or anything but what I always pictured you to myself , and what I always hoped and wished to find you .
Parsing [sent. 11195 len. 6]: Thank God for all ! '
Parsing [sent. 11196 len. 19]: Oh how much , and how keenly , the little coquette of five years ago , felt now !
Parsing [sent. 11197 len. 8]: She had found her heart at last .
Parsing [sent. 11198 len. 17]: Never having known its worth till now , she had never known the worth of his .
Parsing [sent. 11199 len. 6]: How priceless it appeared ! '
Parsing [sent. 11200 len. 28]: I did hope once , ' said Joe , in his homely way , ` that I might come back a rich man , and marry you .
Parsing [sent. 11201 len. 15]: But I was a boy then , and have long known better than that .
Parsing [sent. 11202 len. 22]: I am a poor , maimed , discharged soldier , and must be content to rub through life as I can .
Parsing [sent. 11203 len. 58]: I ca n't say , even now , that I shall be glad to see you married , Dolly ; but I AM glad -- yes , I am , and glad to think I can say so -- to know that you are admired and courted , and can pick and choose for a happy life .
Parsing [sent. 11204 len. 60]: It 's a comfort to me to know that you 'll talk to your husband about me ; and I hope the time will come when I may be able to like him , and to shake hands with him , and to come and see you as a poor friend who knew you when you were a girl .
Parsing [sent. 11205 len. 5]: God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11206 len. 20]: His hand DID tremble ; but for all that , he took it away again , and left her .
Parsing [sent. 11207 len. 51]: Chapter 73 By this Friday night -- for it was on Friday in the riot week , that Emma and Dolly were rescued , by the timely aid of Joe and Edward Chester -- the disturbances were entirely quelled , and peace and order were restored to the affrighted city .
Parsing [sent. 11208 len. 94]: True , after what had happened , it was impossible for any man to say how long this better state of things might last , or how suddenly new outrages , exceeding even those so lately witnessed , might burst forth and fill its streets with ruin and bloodshed ; for this reason , those who had fled from the recent tumults still kept at a distance , and many families , hitherto unable to procure the means of flight , now availed themselves of the calm , and withdrew into the country .
Parsing [sent. 11209 len. 30]: The shops , too , from Tyburn to Whitechapel , were still shut ; and very little business was transacted in any of the places of great commercial resort .
Parsing [sent. 11210 len. 34]: But , notwithstanding , and in spite of the melancholy forebodings of that numerous class of society who see with the greatest clearness into the darkest perspectives , the town remained profoundly quiet .
Parsing [sent. 11211 len. 92]: The strong military force disposed in every advantageous quarter , and stationed at every commanding point , held the scattered fragments of the mob in check ; the search after rioters was prosecuted with unrelenting vigour ; and if there were any among them so desperate and reckless as to be inclined , after the terrible scenes they had beheld , to venture forth again , they were so daunted by these resolute measures , that they quickly shrunk into their hiding-places , and had no thought but for their safety .
Parsing [sent. 11212 len. 10]: In a word , the crowd was utterly routed .
Parsing [sent. 11213 len. 12]: Upwards of two hundred had been shot dead in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 11214 len. 27]: Two hundred and fifty more were lying , badly wounded , in the hospitals ; of whom seventy or eighty died within a short time afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 11215 len. 14]: A hundred were already in custody , and more were taken every hour .
Parsing [sent. 11216 len. 60]: How many perished in the conflagrations , or by their own excesses , is unknown ; but that numbers found a terrible grave in the hot ashes of the flames they had kindled , or crept into vaults and cellars to drink in secret or to nurse their sores , and never saw the light again , is certain .
Parsing [sent. 11217 len. 26]: When the embers of the fires had been black and cold for many weeks , the labourers ' spades proved this , beyond a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 11218 len. 18]: Seventy-two private houses and four strong jails were destroyed in the four great days of these riots .
Parsing [sent. 11219 len. 40]: The total loss of property , as estimated by the sufferers , was one hundred and fifty-five thousand pounds ; at the lowest and least partial estimate of disinterested persons , it exceeded one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 11220 len. 49]: For this immense loss , compensation was soon afterwards made out of the public purse , in pursuance of a vote of the House of Commons ; the sum being levied on the various wards in the city , on the county , and the borough of Southwark .
Parsing [sent. 11221 len. 23]: Both Lord Mansfield and Lord Saville , however , who had been great sufferers , refused to accept of any compensation whatever .
Parsing [sent. 11222 len. 58]: The House of Commons , sitting on Tuesday with locked and guarded doors , had passed a resolution to the effect that , as soon as the tumults subsided , it would immediately proceed to consider the petitions presented from many of his Majesty 's Protestant subjects , and would take the same into its serious consideration .
Parsing [sent. 11223 len. 49]: While this question was under debate , Mr Herbert , one of the members present , indignantly rose and called upon the House to observe that Lord George Gordon was then sitting under the gallery with the blue cockade , the signal of rebellion , in his hat .
Parsing [sent. 11224 len. 63]: He was not only obliged , by those who sat near , to take it out ; but offering to go into the street to pacify the mob with the somewhat indefinite assurance that the House was prepared to give them ` the satisfaction they sought , ' was actually held down in his seat by the combined force of several members .
Parsing [sent. 11225 len. 39]: In short , the disorder and violence which reigned triumphant out of doors , penetrated into the senate , and there , as elsewhere , terror and alarm prevailed , and ordinary forms were for the time forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 11226 len. 38]: On the Thursday , both Houses had adjourned until the following Monday se ` nnight , declaring it impossible to pursue their deliberations with the necessary gravity and freedom , while they were surrounded by armed troops .
Parsing [sent. 11227 len. 80]: And now that the rioters were dispersed , the citizens were beset with a new fear ; for , finding the public thoroughfares and all their usual places of resort filled with soldiers entrusted with the free use of fire and sword , they began to lend a greedy ear to the rumours which were afloat of martial law being declared , and to dismal stories of prisoners having been seen hanging on lamp-posts in Cheapside and Fleet Street .
Parsing [sent. 11228 len. 71]: These terrors being promptly dispelled by a Proclamation declaring that all the rioters in custody would be tried by a special commission in due course of law , a fresh alarm was engendered by its being whispered abroad that French money had been found on some of the rioters , and that the disturbances had been fomented by foreign powers who sought to compass the overthrow and ruin of England .
Parsing [sent. 11229 len. 100]: This report , which was strengthened by the diffusion of anonymous handbills , but which , if it had any foundation at all , probably owed its origin to the circumstance of some few coins which were not English money having been swept into the pockets of the insurgents with other miscellaneous booty , and afterwards discovered on the prisoners or the dead bodies , -- caused a great sensation ; and men 's minds being in that excited state when they are most apt to catch at any shadow of apprehension , was bruited about with much industry .
Parsing [sent. 11230 len. 41]: All remaining quiet , however , during the whole of this Friday , and on this Friday night , and no new discoveries being made , confidence began to be restored , and the most timid and desponding breathed again .
Parsing [sent. 11231 len. 24]: In Southwark , no fewer than three thousand of the inhabitants formed themselves into a watch , and patrolled the streets every hour .
Parsing [sent. 11232 len. 66]: Nor were the citizens slow to follow so good an example : and it being the manner of peaceful men to be very bold when the danger is over , they were abundantly fierce and daring ; not scrupling to question the stoutest passenger with great severity , and carrying it with a very high hand over all errand-boys , servant-girls , and ` prentices .
Parsing [sent. 11233 len. 63]: As day deepened into evening , and darkness crept into the nooks and corners of the town as if it were mustering in secret and gathering strength to venture into the open ways , Barnaby sat in his dungeon , wondering at the silence , and listening in vain for the noise and outcry which had ushered in the night of late .
Parsing [sent. 11234 len. 19]: Beside him , with his hand in hers , sat one in whose companionship he felt at peace .
Parsing [sent. 11235 len. 20]: She was worn , and altered , full of grief , and heavy-hearted ; but the same to him .
Parsing [sent. 11236 len. 31]: ` Mother , ' he said , after a long silence : ` how long , -- how many days and nights , -- shall I be kept here ? '
Parsing [sent. 11237 len. 6]: ` Not many , dear .
Parsing [sent. 11238 len. 6]: I hope not many . '
Parsing [sent. 11239 len. 4]: ` You hope !
Parsing [sent. 11240 len. 11]: Ay , but your hoping will not undo these chains .
Parsing [sent. 11241 len. 10]: I hope , but they do n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 11242 len. 10]: Grip hopes , but who cares for Grip ? '
Parsing [sent. 11243 len. 11]: The raven gave a short , dull , melancholy croak .
Parsing [sent. 11244 len. 14]: It said ` Nobody , ' as plainly as a croak could speak .
Parsing [sent. 11245 len. 12]: ` Who cares for Grip , except you and me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11246 len. 13]: said Barnaby , smoothing the bird 's rumpled feathers with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 11247 len. 67]: ` He never speaks in this place ; he never says a word in jail ; he sits and mopes all day in his dark corner , dozing sometimes , and sometimes looking at the light that creeps in through the bars , and shines in his bright eye as if a spark from those great fires had fallen into the room and was burning yet .
Parsing [sent. 11248 len. 7]: But who cares for Grip ? '
Parsing [sent. 11249 len. 7]: The raven croaked again -- Nobody .
Parsing [sent. 11250 len. 61]: ` And by the way , ' said Barnaby , withdrawing his hand from the bird , and laying it upon his mother 's arm , as he looked eagerly in her face ; ` if they kill me -- they may : I heard it said they would -- what will become of Grip when I am dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 11251 len. 26]: The sound of the word , or the current of his own thoughts , suggested to Grip his old phrase ` Never say die ! '
Parsing [sent. 11252 len. 35]: But he stopped short in the middle of it , drew a dismal cork , and subsided into a faint croak , as if he lacked the heart to get through the shortest sentence .
Parsing [sent. 11253 len. 12]: ` Will they take HIS life as well as mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 11254 len. 4]: said Barnaby . '
Parsing [sent. 11255 len. 5]: I wish they would .
Parsing [sent. 11256 len. 24]: If you and I and he could die together , there would be none to feel sorry , or to grieve for us .
Parsing [sent. 11257 len. 15]: But do what they will , I do n't fear them , mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 11258 len. 17]: ` They will not harm you , ' she said , her tears choking her utterance .
Parsing [sent. 11259 len. 12]: ` They never will harm you , when they know all .
Parsing [sent. 11260 len. 8]: I am sure they never will . '
Parsing [sent. 11261 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11262 len. 30]: Do n't be too sure of that , ' cried Barnaby , with a strange pleasure in the belief that she was self-deceived , and in his own sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 11263 len. 9]: ` They have marked me from the first .
Parsing [sent. 11264 len. 23]: I heard them say so to each other when they brought me to this place last night ; and I believe them .
Parsing [sent. 11265 len. 7]: Do n't you cry for me .
Parsing [sent. 11266 len. 18]: They said that I was bold , and so I am , and so I will be .
Parsing [sent. 11267 len. 17]: You may think that I am silly , but I can die as well as another .
Parsing [sent. 11268 len. 11]: -- I have done no harm , have I ? '
Parsing [sent. 11269 len. 4]: he added quickly .
Parsing [sent. 11270 len. 9]: ` None before Heaven , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 11271 len. 15]: ` Why then , ' said Barnaby , ` let them do their worst .
Parsing [sent. 11272 len. 31]: You told me once -- you -- when I asked you what death meant , that it was nothing to be feared , if we did no harm -- Aha !
Parsing [sent. 11273 len. 10]: mother , you thought I had forgotten that ! '
Parsing [sent. 11274 len. 12]: His merry laugh and playful manner smote her to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 11275 len. 46]: She drew him closer to her , and besought him to talk to her in whispers and to be very quiet , for it was getting dark , and their time was short , and she would soon have to leave him for the night .
Parsing [sent. 11276 len. 7]: ` You will come to-morrow ? '
Parsing [sent. 11277 len. 3]: said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 11278 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 11279 len. 4]: And every day .
Parsing [sent. 11280 len. 7]: And they would never part again .
Parsing [sent. 11281 len. 137]: He joyfully replied that this was well , and what he wished , and what he had felt quite certain she would tell him ; and then he asked her where she had been so long , and why she had not come to see him when he had been a great soldier , and ran through the wild schemes he had had for their being rich and living prosperously , and with some faint notion in his mind that she was sad and he had made her so , tried to console and comfort her , and talked of their former life and his old sports and freedom : little dreaming that every word he uttered only increased her sorrow , and that her tears fell faster at the freshened recollection of their lost tranquillity .
Parsing [sent. 11282 len. 38]: ` Mother , ' said Barnaby , as they heard the man approaching to close the cells for the night , ' when I spoke to you just now about my father you cried `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11283 len. 6]: and turned away your head .
Parsing [sent. 11284 len. 6]: Why did you do so ?
Parsing [sent. 11285 len. 8]: Tell me why , in a word .
Parsing [sent. 11286 len. 6]: You thought HE was dead .
Parsing [sent. 11287 len. 15]: You are not sorry that he is alive and has come back to us .
Parsing [sent. 11288 len. 4]: Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 11289 len. 3]: Here ? '
Parsing [sent. 11290 len. 20]: ` Do not ask any one where he is , or speak about him , ' she made answer .
Parsing [sent. 11291 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 11292 len. 3]: said Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 11293 len. 12]: ` Because he is a stern man , and talks roughly ?
Parsing [sent. 11294 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 11295 len. 23]: I do n't like him , or want to be with him by myself ; but why not speak about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 11296 len. 27]: ` Because I am sorry that he is alive ; sorry that he has come back ; and sorry that he and you have ever met .
Parsing [sent. 11297 len. 19]: Because , dear Barnaby , the endeavour of my life has been to keep you two asunder . '
Parsing [sent. 11298 len. 6]: ` Father and son asunder !
Parsing [sent. 11299 len. 3]: Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 11300 len. 17]: ` He has , ' she whispered in his ear , ` he has shed blood .
Parsing [sent. 11301 len. 10]: The time has come when you must know it .
Parsing [sent. 11302 len. 27]: He has shed the blood of one who loved him well , and trusted him , and never did him wrong in word or deed . '
Parsing [sent. 11303 len. 24]: Barnaby recoiled in horror , and glancing at his stained wrist for an instant , wrapped it , shuddering , in his dress .
Parsing [sent. 11304 len. 35]: ` But , ' she added hastily as the key turned in the lock , ` although we shun him , he is your father , dearest , and I am his wretched wife .
Parsing [sent. 11305 len. 11]: They seek his life , and he will lose it .
Parsing [sent. 11306 len. 28]: It must not be by our means ; nay , if we could win him back to penitence , we should be bound to love him yet .
Parsing [sent. 11307 len. 31]: Do not seem to know him , except as one who fled with you from the jail , and if they question you about him , do not answer them .
Parsing [sent. 11308 len. 11]: God be with you through the night , dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 11309 len. 6]: God be with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11310 len. 14]: She tore herself away , and in a few seconds Barnaby was alone .
Parsing [sent. 11311 len. 30]: He stood for a long time rooted to the spot , with his face hidden in his hands ; then flung himself , sobbing , on his miserable bed .
Parsing [sent. 11312 len. 53]: But the moon came slowly up in all her gentle glory , and the stars looked out , and through the small compass of the grated window , as through the narrow crevice of one good deed in a murky life of guilt , the face of Heaven shone bright and merciful .
Parsing [sent. 11313 len. 56]: He raised his head ; gazed upward at the quiet sky , which seemed to smile upon the earth in sadness , as if the night , more thoughtful than the day , looked down in sorrow on the sufferings and evil deeds of men ; and felt its peace sink deep into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 11314 len. 82]: He , a poor idiot , caged in his narrow cell , was as much lifted up to God , while gazing on the mild light , as the freest and most favoured man in all the spacious city ; and in his ill-remembered prayer , and in the fragment of the childish hymn , with which he sung and crooned himself asleep , there breathed as true a spirit as ever studied homily expressed , or old cathedral arches echoed .
Parsing [sent. 11315 len. 47]: As his mother crossed a yard on her way out , she saw , through a grated door which separated it from another court , her husband , walking round and round , with his hands folded on his breast , and his head hung down .
Parsing [sent. 11316 len. 18]: She asked the man who conducted her , if she might speak a word with this prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 11317 len. 27]: Yes , but she must be quick for he was locking up for the night , and there was but a minute or so to spare .
Parsing [sent. 11318 len. 14]: Saying this , he unlocked the door , and bade her go in .
Parsing [sent. 11319 len. 40]: It grated harshly as it turned upon its hinges , but he was deaf to the noise , and still walked round and round the little court , without raising his head or changing his attitude in the least .
Parsing [sent. 11320 len. 15]: She spoke to him , but her voice was weak , and failed her .
Parsing [sent. 11321 len. 23]: At length she put herself in his track , and when he came near , stretched out her hand and touched him .
Parsing [sent. 11322 len. 22]: He started backward , trembling from head to foot ; but seeing who it was , demanded why she came there .
Parsing [sent. 11323 len. 9]: Before she could reply , he spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 11324 len. 8]: ` Am I to live or die ?
Parsing [sent. 11325 len. 9]: Do you murder too , or spare ? '
Parsing [sent. 11326 len. 18]: ` My son -- our son , ' she answered , ` is in this prison . '
Parsing [sent. 11327 len. 8]: ` What is that to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11328 len. 11]: he cried , stamping impatiently on the stone pavement . '
Parsing [sent. 11329 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 11330 len. 12]: He can no more aid me than I can aid him .
Parsing [sent. 11331 len. 12]: If you are come to talk of him , begone ! '
Parsing [sent. 11332 len. 16]: As he spoke he resumed his walk , and hurried round the court as before .
Parsing [sent. 11333 len. 23]: When he came again to where she stood , he stopped , and said , ` Am I to live or die ?
Parsing [sent. 11334 len. 5]: Do you repent ? '
Parsing [sent. 11335 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11336 len. 5]: -- do YOU ? '
Parsing [sent. 11337 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 11338 len. 8]: ` Will you , while time remains ?
Parsing [sent. 11339 len. 14]: Do not believe that I could save you , if I dared . '
Parsing [sent. 11340 len. 23]: ` Say if you would , ' he answered with an oath , as he tried to disengage himself and pass on .
Parsing [sent. 11341 len. 7]: ` Say if you would . '
Parsing [sent. 11342 len. 18]: ` Listen to me for one moment , ' she returned ; ` for but a moment .
Parsing [sent. 11343 len. 18]: I am but newly risen from a sick-bed , from which I never hoped to rise again .
Parsing [sent. 11344 len. 20]: The best among us think , at such a time , of good intentions half-performed and duties left undone .
Parsing [sent. 11345 len. 130]: If I have ever , since that fatal night , omitted to pray for your repentance before death -- if I omitted , even then , anything which might tend to urge it on you when the horror of your crime was fresh -- if , in our later meeting , I yielded to the dread that was upon me , and forgot to fall upon my knees and solemnly adjure you , in the name of him you sent to his account with Heaven , to prepare for the retribution which must come , and which is stealing on you now -- I humbly before you , and in the agony of supplication in which you see me , beseech that you will let me make atonement . '
Parsing [sent. 11346 len. 11]: ` What is the meaning of your canting words ? '
Parsing [sent. 11347 len. 4]: he answered roughly .
Parsing [sent. 11348 len. 11]: ` Speak so that I may understand you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11349 len. 12]: I will , ' she answered , ' I desire to .
Parsing [sent. 11350 len. 8]: Bear with me for a moment more .
Parsing [sent. 11351 len. 17]: The hand of Him who set His curse on murder , is heavy on us now .
Parsing [sent. 11352 len. 6]: You can not doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 11353 len. 68]: Our son , our innocent boy , on whom His anger fell before his birth , is in this place in peril of his life -- brought here by your guilt ; yes , by that alone , as Heaven sees and knows , for he has been led astray in the darkness of his intellect , and that is the terrible consequence of your crime . '
Parsing [sent. 11354 len. 24]: ` If you come , woman-like , to load me with reproaches -- ' he muttered , again endeavouring to break away . '
Parsing [sent. 11355 len. 4]: I do not .
Parsing [sent. 11356 len. 6]: I have a different purpose .
Parsing [sent. 11357 len. 5]: You must hear it .
Parsing [sent. 11358 len. 14]: If not to-night , to-morrow ; if not to-morrow , at another time .
Parsing [sent. 11359 len. 5]: You MUST hear it .
Parsing [sent. 11360 len. 9]: Husband , escape is hopeless -- impossible . '
Parsing [sent. 11361 len. 10]: ` You tell me so , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11362 len. 12]: he said , raising his manacled hand , and shaking it .
Parsing [sent. 11363 len. 4]: ` You ! '
Parsing [sent. 11364 len. 11]: ` Yes , ' she said , with indescribable earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 11365 len. 5]: ` But why ? '
Parsing [sent. 11366 len. 9]: ` To make me easy in this jail .
Parsing [sent. 11367 len. 13]: To make the time ` twixt this and death , pass pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 11368 len. 30]: For my good -- yes , for my good , of course , ' he said , grinding his teeth , and smiling at her with a livid face .
Parsing [sent. 11369 len. 41]: ` Not to load you with reproaches , ' she replied ; ` not to aggravate the tortures and miseries of your condition , not to give you one hard word , but to restore you to peace and hope .
Parsing [sent. 11370 len. 83]: Husband , dear husband , if you will but confess this dreadful crime ; if you will but implore forgiveness of Heaven and of those whom you have wronged on earth ; if you will dismiss these vain uneasy thoughts , which never can be realised , and will rely on Penitence and on the Truth , I promise you , in the great name of the Creator , whose image you have defaced , that He will comfort and console you .
Parsing [sent. 11371 len. 111]: And for myself , ' she cried , clasping her hands , and looking upward , ' I swear before Him , as He knows my heart and reads it now , that from that hour I will love and cherish you as I did of old , and watch you night and day in the short interval that will remain to us , and soothe you with my truest love and duty , and pray with you , that one threatening judgment may be arrested , and that our boy may be spared to bless God , in his poor way , in the free air and light ! '
Parsing [sent. 11372 len. 33]: He fell back and gazed at her while she poured out these words , as though he were for a moment awed by her manner , and knew not what to do .
Parsing [sent. 11373 len. 18]: But anger and fear soon got the mastery of him , and he spurned her from him .
Parsing [sent. 11374 len. 4]: ` Begone ! '
Parsing [sent. 11375 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 11376 len. 4]: ` Leave me !
Parsing [sent. 11377 len. 6]: You plot , do you !
Parsing [sent. 11378 len. 21]: You plot to get speech with me , and let them know I am the man they say I am .
Parsing [sent. 11379 len. 10]: A curse on you and on your boy . '
Parsing [sent. 11380 len. 17]: ` On him the curse has already fallen , ' she replied , wringing her hands .
Parsing [sent. 11381 len. 6]: ` Let it fall heavier .
Parsing [sent. 11382 len. 8]: Let it fall on one and all .
Parsing [sent. 11383 len. 5]: I hate you both .
Parsing [sent. 11384 len. 7]: The worst has come to me .
Parsing [sent. 11385 len. 21]: The only comfort that I seek or I can have , will be the knowledge that it comes to you .
Parsing [sent. 11386 len. 4]: Now go ! '
Parsing [sent. 11387 len. 19]: She would have urged him gently , even then , but he menaced her with his chain . '
Parsing [sent. 11388 len. 12]: I say go -- I say it for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 11389 len. 23]: The gallows has me in its grasp , and it is a black phantom that may urge me on to something more .
Parsing [sent. 11390 len. 2]: Begone !
Parsing [sent. 11391 len. 21]: I curse the hour that I was born , the man I slew , and all the living world ! '
Parsing [sent. 11392 len. 48]: In a paroxysm of wrath , and terror , and the fear of death , he broke from her , and rushed into the darkness of his cell , where he cast himself jangling down upon the stone floor , and smote it with his ironed hands .
Parsing [sent. 11393 len. 18]: The man returned to lock the dungeon door , and having done so , carried her away .
Parsing [sent. 11394 len. 36]: On that warm , balmy night in June , there were glad faces and light hearts in all quarters of the town , and sleep , banished by the late horrors , was doubly welcomed .
Parsing [sent. 11395 len. 46]: On that night , families made merry in their houses , and greeted each other on the common danger they had escaped ; and those who had been denounced , ventured into the streets ; and they who had been plundered , got good shelter .
Parsing [sent. 11396 len. 70]: Even the timorous Lord Mayor , who was summoned that night before the Privy Council to answer for his conduct , came back contented ; observing to all his friends that he had got off very well with a reprimand , and repeating with huge satisfaction his memorable defence before the Council , ` that such was his temerity , he thought death would have been his portion . '
Parsing [sent. 11397 len. 73]: On that night , too , more of the scattered remnants of the mob were traced to their lurking-places , and taken ; and in the hospitals , and deep among the ruins they had made , and in the ditches , and fields , many unshrouded wretches lay dead : envied by those who had been active in the disturbances , and who pillowed their doomed heads in the temporary jails .
Parsing [sent. 11398 len. 104]: And in the Tower , in a dreary room whose thick stone walls shut out the hum of life , and made a stillness which the records left by former prisoners with those silent witnesses seemed to deepen and intensify ; remorseful for every act that had been done by every man among the cruel crowd ; feeling for the time their guilt his own , and their lives put in peril by himself ; and finding , amidst such reflections , little comfort in fanaticism , or in his fancied call ; sat the unhappy author of all -- Lord George Gordon .
Parsing [sent. 11399 len. 8]: He had been made prisoner that evening .
Parsing [sent. 11400 len. 49]: ` If you are sure it 's me you want , ' he said to the officers , who waited outside with the warrant for his arrest on a charge of High Treason , ' I am ready to accompany you -- ' which he did without resistance .
Parsing [sent. 11401 len. 61]: He was conducted first before the Privy Council , and afterwards to the Horse Guards , and then was taken by way of Westminster Bridge , and back over London Bridge -LRB- for the purpose of avoiding the main streets -RRB- , to the Tower , under the strongest guard ever known to enter its gates with a single prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 11402 len. 15]: Of all his forty thousand men , not one remained to bear him company .
Parsing [sent. 11403 len. 11]: Friends , dependents , followers , -- none were there .
Parsing [sent. 11404 len. 31]: His fawning secretary had played the traitor ; and he whose weakness had been goaded and urged on by so many for their own purposes , was desolate and alone .
Parsing [sent. 11405 len. 38]: Chapter 74 Me Dennis , having been made prisoner late in the evening , was removed to a neighbouring round-house for that night , and carried before a justice for examination on the next day , Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 11406 len. 41]: The charges against him being numerous and weighty , and it being in particular proved , by the testimony of Gabriel Varden , that he had shown a special desire to take his life , he was committed for trial .
Parsing [sent. 11407 len. 47]: Moreover he was honoured with the distinction of being considered a chief among the insurgents , and received from the magistrate 's lips the complimentary assurance that he was in a position of imminent danger , and would do well to prepare himself for the worst .
Parsing [sent. 11408 len. 44]: To say that Mr Dennis 's modesty was not somewhat startled by these honours , or that he was altogether prepared for so flattering a reception , would be to claim for him a greater amount of stoical philosophy than even he possessed .
Parsing [sent. 11409 len. 50]: Indeed this gentleman 's stoicism was of that not uncommon kind , which enables a man to bear with exemplary fortitude the afflictions of his friends , but renders him , by way of counterpoise , rather selfish and sensitive in respect of any that happen to befall himself .
Parsing [sent. 11410 len. 55]: It is therefore no disparagement to the great officer in question to state , without disguise or concealment , that he was at first very much alarmed , and that he betrayed divers emotions of fear , until his reasoning powers came to his relief , and set before him a more hopeful prospect .
Parsing [sent. 11411 len. 39]: In proportion as Mr Dennis exercised these intellectual qualities with which he was gifted , in reviewing his best chances of coming off handsomely and with small personal inconvenience , his spirits rose , and his confidence increased .
Parsing [sent. 11412 len. 177]: When he remembered the great estimation in which his office was held , and the constant demand for his services ; when he bethought himself , how the Statute Book regarded him as a kind of Universal Medicine applicable to men , women , and children , of every age and variety of criminal constitution ; and how high he stood , in his official capacity , in the favour of the Crown , and both Houses of Parliament , the Mint , the Bank of England , and the Judges of the land ; when he recollected that whatever Ministry was in or out , he remained their peculiar pet and panacea , and that for his sake England stood single and conspicuous among the civilised nations of the earth : when he called these things to mind and dwelt upon them , he felt certain that the national gratitude MUST relieve him from the consequences of his late proceedings , and would certainly restore him to his old place in the happy social system .
Parsing [sent. 11413 len. 41]: With these crumbs , or as one may say , with these whole loaves of comfort to regale upon , Mr Dennis took his place among the escort that awaited him , and repaired to jail with a manly indifference .
Parsing [sent. 11414 len. 44]: Arriving at Newgate , where some of the ruined cells had been hastily fitted up for the safe keeping of rioters , he was warmly received by the turnkeys , as an unusual and interesting case , which agreeably relieved their monotonous duties .
Parsing [sent. 11415 len. 20]: In this spirit , he was fettered with great care , and conveyed into the interior of the prison .
Parsing [sent. 11416 len. 42]: ` Brother , ' cried the hangman , as , following an officer , he traversed under these novel circumstances the remains of passages with which he was well acquainted , ` am I going to be along with anybody ? '
Parsing [sent. 11417 len. 21]: ` If you 'd have left more walls standing , you 'd have been alone , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 11418 len. 18]: ` As it is , we 're cramped for room , and you 'll have company . '
Parsing [sent. 11419 len. 17]: ` Well , ' returned Dennis , ' I do n't object to company , brother .
Parsing [sent. 11420 len. 5]: I rather like company .
Parsing [sent. 11421 len. 10]: I was formed for society , I was . '
Parsing [sent. 11422 len. 12]: ` That 's rather a pity , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 11423 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 11424 len. 16]: ` No , ' answered Dennis , ` I 'm not aware that it is .
Parsing [sent. 11425 len. 10]: Why should it be a pity , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 11426 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11427 len. 12]: I do n't know , ' said the man carelessly . '
Parsing [sent. 11428 len. 8]: I thought that was what you meant .
Parsing [sent. 11429 len. 34]: Being formed for society , and being cut off in your flower , you know -- ' ' I say , ' interposed the other quickly , ` what are you talking of ?
Parsing [sent. 11430 len. 3]: Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 11431 len. 12]: Who 's a-going to be cut off in their flowers ? '
Parsing [sent. 11432 len. 6]: ` Oh , nobody particular .
Parsing [sent. 11433 len. 12]: I thought you was , perhaps , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 11434 len. 43]: Mr Dennis wiped his face , which had suddenly grown very hot , and remarking in a tremulous voice to his conductor that he had always been fond of his joke , followed him in silence until he stopped at a door .
Parsing [sent. 11435 len. 10]: ` This is my quarters , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 11436 len. 4]: he asked facetiously .
Parsing [sent. 11437 len. 13]: ` This is the shop , sir , ' replied his friend .
Parsing [sent. 11438 len. 22]: He was walking in , but not with the best possible grace , when he suddenly stopped , and started back .
Parsing [sent. 11439 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 11440 len. 4]: said the officer .
Parsing [sent. 11441 len. 6]: ` You 're nervous . '
Parsing [sent. 11442 len. 4]: ` Nervous ! '
Parsing [sent. 11443 len. 6]: whispered Dennis in great alarm .
Parsing [sent. 11444 len. 6]: ` Well I may be .
Parsing [sent. 11445 len. 6]: Shut the door . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11446 len. 13]: I will , when you 're in , ' returned the man .
Parsing [sent. 11447 len. 14]: ` But I ca n't go in there , ' whispered Dennis . '
Parsing [sent. 11448 len. 10]: I ca n't be shut up with that man .
Parsing [sent. 11449 len. 11]: Do you want me to be throttled , brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 11450 len. 42]: The officer seemed to entertain no particular desire on the subject one way or other , but briefly remarking that he had his orders , and intended to obey them , pushed him in , turned the key , and retired .
Parsing [sent. 11451 len. 61]: Dennis stood trembling with his back against the door , and involuntarily raising his arm to defend himself , stared at a man , the only other tenant of the cell , who lay , stretched at his fall length , upon a stone bench , and who paused in his deep breathing as if he were about to wake .
Parsing [sent. 11452 len. 29]: But he rolled over on one side , let his arm fall negligently down , drew a long sigh , and murmuring indistinctly , fell fast asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 11453 len. 36]: Relieved in some degree by this , the hangman took his eyes for an instant from the slumbering figure , and glanced round the cell in search of some ` vantage-ground or weapon of defence .
Parsing [sent. 11454 len. 24]: There was nothing moveable within it , but a clumsy table which could not be displaced without noise , and a heavy chair .
Parsing [sent. 11455 len. 35]: Stealing on tiptoe towards this latter piece of furniture , he retired with it into the remotest corner , and intrenching himself behind it , watched the enemy with the utmost vigilance and caution .
Parsing [sent. 11456 len. 38]: The sleeping man was Hugh ; and perhaps it was not unnatural for Dennis to feel in a state of very uncomfortable suspense , and to wish with his whole soul that he might never wake again .
Parsing [sent. 11457 len. 47]: Tired of standing , he crouched down in his corner after some time , and rested on the cold pavement ; but although Hugh 's breathing still proclaimed that he was sleeping soundly , he could not trust him out of his sight for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 11458 len. 72]: He was so afraid of him , and of some sudden onslaught , that he was not content to see his closed eyes through the chair-back , but every now and then , rose stealthily to his feet , and peered at him with outstretched neck , to assure himself that he really was still asleep , and was not about to spring upon him when he was off his guard .
Parsing [sent. 11459 len. 24]: He slept so long and so soundly , that Mr Dennis began to think he might sleep on until the turnkey visited them .
Parsing [sent. 11460 len. 44]: He was congratulating himself upon these promising appearances , and blessing his stars with much fervour , when one or two unpleasant symptoms manifested themselves : such as another motion of the arm , another sigh , a restless tossing of the head .
Parsing [sent. 11461 len. 26]: Then , just as it seemed that he was about to fall heavily to the ground from his narrow bed , Hugh 's eyes opened .
Parsing [sent. 11462 len. 13]: It happened that his face was turned directly towards his unexpected visitor .
Parsing [sent. 11463 len. 31]: He looked lazily at him for some half-dozen seconds without any aspect of surprise or recognition ; then suddenly jumped up , and with a great oath pronounced his name .
Parsing [sent. 11464 len. 10]: ` Keep off , brother , keep off ! '
Parsing [sent. 11465 len. 8]: cried Dennis , dodging behind the chair .
Parsing [sent. 11466 len. 8]: ` Do n't do me a mischief .
Parsing [sent. 11467 len. 7]: I 'm a prisoner like you .
Parsing [sent. 11468 len. 10]: I have n't the free use of my limbs .
Parsing [sent. 11469 len. 7]: I 'm quite an old man .
Parsing [sent. 11470 len. 6]: Do n't hurt me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11471 len. 40]: He whined out the last three words in such piteous accents , that Hugh , who had dragged away the chair , and aimed a blow at him with it , checked himself , and bade him get up .
Parsing [sent. 11472 len. 24]: ` I 'll get up certainly , brother , ' cried Dennis , anxious to propitiate him by any means in his power .
Parsing [sent. 11473 len. 14]: ` I 'll comply with any request of yours , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 11474 len. 7]: There -- I 'm up now .
Parsing [sent. 11475 len. 7]: What can I do for you ?
Parsing [sent. 11476 len. 12]: Only say the word , and I 'll do it . '
Parsing [sent. 11477 len. 9]: ` What can you do for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11478 len. 28]: cried Hugh , clutching him by the collar with both hands , and shaking him as though he were bent on stopping his breath by that means .
Parsing [sent. 11479 len. 9]: ` What have you done for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11480 len. 4]: ` The best .
Parsing [sent. 11481 len. 12]: The best that could be done , ' returned the hangman .
Parsing [sent. 11482 len. 36]: Hugh made him no answer , but shaking him in his strong grip until his teeth chattered in his head , cast him down upon the floor , and flung himself on the bench again .
Parsing [sent. 11483 len. 36]: ` If it was n't for the comfort it is to me , to see you here , ' he muttered , ` I 'd have crushed your head against it ; I would . '
Parsing [sent. 11484 len. 28]: It was some time before Dennis had breath enough to speak , but as soon as he could resume his propitiatory strain , he did so . '
Parsing [sent. 11485 len. 20]: I did the best that could be done , brother , ' he whined ; ' I did indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11486 len. 25]: I was forced with two bayonets and I do n't know how many bullets on each side of me , to point you out .
Parsing [sent. 11487 len. 30]: If you had n't been taken , you 'd have been shot ; and what a sight that would have been -- a fine young man like you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11488 len. 10]: ` Will it be a better sight now ? '
Parsing [sent. 11489 len. 24]: asked Hugh , raising his head , with such a fierce expression , that the other durst not answer him just then . '
Parsing [sent. 11490 len. 13]: A deal better , ' said Dennis meekly , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 11491 len. 19]: ` First , there 's all the chances of the law , and they 're five hundred strong .
Parsing [sent. 11492 len. 6]: We may get off scot-free .
Parsing [sent. 11493 len. 9]: Unlikelier things than that have come to pass .
Parsing [sent. 11494 len. 60]: Even if we should n't , and the chances fail , we can but be worked off once : and when it 's well done , it 's so neat , so skilful , so captiwating , if that do n't seem too strong a word , that you 'd hardly believe it could be brought to sich perfection .
Parsing [sent. 11495 len. 9]: Kill one 's fellow-creeturs off , with muskets !
Parsing [sent. 11496 len. 4]: -- Pah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11497 len. 18]: and his nature so revolted at the bare idea , that he spat upon the dungeon pavement .
Parsing [sent. 11498 len. 64]: His warming on this topic , which to one unacquainted with his pursuits and tastes appeared like courage ; together with his artful suppression of his own secret hopes , and mention of himself as being in the same condition with Hugh ; did more to soothe that ruffian than the most elaborate arguments could have done , or the most abject submission .
Parsing [sent. 11499 len. 30]: He rested his arms upon his knees , and stooping forward , looked from beneath his shaggy hair at Dennis , with something of a smile upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 11500 len. 27]: ` The fact is , brother , ' said the hangman , in a tone of greater confidence , ` that you got into bad company .
Parsing [sent. 11501 len. 20]: The man that was with you was looked after more than you , and it was him I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 11502 len. 11]: As to me , what have I got by it ?
Parsing [sent. 11503 len. 12]: Here we are , in one and the same plight . '
Parsing [sent. 11504 len. 41]: ` Lookee , rascal , ' said Hugh , contracting his brows , ` I 'm not altogether such a shallow blade but I know you expected to get something by it , or you would n't have done it .
Parsing [sent. 11505 len. 36]: But it 's done , and you 're here , and it will soon be all over with you and me ; and I 'd as soon die as live , or live as die .
Parsing [sent. 11506 len. 11]: Why should I trouble myself to have revenge on you ?
Parsing [sent. 11507 len. 24]: To eat , and drink , and go to sleep , as long as I stay here , is all I care for .
Parsing [sent. 11508 len. 41]: If there was but a little more sun to bask in , than can find its way into this cursed place , I 'd lie in it all day , and not trouble myself to sit or stand up once .
Parsing [sent. 11509 len. 10]: That 's all the care I have for myself .
Parsing [sent. 11510 len. 8]: Why should I care for YOU ? '
Parsing [sent. 11511 len. 29]: Finishing this speech with a growl like the yawn of a wild beast , he stretched himself upon the bench again , and closed his eyes once more .
Parsing [sent. 11512 len. 53]: After looking at him in silence for some moments , Dennis , who was greatly relieved to find him in this mood , drew the chair towards his rough couch and sat down near him -- taking the precaution , however , to keep out of the range of his brawny arm .
Parsing [sent. 11513 len. 18]: ` Well said , brother ; nothing could be better said , ' he ventured to observe .
Parsing [sent. 11514 len. 24]: ` We 'll eat and drink of the best , and sleep our best , and make the best of it every way .
Parsing [sent. 11515 len. 7]: Anything can be got for money .
Parsing [sent. 11516 len. 7]: Let 's spend it merrily . '
Parsing [sent. 11517 len. 14]: ` Ay , ' said Hugh , coiling himself into a new position .
Parsing [sent. 11518 len. 7]: -- ` Where is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 11519 len. 26]: ` Why , they took mine from me at the lodge , ' said Mr Dennis ; ` but mine 's a peculiar case . '
Parsing [sent. 11520 len. 4]: ` Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 11521 len. 6]: They took mine too . '
Parsing [sent. 11522 len. 15]: ` Why then , I tell you what , brother , ' Dennis began .
Parsing [sent. 11523 len. 14]: ` You must look up your friends -- ' ` My friends ! '
Parsing [sent. 11524 len. 11]: cried Hugh , starting up and resting on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 11525 len. 7]: ` Where are my friends ? '
Parsing [sent. 11526 len. 9]: ` Your relations then , ' said Dennis .
Parsing [sent. 11527 len. 6]: ` Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 11528 len. 10]: laughed Hugh , waving one arm above his head .
Parsing [sent. 11529 len. 43]: ` He talks of friends to me -- talks of relations to a man whose mother died the death in store for her son , and left him , a hungry brat , without a face he knew in all the world !
Parsing [sent. 11530 len. 8]: He talks of this to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11531 len. 43]: ` Brother , ' cried the hangman , whose features underwent a sudden change , ` you do n't mean to say -- ' ' I mean to say , ' Hugh interposed , ` that they hung her up at Tyburn .
Parsing [sent. 11532 len. 13]: What was good enough for her , is good enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 11533 len. 18]: Let them do the like by me as soon as they please -- the sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 11534 len. 6]: Say no more to me .
Parsing [sent. 11535 len. 7]: I 'm going to sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 11536 len. 24]: ` But I want to speak to you ; I want to hear more about that , ' said Dennis , changing colour .
Parsing [sent. 11537 len. 30]: ` If you 're a wise man , ' growled Hugh , raising his head to look at him with a frown , ` you 'll hold your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 11538 len. 10]: I tell you I 'm going to sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 11539 len. 45]: Dennis venturing to say something more in spite of this caution , the desperate fellow struck at him with all his force , and missing him , lay down again with many muttered oaths and imprecations , and turned his face towards the wall .
Parsing [sent. 11540 len. 58]: After two or three ineffectual twitches at his dress , which he was hardy enough to venture upon , notwithstanding his dangerous humour , Mr Dennis , who burnt , for reasons of his own , to pursue the conversation , had no alternative but to sit as patiently as he could : waiting his further pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 11541 len. 19]: Chapter 75 A month has elapsed , -- and we stand in the bedchamber of Sir John Chester .
Parsing [sent. 11542 len. 59]: Through the half-opened window , the Temple Garden looks green and pleasant ; the placid river , gay with boat and barge , and dimpled with the plash of many an oar , sparkles in the distance ; the sky is blue and clear ; and the summer air steals gently in , filling the room with perfume .
Parsing [sent. 11543 len. 11]: The very town , the smoky town , is radiant .
Parsing [sent. 11544 len. 57]: High roofs and steeple-tops , wont to look black and sullen , smile a cheerful grey ; every old gilded vane , and ball , and cross , glitters anew in the bright morning sun ; and , high among them all , St Paul 's towers up , showing its lofty crest in burnished gold .
Parsing [sent. 11545 len. 7]: Sir John was breakfasting in bed .
Parsing [sent. 11546 len. 65]: His chocolate and toast stood upon a little table at his elbow ; books and newspapers lay ready to his hand , upon the coverlet ; and , sometimes pausing to glance with an air of tranquil satisfaction round the well-ordered room , and sometimes to gaze indolently at the summer sky , he ate , and drank , and read the news luxuriously .
Parsing [sent. 11547 len. 18]: The cheerful influence of the morning seemed to have some effect , even upon his equable temper .
Parsing [sent. 11548 len. 22]: His manner was unusually gay ; his smile more placid and agreeable than usual ; his voice more clear and pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 11549 len. 53]: He laid down the newspaper he had been reading ; leaned back upon his pillow with the air of one who resigned himself to a train of charming recollections ; and after a pause , soliloquised as follows : ` And my friend the centaur , goes the way of his mamma !
Parsing [sent. 11550 len. 5]: I am not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 11551 len. 9]: And his mysterious friend Mr Dennis , likewise !
Parsing [sent. 11552 len. 5]: I am not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 11553 len. 13]: And my old postman , the exceedingly free-and-easy young madman of Chigwell !
Parsing [sent. 11554 len. 5]: I am quite rejoiced .
Parsing [sent. 11555 len. 14]: It 's the very best thing that could possibly happen to him . '
Parsing [sent. 11556 len. 41]: After delivering himself of these remarks , he fell again into his smiling train of reflection ; from which he roused himself at length to finish his chocolate , which was getting cold , and ring the bell for more .
Parsing [sent. 11557 len. 36]: The new supply arriving , he took the cup from his servant 's hand ; and saying , with a charming affability , ' I am obliged to you , Peak , ' dismissed him .
Parsing [sent. 11558 len. 84]: ` It is a remarkable circumstance , ' he mused , dallying lazily with the teaspoon , ` that my friend the madman should have been within an ace of escaping , on his trial ; and it was a good stroke of chance -LRB- or , as the world would say , a providential occurrence -RRB- that the brother of my Lord Mayor should have been in court , with other country justices , into whose very dense heads curiosity had penetrated .
Parsing [sent. 11559 len. 68]: For though the brother of my Lord Mayor was decidedly wrong ; and established his near relationship to that amusing person beyond all doubt , in stating that my friend was sane , and had , to his knowledge , wandered about the country with a vagabond parent , avowing revolutionary and rebellious sentiments ; I am not the less obliged to him for volunteering that evidence .
Parsing [sent. 11560 len. 25]: These insane creatures make such very odd and embarrassing remarks , that they really ought to be hanged for the comfort of society . '
Parsing [sent. 11561 len. 23]: The country justice had indeed turned the wavering scale against poor Barnaby , and solved the doubt that trembled in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 11562 len. 11]: Grip little thought how much he had to answer for .
Parsing [sent. 11563 len. 31]: ` They will be a singular party , ' said Sir John , leaning his head upon his hand , and sipping his chocolate ; ' a very curious party .
Parsing [sent. 11564 len. 11]: The hangman himself ; the centaur ; and the madman .
Parsing [sent. 11565 len. 19]: The centaur would make a very handsome preparation in Surgeons ' Hall , and would benefit science extremely .
Parsing [sent. 11566 len. 10]: I hope they have taken care to bespeak him .
Parsing [sent. 11567 len. 19]: -- Peak , I am not at home , of course , to anybody but the hairdresser . '
Parsing [sent. 11568 len. 22]: This reminder to his servant was called forth by a knock at the door , which the man hastened to open .
Parsing [sent. 11569 len. 32]: After a prolonged murmur of question and answer , he returned ; and as he cautiously closed the room-door behind him , a man was heard to cough in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 11570 len. 34]: ` Now , it is of no use , Peak , ' said Sir John , raising his hand in deprecation of his delivering any message ; ' I am not at home .
Parsing [sent. 11571 len. 7]: I can not possibly hear you .
Parsing [sent. 11572 len. 15]: I told you I was not at home , and my word is sacred .
Parsing [sent. 11573 len. 10]: Will you never do as you are desired ? '
Parsing [sent. 11574 len. 58]: Having nothing to oppose to this reproof , the man was about to withdraw , when the visitor who had given occasion to it , probably rendered impatient by delay , knocked with his knuckles at the chamber-door , and called out that he had urgent business with Sir John Chester , which admitted of no delay .
Parsing [sent. 11575 len. 10]: ` Let him in , ' said Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 11576 len. 33]: ` My good fellow , ' he added , when the door was opened , ` how come you to intrude yourself in this extraordinary manner upon the privacy of a gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 11577 len. 19]: How can you be so wholly destitute of self-respect as to be guilty of such remarkable ill-breeding ? '
Parsing [sent. 11578 len. 26]: ` My business , Sir John , is not of a common kind , I do assure you , ' returned the person he addressed .
Parsing [sent. 11579 len. 25]: ` If I have taken any uncommon course to get admission to you , I hope I shall be pardoned on that account . '
Parsing [sent. 11580 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 11581 len. 33]: we shall see ; we shall see , ' returned Sir John , whose face cleared up when he saw who it was , and whose prepossessing smile was now restored . '
Parsing [sent. 11582 len. 25]: I am sure we have met before , ' he added in his winning tone , ` but really I forget your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 11583 len. 10]: ` My name is Gabriel Varden , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11584 len. 17]: ` Varden , of course , Varden , ' returned Sir John , tapping his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 11585 len. 11]: ` Dear me , how very defective my memory becomes !
Parsing [sent. 11586 len. 10]: Varden to be sure -- Mr Varden the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 11587 len. 15]: You have a charming wife , Mr Varden , and a most beautiful daughter .
Parsing [sent. 11588 len. 5]: They are well ? '
Parsing [sent. 11589 len. 10]: Gabriel thanked him , and said they were . '
Parsing [sent. 11590 len. 11]: I rejoice to hear it , ' said Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 11591 len. 32]: ` Commend me to them when you return , and say that I wished I were fortunate enough to convey , myself , the salute which I entrust you to deliver .
Parsing [sent. 11592 len. 22]: And what , ' he asked very sweetly , after a moment 's pause , ` can I do for you ?
Parsing [sent. 11593 len. 8]: You may command me freely . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11594 len. 36]: I thank you , Sir John , ' said Gabriel , with some pride in his manner , ` but I have come to ask no favour of you , though I come on business .
Parsing [sent. 11595 len. 26]: -- Private , ' he added , with a glance at the man who stood looking on , ` and very pressing business . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11596 len. 50]: I can not say you are the more welcome for being independent , and having nothing to ask of me , ' returned Sir John , graciously , ` for I should have been happy to render you a service ; still , you are welcome on any terms .
Parsing [sent. 11597 len. 15]: Oblige me with some more chocolate , Peak , and do n't wait . '
Parsing [sent. 11598 len. 9]: The man retired , and left them alone .
Parsing [sent. 11599 len. 23]: ` Sir John , ' said Gabriel , ' I am a working-man , and have been so , all my life .
Parsing [sent. 11600 len. 56]: If I do n't prepare you enough for what I have to tell ; if I come to the point too abruptly ; and give you a shock , which a gentleman could have spared you , or at all events lessened very much ; I hope you will give me credit for meaning well .
Parsing [sent. 11601 len. 29]: I wish to be careful and considerate , and I trust that in a straightforward person like me , you 'll take the will for the deed . '
Parsing [sent. 11602 len. 24]: ` Mr Varden , ' returned the other , perfectly composed under this exordium ; ' I beg you 'll take a chair .
Parsing [sent. 11603 len. 9]: Chocolate , perhaps , you do n't relish ?
Parsing [sent. 11604 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 11605 len. 10]: it IS an acquired taste , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 11606 len. 28]: ` Sir John , ' said Gabriel , who had acknowledged with a bow the invitation to be seated , but had not availed himself of it .
Parsing [sent. 11607 len. 31]: ` Sir John ' -- he dropped his voice and drew nearer to the bed -- ' I am just now come from Newgate -- ' ` Good Gad ! '
Parsing [sent. 11608 len. 17]: cried Sir John , hastily sitting up in bed ; ` from Newgate , Mr Varden !
Parsing [sent. 11609 len. 13]: How could you be so very imprudent as to come from Newgate !
Parsing [sent. 11610 len. 22]: Newgate , where there are jail-fevers , and ragged people , and bare-footed men and women , and a thousand horrors !
Parsing [sent. 11611 len. 8]: Peak , bring the camphor , quick !
Parsing [sent. 11612 len. 21]: Heaven and earth , Mr Varden , my dear , good soul , how COULD you come from Newgate ? '
Parsing [sent. 11613 len. 60]: Gabriel returned no answer , but looked on in silence while Peak -LRB- who had entered with the hot chocolate -RRB- ran to a drawer , and returning with a bottle , sprinkled his master 's dressing-gown and the bedding ; and besides moistening the locksmith himself , plentifully , described a circle round about him on the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 11614 len. 33]: When he had done this , he again retired ; and Sir John , reclining in an easy attitude upon his pillow , once more turned a smiling face towards his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 11615 len. 28]: ` You will forgive me , Mr Varden , I am sure , for being at first a little sensitive both on your account and my own .
Parsing [sent. 11616 len. 11]: I confess I was startled , notwithstanding your delicate exordium .
Parsing [sent. 11617 len. 15]: Might I ask you to do me the favour not to approach any nearer ?
Parsing [sent. 11618 len. 9]: -- You have really come from Newgate ! '
Parsing [sent. 11619 len. 6]: The locksmith inclined his head .
Parsing [sent. 11620 len. 3]: ` In-deed !
Parsing [sent. 11621 len. 36]: And now , Mr Varden , all exaggeration and embellishment apart , ' said Sir John Chester , confidentially , as he sipped his chocolate , ` what kind of place IS Newgate ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11622 len. 20]: A strange place , Sir John , ' returned the locksmith , ` of a sad and doleful kind .
Parsing [sent. 11623 len. 26]: A strange place , where many strange things are heard and seen ; but few more strange than that I come to tell you of .
Parsing [sent. 11624 len. 5]: The case is urgent .
Parsing [sent. 11625 len. 6]: I am sent here . '
Parsing [sent. 11626 len. 13]: ` Not -- no , no -- not from the jail ? '
Parsing [sent. 11627 len. 11]: ` Yes , Sir John ; from the jail . '
Parsing [sent. 11628 len. 29]: ` And my good , credulous , open-hearted friend , ' said Sir John , setting down his cup , and laughing , -- ` by whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 11629 len. 24]: ` By a man called Dennis -- for many years the hangman , and to-morrow morning the hanged , ' returned the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 11630 len. 33]: Sir John had expected -- had been quite certain from the first -- that he would say he had come from Hugh , and was prepared to meet him on that point .
Parsing [sent. 11631 len. 33]: But this answer occasioned him a degree of astonishment , which , for the moment , he could not , with all his command of feature , prevent his face from expressing .
Parsing [sent. 11632 len. 25]: He quickly subdued it , however , and said in the same light tone : ` And what does the gentleman require of me ?
Parsing [sent. 11633 len. 45]: My memory may be at fault again , but I do n't recollect that I ever had the pleasure of an introduction to him , or that I ever numbered him among my personal friends , I do assure you , Mr Varden . '
Parsing [sent. 11634 len. 54]: ` Sir John , ' returned the locksmith , gravely , ' I will tell you , as nearly as I can , in the words he used to me , what he desires that you should know , and what you ought to know without a moment 's loss of time . '
Parsing [sent. 11635 len. 34]: Sir John Chester settled himself in a position of greater repose , and looked at his visitor with an expression of face which seemed to say , ` This is an amusing fellow !
Parsing [sent. 11636 len. 7]: I 'll hear him out . '
Parsing [sent. 11637 len. 62]: ` You may have seen in the newspapers , sir , ' said Gabriel , pointing to the one which lay by his side , ` that I was a witness against this man upon his trial some days since ; and that it was not his fault I was alive , and able to speak to what I knew . '
Parsing [sent. 11638 len. 6]: ` MAY have seen ! '
Parsing [sent. 11639 len. 4]: cried Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 11640 len. 23]: ` My dear Mr Varden , you are quite a public character , and live in all men 's thoughts most deservedly .
Parsing [sent. 11641 len. 26]: Nothing can exceed the interest with which I read your testimony , and remembered that I had the pleasure of a slight acquaintance with you .
Parsing [sent. 11642 len. 12]: -- - I hope we shall have your portrait published ? '
Parsing [sent. 11643 len. 55]: ` This morning , sir , ' said the locksmith , taking no notice of these compliments , ` early this morning , a message was brought to me from Newgate , at this man 's request , desiring that I would go and see him , for he had something particular to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 11644 len. 29]: I need n't tell you that he is no friend of mine , and that I had never seen him , until the rioters beset my house . '
Parsing [sent. 11645 len. 13]: Sir John fanned himself gently with the newspaper , and nodded . '
Parsing [sent. 11646 len. 47]: I knew , however , from the general report , ' resumed Gabriel , ` that the order for his execution to-morrow , went down to the prison last night ; and looking upon him as a dying man , I complied with his request . '
Parsing [sent. 11647 len. 34]: ` You are quite a Christian , Mr Varden , ' said Sir John ; ` and in that amiable capacity , you increase my desire that you should take a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 11648 len. 70]: ` He said , ' continued Gabriel , looking steadily at the knight , ` that he had sent to me , because he had no friend or companion in the whole world -LRB- being the common hangman -RRB- , and because he believed , from the way in which I had given my evidence , that I was an honest man , and would act truly by him .
Parsing [sent. 11649 len. 91]: He said that , being shunned by every one who knew his calling , even by people of the lowest and most wretched grade , and finding , when he joined the rioters , that the men he acted with had no suspicion of it -LRB- which I believe is true enough , for a poor fool of an old ` prentice of mine was one of them -RRB- , he had kept his own counsel , up to the time of his being taken and put in jail . '
Parsing [sent. 11650 len. 48]: ` Very discreet of Mr Dennis , ' observed Sir John with a slight yawn , though still with the utmost affability , ` but -- except for your admirable and lucid manner of telling it , which is perfect -- not very interesting to me . '
Parsing [sent. 11651 len. 62]: ` When , ' pursued the locksmith , quite unabashed and wholly regardless of these interruptions , ` when he was taken to the jail , he found that his fellow-prisoner , in the same room , was a young man , Hugh by name , a leader in the riots , who had been betrayed and given up by himself .
Parsing [sent. 11652 len. 37]: From something which fell from this unhappy creature in the course of the angry words they had at meeting , he discovered that his mother had suffered the death to which they both are now condemned .
Parsing [sent. 11653 len. 11]: -- The time is very short , Sir John . '
Parsing [sent. 11654 len. 45]: The knight laid down his paper fan , replaced his cup upon the table at his side , and , saving for the smile that lurked about his mouth , looked at the locksmith with as much steadiness as the locksmith looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 11655 len. 11]: ` They have been in prison now , a month .
Parsing [sent. 11656 len. 40]: One conversation led to many more ; and the hangman soon found , from a comparison of time , and place , and dates , that he had executed the sentence of the law upon this woman , himself .
Parsing [sent. 11657 len. 22]: She had been tempted by want -- as so many people are -- into the easy crime of passing forged notes .
Parsing [sent. 11658 len. 47]: She was young and handsome ; and the traders who employ men , women , and children in this traffic , looked upon her as one who was well adapted for their business , and who would probably go on without suspicion for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 11659 len. 23]: But they were mistaken ; for she was stopped in the commission of her very first offence , and died for it .
Parsing [sent. 11660 len. 40]: She was of gipsy blood , Sir John -- ' It might have been the effect of a passing cloud which obscured the sun , and cast a shadow on his face ; but the knight turned deadly pale .
Parsing [sent. 11661 len. 11]: Still he met the locksmith 's eye , as before .
Parsing [sent. 11662 len. 23]: ` She was of gipsy blood , Sir John , ' repeated Gabriel , ` and had a high , free spirit .
Parsing [sent. 11663 len. 31]: This , and her good looks , and her lofty manner , interested some gentlemen who were easily moved by dark eyes ; and efforts were made to save her .
Parsing [sent. 11664 len. 18]: They might have been successful , if she would have given them any clue to her history .
Parsing [sent. 11665 len. 8]: But she never would , or did .
Parsing [sent. 11666 len. 15]: There was reason to suspect that she would make an attempt upon her life .
Parsing [sent. 11667 len. 30]: A watch was set upon her night and day ; and from that time she never spoke again -- ' Sir John stretched out his hand towards his cup .
Parsing [sent. 11668 len. 9]: The locksmith going on , arrested it half-way .
Parsing [sent. 11669 len. 11]: -- ` Until she had but a minute to live .
Parsing [sent. 11670 len. 63]: Then she broke silence , and said , in a low firm voice which no one heard but this executioner , for all other living creatures had retired and left her to her fate , `` If I had a dagger within these fingers and he was within my reach , I would strike him dead before me , even now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11671 len. 7]: The man asked `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11672 len. 12]: She said , `` The father of her boy . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11673 len. 32]: Sir John drew back his outstretched hand , and seeing that the locksmith paused , signed to him with easy politeness and without any new appearance of emotion , to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 11674 len. 25]: ` It was the first word she had ever spoken , from which it could be understood that she had any relative on earth .
Parsing [sent. 11675 len. 7]: `` Was the child alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11676 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 11677 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 11678 len. 19]: He asked her where it was , its name , and whether she had any wish respecting it .
Parsing [sent. 11679 len. 8]: She had but one , she said .
Parsing [sent. 11680 len. 30]: It was that the boy might live and grow , in utter ignorance of his father , so that no arts might teach him to be gentle and forgiving .
Parsing [sent. 11681 len. 30]: When he became a man , she trusted to the God of their tribe to bring the father and the son together , and revenge her through her child .
Parsing [sent. 11682 len. 12]: He asked her other questions , but she spoke no more .
Parsing [sent. 11683 len. 33]: Indeed , he says , she scarcely said this much , to him , but stood with her face turned upwards to the sky , and never looked towards him once . '
Parsing [sent. 11684 len. 106]: Sir John took a pinch of snuff ; glanced approvingly at an elegant little sketch , entitled ` Nature , ' on the wall ; and raising his eyes to the locksmith 's face again , said , with an air of courtesy and patronage , ` You were observing , Mr Varden -- ' ` That she never , ' returned the locksmith , who was not to be diverted by any artifice from his firm manner , and his steady gaze , ` that she never looked towards him once , Sir John ; and so she died , and he forgot her .
Parsing [sent. 11685 len. 90]: But , some years afterwards , a man was sentenced to die the same death , who was a gipsy too ; a sunburnt , swarthy fellow , almost a wild man ; and while he lay in prison , under sentence , he , who had seen the hangman more than once while he was free , cut an image of him on his stick , by way of braving death , and showing those who attended on him , how little he cared or thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 11686 len. 75]: He gave this stick into his hands at Tyburn , and told him then , that the woman I have spoken of had left her own people to join a fine gentleman , and that , being deserted by him , and cast off by her old friends , she had sworn within her own proud breast , that whatever her misery might be , she would ask no help of any human being .
Parsing [sent. 11687 len. 95]: He told him that she had kept her word to the last ; and that , meeting even him in the streets -- he had been fond of her once , it seems -- she had slipped from him by a trick , and he never saw her again , until , being in one of the frequent crowds at Tyburn , with some of his rough companions , he had been driven almost mad by seeing , in the criminal under another name , whose death he had come to witness , herself .
Parsing [sent. 11688 len. 45]: Standing in the same place in which she had stood , he told the hangman this , and told him , too , her real name , which only her own people and the gentleman for whose sake she had left them , knew .
Parsing [sent. 11689 len. 16]: That name he will tell again , Sir John , to none but you . '
Parsing [sent. 11690 len. 7]: ` To none but me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11691 len. 45]: exclaimed the knight , pausing in the act of raising his cup to his lips with a perfectly steady hand , and curling up his little finger for the better display of a brilliant ring with which it was ornamented : ` but me !
Parsing [sent. 11692 len. 17]: -- My dear Mr Varden , how very preposterous , to select me for his confidence !
Parsing [sent. 11693 len. 15]: With you at his elbow , too , who are so perfectly trustworthy ! '
Parsing [sent. 11694 len. 21]: ` Sir John , Sir John , ' returned the locksmith , ` at twelve tomorrow , these men die .
Parsing [sent. 11695 len. 78]: Hear the few words I have to add , and do not hope to deceive me ; for though I am a plain man of humble station , and you are a gentleman of rank and learning , the truth raises me to your level , and I KNOW that you anticipate the disclosure with which I am about to end , and that you believe this doomed man , Hugh , to be your son . '
Parsing [sent. 11696 len. 36]: ` Nay , ' said Sir John , bantering him with a gay air ; ` the wild gentleman , who died so suddenly , scarcely went as far as that , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 11697 len. 86]: ` He did not , ' returned the locksmith , ` for she had bound him by some pledge , known only to these people , and which the worst among them respect , not to tell your name : but , in a fantastic pattern on the stick , he had carved some letters , and when the hangman asked it , he bade him , especially if he should ever meet with her son in after life , remember that place well . '
Parsing [sent. 11698 len. 5]: ` What place ? '
Parsing [sent. 11699 len. 4]: ` Chester . '
Parsing [sent. 11700 len. 23]: The knight finished his cup of chocolate with an appearance of infinite relish , and carefully wiped his lips upon his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 11701 len. 37]: ` Sir John , ' said the locksmith , ` this is all that has been told to me ; but since these two men have been left for death , they have conferred together closely .
Parsing [sent. 11702 len. 10]: See them , and hear what they can add .
Parsing [sent. 11703 len. 16]: See this Dennis , and learn from him what he has not trusted to me .
Parsing [sent. 11704 len. 25]: If you , who hold the clue to all , want corroboration -LRB- which you do not -RRB- , the means are easy . '
Parsing [sent. 11705 len. 54]: ` And to what , ' said Sir John Chester , rising on his elbow , after smoothing the pillow for its reception ; ` my dear , good-natured , estimable Mr Varden -- with whom I can not be angry if I would -- to what does all this tend ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11706 len. 31]: I take you for a man , Sir John , and I suppose it tends to some pleading of natural affection in your breast , ' returned the locksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 11707 len. 41]: I suppose to the straining of every nerve , and the exertion of all the influence you have , or can make , in behalf of your miserable son , and the man who has disclosed his existence to you .
Parsing [sent. 11708 len. 24]: At the worst , I suppose to your seeing your son , and awakening him to a sense of his crime and danger .
Parsing [sent. 11709 len. 7]: He has no such sense now .
Parsing [sent. 11710 len. 45]: Think what his life must have been , when he said in my hearing , that if I moved you to anything , it would be to hastening his death , and ensuring his silence , if you had it in your power ! '
Parsing [sent. 11711 len. 66]: ` And have you , my good Mr Varden , ' said Sir John in a tone of mild reproof , ` have you really lived to your present age , and remained so very simple and credulous , as to approach a gentleman of established character with such credentials as these , from desperate men in their last extremity , catching at any straw ?
Parsing [sent. 11712 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 11713 len. 6]: Oh fie , fie ! '
Parsing [sent. 11714 len. 54]: The locksmith was going to interpose , but he stopped him : ` On any other subject , Mr Varden , I shall be delighted -- I shall be charmed -- to converse with you , but I owe it to my own character not to pursue this topic for another moment . '
Parsing [sent. 11715 len. 26]: ` Think better of it , sir , when I am gone , ' returned the locksmith ; ` think better of it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11716 len. 59]: Although you have , thrice within as many weeks , turned your lawful son , Mr Edward , from your door , you may have time , you may have years to make your peace with HIM , Sir John : but that twelve o'clock will soon be here , and soon be past for ever . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11717 len. 50]: I thank you very much , ' returned the knight , kissing his delicate hand to the locksmith , ` for your guileless advice ; and I only wish , my good soul , although your simplicity is quite captivating , that you had a little more worldly wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 11718 len. 17]: I never so much regretted the arrival of my hairdresser as I do at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 11719 len. 4]: God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 11720 len. 3]: Good morning !
Parsing [sent. 11721 len. 13]: You 'll not forget my message to the ladies , Mr Varden ?
Parsing [sent. 11722 len. 10]: Peak , show Mr Varden to the door . '
Parsing [sent. 11723 len. 17]: Gabriel said no more , but gave the knight a parting look , and left him .
Parsing [sent. 11724 len. 39]: As he quitted the room , Sir John 's face changed ; and the smile gave place to a haggard and anxious expression , like that of a weary actor jaded by the performance of a difficult part .
Parsing [sent. 11725 len. 17]: He rose from his bed with a heavy sigh , and wrapped himself in his morning-gown .
Parsing [sent. 11726 len. 19]: ` So she kept her word , ' he said , ` and was constant to her threat !
Parsing [sent. 11727 len. 26]: I would I had never seen that dark face of hers , -- I might have read these consequences in it , from the first .
Parsing [sent. 11728 len. 39]: This affair would make a noise abroad , if it rested on better evidence ; but , as it is , and by not joining the scattered links of the chain , I can afford to slight it .
Parsing [sent. 11729 len. 13]: -- Extremely distressing to be the parent of such an uncouth creature !
Parsing [sent. 11730 len. 9]: Still , I gave him very good advice .
Parsing [sent. 11731 len. 9]: I told him he would certainly be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 11732 len. 32]: I could have done no more if I had known of our relationship ; and there are a great many fathers who have never done as much for THEIR natural children .
Parsing [sent. 11733 len. 10]: -- The hairdresser may come in , Peak ! '
Parsing [sent. 11734 len. 52]: The hairdresser came in ; and saw in Sir John Chester -LRB- whose accommodating conscience was soon quieted by the numerous precedents that occurred to him in support of his last observation -RRB- , the same imperturbable , fascinating , elegant gentleman he had seen yesterday , and many yesterdays before .
Parsing [sent. 11735 len. 35]: Chapter 76 As the locksmith walked slowly away from Sir John Chester 's chambers , he lingered under the trees which shaded the path , almost hoping that he might be summoned to return .
Parsing [sent. 11736 len. 19]: He had turned back thrice , and still loitered at the corner , when the clock struck twelve .
Parsing [sent. 11737 len. 29]: It was a solemn sound , and not merely for its reference to to-morrow ; for he knew that in that chime the murderer 's knell was rung .
Parsing [sent. 11738 len. 66]: He had seen him pass along the crowded street , amidst the execration of the throng ; and marked his quivering lip , and trembling limbs ; the ashy hue upon his face , his clammy brow , the wild distraction of his eye -- the fear of death that swallowed up all other thoughts , and gnawed without cessation at his heart and brain .
Parsing [sent. 11739 len. 21]: He had marked the wandering look , seeking for hope , and finding , turn where it would , despair .
Parsing [sent. 11740 len. 24]: He had seen the remorseful , pitiful , desolate creature , riding , with his coffin by his side , to the gibbet .
Parsing [sent. 11741 len. 58]: He knew that , to the last , he had been an unyielding , obdurate man ; that in the savage terror of his condition he had hardened , rather than relented , to his wife and child ; and that the last words which had passed his white lips were curses on them as his enemies .
Parsing [sent. 11742 len. 13]: Mr Haredale had determined to be there , and see it done .
Parsing [sent. 11743 len. 26]: Nothing but the evidence of his own senses could satisfy that gloomy thirst for retribution which had been gathering upon him for so many years .
Parsing [sent. 11744 len. 20]: The locksmith knew this , and when the chimes had ceased to vibrate , hurried away to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 11745 len. 21]: ` For these two men , ' he said , as he went , ' I can do no more .
Parsing [sent. 11746 len. 6]: Heaven have mercy on them !
Parsing [sent. 11747 len. 3]: -- Alas !
Parsing [sent. 11748 len. 16]: I say I can do no more for them , but whom can I help ?
Parsing [sent. 11749 len. 33]: Mary Rudge will have a home , and a firm friend when she most wants one ; but Barnaby -- poor Barnaby -- willing Barnaby -- what aid can I render him ?
Parsing [sent. 11750 len. 42]: There are many , many men of sense , God forgive me , ' cried the honest locksmith , stopping in a narrow count to pass his hand across his eyes , ' I could better afford to lose than Barnaby .
Parsing [sent. 11751 len. 23]: We have always been good friends , but I never knew , till now , how much I loved the lad . '
Parsing [sent. 11752 len. 30]: There were not many in the great city who thought of Barnaby that day , otherwise than as an actor in a show which was to take place to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 11753 len. 43]: But if the whole population had had him in their minds , and had wished his life to be spared , not one among them could have done so with a purer zeal or greater singleness of heart than the good locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 11754 len. 5]: Barnaby was to die .
Parsing [sent. 11755 len. 5]: There was no hope .
Parsing [sent. 11756 len. 56]: It is not the least evil attendant upon the frequent exhibition of this last dread punishment , of Death , that it hardens the minds of those who deal it out , and makes them , though they be amiable men in other respects , indifferent to , or unconscious of , their great responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 11757 len. 11]: The word had gone forth that Barnaby was to die .
Parsing [sent. 11758 len. 11]: It went forth , every month , for lighter crimes .
Parsing [sent. 11759 len. 24]: It was a thing so common , that very few were startled by the awful sentence , or cared to question its propriety .
Parsing [sent. 11760 len. 20]: Just then , too , when the law had been so flagrantly outraged , its dignity must be asserted .
Parsing [sent. 11761 len. 27]: The symbol of its dignity , -- stamped upon every page of the criminal statute-book , -- was the gallows ; and Barnaby was to die .
Parsing [sent. 11762 len. 7]: They had tried to save him .
Parsing [sent. 11763 len. 16]: The locksmith had carried petitions and memorials to the fountain-head , with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 11764 len. 15]: But the well was not one of mercy , and Barnaby was to die .
Parsing [sent. 11765 len. 26]: From the first his mother had never left him , save at night ; and with her beside him , he was as usual contented .
Parsing [sent. 11766 len. 60]: On this last day , he was more elated and more proud than he had been yet ; and when she dropped the book she had been reading to him aloud , and fell upon his neck , he stopped in his busy task of folding a piece of crape about his hat , and wondered at her anguish .
Parsing [sent. 11767 len. 32]: Grip uttered a feeble croak , half in encouragement , it seemed , and half in remonstrance , but he wanted heart to sustain it , and lapsed abruptly into silence .
Parsing [sent. 11768 len. 44]: With them who stood upon the brink of the great gulf which none can see beyond , Time , so soon to lose itself in vast Eternity , rolled on like a mighty river , swollen and rapid as it nears the sea .
Parsing [sent. 11769 len. 21]: It was morning but now ; they had sat and talked together in a dream ; and here was evening .
Parsing [sent. 11770 len. 18]: The dreadful hour of separation , which even yesterday had seemed so distant , was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 11771 len. 16]: They walked out into the courtyard , clinging to each other , but not speaking .
Parsing [sent. 11772 len. 32]: Barnaby knew that the jail was a dull , sad , miserable place , and looked forward to to-morrow , as to a passage from it to something bright and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 11773 len. 37]: He had a vague impression too , that he was expected to be brave -- that he was a man of great consequence , and that the prison people would be glad to make him weep .
Parsing [sent. 11774 len. 30]: He trod the ground more firmly as he thought of this , and bade her take heart and cry no more , and feel how steady his hand was .
Parsing [sent. 11775 len. 8]: ` They call me silly , mother .
Parsing [sent. 11776 len. 6]: They shall see to-morrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 11777 len. 8]: Dennis and Hugh were in the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 11778 len. 19]: Hugh came forth from his cell as they did , stretching himself as though he had been sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 11779 len. 30]: Dennis sat upon a bench in a corner , with his knees and chin huddled together , and rocked himself to and fro like a person in severe pain .
Parsing [sent. 11780 len. 20]: The mother and son remained on one side of the court , and these two men upon the other .
Parsing [sent. 11781 len. 32]: Hugh strode up and down , glancing fiercely every now and then at the bright summer sky , and looking round , when he had done so , at the walls .
Parsing [sent. 11782 len. 7]: ` No reprieve , no reprieve !
Parsing [sent. 11783 len. 5]: Nobody comes near us .
Parsing [sent. 11784 len. 9]: There 's only the night left now ! '
Parsing [sent. 11785 len. 10]: moaned Dennis faintly , as he wrung his hands .
Parsing [sent. 11786 len. 14]: ` Do you think they 'll reprieve me in the night , brother ?
Parsing [sent. 11787 len. 12]: I 've known reprieves come in the night , afore now .
Parsing [sent. 11788 len. 19]: I 've known 'em come as late as five , six , and seven o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 11789 len. 16]: Do n't you think there 's a good chance yet , -- do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 11790 len. 4]: Say you do .
Parsing [sent. 11791 len. 28]: Say you do , young man , ' whined the miserable creature , with an imploring gesture towards Barnaby , ` or I shall go mad ! '
Parsing [sent. 11792 len. 13]: ` Better be mad than sane , here , ' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 11793 len. 5]: ` GO mad . '
Parsing [sent. 11794 len. 8]: ` But tell me what you think .
Parsing [sent. 11795 len. 8]: Somebody tell me what he thinks ! '
Parsing [sent. 11796 len. 57]: cried the wretched object , -- so mean , and wretched , and despicable , that even Pity 's self might have turned away , at sight of such a being in the likeness of a man -- ` is n't there a chance for me , -- is n't there a good chance for me ?
Parsing [sent. 11797 len. 13]: Is n't it likely they may be doing this to frighten me ?
Parsing [sent. 11798 len. 7]: Do n't you think it is ?
Parsing [sent. 11799 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 11800 len. 19]: he almost shrieked , as he wrung his hands , ` wo n't anybody give me comfort ! '
Parsing [sent. 11801 len. 21]: ` You ought to be the best , instead of the worst , ' said Hugh , stopping before him .
Parsing [sent. 11802 len. 7]: ` Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 11803 len. 12]: See the hangman , when it comes home to him ! '
Parsing [sent. 11804 len. 23]: ` You do n't know what it is , ' cried Dennis , actually writhing as he spoke : ' I do .
Parsing [sent. 11805 len. 9]: That I should come to be worked off !
Parsing [sent. 11806 len. 2]: I !
Parsing [sent. 11807 len. 2]: I !
Parsing [sent. 11808 len. 6]: That I should come ! '
Parsing [sent. 11809 len. 6]: ` And why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 11810 len. 20]: said Hugh , as he thrust back his matted hair to get a better view of his late associate .
Parsing [sent. 11811 len. 26]: ` How often , before I knew your trade , did I hear you talking of this as if it was a treat ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11812 len. 23]: I a n't unconsistent , ' screamed the miserable creature ; ` I 'd talk so again , if I was hangman .
Parsing [sent. 11813 len. 12]: Some other man has got my old opinions at this minute .
Parsing [sent. 11814 len. 5]: That makes it worse .
Parsing [sent. 11815 len. 8]: Somebody 's longing to work me off .
Parsing [sent. 11816 len. 10]: I know by myself that somebody must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 11817 len. 16]: ` He 'll soon have his longing , ' said Hugh , resuming his walk .
Parsing [sent. 11818 len. 10]: ` Think of that , and be quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 11819 len. 62]: Although one of these men displayed , in his speech and bearing , the most reckless hardihood ; and the other , in his every word and action , testified such an extreme of abject cowardice that it was humiliating to see him ; it would be difficult to say which of them would most have repelled and shocked an observer .
Parsing [sent. 11820 len. 38]: Hugh 's was the dogged desperation of a savage at the stake ; the hangman was reduced to a condition little better , if any , than that of a hound with the halter round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 11821 len. 27]: Yet , as Mr Dennis knew and could have told them , these were the two commonest states of mind in persons brought to their pass .
Parsing [sent. 11822 len. 29]: Such was the wholesome growth of the seed sown by the law , that this kind of harvest was usually looked for , as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 11823 len. 7]: In one respect they all agreed .
Parsing [sent. 11824 len. 147]: The wandering and uncontrollable train of thought , suggesting sudden recollections of things distant and long forgotten and remote from each other -- the vague restless craving for something undefined , which nothing could satisfy -- the swift flight of the minutes , fusing themselves into hours , as if by enchantment -- the rapid coming of the solemn night -- the shadow of death always upon them , and yet so dim and faint , that objects the meanest and most trivial started from the gloom beyond , and forced themselves upon the view -- the impossibility of holding the mind , even if they had been so disposed , to penitence and preparation , or of keeping it to any point while one hideous fascination tempted it away -- these things were common to them all , and varied only in their outward tokens .
Parsing [sent. 11825 len. 24]: ` Fetch me the book I left within -- upon your bed , ' she said to Barnaby , as the clock struck .
Parsing [sent. 11826 len. 6]: ` Kiss me first . '
Parsing [sent. 11827 len. 16]: He looked in her face , and saw there , that the time was come .
Parsing [sent. 11828 len. 27]: After a long embrace , he tore himself away , and ran to bring it to her ; bidding her not stir till he came back .
Parsing [sent. 11829 len. 16]: He soon returned , for a shriek recalled him , -- but she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 11830 len. 10]: He ran to the yard-gate , and looked through .
Parsing [sent. 11831 len. 6]: They were carrying her away .
Parsing [sent. 11832 len. 8]: She had said her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 11833 len. 5]: It was better so .
Parsing [sent. 11834 len. 43]: ` Do n't you think , ' whimpered Dennis , creeping up to him , as he stood with his feet rooted to the ground , gazing at the blank walls -- ` do n't you think there 's still a chance ?
Parsing [sent. 11835 len. 17]: It 's a dreadful end ; it 's a terrible end for a man like me .
Parsing [sent. 11836 len. 9]: Do n't you think there 's a chance ?
Parsing [sent. 11837 len. 12]: I do n't mean for you , I mean for me .
Parsing [sent. 11838 len. 18]: Do n't let HIM hear us -LRB- meaning Hugh -RRB- ; ` he 's so desperate . '
Parsing [sent. 11839 len. 49]: Now then , ' said the officer , who had been lounging in and out with his hands in his pockets , and yawning as if he were in the last extremity for some subject of interest : ` it 's time to turn in , boys . '
Parsing [sent. 11840 len. 12]: ` Not yet , ' cried Dennis , ` not yet .
Parsing [sent. 11841 len. 8]: Not for an hour yet . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11842 len. 19]: I say , -- your watch goes different from what it used to , ' returned the man .
Parsing [sent. 11843 len. 11]: ` Once upon a time it was always too fast .
Parsing [sent. 11844 len. 9]: It 's got the other fault now . '
Parsing [sent. 11845 len. 32]: ` My friend , ' cried the wretched creature , falling on his knees , ` my dear friend -- you always were my dear friend -- there 's some mistake .
Parsing [sent. 11846 len. 16]: Some letter has been mislaid , or some messenger has been stopped upon the way .
Parsing [sent. 11847 len. 6]: He may have fallen dead .
Parsing [sent. 11848 len. 23]: I saw a man once , fall down dead in the street , myself , and he had papers in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 11849 len. 4]: Send to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 11850 len. 6]: Let somebody go to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 11851 len. 6]: They never will hang me .
Parsing [sent. 11852 len. 4]: They never can .
Parsing [sent. 11853 len. 19]: -- Yes , they will , ' he cried , starting to his feet with a terrible scream .
Parsing [sent. 11854 len. 15]: ` They 'll hang me by a trick , and keep the pardon back .
Parsing [sent. 11855 len. 7]: It 's a plot against me .
Parsing [sent. 11856 len. 7]: I shall lose my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 11857 len. 14]: And uttering another yell , he fell in a fit upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 11858 len. 12]: ` See the hangman when it comes home to him ! '
Parsing [sent. 11859 len. 15]: cried Hugh again , as they bore him away -- ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 11860 len. 9]: Courage , bold Barnaby , what care we ?
Parsing [sent. 11861 len. 3]: Your hand !
Parsing [sent. 11862 len. 31]: They do well to put us out of the world , for if we got loose a second time , we would n't let them off so easy , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 11863 len. 3]: Another shake !
Parsing [sent. 11864 len. 7]: A man can die but once .
Parsing [sent. 11865 len. 17]: If you wake in the night , sing that out lustily , and fall asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 11866 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 11867 len. 27]: Barnaby glanced once more through the grate into the empty yard ; and then watched Hugh as he strode to the steps leading to his sleeping-cell .
Parsing [sent. 11868 len. 20]: He heard him shout , and burst into a roar of laughter , and saw him flourish his hat .
Parsing [sent. 11869 len. 38]: Then he turned away himself , like one who walked in his sleep ; and , without any sense of fear or sorrow , lay down on his pallet , listening for the clock to strike again .
Parsing [sent. 11870 len. 7]: Chapter 77 The time wore on .
Parsing [sent. 11871 len. 52]: The noises in the streets became less frequent by degrees , until silence was scarcely broken save by the bells in church towers , marking the progress -- softer and more stealthy while the city slumbered -- of that Great Watcher with the hoary head , who never sleeps or rests .
Parsing [sent. 11872 len. 46]: In the brief interval of darkness and repose which feverish towns enjoy , all busy sounds were hushed ; and those who awoke from dreams lay listening in their beds , and longed for dawn , and wished the dead of the night were past .
Parsing [sent. 11873 len. 42]: Into the street outside the jail 's main wall , workmen came straggling at this solemn hour , in groups of two or three , and meeting in the centre , cast their tools upon the ground and spoke in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 11874 len. 41]: Others soon issued from the jail itself , bearing on their shoulders planks and beams : these materials being all brought forth , the rest bestirred themselves , and the dull sound of hammers began to echo through the stillness .
Parsing [sent. 11875 len. 67]: Here and there among this knot of labourers , one , with a lantern or a smoky link , stood by to light his fellows at their work ; and by its doubtful aid , some might be dimly seen taking up the pavement of the road , while others held great upright posts , or fixed them in the holes thus made for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 11876 len. 30]: Some dragged slowly on , towards the rest , an empty cart , which they brought rumbling from the prison-yard ; while others erected strong barriers across the street .
Parsing [sent. 11877 len. 5]: All were busily engaged .
Parsing [sent. 11878 len. 59]: Their dusky figures moving to and fro , at that unusual hour , so active and so silent , might have been taken for those of shadowy creatures toiling at midnight on some ghostly unsubstantial work , which , like themselves , would vanish with the first gleam of day , and leave but morning mist and vapour .
Parsing [sent. 11879 len. 55]: While it was yet dark , a few lookers-on collected , who had plainly come there for the purpose and intended to remain : even those who had to pass the spot on their way to some other place , lingered , and lingered yet , as though the attraction of that were irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 11880 len. 39]: Meanwhile the noise of saw and mallet went on briskly , mingled with the clattering of boards on the stone pavement of the road , and sometimes with the workmen 's voices as they called to one another .
Parsing [sent. 11881 len. 37]: Whenever the chimes of the neighbouring church were heard -- and that was every quarter of an hour -- a strange sensation , instantaneous and indescribable , but perfectly obvious , seemed to pervade them all .
Parsing [sent. 11882 len. 29]: Gradually , a faint brightness appeared in the east , and the air , which had been very warm all through the night , felt cool and chilly .
Parsing [sent. 11883 len. 18]: Though there was no daylight yet , the darkness was diminished , and the stars looked pale .
Parsing [sent. 11884 len. 47]: The prison , which had been a mere black mass with little shape or form , put on its usual aspect ; and ever and anon a solitary watchman could be seen upon its roof , stopping to look down upon the preparations in the street .
Parsing [sent. 11885 len. 58]: This man , from forming , as it were , a part of the jail , and knowing or being supposed to know all that was passing within , became an object of as much interest , and was as eagerly looked for , and as awfully pointed out , as if he had been a spirit .
Parsing [sent. 11886 len. 29]: By and by , the feeble light grew stronger , and the houses with their signboards and inscriptions , stood plainly out , in the dull grey morning .
Parsing [sent. 11887 len. 30]: Heavy stage waggons crawled from the inn-yard opposite ; and travellers peeped out ; and as they rolled sluggishly away , cast many a backward look towards the jail .
Parsing [sent. 11888 len. 53]: And now , the sun 's first beams came glancing into the street ; and the night 's work , which , in its various stages and in the varied fancies of the lookers-on had taken a hundred shapes , wore its own proper form -- a scaffold , and a gibbet .
Parsing [sent. 11889 len. 63]: As the warmth of the cheerful day began to shed itself upon the scanty crowd , the murmur of tongues was heard , shutters were thrown open , and blinds drawn up , and those who had slept in rooms over against the prison , where places to see the execution were let at high prices , rose hastily from their beds .
Parsing [sent. 11890 len. 44]: In some of the houses , people were busy taking out the window-sashes for the better accommodation of spectators ; in others , the spectators were already seated , and beguiling the time with cards , or drink , or jokes among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 11891 len. 20]: Some had purchased seats upon the house-tops , and were already crawling to their stations from parapet and garret-window .
Parsing [sent. 11892 len. 62]: Some were yet bargaining for good places , and stood in them in a state of indecision : gazing at the slowly-swelling crowd , and at the workmen as they rested listlessly against the scaffold -- affecting to listen with indifference to the proprietor 's eulogy of the commanding view his house afforded , and the surpassing cheapness of his terms .
Parsing [sent. 11893 len. 6]: A fairer morning never shone .
Parsing [sent. 11894 len. 64]: From the roofs and upper stories of these buildings , the spires of city churches and the great cathedral dome were visible , rising up beyond the prison , into the blue sky , and clad in the colour of light summer clouds , and showing in the clear atmosphere their every scrap of tracery and fretwork , and every niche and loophole .
Parsing [sent. 11895 len. 57]: All was brightness and promise , excepting in the street below , into which -LRB- for it yet lay in shadow -RRB- the eye looked down as into a dark trench , where , in the midst of so much life , and hope , and renewal of existence , stood the terrible instrument of death .
Parsing [sent. 11896 len. 13]: It seemed as if the very sun forbore to look upon it .
Parsing [sent. 11897 len. 51]: But it was better , grim and sombre in the shade , than when , the day being more advanced , it stood confessed in the full glare and glory of the sun , with its black paint blistering , and its nooses dangling in the light like loathsome garlands .
Parsing [sent. 11898 len. 35]: It was better in the solitude and gloom of midnight with a few forms clustering about it , than in the freshness and the stir of morning : the centre of an eager crowd .
Parsing [sent. 11899 len. 41]: It was better haunting the street like a spectre , when men were in their beds , and influencing perchance the city 's dreams , than braving the broad day , and thrusting its obscene presence upon their waking senses .
Parsing [sent. 11900 len. 12]: Five o'clock had struck -- six -- seven -- and eight .
Parsing [sent. 11901 len. 29]: Along the two main streets at either end of the cross-way , a living stream had now set in , rolling towards the marts of gain and business .
Parsing [sent. 11902 len. 29]: Carts , coaches , waggons , trucks , and barrows , forced a passage through the outskirts of the throng , and clattered onward in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 11903 len. 65]: Some of these which were public conveyances and had come from a short distance in the country , stopped ; and the driver pointed to the gibbet with his whip , though he might have spared himself the pains , for the heads of all the passengers were turned that way without his help , and the coach-windows were stuck full of staring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11904 len. 51]: In some of the carts and waggons , women might be seen , glancing fearfully at the same unsightly thing ; and even little children were held up above the people 's heads to see what kind of a toy a gallows was , and learn how men were hanged .
Parsing [sent. 11905 len. 27]: Two rioters were to die before the prison , who had been concerned in the attack upon it ; and one directly afterwards in Bloomsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 11906 len. 34]: At nine o'clock , a strong body of military marched into the street , and formed and lined a narrow passage into Holborn , which had been indifferently kept all night by constables .
Parsing [sent. 11907 len. 30]: Through this , another cart was brought -LRB- the one already mentioned had been employed in the construction of the scaffold -RRB- , and wheeled up to the prison-gate .
Parsing [sent. 11908 len. 73]: These preparations made , the soldiers stood at ease ; the officers lounged to and fro , in the alley they had made , or talked together at the scaffold 's foot ; and the concourse , which had been rapidly augmenting for some hours , and still received additions every minute , waited with an impatience which increased with every chime of St Sepulchre 's clock , for twelve at noon .
Parsing [sent. 11909 len. 40]: Up to this time they had been very quiet , comparatively silent , save when the arrival of some new party at a window , hitherto unoccupied , gave them something new to look at or to talk of .
Parsing [sent. 11910 len. 32]: But , as the hour approached , a buzz and hum arose , which , deepening every moment , soon swelled into a roar , and seemed to fill the air .
Parsing [sent. 11911 len. 87]: No words or even voices could be distinguished in this clamour , nor did they speak much to each other ; though such as were better informed upon the topic than the rest , would tell their neighbours , perhaps , that they might know the hangman when he came out , by his being the shorter one : and that the man who was to suffer with him was named Hugh : and that it was Barnaby Rudge who would be hanged in Bloomsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 11912 len. 34]: The hum grew , as the time drew near , so loud , that those who were at the windows could not hear the church-clock strike , though it was close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 11913 len. 22]: Nor had they any need to hear it , either , for they could see it in the people 's faces .
Parsing [sent. 11914 len. 52]: So surely as another quarter chimed , there was a movement in the crowd -- as if something had passed over it -- as if the light upon them had been changed -- in which the fact was readable as on a brazen dial , figured by a giant 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 11915 len. 5]: Three quarters past eleven !
Parsing [sent. 11916 len. 12]: The murmur now was deafening , yet every man seemed mute .
Parsing [sent. 11917 len. 42]: Look where you would among the crowd , you saw strained eyes and lips compressed ; it would have been difficult for the most vigilant observer to point this way or that , and say that yonder man had cried out .
Parsing [sent. 11918 len. 14]: It were as easy to detect the motion of lips in a sea-shell .
Parsing [sent. 11919 len. 5]: Three quarters past eleven !
Parsing [sent. 11920 len. 21]: Many spectators who had retired from the windows , came back refreshed , as though their watch had just begun .
Parsing [sent. 11921 len. 41]: Those who had fallen asleep , roused themselves ; and every person in the crowd made one last effort to better his position -- which caused a press against the sturdy barriers that made them bend and yield like twigs .
Parsing [sent. 11922 len. 23]: The officers , who until now had kept together , fell into their several positions , and gave the words of command .
Parsing [sent. 11923 len. 28]: Swords were drawn , muskets shouldered , and the bright steel winding its way among the crowd , gleamed and glittered in the sun like a river .
Parsing [sent. 11924 len. 26]: Along this shining path , two men came hurrying on , leading a horse , which was speedily harnessed to the cart at the prison-door .
Parsing [sent. 11925 len. 21]: Then , a profound silence replaced the tumult that had so long been gathering , and a breathless pause ensued .
Parsing [sent. 11926 len. 43]: Every window was now choked up with heads ; the house-tops teemed with people -- clinging to chimneys , peering over gable-ends , and holding on where the sudden loosening of any brick or stone would dash them down into the street .
Parsing [sent. 11927 len. 32]: The church tower , the church roof , the church yard , the prison leads , the very water-spouts and lampposts -- every inch of room -- swarmed with human life .
Parsing [sent. 11928 len. 12]: At the first stroke of twelve the prison-bell began to toll .
Parsing [sent. 11929 len. 14]: Then the roar -- mingled now with cries of ` Hats off ! '
Parsing [sent. 11930 len. 6]: and ` Poor fellows ! '
Parsing [sent. 11931 len. 20]: and , from some specks in the great concourse , with a shriek or groan -- burst forth again .
Parsing [sent. 11932 len. 33]: It was terrible to see -- if any one in that distraction of excitement could have seen -- the world of eager eyes , all strained upon the scaffold and the beam .
Parsing [sent. 11933 len. 13]: The hollow murmuring was heard within the jail as plainly as without .
Parsing [sent. 11934 len. 18]: The three were brought forth into the yard , together , as it resounded through the air .
Parsing [sent. 11935 len. 6]: They knew its import well .
Parsing [sent. 11936 len. 6]: 'D ` ye hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11937 len. 8]: cried Hugh , undaunted by the sound .
Parsing [sent. 11938 len. 5]: ` They expect us !
Parsing [sent. 11939 len. 24]: I heard them gathering when I woke in the night , and turned over on t ` other side and fell asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 11940 len. 17]: We shall see how they welcome the hangman , now that it comes home to him .
Parsing [sent. 11941 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 11942 len. 23]: The Ordinary coming up at this moment , reproved him for his indecent mirth , and advised him to alter his demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 11943 len. 7]: ` And why , master ? '
Parsing [sent. 11944 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 11945 len. 10]: ` Can I do better than bear it easily ?
Parsing [sent. 11946 len. 6]: YOU bear it easily enough .
Parsing [sent. 11947 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11948 len. 33]: never tell me , ' he cried , as the other would have spoken , ` for all your sad look and your solemn air , you think little enough of it !
Parsing [sent. 11949 len. 13]: They say you 're the best maker of lobster salads in London .
Parsing [sent. 11950 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 11951 len. 11]: I 've heard that , you see , before now .
Parsing [sent. 11952 len. 14]: Is it a good one , this morning -- is your hand in ?
Parsing [sent. 11953 len. 6]: How does the breakfast look ?
Parsing [sent. 11954 len. 30]: I hope there 's enough , and to spare , for all this hungry company that 'll sit down to it , when the sight 's over . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11955 len. 19]: I fear , ' observed the clergyman , shaking his head , ` that you are incorrigible . '
Parsing [sent. 11956 len. 5]: ` You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 11957 len. 8]: I am , ' rejoined Hugh sternly .
Parsing [sent. 11958 len. 7]: ` Be no hypocrite , master !
Parsing [sent. 11959 len. 17]: You make a merry-making of this , every month ; let me be merry , too .
Parsing [sent. 11960 len. 14]: If you want a frightened fellow there 's one that 'll suit you .
Parsing [sent. 11961 len. 7]: Try your hand upon him . '
Parsing [sent. 11962 len. 42]: He pointed , as he spoke , to Dennis , who , with his legs trailing on the ground , was held between two men ; and who trembled so , that all his joints and limbs seemed racked by spasms .
Parsing [sent. 11963 len. 15]: Turning from this wretched spectacle , he called to Barnaby , who stood apart .
Parsing [sent. 11964 len. 6]: ` What cheer , Barnaby ?
Parsing [sent. 11965 len. 7]: Do n't be downcast , lad .
Parsing [sent. 11966 len. 6]: Leave that to HIM . '
Parsing [sent. 11967 len. 21]: ` Bless you , ' cried Barnaby , stepping lightly towards him , ` I 'm not frightened , Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 11968 len. 5]: I 'm quite happy .
Parsing [sent. 11969 len. 14]: I would n't desire to live now , if they 'd let me .
Parsing [sent. 11970 len. 4]: Look at me !
Parsing [sent. 11971 len. 6]: Am I afraid to die ?
Parsing [sent. 11972 len. 7]: Will they see ME tremble ? '
Parsing [sent. 11973 len. 58]: Hugh gazed for a moment at his face , on which there was a strange , unearthly smile ; and at his eye , which sparkled brightly ; and interposing between him and the Ordinary , gruffly whispered to the latter : ' I would n't say much to him , master , if I was you .
Parsing [sent. 11974 len. 16]: He may spoil your appetite for breakfast , though you ARE used to it . '
Parsing [sent. 11975 len. 17]: He was the only one of the three who had washed or trimmed himself that morning .
Parsing [sent. 11976 len. 14]: Neither of the others had done so , since their doom was pronounced .
Parsing [sent. 11977 len. 26]: He still wore the broken peacock 's feathers in his hat ; and all his usual scraps of finery were carefully disposed about his person .
Parsing [sent. 11978 len. 43]: His kindling eye , his firm step , his proud and resolute bearing , might have graced some lofty act of heroism ; some voluntary sacrifice , born of a noble cause and pure enthusiasm ; rather than that felon 's death .
Parsing [sent. 11979 len. 8]: But all these things increased his guilt .
Parsing [sent. 11980 len. 5]: They were mere assumptions .
Parsing [sent. 11981 len. 13]: The law had declared it so , and so it must be .
Parsing [sent. 11982 len. 22]: The good minister had been greatly shocked , not a quarter of an hour before , at his parting with Grip .
Parsing [sent. 11983 len. 11]: For one in his condition , to fondle a bird !
Parsing [sent. 11984 len. 35]: -- The yard was filled with people ; bluff civic functionaries , officers of justice , soldiers , the curious in such matters , and guests who had been bidden as to a wedding .
Parsing [sent. 11985 len. 42]: Hugh looked about him , nodded gloomily to some person in authority , who indicated with his hand in what direction he was to proceed ; and clapping Barnaby on the shoulder , passed out with the gait of a lion .
Parsing [sent. 11986 len. 62]: They entered a large room , so near to the scaffold that the voices of those who stood about it , could be plainly heard : some beseeching the javelin-men to take them out of the crowd : others crying to those behind , to stand back , for they were pressed to death , and suffocating for want of air .
Parsing [sent. 11987 len. 18]: In the middle of this chamber , two smiths , with hammers , stood beside an anvil .
Parsing [sent. 11988 len. 27]: Hugh walked straight up to them , and set his foot upon it with a sound as though it had been struck by a heavy weapon .
Parsing [sent. 11989 len. 33]: Then , with folded arms , he stood to have his irons knocked off : scowling haughtily round , as those who were present eyed him narrowly and whispered to each other .
Parsing [sent. 11990 len. 28]: It took so much time to drag Dennis in , that this ceremony was over with Hugh , and nearly over with Barnaby , before he appeared .
Parsing [sent. 11991 len. 41]: He no sooner came into the place he knew so well , however , and among faces with which he was so familiar , than he recovered strength and sense enough to clasp his hands and make a last appeal .
Parsing [sent. 11992 len. 79]: ` Gentlemen , good gentlemen , ' cried the abject creature , grovelling down upon his knees , and actually prostrating himself upon the stone floor : ` Governor , dear governor -- honourable sheriffs -- worthy gentlemen -- have mercy upon a wretched man that has served His Majesty , and the Law , and Parliament , for so many years , and do n't -- do n't let me die -- because of a mistake . '
Parsing [sent. 11993 len. 28]: ` Dennis , ' said the governor of the jail , ` you know what the course is , and that the order came with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 11994 len. 14]: You know that we could do nothing , even if we would . '
Parsing [sent. 11995 len. 34]: ` All I ask , sir , -- all I want and beg , is time , to make it sure , ' cried the trembling wretch , looking wildly round for sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 11996 len. 34]: ` The King and Government ca n't know it 's me ; I 'm sure they ca n't know it 's me ; or they never would bring me to this dreadful slaughterhouse .
Parsing [sent. 11997 len. 16]: They know my name , but they do n't know it 's the same man .
Parsing [sent. 11998 len. 30]: Stop my execution -- for charity 's sake stop my execution , gentlemen -- till they can be told that I 've been hangman here , nigh thirty year .
Parsing [sent. 11999 len. 9]: Will no one go and tell them ? '
Parsing [sent. 12000 len. 28]: he implored , clenching his hands and glaring round , and round , and round again -- ` will no charitable person go and tell them ! '
Parsing [sent. 12001 len. 63]: ` Mr Akerman , ' said a gentleman who stood by , after a moment 's pause , ` since it may possibly produce in this unhappy man a better frame of mind , even at this last minute , let me assure him that he was well known to have been the hangman , when his sentence was considered . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12002 len. 55]: -- But perhaps they think on that account that the punishment 's not so great , ' cried the criminal , shuffling towards this speaker on his knees , and holding up his folded hands ; ` whereas it 's worse , it 's worse a hundred times , to me than any man .
Parsing [sent. 12003 len. 7]: Let them know that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12004 len. 5]: Let them know that .
Parsing [sent. 12005 len. 15]: They 've made it worse to me by giving me so much to do .
Parsing [sent. 12006 len. 9]: Stop my execution till they know that ! '
Parsing [sent. 12007 len. 20]: The governor beckoned with his hand , and the two men , who had supported him before , approached .
Parsing [sent. 12008 len. 9]: He uttered a piercing cry : ` Wait !
Parsing [sent. 12009 len. 2]: Wait .
Parsing [sent. 12010 len. 9]: Only a moment -- only one moment more !
Parsing [sent. 12011 len. 8]: Give me a last chance of reprieve .
Parsing [sent. 12012 len. 11]: One of us three is to go to Bloomsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 12013 len. 6]: Let me be the one .
Parsing [sent. 12014 len. 13]: It may come in that time ; it 's sure to come .
Parsing [sent. 12015 len. 13]: In the Lord 's name let me be sent to Bloomsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 12016 len. 6]: Do n't hang me here .
Parsing [sent. 12017 len. 5]: It 's murder . '
Parsing [sent. 12018 len. 112]: They took him to the anvil : but even then he could he heard above the clinking of the smiths ' hammers , and the hoarse raging of the crowd , crying that he knew of Hugh 's birth -- that his father was living , and was a gentleman of influence and rank -- that he had family secrets in his possession -- that he could tell nothing unless they gave him time , but must die with them on his mind ; and he continued to rave in this sort until his voice failed him , and he sank down a mere heap of clothes between the two attendants .
Parsing [sent. 12019 len. 22]: It was at this moment that the clock struck the first stroke of twelve , and the bell began to toll .
Parsing [sent. 12020 len. 17]: The various officers , with the two sheriffs at their head , moved towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 12021 len. 12]: All was ready when the last chime came upon the ear .
Parsing [sent. 12022 len. 14]: They told Hugh this , and asked if he had anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 12023 len. 5]: ` To say ! '
Parsing [sent. 12024 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 12025 len. 7]: ` Not I. I 'm ready .
Parsing [sent. 12026 len. 24]: -- Yes , ' he added , as his eye fell upon Barnaby , ' I have a word to say , too .
Parsing [sent. 12027 len. 6]: Come hither , lad . '
Parsing [sent. 12028 len. 30]: There was , for the moment , something kind , and even tender , struggling in his fierce aspect , as he wrung his poor companion by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 12029 len. 66]: ` I 'll say this , ' he cried , looking firmly round , ` that if I had ten lives to lose , and the loss of each would give me ten times the agony of the hardest death , I 'd lay them all down -- ay , I would , though you gentlemen may not believe it -- to save this one .
Parsing [sent. 12030 len. 21]: This one , ' he added , wringing his hand again , ` that will be lost through me . '
Parsing [sent. 12031 len. 12]: ` Not through you , ' said the idiot , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 12032 len. 6]: ` Do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 12033 len. 6]: You were not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 12034 len. 9]: You have always been very good to me .
Parsing [sent. 12035 len. 16]: -- Hugh , we shall know what makes the stars shine , NOW ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12036 len. 40]: I took him from her in a reckless mood , and did n't think what harm would come of it , ' said Hugh , laying his hand upon his head , and speaking in a lower voice . '
Parsing [sent. 12037 len. 8]: I ask her pardon ; and his .
Parsing [sent. 12038 len. 14]: -- Look here , ' he added roughly , in his former tone .
Parsing [sent. 12039 len. 7]: ` You see this lad ? '
Parsing [sent. 12040 len. 14]: They murmured ` Yes , ' and seemed to wonder why he asked .
Parsing [sent. 12041 len. 29]: ` That gentleman yonder -- ' pointing to the clergyman -- ` has often in the last few days spoken to me of faith , and strong belief .
Parsing [sent. 12042 len. 48]: You see what I am -- more brute than man , as I have been often told -- but I had faith enough to believe , and did believe as strongly as any of you gentlemen can believe anything , that this one life would be spared .
Parsing [sent. 12043 len. 5]: See what he is !
Parsing [sent. 12044 len. 6]: -- Look at him ! '
Parsing [sent. 12045 len. 14]: Barnaby had moved towards the door , and stood beckoning him to follow .
Parsing [sent. 12046 len. 12]: ` If this was not faith , and strong belief ! '
Parsing [sent. 12047 len. 32]: cried Hugh , raising his right arm aloft , and looking upward like a savage prophet whom the near approach of Death had filled with inspiration , ` where are they !
Parsing [sent. 12048 len. 36]: What else should teach me -- me , born as I was born , and reared as I have been reared -- to hope for any mercy in this hardened , cruel , unrelenting place !
Parsing [sent. 12049 len. 24]: Upon these human shambles , I , who never raised this hand in prayer till now , call down the wrath of God !
Parsing [sent. 12050 len. 32]: On that black tree , of which I am the ripened fruit , I do invoke the curse of all its victims , past , and present , and to come .
Parsing [sent. 12051 len. 53]: On the head of that man , who , in his conscience , owns me for his son , I leave the wish that he may never sicken on his bed of down , but die a violent death as I do now , and have the night-wind for his only mourner .
Parsing [sent. 12052 len. 10]: To this I say , Amen , amen ! '
Parsing [sent. 12053 len. 27]: His arm fell downward by his side ; he turned ; and moved towards them with a steady step , the man he had been before .
Parsing [sent. 12054 len. 7]: ` There is nothing more ? '
Parsing [sent. 12055 len. 4]: said the governor .
Parsing [sent. 12056 len. 29]: Hugh motioned Barnaby not to come near him -LRB- though without looking in the direction where he stood -RRB- and answered , ` There is nothing more . '
Parsing [sent. 12057 len. 6]: ` Move forward ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12058 len. 36]: -- Unless , ' said Hugh , glancing hurriedly back , -- ` unless any person here has a fancy for a dog ; and not then , unless he means to use him well .
Parsing [sent. 12059 len. 26]: There 's one , belongs to me , at the house I came from , and it would n't be easy to find a better .
Parsing [sent. 12060 len. 14]: He 'll whine at first , but he 'll soon get over that .
Parsing [sent. 12061 len. 21]: -- You wonder that I think about a dog just now , he added , with a kind of laugh .
Parsing [sent. 12062 len. 19]: ` If any man deserved it of me half as well , I 'd think of HIM . '
Parsing [sent. 12063 len. 40]: He spoke no more , but moved onward in his place , with a careless air , though listening at the same time to the Service for the Dead , with something between sullen attention , and quickened curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 12064 len. 23]: As soon as he had passed the door , his miserable associate was carried out ; and the crowd beheld the rest .
Parsing [sent. 12065 len. 36]: Barnaby would have mounted the steps at the same time -- indeed he would have gone before them , but in both attempts he was restrained , as he was to undergo the sentence elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 12066 len. 35]: In a few minutes the sheriffs reappeared , the same procession was again formed , and they passed through various rooms and passages to another door -- that at which the cart was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 12067 len. 40]: He held down his head to avoid seeing what he knew his eyes must otherwise encounter , and took his seat sorrowfully , -- and yet with something of a childish pride and pleasure , -- in the vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 12068 len. 49]: The officers fell into their places at the sides , in front and in the rear ; the sheriffs ' carriages rolled on ; a guard of soldiers surrounded the whole ; and they moved slowly forward through the throng and pressure toward Lord Mansfield 's ruined house .
Parsing [sent. 12069 len. 78]: It was a sad sight -- all the show , and strength , and glitter , assembled round one helpless creature -- and sadder yet to note , as he rode along , how his wandering thoughts found strange encouragement in the crowded windows and the concourse in the streets ; and how , even then , he felt the influence of the bright sky , and looked up , smiling , into its deep unfathomable blue .
Parsing [sent. 12070 len. 75]: But there had been many such sights since the riots were over -- some so moving in their nature , and so repulsive too , that they were far more calculated to awaken pity for the sufferers , than respect for that law whose strong arm seemed in more than one case to be as wantonly stretched forth now that all was safe , as it had been basely paralysed in time of danger .
Parsing [sent. 12071 len. 36]: Two cripples -- both mere boys -- one with a leg of wood , one who dragged his twisted limbs along by the help of a crutch , were hanged in this same Bloomsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 12072 len. 45]: As the cart was about to glide from under them , it was observed that they stood with their faces from , not to , the house they had assisted to despoil ; and their misery was protracted that this omission might be remedied .
Parsing [sent. 12073 len. 18]: Another boy was hanged in Bow Street ; other young lads in various quarters of the town .
Parsing [sent. 12074 len. 11]: Four wretched women , too , were put to death .
Parsing [sent. 12075 len. 27]: In a word , those who suffered as rioters were , for the most part , the weakest , meanest , and most miserable among them .
Parsing [sent. 12076 len. 40]: It was a most exquisite satire upon the false religious cry which had led to so much misery , that some of these people owned themselves to be Catholics , and begged to be attended by their own priests .
Parsing [sent. 12077 len. 43]: One young man was hanged in Bishopsgate Street , whose aged grey-headed father waited for him at the gallows , kissed him at its foot when he arrived , and sat there , on the ground , till they took him down .
Parsing [sent. 12078 len. 56]: They would have given him the body of his child ; but he had no hearse , no coffin , nothing to remove it in , being too poor -- and walked meekly away beside the cart that took it back to prison , trying , as he went , to touch its lifeless hand .
Parsing [sent. 12079 len. 63]: But the crowd had forgotten these matters , or cared little about them if they lived in their memory : and while one great multitude fought and hustled to get near the gibbet before Newgate , for a parting look , another followed in the train of poor lost Barnaby , to swell the throng that waited for him on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 12080 len. 29]: Chapter 78 On this same day , and about this very hour , Mr Willet the elder sat smoking his pipe in a chamber at the Black Lion .
Parsing [sent. 12081 len. 15]: Although it was hot summer weather , Mr Willet sat close to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 12082 len. 64]: He was in a state of profound cogitation , with his own thoughts , and it was his custom at such times to stew himself slowly , under the impression that that process of cookery was favourable to the melting out of his ideas , which , when he began to simmer , sometimes oozed forth so copiously as to astonish even himself .
Parsing [sent. 12083 len. 41]: Mr Willet had been several thousand times comforted by his friends and acquaintance , with the assurance that for the loss he had sustained in the damage done to the Maypole , he could ` come upon the county . '
Parsing [sent. 12084 len. 47]: But as this phrase happened to bear an unfortunate resemblance to the popular expression of ` coming on the parish , ' it suggested to Mr Willet 's mind no more consolatory visions than pauperism on an extensive scale , and ruin in a capacious aspect .
Parsing [sent. 12085 len. 49]: Consequently , he had never failed to receive the intelligence with a rueful shake of the head , or a dreary stare , and had been always observed to appear much more melancholy after a visit of condolence than at any other time in the whole four-and-twenty hours .
Parsing [sent. 12086 len. 128]: It chanced , however , that sitting over the fire on this particular occasion -- perhaps because he was , as it were , done to a turn ; perhaps because he was in an unusually bright state of mind ; perhaps because he had considered the subject so long ; perhaps because of all these favouring circumstances , taken together -- it chanced that , sitting over the fire on this particular occasion , Mr Willet did , afar off and in the remotest depths of his intellect , perceive a kind of lurking hint or faint suggestion , that out of the public purse there might issue funds for the restoration of the Maypole to its former high place among the taverns of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 12087 len. 105]: And this dim ray of light did so diffuse itself within him , and did so kindle up and shine , that at last he had it as plainly and visibly before him as the blaze by which he sat ; and , fully persuaded that he was the first to make the discovery , and that he had started , hunted down , fallen upon , and knocked on the head , a perfectly original idea which had never presented itself to any other man , alive or dead , he laid down his pipe , rubbed his hands , and chuckled audibly .
Parsing [sent. 12088 len. 6]: ` Why , father ! '
Parsing [sent. 12089 len. 16]: cried Joe , entering at the moment , ` you 're in spirits to-day ! '
Parsing [sent. 12090 len. 14]: ` It 's nothing partickler , ' said Mr Willet , chuckling again .
Parsing [sent. 12091 len. 10]: ` It 's nothing at all partickler , Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 12092 len. 8]: Tell me something about the Salwanners . '
Parsing [sent. 12093 len. 29]: Having preferred this request , Mr Willet chuckled a third time , and after these unusual demonstrations of levity , he put his pipe in his mouth again .
Parsing [sent. 12094 len. 10]: ` What shall I tell you , father ? '
Parsing [sent. 12095 len. 19]: asked Joe , laying his hand upon his sire 's shoulder , and looking down into his face .
Parsing [sent. 12096 len. 13]: ` That I have come back , poorer than a church mouse ?
Parsing [sent. 12097 len. 4]: You know that .
Parsing [sent. 12098 len. 10]: That I have come back , maimed and crippled ?
Parsing [sent. 12099 len. 5]: You know that . '
Parsing [sent. 12100 len. 35]: ` It was took off , ' muttered Mr Willet , with his eyes upon the fire , ` at the defence of the Salwanners , in America , where the war is . '
Parsing [sent. 12101 len. 37]: ` Quite right , ' returned Joe , smiling , and leaning with his remaining elbow on the back of his father 's chair ; ` the very subject I came to speak to you about .
Parsing [sent. 12102 len. 19]: A man with one arm , father , is not of much use in the busy world . '
Parsing [sent. 12103 len. 25]: This was one of those vast propositions which Mr Willet had never considered for an instant , and required time to ` tackle . '
Parsing [sent. 12104 len. 6]: Wherefore he made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 12105 len. 28]: ` At all events , ' said Joe , ` he ca n't pick and choose his means of earning a livelihood , as another man may .
Parsing [sent. 12106 len. 42]: He ca n't say `` I will turn my hand to this , '' or `` I wo n't turn my hand to that , '' but must take what he can do , and be thankful it 's no worse .
Parsing [sent. 12107 len. 7]: -- What did you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 12108 len. 38]: Mr Willet had been softly repeating to himself , in a musing tone , the words ` defence of the Salwanners : ' but he seemed embarrassed at having been overheard , and answered ` Nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 12109 len. 7]: ` Now look here , father .
Parsing [sent. 12110 len. 12]: -- Mr Edward has come to England from the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 12111 len. 84]: When he was lost sight of -LRB- I ran away on the same day , father -RRB- , he made a voyage to one of the islands , where a school-friend of his had settled ; and , finding him , was n't too proud to be employed on his estate , and -- and in short , got on well , and is prospering , and has come over here on business of his own , and is going back again speedily .
Parsing [sent. 12112 len. 60]: Our returning nearly at the same time , and meeting in the course of the late troubles , has been a good thing every way ; for it has not only enabled us to do old friends some service , but has opened a path in life for me which I may tread without being a burden upon you .
Parsing [sent. 12113 len. 46]: To be plain , father , he can employ me ; I have satisfied myself that I can be of real use to him ; and I am going to carry my one arm away with him , and to make the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 12114 len. 44]: In the mind 's eye of Mr Willet , the West Indies , and indeed all foreign countries , were inhabited by savage nations , who were perpetually burying pipes of peace , flourishing tomahawks , and puncturing strange patterns in their bodies .
Parsing [sent. 12115 len. 54]: He no sooner heard this announcement , therefore , than he leaned back in his chair , took his pipe from his lips , and stared at his son with as much dismay as if he already beheld him tied to a stake , and tortured for the entertainment of a lively population .
Parsing [sent. 12116 len. 19]: In what form of expression his feelings would have found a vent , it is impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 12117 len. 46]: Nor is it necessary : for , before a syllable occurred to him , Dolly Varden came running into the room , in tears , threw herself on Joe 's breast without a word of explanation , and clasped her white arms round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 12118 len. 4]: ` Dolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 12119 len. 3]: cried Joe .
Parsing [sent. 12120 len. 4]: ` Dolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 12121 len. 52]: ` Ay , call me that ; call me that always , ' exclaimed the locksmith 's little daughter ; ` never speak coldly to me , never be distant , never again reprove me for the follies I have long repented , or I shall die , Joe . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12122 len. 5]: I reprove you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12123 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 12124 len. 17]: ` Yes -- for every kind and honest word you uttered , went to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 12125 len. 46]: For you , who have borne so much from me -- for you , who owe your sufferings and pain to my caprice -- for you to be so kind -- so noble to me , Joe -- ' He could say nothing to her .
Parsing [sent. 12126 len. 4]: Not a syllable .
Parsing [sent. 12127 len. 25]: There was an odd sort of eloquence in his one arm , which had crept round her waist : but his lips were mute .
Parsing [sent. 12128 len. 61]: ` If you had reminded me by a word -- only by one short word , ' sobbed Dolly , clinging yet closer to him , ` how little I deserved that you should treat me with so much forbearance ; if you had exulted only for one moment in your triumph , I could have borne it better . '
Parsing [sent. 12129 len. 4]: ` Triumph ! '
Parsing [sent. 12130 len. 21]: repeated Joe , with a smile which seemed to say , ' I am a pretty figure for that . '
Parsing [sent. 12131 len. 30]: ` Yes , triumph , ' she cried , with her whole heart and soul in her earnest voice , and gushing tears ; ` for it is one .
Parsing [sent. 12132 len. 10]: I am glad to think and know it is .
Parsing [sent. 12133 len. 45]: I would n't be less humbled , dear -- I would n't be without the recollection of that last time we spoke together in this place -- no , not if I could recall the past , and make our parting , yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 12134 len. 9]: Did ever lover look as Joe looked now !
Parsing [sent. 12135 len. 30]: ` Dear Joe , ' said Dolly , ' I always loved you -- in my own heart I always did , although I was so vain and giddy .
Parsing [sent. 12136 len. 9]: I hoped you would come back that night .
Parsing [sent. 12137 len. 7]: I made quite sure you would .
Parsing [sent. 12138 len. 8]: I prayed for it on my knees .
Parsing [sent. 12139 len. 27]: Through all these long , long years , I have never once forgotten you , or left off hoping that this happy time might come . '
Parsing [sent. 12140 len. 27]: The eloquence of Joe 's arm surpassed the most impassioned language ; and so did that of his lips -- yet he said nothing , either .
Parsing [sent. 12141 len. 93]: ` And now , at last , ' cried Dolly , trembling with the fervour of her speech , ` if you were sick , and shattered in your every limb ; if you were ailing , weak , and sorrowful ; if , instead of being what you are , you were in everybody 's eyes but mine the wreck and ruin of a man ; I would be your wife , dear love , with greater pride and joy , than if you were the stateliest lord in England ! '
Parsing [sent. 12142 len. 22]: ` What have I done , ' cried Joe , ` what have I done to meet with this reward ? '
Parsing [sent. 12143 len. 45]: ` You have taught me , ' said Dolly , raising her pretty face to his , ` to know myself , and your worth ; to be something better than I was ; to be more deserving of your true and manly nature .
Parsing [sent. 12144 len. 52]: In years to come , dear Joe , you shall find that you have done so ; for I will be , not only now , when we are young and full of hope , but when we have grown old and weary , your patient , gentle , never-tiring wife .
Parsing [sent. 12145 len. 33]: I will never know a wish or care beyond our home and you , and I will always study how to please you with my best affection and my most devoted love .
Parsing [sent. 12146 len. 8]: I will : indeed I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 12147 len. 17]: Joe could only repeat his former eloquence -- but it was very much to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12148 len. 13]: ` They know of this , at home , ' said Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 12149 len. 38]: ` For your sake , I would leave even them ; but they know it , and are glad of it , and are as proud of you as I am , and as full of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 12150 len. 28]: -- You 'll not come and see me as a poor friend who knew me when I was a girl , will you , dear Joe ? '
Parsing [sent. 12151 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 12152 len. 87]: It do n't matter what Joe said in answer , but he said a great deal ; and Dolly said a great deal too : and he folded Dolly in his one arm pretty tight , considering that it was but one ; and Dolly made no resistance : and if ever two people were happy in this world -- which is not an utterly miserable one , with all its faults -- we may , with some appearance of certainty , conclude that they were .
Parsing [sent. 12153 len. 68]: To say that during these proceedings Mr Willet the elder underwent the greatest emotions of astonishment of which our common nature is susceptible -- to say that he was in a perfect paralysis of surprise , and that he wandered into the most stupendous and theretofore unattainable heights of complicated amazement -- would be to shadow forth his state of mind in the feeblest and lamest terms .
Parsing [sent. 12154 len. 61]: If a roc , an eagle , a griffin , a flying elephant , a winged sea-horse , had suddenly appeared , and , taking him on its back , carried him bodily into the heart of the ` Salwanners , ' it would have been to him as an everyday occurrence , in comparison with what he now beheld .
Parsing [sent. 12155 len. 107]: To be sitting quietly by , seeing and hearing these things ; to be completely overlooked , unnoticed , and disregarded , while his son and a young lady were talking to each other in the most impassioned manner , kissing each other , and making themselves in all respects perfectly at home ; was a position so tremendous , so inexplicable , so utterly beyond the widest range of his capacity of comprehension , that he fell into a lethargy of wonder , and could no more rouse himself than an enchanted sleeper in the first year of his fairy lease , a century long .
Parsing [sent. 12156 len. 10]: ` Father , ' said Joe , presenting Dolly .
Parsing [sent. 12157 len. 8]: ` You know who this is ? '
Parsing [sent. 12158 len. 39]: Mr Willet looked first at her , then at his son , then back again at Dolly , and then made an ineffectual effort to extract a whiff from his pipe , which had gone out long ago .
Parsing [sent. 12159 len. 21]: ` Say a word , father , if it 's only `` how d'ye do , '' ' urged Joe .
Parsing [sent. 12160 len. 10]: ` Certainly , Joseph , ' answered Mr Willet .
Parsing [sent. 12161 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 12162 len. 4]: Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12163 len. 9]: ` To be sure , ' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 12164 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12165 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 12166 len. 4]: replied his father .
Parsing [sent. 12167 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12168 len. 57]: and with this remark , which he uttered in a low voice as though he were discussing some grave question with himself , he used the little finger -- if any of his fingers can be said to have come under that denomination -- of his right hand as a tobacco-stopper , and was silent again .
Parsing [sent. 12169 len. 35]: And so he sat for half an hour at least , although Dolly , in the most endearing of manners , hoped , a dozen times , that he was not angry with her .
Parsing [sent. 12170 len. 28]: So he sat for half an hour , quite motionless , and looking all the while like nothing so much as a great Dutch Pin or Skittle .
Parsing [sent. 12171 len. 44]: At the expiration of that period , he suddenly , and without the least notice , burst -LRB- to the great consternation of the young people -RRB- into a very loud and very short laugh ; and repeating , ` Certainly , Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 12172 len. 3]: Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 12173 len. 4]: Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12174 len. 6]: went out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 12175 len. 54]: Chapter 79 Old John did not walk near the Golden Key , for between the Golden Key and the Black Lion there lay a wilderness of streets -- as everybody knows who is acquainted with the relative bearings of Clerkenwell and Whitechapel -- and he was by no means famous for pedestrian exercises .
Parsing [sent. 12176 len. 25]: But the Golden Key lies in our way , though it was out of his ; so to the Golden Key this chapter goes .
Parsing [sent. 12177 len. 27]: The Golden Key itself , fair emblem of the locksmith 's trade , had been pulled down by the rioters , and roughly trampled under foot .
Parsing [sent. 12178 len. 31]: But , now , it was hoisted up again in all the glory of a new coat of paint , and shewed more bravely even than in days of yore .
Parsing [sent. 12179 len. 60]: Indeed the whole house-front was spruce and trim , and so freshened up throughout , that if there yet remained at large any of the rioters who had been concerned in the attack upon it , the sight of the old , goodly , prosperous dwelling , so revived , must have been to them as gall and wormwood .
Parsing [sent. 12180 len. 66]: The shutters of the shop were closed , however , and the window-blinds above were all pulled down , and in place of its usual cheerful appearance , the house had a look of sadness and an air of mourning ; which the neighbours , who in old days had often seen poor Barnaby go in and out , were at no loss to understand .
Parsing [sent. 12181 len. 32]: The door stood partly open ; but the locksmith 's hammer was unheard ; the cat sat moping on the ashy forge ; all was deserted , dark , and silent .
Parsing [sent. 12182 len. 14]: On the threshold of this door , Mr Haredale and Edward Chester met .
Parsing [sent. 12183 len. 40]: The younger man gave place ; and both passing in with a familiar air , which seemed to denote that they were tarrying there , or were well-accustomed to go to and fro unquestioned , shut it behind them .
Parsing [sent. 12184 len. 48]: Entering the old back-parlour , and ascending the flight of stairs , abrupt and steep , and quaintly fashioned as of old , they turned into the best room ; the pride of Mrs Varden 's heart , and erst the scene of Miggs 's household labours .
Parsing [sent. 12185 len. 14]: ` Varden brought the mother here last evening , he told me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12186 len. 4]: said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 12187 len. 16]: ` She is above-stairs now -- in the room over here , ' Edward rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 12188 len. 12]: ` Her grief , they say , is past all telling .
Parsing [sent. 12189 len. 31]: I need n't add -- for that you know beforehand , sir -- that the care , humanity , and sympathy of these good people have no bounds . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12190 len. 6]: I am sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 12191 len. 11]: Heaven repay them for it , and for much more !
Parsing [sent. 12192 len. 5]: Varden is out ? '
Parsing [sent. 12193 len. 19]: ` He returned with your messenger , who arrived almost at the moment of his coming home himself .
Parsing [sent. 12194 len. 14]: He was out the whole night -- but that of course you know .
Parsing [sent. 12195 len. 11]: He was with you the greater part of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12196 len. 4]: ` He was .
Parsing [sent. 12197 len. 11]: Without him , I should have lacked my right hand .
Parsing [sent. 12198 len. 15]: He is an older man than I ; but nothing can conquer him . '
Parsing [sent. 12199 len. 11]: ` The cheeriest , stoutest-hearted fellow in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 12200 len. 8]: ` He has a right to be .
Parsing [sent. 12201 len. 7]: He has a right to he .
Parsing [sent. 12202 len. 6]: A better creature never lived .
Parsing [sent. 12203 len. 11]: He reaps what he has sown -- no more . '
Parsing [sent. 12204 len. 27]: ` It is not all men , ' said Edward , after a moment 's hesitation , ` who have the happiness to do that . '
Parsing [sent. 12205 len. 11]: ` More than you imagine , ' returned Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 12206 len. 10]: ` We note the harvest more than the seed-time .
Parsing [sent. 12207 len. 7]: You do so in me . '
Parsing [sent. 12208 len. 34]: In truth his pale and haggard face , and gloomy bearing , had so far influenced the remark , that Edward was , for the moment , at a loss to answer him .
Parsing [sent. 12209 len. 22]: ` Tut , tut , ' said Mr Haredale , '' twas not very difficult to read a thought so natural .
Parsing [sent. 12210 len. 6]: But you are mistaken nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 12211 len. 23]: I have had my share of sorrows -- more than the common lot , perhaps , but I have borne them ill .
Parsing [sent. 12212 len. 28]: I have broken where I should have bent ; and have mused and brooded , when my spirit should have mixed with all God 's great creation .
Parsing [sent. 12213 len. 16]: The men who learn endurance , are they who call the whole world , brother .
Parsing [sent. 12214 len. 14]: I have turned FROM the world , and I pay the penalty . '
Parsing [sent. 12215 len. 14]: Edward would have interposed , but he went on without giving him time .
Parsing [sent. 12216 len. 10]: ` It is too late to evade it now .
Parsing [sent. 12217 len. 47]: I sometimes think , that if I had to live my life once more , I might amend this fault -- not so much , I discover when I search my mind , for the love of what is right , as for my own sake .
Parsing [sent. 12218 len. 60]: But even when I make these better resolutions , I instinctively recoil from the idea of suffering again what I have undergone ; and in this circumstance I find the unwelcome assurance that I should still be the same man , though I could cancel the past , and begin anew , with its experience to guide me . '
Parsing [sent. 12219 len. 14]: ` Nay , you make too sure of that , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 12220 len. 18]: ` You think so , ' Mr Haredale answered , ` and I am glad you do .
Parsing [sent. 12221 len. 11]: I know myself better , and therefore distrust myself more .
Parsing [sent. 12222 len. 26]: Let us leave this subject for another -- not so far removed from it as it might , at first sight , seem to be .
Parsing [sent. 12223 len. 18]: Sir , you still love my niece , and she is still attached to you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12224 len. 39]: I have that assurance from her own lips , ' said Edward , ` and you know -- I am sure you know -- that I would not exchange it for any blessing life could yield me . '
Parsing [sent. 12225 len. 37]: ` You are frank , honourable , and disinterested , ' said Mr Haredale ; ` you have forced the conviction that you are so , even on my once-jaundiced mind , and I believe you .
Parsing [sent. 12226 len. 8]: Wait here till I come back . '
Parsing [sent. 12227 len. 15]: He left the room as he spoke ; but soon returned with his niece .
Parsing [sent. 12228 len. 47]: ` On that first and only time , ' he said , looking from the one to the other , ` when we three stood together under her father 's roof , I told you to quit it , and charged you never to return . '
Parsing [sent. 12229 len. 23]: ` It is the only circumstance arising out of our love , ' observed Edward , ` that I have forgotten . '
Parsing [sent. 12230 len. 19]: ` You own a name , ' said Mr Haredale , ' I had deep reason to remember .
Parsing [sent. 12231 len. 89]: I was moved and goaded by recollections of personal wrong and injury , I know , but , even now I can not charge myself with having , then , or ever , lost sight of a heartfelt desire for her true happiness ; or with having acted -- however much I was mistaken -- with any other impulse than the one pure , single , earnest wish to be to her , as far as in my inferior nature lay , the father she had lost . '
Parsing [sent. 12232 len. 17]: ` Dear uncle , ' cried Emma , ' I have known no parent but you .
Parsing [sent. 12233 len. 17]: I have loved the memory of others , but I have loved you all my life .
Parsing [sent. 12234 len. 29]: Never was father kinder to his child than you have been to me , without the interval of one harsh hour , since I can first remember . '
Parsing [sent. 12235 len. 53]: ` You speak too fondly , ' he answered , ` and yet I can not wish you were less partial ; for I have a pleasure in hearing those words , and shall have in calling them to mind when we are far asunder , which nothing else could give me .
Parsing [sent. 12236 len. 47]: Bear with me for a moment longer , Edward , for she and I have been together many years ; and although I believe that in resigning her to you I put the seal upon her future happiness , I find it needs an effort . '
Parsing [sent. 12237 len. 48]: He pressed her tenderly to his bosom , and after a minute 's pause , resumed : ' I have done you wrong , sir , and I ask your forgiveness -- in no common phrase , or show of sorrow ; but with earnestness and sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 12238 len. 42]: In the same spirit , I acknowledge to you both that the time has been when I connived at treachery and falsehood -- which if I did not perpetrate myself , I still permitted -- to rend you two asunder . '
Parsing [sent. 12239 len. 11]: ` You judge yourself too harshly , ' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 12240 len. 7]: ` Let these things rest . '
Parsing [sent. 12241 len. 25]: ` They rise in judgment against me when I look back , and not now for the first time , ' he answered . '
Parsing [sent. 12242 len. 40]: I can not part from you without your full forgiveness ; for busy life and I have little left in common now , and I have regrets enough to carry into solitude , without addition to the stock . '
Parsing [sent. 12243 len. 13]: ` You bear a blessing from us both , ' said Emma .
Parsing [sent. 12244 len. 37]: ` Never mingle thoughts of me -- of me who owe you so much love and duty -- with anything but undying affection and gratitude for the past , and bright hopes for the future . '
Parsing [sent. 12245 len. 32]: ` The future , ' returned her uncle , with a melancholy smile , ` is a bright word for you , and its image should be wreathed with cheerful hopes .
Parsing [sent. 12246 len. 25]: Mine is of another kind , but it will be one of peace , and free , I trust , from care or passion .
Parsing [sent. 12247 len. 10]: When you quit England I shall leave it too .
Parsing [sent. 12248 len. 26]: There are cloisters abroad ; and now that the two great objects of my life are set at rest , I know no better home .
Parsing [sent. 12249 len. 20]: You droop at that , forgetting that I am growing old , and that my course is nearly run .
Parsing [sent. 12250 len. 29]: Well , we will speak of it again -- not once or twice , but many times ; and you shall give me cheerful counsel , Emma . '
Parsing [sent. 12251 len. 8]: ` And you will take it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12252 len. 4]: asked his niece .
Parsing [sent. 12253 len. 26]: ` I 'll listen to it , ' he answered , with a kiss , ` and it will have its weight , be certain .
Parsing [sent. 12254 len. 7]: What have I left to say ?
Parsing [sent. 12255 len. 10]: You have , of late , been much together .
Parsing [sent. 12256 len. 36]: It is better and more fitting that the circumstances attendant on the past , which wrought your separation , and sowed between you suspicion and distrust , should not be entered on by me . '
Parsing [sent. 12257 len. 11]: ` Much , much better , ' whispered Emma . '
Parsing [sent. 12258 len. 25]: I avow my share in them , ' said Mr Haredale , ` though I held it , at the time , in detestation .
Parsing [sent. 12259 len. 32]: Let no man turn aside , ever so slightly , from the broad path of honour , on the plausible pretence that he is justified by the goodness of his end .
Parsing [sent. 12260 len. 11]: All good ends can he worked out by good means .
Parsing [sent. 12261 len. 21]: Those that can not , are bad ; and may be counted so at once , and left alone . '
Parsing [sent. 12262 len. 25]: He looked from her to Edward , and said in a gentler tone : ` In goods and fortune you are now nearly equal .
Parsing [sent. 12263 len. 50]: I have been her faithful steward , and to that remnant of a richer property which my brother left her , I desire to add , in token of my love , a poor pittance , scarcely worth the mention , for which I have no longer any need .
Parsing [sent. 12264 len. 7]: I am glad you go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 12265 len. 10]: Let our ill-fated house remain the ruin it is .
Parsing [sent. 12266 len. 22]: When you return , after a few thriving years , you will command a better , and a more fortunate one .
Parsing [sent. 12267 len. 5]: We are friends ? '
Parsing [sent. 12268 len. 11]: Edward took his extended hand , and grasped it heartily .
Parsing [sent. 12269 len. 46]: ` You are neither slow nor cold in your response , ' said Mr Haredale , doing the like by him , ` and when I look upon you now , and know you , I feel that I would choose you for her husband .
Parsing [sent. 12270 len. 15]: Her father had a generous nature , and you would have pleased him well .
Parsing [sent. 12271 len. 14]: I give her to you in his name , and with his blessing .
Parsing [sent. 12272 len. 25]: If the world and I part in this act , we part on happier terms than we have lived for many a day . '
Parsing [sent. 12273 len. 40]: He placed her in his arms , and would have left the room , but that he was stopped in his passage to the door by a great noise at a distance , which made them start and pause .
Parsing [sent. 12274 len. 17]: It was a loud shouting , mingled with boisterous acclamations , that rent the very air .
Parsing [sent. 12275 len. 33]: It drew nearer and nearer every moment , and approached so rapidly , that , even while they listened , it burst into a deafening confusion of sounds at the street corner .
Parsing [sent. 12276 len. 15]: ` This must be stopped -- quieted , ' said Mr Haredale , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 12277 len. 12]: ` We should have foreseen this , and provided against it .
Parsing [sent. 12278 len. 10]: I will go out to them at once . '
Parsing [sent. 12279 len. 62]: But , before he could reach the door , and before Edward could catch up his hat and follow him , they were again arrested by a loud shriek from above-stairs : and the locksmith 's wife , bursting in , and fairly running into Mr Haredale 's arms , cried out : ` She knows it all , dear sir !
Parsing [sent. 12280 len. 6]: -- she knows it all !
Parsing [sent. 12281 len. 16]: We broke it out to her by degrees , and she is quite prepared . '
Parsing [sent. 12282 len. 36]: Having made this communication , and furthermore thanked Heaven with great fervour and heartiness , the good lady , according to the custom of matrons , on all occasions of excitement , fainted away directly .
Parsing [sent. 12283 len. 18]: They ran to the window , drew up the sash , and looked into the crowded street .
Parsing [sent. 12284 len. 41]: Among a dense mob of persons , of whom not one was for an instant still , the locksmith 's ruddy face and burly form could be descried , beating about as though he was struggling with a rough sea .
Parsing [sent. 12285 len. 72]: Now , he was carried back a score of yards , now onward nearly to the door , now back again , now forced against the opposite houses , now against those adjoining his own : now carried up a flight of steps , and greeted by the outstretched hands of half a hundred men , while the whole tumultuous concourse stretched their throats , and cheered with all their might .
Parsing [sent. 12286 len. 58]: Though he was really in a fair way to be torn to pieces in the general enthusiasm , the locksmith , nothing discomposed , echoed their shouts till he was as hoarse as they , and in a glow of joy and right good-humour , waved his hat until the daylight shone between its brim and crown .
Parsing [sent. 12287 len. 73]: But in all the bandyings from hand to hand , and strivings to and fro , and sweepings here and there , which -- saving that he looked more jolly and more radiant after every struggle -- troubled his peace of mind no more than if he had been a straw upon the water 's surface , he never once released his firm grasp of an arm , drawn tight through his .
Parsing [sent. 12288 len. 52]: He sometimes turned to clap this friend upon the back , or whisper in his ear a word of staunch encouragement , or cheer him with a smile ; but his great care was to shield him from the pressure , and force a passage for him to the Golden Key .
Parsing [sent. 12289 len. 77]: Passive and timid , scared , pale , and wondering , and gazing at the throng as if he were newly risen from the dead , and felt himself a ghost among the living , Barnaby -- not Barnaby in the spirit , but in flesh and blood , with pulses , sinews , nerves , and beating heart , and strong affections -- clung to his stout old friend , and followed where he led .
Parsing [sent. 12290 len. 23]: And thus , in course of time , they reached the door , held ready for their entrance by no unwilling hands .
Parsing [sent. 12291 len. 40]: Then slipping in , and shutting out the crowd by main force , Gabriel stood between Mr Haredale and Edward Chester , and Barnaby , rushing up the stairs , fell upon his knees beside his mother 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 12292 len. 30]: ` Such is the blessed end , sir , ' cried the panting locksmith , to Mr Haredale , ` of the best day 's work we ever did .
Parsing [sent. 12293 len. 3]: The rogues !
Parsing [sent. 12294 len. 11]: it 's been hard fighting to get away from 'em .
Parsing [sent. 12295 len. 21]: I almost thought , once or twice , they 'd have been too much for us with their kindness ! '
Parsing [sent. 12296 len. 17]: They had striven , all the previous day , to rescue Barnaby from his impending fate .
Parsing [sent. 12297 len. 21]: Failing in their attempts , in the first quarter to which they addressed themselves , they renewed them in another .
Parsing [sent. 12298 len. 53]: Failing there , likewise , they began afresh at midnight ; and made their way , not only to the judge and jury who had tried him , but to men of influence at court , to the young Prince of Wales , and even to the ante-chamber of the King himself .
Parsing [sent. 12299 len. 45]: Successful , at last , in awakening an interest in his favour , and an inclination to inquire more dispassionately into his case , they had had an interview with the minister , in his bed , so late as eight o'clock that morning .
Parsing [sent. 12300 len. 66]: The result of a searching inquiry -LRB- in which they , who had known the poor fellow from his childhood , did other good service , besides bringing it about -RRB- was , that between eleven and twelve o'clock , a free pardon to Barnaby Rudge was made out and signed , and entrusted to a horse-soldier for instant conveyance to the place of execution .
Parsing [sent. 12301 len. 55]: This courier reached the spot just as the cart appeared in sight ; and Barnaby being carried back to jail , Mr Haredale , assured that all was safe , had gone straight from Bloomsbury Square to the Golden Key , leaving to Gabriel the grateful task of bringing him home in triumph . '
Parsing [sent. 12302 len. 53]: I need n't say , ' observed the locksmith , when he had shaken hands with all the males in the house , and hugged all the females , five-and-forty times , at least , ` that , except among ourselves , I did n't want to make a triumph of it .
Parsing [sent. 12303 len. 17]: But , directly we got into the street we were known , and this hubbub began .
Parsing [sent. 12304 len. 49]: Of the two , ' he added , as he wiped his crimson face , ` and after experience of both , I think I 'd rather be taken out of my house by a crowd of enemies , than escorted home by a mob of friends ! '
Parsing [sent. 12305 len. 127]: It was plain enough , however , that this was mere talk on Gabriel 's part , and that the whole proceeding afforded him the keenest delight ; for the people continuing to make a great noise without , and to cheer as if their voices were in the freshest order , and good for a fortnight , he sent upstairs for Grip -LRB- who had come home at his master 's back , and had acknowledged the favours of the multitude by drawing blood from every finger that came within his reach -RRB- , and with the bird upon his arm presented himself at the first-floor window , and waved his hat again until it dangled by a shred , between his finger and thumb .
Parsing [sent. 12306 len. 70]: This demonstration having been received with appropriate shouts , and silence being in some degree restored , he thanked them for their sympathy ; and taking the liberty to inform them that there was a sick person in the house , proposed that they should give three cheers for King George , three more for Old England , and three more for nothing particular , as a closing ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 12307 len. 27]: The crowd assenting , substituted Gabriel Varden for the nothing particular ; and giving him one over , for good measure , dispersed in high good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 12308 len. 86]: What congratulations were exchanged among the inmates at the Golden Key , when they were left alone ; what an overflowing of joy and happiness there was among them ; how incapable it was of expression in Barnaby 's own person ; and how he went wildly from one to another , until he became so far tranquillised , as to stretch himself on the ground beside his mother 's couch and fall into a deep sleep ; are matters that need not be told .
Parsing [sent. 12309 len. 28]: And it is well they happened to be of this class , for they would be very hard to tell , were their narration ever so indispensable .
Parsing [sent. 12310 len. 32]: Before leaving this bright picture , it may be well to glance at a dark and very different one which was presented to only a few eyes , that same night .
Parsing [sent. 12311 len. 32]: The scene was a churchyard ; the time , midnight ; the persons , Edward Chester , a clergyman , a grave-digger , and the four bearers of a homely coffin .
Parsing [sent. 12312 len. 39]: They stood about a grave which had been newly dug , and one of the bearers held up a dim lantern , -- the only light there -- which shed its feeble ray upon the book of prayer .
Parsing [sent. 12313 len. 22]: He placed it for a moment on the coffin , when he and his companions were about to lower it down .
Parsing [sent. 12314 len. 8]: There was no inscription on the lid .
Parsing [sent. 12315 len. 36]: The mould fell solemnly upon the last house of this nameless man ; and the rattling dust left a dismal echo even in the accustomed ears of those who had borne it to its resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 12316 len. 13]: The grave was filled in to the top , and trodden down .
Parsing [sent. 12317 len. 7]: They all left the spot together .
Parsing [sent. 12318 len. 9]: ` You never saw him , living ? '
Parsing [sent. 12319 len. 7]: asked the clergyman , of Edward .
Parsing [sent. 12320 len. 14]: ` Often , years ago ; not knowing him for my brother . '
Parsing [sent. 12321 len. 5]: ` Never since ? '
Parsing [sent. 12322 len. 3]: ` Never .
Parsing [sent. 12323 len. 9]: Yesterday , he steadily refused to see me .
Parsing [sent. 12324 len. 14]: It was urged upon him , many times , at my desire . '
Parsing [sent. 12325 len. 5]: ` Still he refused ?
Parsing [sent. 12326 len. 7]: That was hardened and unnatural . '
Parsing [sent. 12327 len. 8]: ` Do you think so ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12328 len. 8]: I infer that you do not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12329 len. 5]: ` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 12330 len. 14]: We hear the world wonder , every day , at monsters of ingratitude .
Parsing [sent. 12331 len. 24]: Did it never occur to you that it often looks for monsters of affection , as though they were things of course ? '
Parsing [sent. 12332 len. 22]: They had reached the gate by this time , and bidding each other good night , departed on their separate ways .
Parsing [sent. 12333 len. 115]: Chapter 80 That afternoon , when he had slept off his fatigue ; had shaved , and washed , and dressed , and freshened himself from top to toe ; when he had dined , comforted himself with a pipe , an extra Toby , a nap in the great arm-chair , and a quiet chat with Mrs Varden on everything that had happened , was happening , or about to happen , within the sphere of their domestic concern ; the locksmith sat himself down at the tea-table in the little back-parlour : the rosiest , cosiest , merriest , heartiest , best-contented old buck , in Great Britain or out of it .
Parsing [sent. 12334 len. 61]: There he sat , with his beaming eye on Mrs V. , and his shining face suffused with gladness , and his capacious waistcoat smiling in every wrinkle , and his jovial humour peeping from under the table in the very plumpness of his legs ; a sight to turn the vinegar of misanthropy into purest milk of human kindness .
Parsing [sent. 12335 len. 253]: There he sat , watching his wife as she decorated the room with flowers for the greater honour of Dolly and Joseph Willet , who had gone out walking , and for whom the tea-kettle had been singing gaily on the hob full twenty minutes , chirping as never kettle chirped before ; for whom the best service of real undoubted china , patterned with divers round-faced mandarins holding up broad umbrellas , was now displayed in all its glory ; to tempt whose appetites a clear , transparent , juicy ham , garnished with cool green lettuce-leaves and fragrant cucumber , reposed upon a shady table , covered with a snow-white cloth ; for whose delight , preserves and jams , crisp cakes and other pastry , short to eat , with cunning twists , and cottage loaves , and rolls of bread both white and brown , were all set forth in rich profusion ; in whose youth Mrs V. herself had grown quite young , and stood there in a gown of red and white : symmetrical in figure , buxom in bodice , ruddy in cheek and lip , faultless in ankle , laughing in face and mood , in all respects delicious to behold -- there sat the locksmith among all and every these delights , the sun that shone upon them all : the centre of the system : the source of light , heat , life , and frank enjoyment in the bright household world .
Parsing [sent. 12336 len. 12]: And when had Dolly ever been the Dolly of that afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 12337 len. 91]: To see how she came in , arm-in-arm with Joe ; and how she made an effort not to blush or seem at all confused ; and how she made believe she did n't care to sit on his side of the table ; and how she coaxed the locksmith in a whisper not to joke ; and how her colour came and went in a little restless flutter of happiness , which made her do everything wrong , and yet so charmingly wrong that it was better than right !
Parsing [sent. 12338 len. 38]: -- why , the locksmith could have looked on at this -LRB- as he mentioned to Mrs Varden when they retired for the night -RRB- for four-and-twenty hours at a stretch , and never wished it done .
Parsing [sent. 12339 len. 16]: The recollections , too , with which they made merry over that long protracted tea !
Parsing [sent. 12340 len. 155]: The glee with which the locksmith asked Joe if he remembered that stormy night at the Maypole when he first asked after Dolly -- the laugh they all had , about that night when she was going out to the party in the sedan-chair -- the unmerciful manner in which they rallied Mrs Varden about putting those flowers outside that very window -- the difficulty Mrs Varden found in joining the laugh against herself , at first , and the extraordinary perception she had of the joke when she overcame it -- the confidential statements of Joe concerning the precise day and hour when he was first conscious of being fond of Dolly , and Dolly 's blushing admissions , half volunteered and half extorted , as to the time from which she dated the discovery that she ` did n't mind ' Joe -- here was an exhaustless fund of mirth and conversation .
Parsing [sent. 12341 len. 42]: Then , there was a great deal to be said regarding Mrs Varden 's doubts , and motherly alarms , and shrewd suspicions ; and it appeared that from Mrs Varden 's penetration and extreme sagacity nothing had ever been hidden .
Parsing [sent. 12342 len. 7]: She had known it all along .
Parsing [sent. 12343 len. 8]: She had seen it from the first .
Parsing [sent. 12344 len. 6]: She had always predicted it .
Parsing [sent. 12345 len. 10]: She had been aware of it before the principals .
Parsing [sent. 12346 len. 32]: She had said within herself -LRB- for she remembered the exact words -RRB- ` that young Willet is certainly looking after our Dolly , and I must look after HIM . '
Parsing [sent. 12347 len. 56]: Accordingly , she had looked after him , and had observed many little circumstances -LRB- all of which she named -RRB- so exceedingly minute that nobody else could make anything out of them even now ; and had , it seemed from first to last , displayed the most unbounded tact and most consummate generalship .
Parsing [sent. 12348 len. 67]: Of course the night when Joe WOULD ride homeward by the side of the chaise , and when Mrs Varden WOULD insist upon his going back again , was not forgotten -- nor the night when Dolly fainted on his name being mentioned -- nor the times upon times when Mrs Varden , ever watchful and prudent , had found her pining in her own chamber .
Parsing [sent. 12349 len. 55]: In short , nothing was forgotten ; and everything by some means or other brought them back to the conclusion , that that was the happiest hour in all their lives ; consequently , that everything must have occurred for the best , and nothing could be suggested which would have made it better .
Parsing [sent. 12350 len. 45]: While they were in the full glow of such discourse as this , there came a startling knock at the door , opening from the street into the workshop , which had been kept closed all day that the house might be more quiet .
Parsing [sent. 12351 len. 27]: Joe , as in duty bound , would hear of nobody but himself going to open it ; and accordingly left the room for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12352 len. 46]: It would have been odd enough , certainly , if Joe had forgotten the way to this door ; and even if he had , as it was a pretty large one and stood straight before him , he could not easily have missed it .
Parsing [sent. 12353 len. 102]: But Dolly , perhaps because she was in the flutter of spirits before mentioned , or perhaps because she thought he would not be able to open it with his one arm -- she could have had no other reason -- hurried out after him ; and they stopped so long in the passage -- no doubt owing to Joe 's entreaties that she would not expose herself to the draught of July air which must infallibly come rushing in on this same door being opened -- that the knock was repeated , in a yet more startling manner than before .
Parsing [sent. 12354 len. 10]: ` Is anybody going to open that door ? '
Parsing [sent. 12355 len. 4]: cried the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 12356 len. 7]: ` Or shall I come ? '
Parsing [sent. 12357 len. 36]: Upon that , Dolly went running back into the parlour , all dimples and blushes ; and Joe opened it with a mighty noise , and other superfluous demonstrations of being in a violent hurry .
Parsing [sent. 12358 len. 17]: ` Well , ' said the locksmith , when he reappeared : ` what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 12359 len. 3]: eh Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 12360 len. 7]: what are you laughing at ? '
Parsing [sent. 12361 len. 5]: ` Nothing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12362 len. 6]: It 's coming in . '
Parsing [sent. 12363 len. 6]: ` Who 's coming in ?
Parsing [sent. 12364 len. 6]: what 's coming in ? '
Parsing [sent. 12365 len. 65]: Mrs Varden , as much at a loss as her husband , could only shake her head in answer to his inquiring look : so , the locksmith wheeled his chair round to command a better view of the room-door , and stared at it with his eyes wide open , and a mingled expression of curiosity and wonder shining in his jolly face .
Parsing [sent. 12366 len. 58]: Instead of some person or persons straightway appearing , divers remarkable sounds were heard , first in the workshop and afterwards in the little dark passage between it and the parlour , as though some unwieldy chest or heavy piece of furniture were being brought in , by an amount of human strength inadequate to the task .
Parsing [sent. 12367 len. 73]: At length after much struggling and humping , and bruising of the wall on both sides , the door was forced open as by a battering-ram ; and the locksmith , steadily regarding what appeared beyond , smote his thigh , elevated his eyebrows , opened his mouth , and cried in a loud voice expressive of the utmost consternation : ` Damme , if it a n't Miggs come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 12368 len. 79]: The young damsel whom he named no sooner heard these words , than deserting a small boy and a very large box by which she was accompanied , and advancing with such precipitation that her bonnet flew off her head , burst into the room , clasped her hands -LRB- in which she held a pair of pattens , one in each -RRB- , raised her eyes devotedly to the ceiling , and shed a flood of tears .
Parsing [sent. 12369 len. 6]: ` The old story ! '
Parsing [sent. 12370 len. 11]: cried the locksmith , looking at her in inexpressible desperation .
Parsing [sent. 12371 len. 13]: ` She was born to be a damper , this young woman !
Parsing [sent. 12372 len. 6]: nothing can prevent it ! '
Parsing [sent. 12373 len. 8]: ` Ho master , ho mim ! '
Parsing [sent. 12374 len. 17]: cried Miggs , ` can I constrain my feelings in these here once agin united moments !
Parsing [sent. 12375 len. 12]: Ho Mr Warsen , here 's blessedness among relations , sir !
Parsing [sent. 12376 len. 11]: Here 's forgivenesses of injuries , here 's amicablenesses ! '
Parsing [sent. 12377 len. 32]: The locksmith looked from his wife to Dolly , and from Dolly to Joe , and from Joe to Miggs , with his eyebrows still elevated and his mouth still open .
Parsing [sent. 12378 len. 15]: When his eyes got back to Miggs , they rested on her ; fascinated .
Parsing [sent. 12379 len. 35]: ` To think , ' cried Miggs with hysterical joy , ` that Mr Joe , and dear Miss Dolly , has raly come together after all as has been said and done contrairy !
Parsing [sent. 12380 len. 44]: To see them two a-settin ' along with him and her , so pleasant and in all respects so affable and mild ; and me not knowing of it , and not being in the ways to make no preparations for their teas .
Parsing [sent. 12381 len. 19]: Ho what a cutting thing it is , and yet what sweet sensations is awoke within me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12382 len. 102]: Either in clasping her hands again , or in an ecstasy of pious joy , Miss Miggs clinked her pattens after the manner of a pair of cymbals , at this juncture ; and then resumed , in the softest accents : ` And did my missis think -- ho goodness , did she think -- as her own Miggs , which supported her under so many trials , and understood her natur ' when them as intended well but acted rough , went so deep into her feelings -- did she think as her own Miggs would ever leave her ?
Parsing [sent. 12383 len. 56]: Did she think as Miggs , though she was but a servant , and knowed that servitudes was no inheritances , would forgit that she was the humble instruments as always made it comfortable between them two when they fell out , and always told master of the meekness and forgiveness of her blessed dispositions !
Parsing [sent. 12384 len. 9]: Did she think as Miggs had no attachments !
Parsing [sent. 12385 len. 11]: Did she think that wages was her only object ! '
Parsing [sent. 12386 len. 285]: To none of these interrogatories , whereof every one was more pathetically delivered than the last , did Mrs Varden answer one word : but Miggs , not at all abashed by this circumstance , turned to the small boy in attendance -- her eldest nephew -- son of her own married sister -- born in Golden Lion Court , number twenty-sivin , and bred in the very shadow of the second bell-handle on the right-hand door-post -- and with a plentiful use of her pocket-handkerchief , addressed herself to him : requesting that on his return home he would console his parents for the loss of her , his aunt , by delivering to them a faithful statement of his having left her in the bosom of that family , with which , as his aforesaid parents well knew , her best affections were incorporated ; that he would remind them that nothing less than her imperious sense of duty , and devoted attachment to her old master and missis , likewise Miss Dolly and young Mr Joe , should ever have induced her to decline that pressing invitation which they , his parents , had , as he could testify , given her , to lodge and board with them , free of all cost and charge , for evermore ; lastly , that he would help her with her box upstairs , and then repair straight home , bearing her blessing and her strong injunctions to mingle in his prayers a supplication that he might in course of time grow up a locksmith , or a Mr Joe , and have Mrs Vardens and Miss Dollys for his relations and friends .
Parsing [sent. 12387 len. 86]: Having brought this admonition to an end -- upon which , to say the truth , the young gentleman for whose benefit it was designed , bestowed little or no heed , having to all appearance his faculties absorbed in the contemplation of the sweetmeats , -- Miss Miggs signified to the company in general that they were not to be uneasy , for she would soon return ; and , with her nephew 's aid , prepared to bear her wardrobe up the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 12388 len. 12]: ` My dear , ' said the locksmith to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 12389 len. 8]: ` Do you desire this ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12390 len. 5]: I desire it ! '
Parsing [sent. 12391 len. 4]: she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 12392 len. 12]: I am astonished -- I am amazed -- at her audacity .
Parsing [sent. 12393 len. 9]: Let her leave the house this moment . '
Parsing [sent. 12394 len. 50]: Miggs , hearing this , let her end of the box fall heavily to the floor , gave a very loud sniff , crossed her arms , screwed down the corners of her mouth , and cried , in an ascending scale , ` Ho , good gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 12395 len. 4]: three distinct times .
Parsing [sent. 12396 len. 16]: ` You hear what your mistress says , my love , ' remarked the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 12397 len. 9]: ` You had better go , I think .
Parsing [sent. 12398 len. 15]: Stay ; take this with you , for the sake of old service . '
Parsing [sent. 12399 len. 87]: Miss Miggs clutched the bank-note he took from his pocket-book and held out to her ; deposited it in a small , red leather purse ; put the purse in her pocket -LRB- displaying , as she did so , a considerable portion of some under-garment , made of flannel , and more black cotton stocking than is commonly seen in public -RRB- ; and , tossing her head , as she looked at Mrs Varden , repeated -- ` Ho , good gracious ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12400 len. 16]: I think you said that once before , my dear , ' observed the locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 12401 len. 11]: ` Times is changed , is they , mim ! '
Parsing [sent. 12402 len. 15]: cried Miggs , bridling ; ` you can spare me now , can you ?
Parsing [sent. 12403 len. 8]: You can keep 'em down without me ?
Parsing [sent. 12404 len. 26]: You 're not in wants of any one to scold , or throw the blame upon , no longer , a n't you , mim ?
Parsing [sent. 12405 len. 11]: I 'm glad to find you 've grown so independent .
Parsing [sent. 12406 len. 10]: I wish you joy , I 'm sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 12407 len. 85]: With that she dropped a curtsey , and keeping her head erect , her ear towards Mrs Varden , and her eye on the rest of the company , as she alluded to them in her remarks , proceeded : ` I 'm quite delighted , I 'm sure , to find sich independency , feeling sorry though , at the same time , mim , that you should have been forced into submissions when you could n't help yourself -- he he he !
Parsing [sent. 12408 len. 53]: It must be great vexations , ` specially considering how ill you always spoke of Mr Joe -- to have him for a son-in-law at last ; and I wonder Miss Dolly can put up with him , either , after being off and on for so many years with a coachmaker .
Parsing [sent. 12409 len. 18]: But I HAVE heerd say , that the coachmaker thought twice about it -- he he he !
Parsing [sent. 12410 len. 40]: -- and that he told a young man as was a frind of his , that he hoped he knowed better than to be drawed into that ; though she and all the family DID pull uncommon strong ! '
Parsing [sent. 12411 len. 17]: Here she paused for a reply , and receiving none , went on as before . '
Parsing [sent. 12412 len. 36]: I HAVE heerd say , mim , that the illnesses of some ladies was all pretensions , and that they could faint away , stone dead , whenever they had the inclinations so to do .
Parsing [sent. 12413 len. 15]: Of course I never see sich cases with my own eyes -- ho no !
Parsing [sent. 12414 len. 4]: He he he !
Parsing [sent. 12415 len. 7]: Nor master neither -- ho no !
Parsing [sent. 12416 len. 4]: He he he !
Parsing [sent. 12417 len. 39]: I HAVE heerd the neighbours make remark as some one as they was acquainted with , was a poor good-natur 'd mean-spirited creetur , as went out fishing for a wife one day , and caught a Tartar .
Parsing [sent. 12418 len. 13]: Of course I never to my knowledge see the poor person himself .
Parsing [sent. 12419 len. 10]: Nor did you neither , mim -- ho no .
Parsing [sent. 12420 len. 13]: I wonder who it can be -- do n't you , mim ?
Parsing [sent. 12421 len. 7]: No doubt you do , mim .
Parsing [sent. 12422 len. 3]: Ho yes .
Parsing [sent. 12423 len. 5]: He he he ! '
Parsing [sent. 12424 len. 28]: Again Miggs paused for a reply ; and none being offered , was so oppressed with teeming spite and spleen , that she seemed like to burst .
Parsing [sent. 12425 len. 18]: ` I 'm glad Miss Dolly can laugh , ' cried Miggs with a feeble titter . '
Parsing [sent. 12426 len. 17]: I like to see folks a-laughing -- so do you , mim , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 12427 len. 16]: You was always glad to see people in spirits , was n't you , mim ?
Parsing [sent. 12428 len. 17]: And you always did your best to keep 'em cheerful , did n't you , mim ?
Parsing [sent. 12429 len. 19]: Though there a n't such a great deal to laugh at now either ; is there , mim ?
Parsing [sent. 12430 len. 49]: It a n't so much of a catch , after looking out so sharp ever since she was a little chit , and costing such a deal in dress and show , to get a poor , common soldier , with one arm , is it , mim ?
Parsing [sent. 12431 len. 3]: He he !
Parsing [sent. 12432 len. 12]: I would n't have a husband with one arm , anyways .
Parsing [sent. 12433 len. 6]: I would have two arms .
Parsing [sent. 12434 len. 29]: I would have two arms , if it was me , though instead of hands they 'd only got hooks at the end , like our dustman ! '
Parsing [sent. 12435 len. 105]: Miss Miggs was about to add , and had , indeed , begun to add , that , taking them in the abstract , dustmen were far more eligible matches than soldiers , though , to be sure , when people were past choosing they must take the best they could get , and think themselves well off too ; but her vexation and chagrin being of that internally bitter sort which finds no relief in words , and is aggravated to madness by want of contradiction , she could hold out no longer , and burst into a storm of sobs and tears .
Parsing [sent. 12436 len. 116]: In this extremity she fell on the unlucky nephew , tooth and nail , and plucking a handful of hair from his head , demanded to know how long she was to stand there to be insulted , and whether or no he meant to help her to carry out the box again , and if he took a pleasure in hearing his family reviled : with other inquiries of that nature ; at which disgrace and provocation , the small boy , who had been all this time gradually lashed into rebellion by the sight of unattainable pastry , walked off indignant , leaving his aunt and the box to follow at their leisure .
Parsing [sent. 12437 len. 61]: Somehow or other , by dint of pushing and pulling , they did attain the street at last ; where Miss Miggs , all blowzed with the exertion of getting there , and with her sobs and tears , sat down upon her property to rest and grieve , until she could ensnare some other youth to help her home .
Parsing [sent. 12438 len. 36]: ` It 's a thing to laugh at , Martha , not to care for , ' whispered the locksmith , as he followed his wife to the window , and good-humouredly dried her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12439 len. 6]: ` What does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 12440 len. 7]: You had seen your fault before .
Parsing [sent. 12441 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 12442 len. 27]: Bring up Toby again , my dear ; Dolly shall sing us a song ; and we 'll be all the merrier for this interruption ! '
Parsing [sent. 12443 len. 28]: Chapter 81 Another month had passed , and the end of August had nearly come , when Mr Haredale stood alone in the mail-coach office at Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 12444 len. 48]: Although but a few weeks had intervened since his conversation with Edward Chester and his niece , in the locksmith 's house , and he had made no change , in the mean time , in his accustomed style of dress , his appearance was greatly altered .
Parsing [sent. 12445 len. 9]: He looked much older , and more care-worn .
Parsing [sent. 12446 len. 35]: Agitation and anxiety of mind scatter wrinkles and grey hairs with no unsparing hand ; but deeper traces follow on the silent uprooting of old habits , and severing of dear , familiar ties .
Parsing [sent. 12447 len. 22]: The affections may not be so easily wounded as the passions , but their hurts are deeper , and more lasting .
Parsing [sent. 12448 len. 17]: He was now a solitary man , and the heart within him was dreary and lonesome .
Parsing [sent. 12449 len. 17]: He was not the less alone for having spent so many years in seclusion and retirement .
Parsing [sent. 12450 len. 22]: This was no better preparation than a round of social cheerfulness : perhaps it even increased the keenness of his sensibility .
Parsing [sent. 12451 len. 78]: He had been so dependent upon her for companionship and love ; she had come to be so much a part and parcel of his existence ; they had had so many cares and thoughts in common , which no one else had shared ; that losing her was beginning life anew , and being required to summon up the hope and elasticity of youth , amid the doubts , distrusts , and weakened energies of age .
Parsing [sent. 12452 len. 28]: The effort he had made to part from her with seeming cheerfulness and hope -- and they had parted only yesterday -- left him the more depressed .
Parsing [sent. 12453 len. 37]: With these feelings , he was about to revisit London for the last time , and look once more upon the walls of their old home , before turning his back upon it , for ever .
Parsing [sent. 12454 len. 44]: The journey was a very different one , in those days , from what the present generation find it ; but it came to an end , as the longest journey will , and he stood again in the streets of the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 12455 len. 53]: He lay at the inn where the coach stopped , and resolved , before he went to bed , that he would make his arrival known to no one ; would spend but another night in London ; and would spare himself the pang of parting , even with the honest locksmith .
Parsing [sent. 12456 len. 33]: Such conditions of the mind as that to which he was a prey when he lay down to rest , are favourable to the growth of disordered fancies , and uneasy visions .
Parsing [sent. 12457 len. 51]: He knew this , even in the horror with which he started from his first sleep , and threw up the window to dispel it by the presence of some object , beyond the room , which had not been , as it were , the witness of his dream .
Parsing [sent. 12458 len. 39]: But it was not a new terror of the night ; it had been present to him before , in many shapes ; it had haunted him in bygone times , and visited his pillow again and again .
Parsing [sent. 12459 len. 48]: If it had been but an ugly object , a childish spectre , haunting his sleep , its return , in its old form , might have awakened a momentary sensation of fear , which , almost in the act of waking , would have passed away .
Parsing [sent. 12460 len. 15]: This disquiet , however , lingered about him , and would yield to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 12461 len. 71]: When he closed his eyes again , he felt it hovering near ; as he slowly sunk into a slumber , he was conscious of its gathering strength and purpose , and gradually assuming its recent shape ; when he sprang up from his bed , the same phantom vanished from his heated brain , and left him filled with a dread against which reason and waking thought were powerless .
Parsing [sent. 12462 len. 12]: The sun was up , before he could shake it off .
Parsing [sent. 12463 len. 16]: He rose late , but not refreshed , and remained within doors all that day .
Parsing [sent. 12464 len. 44]: He had a fancy for paying his last visit to the old spot in the evening , for he had been accustomed to walk there at that season , and desired to see it under the aspect that was most familiar to him .
Parsing [sent. 12465 len. 29]: At such an hour as would afford him time to reach it a little before sunset , he left the inn , and turned into the busy street .
Parsing [sent. 12466 len. 53]: He had not gone far , and was thoughtfully making his way among the noisy crowd , when he felt a hand upon his shoulder , and , turning , recognised one of the waiters from the inn , who begged his pardon , but he had left his sword behind him .
Parsing [sent. 12467 len. 10]: ` Why have you brought it to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12468 len. 28]: he asked , stretching out his hand , and yet not taking it from the man , but looking at him in a disturbed and agitated manner .
Parsing [sent. 12469 len. 16]: The man was sorry to have disobliged him , and would carry it back again .
Parsing [sent. 12470 len. 24]: The gentleman had said that he was going a little way into the country , and that he might not return until late .
Parsing [sent. 12471 len. 35]: The roads were not very safe for single travellers after dark ; and , since the riots , gentlemen had been more careful than ever , not to trust themselves unarmed in lonely places .
Parsing [sent. 12472 len. 63]: ` We thought you were a stranger , sir , ' he added , ` and that you might believe our roads to be better than they are ; but perhaps you know them well , and carry fire-arms -- ' He took the sword , and putting it up at his side , thanked the man , and resumed his walk .
Parsing [sent. 12473 len. 43]: It was long remembered that he did this in a manner so strange , and with such a trembling hand , that the messenger stood looking after his retreating figure , doubtful whether he ought not to follow , and watch him .
Parsing [sent. 12474 len. 88]: It was long remembered that he had been heard pacing his bedroom in the dead of the night ; that the attendants had mentioned to each other in the morning , how fevered and how pale he looked ; and that when this man went back to the inn , he told a fellow-servant that what he had observed in this short interview lay very heavy on his mind , and that he feared the gentleman intended to destroy himself , and would never come back alive .
Parsing [sent. 12475 len. 86]: With a half-consciousness that his manner had attracted the man 's attention -LRB- remembering the expression of his face when they parted -RRB- , Mr Haredale quickened his steps ; and arriving at a stand of coaches , bargained with the driver of the best to carry him so far on his road as the point where the footway struck across the fields , and to await his return at a house of entertainment which was within a stone 's - throw of that place .
Parsing [sent. 12476 len. 15]: Arriving there in due course , he alighted and pursued his way on foot .
Parsing [sent. 12477 len. 46]: He passed so near the Maypole , that he could see its smoke rising from among the trees , while a flock of pigeons -- some of its old inhabitants , doubtless -- sailed gaily home to roost , between him and the unclouded sky .
Parsing [sent. 12478 len. 32]: ` The old house will brighten up now , ' he said , as he looked towards it , ` and there will be a merry fireside beneath its ivied roof .
Parsing [sent. 12479 len. 14]: It is some comfort to know that everything will not be blighted hereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 12480 len. 21]: I shall be glad to have one picture of life and cheerfulness to turn to , in my mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 12481 len. 13]: He resumed his walk , and bent his steps towards the Warren .
Parsing [sent. 12482 len. 57]: It was a clear , calm , silent evening , with hardly a breath of wind to stir the leaves , or any sound to break the stillness of the time , but drowsy sheep-bells tinkling in the distance , and , at intervals , the far-off lowing of cattle , or bark of village dogs .
Parsing [sent. 12483 len. 26]: The sky was radiant with the softened glory of sunset ; and on the earth , and in the air , a deep repose prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 12484 len. 30]: At such an hour , he arrived at the deserted mansion which had been his home so long , and looked for the last time upon its blackened walls .
Parsing [sent. 12485 len. 50]: The ashes of the commonest fire are melancholy things , for in them there is an image of death and ruin , -- of something that has been bright , and is but dull , cold , dreary dust , -- with which our nature forces us to sympathise .
Parsing [sent. 12486 len. 72]: How much more sad the crumbled embers of a home : the casting down of that great altar , where the worst among us sometimes perform the worship of the heart ; and where the best have offered up such sacrifices , and done such deeds of heroism , as , chronicled , would put the proudest temples of old Time , with all their vaunting annals , to the blush !
Parsing [sent. 12487 len. 17]: He roused himself from a long train of meditation , and walked slowly round the house .
Parsing [sent. 12488 len. 8]: It was by this time almost dark .
Parsing [sent. 12489 len. 23]: He had nearly made the circuit of the building , when he uttered a half-suppressed exclamation , started , and stood still .
Parsing [sent. 12490 len. 104]: Reclining , in an easy attitude , with his back against a tree , and contemplating the ruin with an expression of pleasure , -- a pleasure so keen that it overcame his habitual indolence and command of feature , and displayed itself utterly free from all restraint or reserve , -- before him , on his own ground , and triumphing then , as he had triumphed in every misfortune and disappointment of his life , stood the man whose presence , of all mankind , in any place , and least of all in that , he could the least endure .
Parsing [sent. 12491 len. 42]: Although his blood so rose against this man , and his wrath so stirred within him , that he could have struck him dead , he put such fierce constraint upon himself that he passed him without a word or look .
Parsing [sent. 12492 len. 83]: Yes , and he would have gone on , and not turned , though to resist the Devil who poured such hot temptation in his brain , required an effort scarcely to be achieved , if this man had not himself summoned him to stop : and that , with an assumed compassion in his voice which drove him well-nigh mad , and in an instant routed all the self-command it had been anguish -- acute , poignant anguish -- to sustain .
Parsing [sent. 12493 len. 30]: All consideration , reflection , mercy , forbearance ; everything by which a goaded man can curb his rage and passion ; fled from him as he turned back .
Parsing [sent. 12494 len. 31]: And yet he said , slowly and quite calmly -- far more calmly than he had ever spoken to him before : ` Why have you called to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12495 len. 29]: ` To remark , ' said Sir John Chester with his wonted composure , ` what an odd chance it is , that we should meet here ! '
Parsing [sent. 12496 len. 8]: ` It IS a strange chance . '
Parsing [sent. 12497 len. 3]: ` Strange ?
Parsing [sent. 12498 len. 10]: The most remarkable and singular thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 12499 len. 15]: I never ride in the evening ; I have not done so for years .
Parsing [sent. 12500 len. 15]: The whim seized me , quite unaccountably , in the middle of last night .
Parsing [sent. 12501 len. 8]: -- How very picturesque this is ! '
Parsing [sent. 12502 len. 21]: -- He pointed , as he spoke , to the dismantled house , and raised his glass to his eye .
Parsing [sent. 12503 len. 10]: ` You praise your own work very freely . '
Parsing [sent. 12504 len. 45]: Sir John let fall his glass ; inclined his face towards him with an air of the most courteous inquiry ; and slightly shook his head as though he were remarking to himself , ' I fear this animal is going mad ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12505 len. 15]: I say you praise your own work very freely , ' repeated Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 12506 len. 4]: ` Work ! '
Parsing [sent. 12507 len. 8]: echoed Sir John , looking smilingly round .
Parsing [sent. 12508 len. 3]: ` Mine !
Parsing [sent. 12509 len. 28]: -- I beg your pardon , I really beg your pardon -- ' ` Why , you see , ' said Mr Haredale , ` those walls .
Parsing [sent. 12510 len. 6]: You see those tottering gables .
Parsing [sent. 12511 len. 12]: You see on every side where fire and smoke have raged .
Parsing [sent. 12512 len. 10]: You see the destruction that has been wanton here .
Parsing [sent. 12513 len. 5]: Do you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12514 len. 24]: ` My good friend , ' returned the knight , gently checking his impatience with his hand , ` of course I do .
Parsing [sent. 12515 len. 23]: I see everything you speak of , when you stand aside , and do not interpose yourself between the view and me .
Parsing [sent. 12516 len. 7]: I am very sorry for you .
Parsing [sent. 12517 len. 23]: If I had not had the pleasure to meet you here , I think I should have written to tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 12518 len. 24]: But you do n't bear it as well as I had expected -- excuse me -- no , you do n't indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 12519 len. 66]: He pulled out his snuff-box , and addressing him with the superior air of a man who , by reason of his higher nature , has a right to read a moral lesson to another , continued : ` For you are a philosopher , you know -- one of that stern and rigid school who are far above the weaknesses of mankind in general .
Parsing [sent. 12520 len. 15]: You are removed , a long way , from the frailties of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 12521 len. 17]: You contemplate them from a height , and rail at them with a most impressive bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 12522 len. 6]: I have heard you . '
Parsing [sent. 12523 len. 11]: -- ` And shall again , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 12524 len. 9]: ` Thank you , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 12525 len. 8]: ` Shall we walk as we talk ?
Parsing [sent. 12526 len. 6]: The damp falls rather heavily .
Parsing [sent. 12527 len. 7]: Well , -- as you please .
Parsing [sent. 12528 len. 18]: But I grieve to say that I can spare you only a very few moments . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12529 len. 15]: I would , ' said Mr Haredale , ` you had spared me none .
Parsing [sent. 12530 len. 30]: I would , with all my soul , you had been in Paradise -LRB- if such a monstrous lie could be enacted -RRB- , rather than here to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 12531 len. 16]: ` Nay , ' returned the other -- ` really -- you do yourself injustice .
Parsing [sent. 12532 len. 18]: You are a rough companion , but I would not go so far to avoid you . '
Parsing [sent. 12533 len. 10]: ` Listen to me , ' said Mr Haredale .
Parsing [sent. 12534 len. 6]: ` Listen to me . '
Parsing [sent. 12535 len. 6]: ` While you rail ? '
Parsing [sent. 12536 len. 4]: inquired Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 12537 len. 7]: ` While I deliver your infamy .
Parsing [sent. 12538 len. 56]: You urged and stimulated to do your work a fit agent , but one who in his nature -- in the very essence of his being -- is a traitor , and who has been false to you -LRB- despite the sympathy you two should have together -RRB- as he has been to all others .
Parsing [sent. 12539 len. 30]: With hints , and looks , and crafty words , which told again are nothing , you set on Gashford to this work -- this work before us now .
Parsing [sent. 12540 len. 49]: With these same hints , and looks , and crafty words , which told again are nothing , you urged him on to gratify the deadly hate he owes me -- I have earned it , I thank Heaven -- by the abduction and dishonour of my niece .
Parsing [sent. 12541 len. 3]: You did .
Parsing [sent. 12542 len. 29]: I see denial in your looks , ' he cried , abruptly pointing in his face , and stepping back , ` and denial is a lie ! '
Parsing [sent. 12543 len. 25]: He had his hand upon his sword ; but the knight , with a contemptuous smile , replied to him as coldly as before .
Parsing [sent. 12544 len. 24]: ` You will take notice , sir -- if you can discriminate sufficiently -- that I have taken the trouble to deny nothing .
Parsing [sent. 12545 len. 59]: Your discernment is hardly fine enough for the perusal of faces , not of a kind as coarse as your speech ; nor has it ever been , that I remember ; or , in one face that I could name , you would have read indifference , not to say disgust , somewhat sooner than you did .
Parsing [sent. 12546 len. 15]: I speak of a long time ago , -- but you understand me . '
Parsing [sent. 12547 len. 11]: ` Disguise it as you will , you mean denial .
Parsing [sent. 12548 len. 17]: Denial explicit or reserved , expressed or left to be inferred , is still a lie .
Parsing [sent. 12549 len. 7]: You say you do n't deny .
Parsing [sent. 12550 len. 5]: Do you admit ? '
Parsing [sent. 12551 len. 67]: ` You yourself , ' returned Sir John , suffering the current of his speech to flow as smoothly as if it had been stemmed by no one word of interruption , ` publicly proclaimed the character of the gentleman in question -LRB- I think it was in Westminster Hall -RRB- in terms which relieve me from the necessity of making any further allusion to him .
Parsing [sent. 12552 len. 17]: You may have been warranted ; you may not have been ; I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 12553 len. 83]: Assuming the gentleman to be what you described , and to have made to you or any other person any statements that may have happened to suggest themselves to him , for the sake of his own security , or for the sake of money , or for his own amusement , or for any other consideration , -- I have nothing to say of him , except that his extremely degrading situation appears to me to be shared with his employers .
Parsing [sent. 12554 len. 22]: You are so very plain yourself , that you will excuse a little freedom in me , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 12555 len. 37]: ` Attend to me again , Sir John but once , ' cried Mr Haredale ; ` in your every look , and word , and gesture , you tell me this was not your act .
Parsing [sent. 12556 len. 29]: I tell you that it was , and that you tampered with the man I speak of , and with your wretched son -LRB- whom God forgive ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12557 len. 5]: to do this deed .
Parsing [sent. 12558 len. 7]: You talk of degradation and character .
Parsing [sent. 12559 len. 43]: You told me once that you had purchased the absence of the poor idiot and his mother , when -LRB- as I have discovered since , and then suspected -RRB- you had gone to tempt them , and had found them flown .
Parsing [sent. 12560 len. 32]: To you I traced the insinuation that I alone reaped any harvest from my brother 's death ; and all the foul attacks and whispered calumnies that followed in its train .
Parsing [sent. 12561 len. 33]: In every action of my life , from that first hope which you converted into grief and desolation , you have stood , like an adverse fate , between me and peace .
Parsing [sent. 12562 len. 18]: In all , you have ever been the same cold-blooded , hollow , false , unworthy villain .
Parsing [sent. 12563 len. 31]: For the second time , and for the last , I cast these charges in your teeth , and spurn you from me as I would a faithless dog ! '
Parsing [sent. 12564 len. 18]: With that he raised his arm , and struck him on the breast so that he staggered .
Parsing [sent. 12565 len. 53]: Sir John , the instant he recovered , drew his sword , threw away the scabbard and his hat , and running on his adversary made a desperate lunge at his heart , which , but that his guard was quick and true , would have stretched him dead upon the grass .
Parsing [sent. 12566 len. 19]: In the act of striking him , the torrent of his opponent 's rage had reached a stop .
Parsing [sent. 12567 len. 29]: He parried his rapid thrusts , without returning them , and called to him , with a frantic kind of terror in his face , to keep back .
Parsing [sent. 12568 len. 4]: ` Not to-night !
Parsing [sent. 12569 len. 4]: not to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 12570 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 12571 len. 10]: ` In God 's name , not tonight ! '
Parsing [sent. 12572 len. 21]: Seeing that he lowered his weapon , and that he would not thrust in turn , Sir John lowered his .
Parsing [sent. 12573 len. 5]: ` Not to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 12574 len. 4]: his adversary cried .
Parsing [sent. 12575 len. 7]: ` Be warned in time ! '
Parsing [sent. 12576 len. 46]: ` You told me -- it must have been in a sort of inspiration -- ' said Sir John , quite deliberately , though now he dropped his mask , and showed his hatred in his face , ` that this was the last time .
Parsing [sent. 12577 len. 5]: Be assured it is !
Parsing [sent. 12578 len. 9]: Did you believe our last meeting was forgotten ?
Parsing [sent. 12579 len. 22]: Did you believe that your every word and look was not to be accounted for , and was not well remembered ?
Parsing [sent. 12580 len. 14]: Do you believe that I have waited your time , or you mine ?
Parsing [sent. 12581 len. 84]: What kind of man is he who entered , with all his sickening cant of honesty and truth , into a bond with me to prevent a marriage he affected to dislike , and when I had redeemed my part to the spirit and the letter , skulked from his , and brought the match about in his own time , to rid himself of a burden he had grown tired of , and cast a spurious lustre on his house ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12582 len. 17]: I have acted , ' cried Mr Haredale , ` with honour and in good faith .
Parsing [sent. 12583 len. 5]: I do so now .
Parsing [sent. 12584 len. 11]: Do not force me to renew this duel to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 12585 len. 13]: ` You said my `` wretched '' son , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 12586 len. 8]: said Sir John , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 12587 len. 4]: ` Poor fool !
Parsing [sent. 12588 len. 27]: The dupe of such a shallow knave -- trapped into marriage by such an uncle and by such a niece -- he well deserves your pity .
Parsing [sent. 12589 len. 24]: But he is no longer a son of mine : you are welcome to the prize your craft has made , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12590 len. 39]: ` Once more , ' cried his opponent , wildly stamping on the ground , ` although you tear me from my better angel , I implore you not to come within the reach of my sword to-night .
Parsing [sent. 12591 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 12592 len. 7]: why were you here at all !
Parsing [sent. 12593 len. 5]: Why have we met !
Parsing [sent. 12594 len. 11]: To-morrow would have cast us far apart for ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 12595 len. 26]: ` That being the case , ' returned Sir John , without the least emotion , ` it is very fortunate we have met to-night .
Parsing [sent. 12596 len. 25]: Haredale , I have always despised you , as you know , but I have given you credit for a species of brute courage .
Parsing [sent. 12597 len. 25]: For the honour of my judgment , which I had thought a good one , I am sorry to find you a coward . '
Parsing [sent. 12598 len. 9]: Not another word was spoken on either side .
Parsing [sent. 12599 len. 17]: They crossed swords , though it was now quite dusk , and attacked each other fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 12600 len. 17]: They were well matched , and each was thoroughly skilled in the management of his weapon .
Parsing [sent. 12601 len. 23]: After a few seconds they grew hotter and more furious , and pressing on each other inflicted and received several slight wounds .
Parsing [sent. 12602 len. 41]: It was directly after receiving one of these in his arm , that Mr Haredale , making a keener thrust as he felt the warm blood spirting out , plunged his sword through his opponent 's body to the hilt .
