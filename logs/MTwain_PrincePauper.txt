Parsing [sent. 18 len. 15]: It may be history , it may be only a legend , a tradition .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 17]: It may have happened , it may not have happened : but it COULD have happened .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 32]: It may be that the wise and the learned believed it in the old days ; it may be that only the unlearned and the simple loved it and credited it .

Parsing [sent. 92 len. 3]: Chapter I .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 9]: The birth of the Prince and the Pauper .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 41]: In the ancient city of London , on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century , a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Canty , who did not want him .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 24]: On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor , who did want him .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 6]: All England wanted him too .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 35]: England had so longed for him , and hoped for him , and prayed God for him , that , now that he was really come , the people went nearly mad for joy .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 10]: Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 36]: Everybody took a holiday , and high and low , rich and poor , feasted and danced and sang , and got very mellow ; and they kept this up for days and nights together .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 26]: By day , London was a sight to see , with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop , and splendid pageants marching along .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 29]: By night , it was again a sight to see , with its great bonfires at every corner , and its troops of revellers making merry around them .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 56]: There was no talk in all England but of the new baby , Edward Tudor , Prince of Wales , who lay lapped in silks and satins , unconscious of all this fuss , and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him -- and not caring , either .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 36]: But there was no talk about the other baby , Tom Canty , lapped in his poor rags , except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 3]: Chapter II .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 5]: Tom 's early life .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 8]: Let us skip a number of years .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 17]: London was fifteen hundred years old , and was a great town -- for that day .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 13]: It had a hundred thousand inhabitants -- some think double as many .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 29]: The streets were very narrow , and crooked , and dirty , especially in the part where Tom Canty lived , which was not far from London Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 26]: The houses were of wood , with the second story projecting over the first , and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 11]: The higher the houses grew , the broader they grew .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 17]: They were skeletons of strong criss-cross beams , with solid material between , coated with plaster .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 27]: The beams were painted red or blue or black , according to the owner 's taste , and this gave the houses a very picturesque look .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 22]: The windows were small , glazed with little diamond-shaped panes , and they opened outward , on hinges , like doors .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 23]: The house which Tom 's father lived in was up a foul little pocket called Offal Court , out of Pudding Lane .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 19]: It was small , decayed , and rickety , but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 11]: Canty 's tribe occupied a room on the third floor .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 47]: The mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner ; but Tom , his grandmother , and his two sisters , Bet and Nan , were not restricted -- they had all the floor to themselves , and might sleep where they chose .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 56]: There were the remains of a blanket or two , and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw , but these could not rightly be called beds , for they were not organised ; they were kicked into a general pile , mornings , and selections made from the mass at night , for service .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 10]: Bet and Nan were fifteen years old -- twins .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 15]: They were good-hearted girls , unclean , clothed in rags , and profoundly ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 6]: Their mother was like them .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 12]: But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 43]: They got drunk whenever they could ; then they fought each other or anybody else who came in the way ; they cursed and swore always , drunk or sober ; John Canty was a thief , and his mother a beggar .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 15]: They made beggars of the children , but failed to make thieves of them .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 52]: Among , but not of , the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house , was a good old priest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings , and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 49]: Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin , and how to read and write ; and would have done the same with the girls , but they were afraid of the jeers of their friends , who could not have endured such a queer accomplishment in them .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 13]: All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty 's house .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 19]: Drunkenness , riot and brawling were the order , there , every night and nearly all night long .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 11]: Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 7]: Yet little Tom was not unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 14]: He had a hard time of it , but did not know it .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 25]: It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had , therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 92]: When he came home empty-handed at night , he knew his father would curse him and thrash him first , and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it ; and that away in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going hungry herself , notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 14]: No , Tom 's life went along well enough , especially in summer .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 62]: He only begged just enough to save himself , for the laws against mendicancy were stringent , and the penalties heavy ; so he put in a good deal of his time listening to good Father Andrew 's charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies , dwarfs and genii , and enchanted castles , and gorgeous kings and princes .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 67]: His head grew to be full of these wonderful things , and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw , tired , hungry , and smarting from a thrashing , he unleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 25]: One desire came in time to haunt him day and night : it was to see a real prince , with his own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 35]: He spoke of it once to some of his Offal Court comrades ; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 18]: He often read the priest 's old books and got him to explain and enlarge upon them .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 12]: His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him , by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 27]: His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt , and to wish to be clean and better clad .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 51]: He went on playing in the mud just the same , and enjoying it , too ; but , instead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it , he began to find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it afforded .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 52]: Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside , and at the fairs ; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried prisoner to the Tower , by land or boat .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 34]: One summer 's day he saw poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield , and heard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 15]: Yes , Tom 's life was varied and pleasant enough , on the whole .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 26]: By-and-by Tom 's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince , unconsciously .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 20]: His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly , to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimates .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 43]: But Tom 's influence among these young people began to grow now , day by day ; and in time he came to be looked up to , by them , with a sort of wondering awe , as a superior being .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 7]: He seemed to know so much !
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 10]: and he could do and say such marvellous things !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 10]: and withal , he was so deep and wise !
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 42]: Tom 's remarks , and Tom 's performances , were reported by the boys to their elders ; and these , also , presently began to discuss Tom Canty , and to regard him as a most gifted and extraordinary creature .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 23]: Full-grown people brought their perplexities to Tom for solution , and were often astonished at the wit and wisdom of his decisions .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 26]: In fact he was become a hero to all who knew him except his own family -- these , only , saw nothing in him .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 12]: Privately , after a while , Tom organised a royal court !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 26]: He was the prince ; his special comrades were guards , chamberlains , equerries , lords and ladies in waiting , and the royal family .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 49]: Daily the mock prince was received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic readings ; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in the royal council , and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his imaginary armies , navies , and viceroyalties .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 48]: After which , he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings , eat his poor crust , take his customary cuffs and abuse , and then stretch himself upon his handful of foul straw , and resume his empty grandeurs in his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 48]: And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince , in the flesh , grew upon him , day by day , and week by week , until at last it absorbed all other desires , and became the one passion of his life .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 89]: One January day , on his usual begging tour , he tramped despondently up and down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap , hour after hour , bare-footed and cold , looking in at cook-shop windows and longing for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed there -- for to him these were dainties fit for the angels ; that is , judging by the smell , they were -- for it had never been his good luck to own and eat one .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 19]: There was a cold drizzle of rain ; the atmosphere was murky ; it was a melancholy day .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 50]: At night Tom reached home so wet and tired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved -- after their fashion ; wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 68]: For a long time his pain and hunger , and the swearing and fighting going on in the building , kept him awake ; but at last his thoughts drifted away to far , romantic lands , and he fell asleep in the company of jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces , and had servants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 15]: And then , as usual , he dreamed that HE was a princeling himself .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 67]: All night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him ; he moved among great lords and ladies , in a blaze of light , breathing perfumes , drinking in delicious music , and answering the reverent obeisances of the glittering throng as it parted to make way for him , with here a smile , and there a nod of his princely head .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 34]: And when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness about him , his dream had had its usual effect -- it had intensified the sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 10]: Then came bitterness , and heart-break , and tears .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 3]: Chapter III .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 7]: Tom 's meeting with the Prince .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 25]: Tom got up hungry , and sauntered hungry away , but with his thoughts busy with the shadowy splendours of his night 's dreams .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 23]: He wandered here and there in the city , hardly noticing where he was going , or what was happening around him .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 21]: People jostled him , and some gave him rough speech ; but it was all lost on the musing boy .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 20]: By-and-by he found himself at Temple Bar , the farthest from home he had ever travelled in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 23]: He stopped and considered a moment , then fell into his imaginings again , and passed on outside the walls of London .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 82]: The Strand had ceased to be a country-road then , and regarded itself as a street , but by a strained construction ; for , though there was a tolerably compact row of houses on one side of it , there were only some scattered great buildings on the other , these being palaces of rich nobles , with ample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river -- grounds that are now closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 52]: Tom discovered Charing Village presently , and rested himself at the beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days ; then idled down a quiet , lovely road , past the great cardinal 's stately palace , toward a far more mighty and majestic palace beyond -- Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 50]: Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of masonry , the wide-spreading wings , the frowning bastions and turrets , the huge stone gateway , with its gilded bars and its magnificent array of colossal granite lions , and other the signs and symbols of English royalty .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 12]: Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last ?
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 10]: Here , indeed , was a king 's palace .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 22]: Might he not hope to see a prince now -- a prince of flesh and blood , if Heaven were willing ?
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 35]: At each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue -- that is to say , an erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms , clad from head to heel in shining steel armour .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 26]: At a respectful distance were many country folk , and people from the city , waiting for any chance glimpse of royalty that might offer .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 28]: Splendid carriages , with splendid people in them and splendid servants outside , were arriving and departing by several other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 51]: Poor little Tom , in his rags , approached , and was moving slowly and timidly past the sentinels , with a beating heart and a rising hope , when all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that almost made him shout for joy .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 69]: Within was a comely boy , tanned and brown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises , whose clothing was all of lovely silks and satins , shining with jewels ; at his hip a little jewelled sword and dagger ; dainty buskins on his feet , with red heels ; and on his head a jaunty crimson cap , with drooping plumes fastened with a great sparkling gem .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 13]: Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near -- his servants , without a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 36]: he was a prince -- a prince , a living prince , a real prince -- without the shadow of a question ; and the prayer of the pauper-boy 's heart was answered at last .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 20]: Tom 's breath came quick and short with excitement , and his eyes grew big with wonder and delight .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 30]: Everything gave way in his mind instantly to one desire : that was to get close to the prince , and have a good , devouring look at him .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 16]: Before he knew what he was about , he had his face against the gate-bars .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 27]: The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him rudely away , and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country gawks and London idlers .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 15]: The soldier said , -- `` Mind thy manners , thou young beggar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 44]: The crowd jeered and laughed ; but the young prince sprang to the gate with his face flushed , and his eyes flashing with indignation , and cried out , -- `` How dar ` st thou use a poor lad like that ?
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 15]: How dar ` st thou use the King my father 's meanest subject so ?
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 10]: Open the gates , and let him in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 13]: You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 19]: You should have heard them cheer , and shout , `` Long live the Prince of Wales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 39]: The soldiers presented arms with their halberds , opened the gates , and presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in , in his fluttering rags , to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 18]: Edward Tudor said -- `` Thou lookest tired and hungry : thou ` st been treated ill .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 5]: Come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 19]: Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to -- I do n't know what ; interfere , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 25]: But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture , and they stopped stock still where they were , like so many statues .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 17]: Edward took Tom to a rich apartment in the palace , which he called his cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 18]: By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before except in books .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 41]: The prince , with princely delicacy and breeding , sent away the servants , so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by their critical presence ; then he sat near by , and asked questions while Tom ate .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 9]: `` What is thy name , lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 14]: `` Tom Canty , an ' it please thee , sir . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 6]: 'T is an odd one .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 5]: Where dost live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 10]: `` In the city , please thee , sir .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 9]: Offal Court , out of Pudding Lane . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 4]: `` Offal Court !
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 7]: Truly 't is another odd one .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 4]: Hast parents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 39]: `` Parents have I , sir , and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently precious to me , God forgive me if it be offence to say it -- also twin sisters , Nan and Bet . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 16]: `` Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee , I take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 13]: `` Neither to any other is she , so please your worship .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 14]: She hath a wicked heart , and worketh evil all her days . ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 7]: `` Doth she mistreat thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 37]: `` There be times that she stayeth her hand , being asleep or overcome with drink ; but when she hath her judgment clear again , she maketh it up to me with goodly beatings . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 19]: A fierce look came into the little prince 's eyes , and he cried out -- `` What !
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 3]: Beatings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 13]: `` Oh , indeed , yes , please you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 3]: `` BEATINGS !
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 8]: -- and thou so frail and little .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 16]: Hark ye : before the night come , she shall hie her to the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 19]: The King my father '' -- `` In sooth , you forget , sir , her low degree .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 9]: The Tower is for the great alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 5]: `` True , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 7]: I had not thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 7]: I will consider of her punishment .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 8]: Is thy father kind to thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 10]: `` Not more than Gammer Canty , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 7]: `` Fathers be alike , mayhap .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 8]: Mine hath not a doll 's temper .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 26]: He smiteth with a heavy hand , yet spareth me : he spareth me not always with his tongue , though , sooth to say .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 8]: How doth thy mother use thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 18]: `` She is good , sir , and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 12]: And Nan and Bet are like to her in this . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 7]: `` How old be these ? ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 12]: `` Fifteen , an ' it please you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 65]: `` The Lady Elizabeth , my sister , is fourteen , and the Lady Jane Grey , my cousin , is of mine own age , and comely and gracious withal ; but my sister the Lady Mary , with her gloomy mien and -- Look you : do thy sisters forbid their servants to smile , lest the sin destroy their souls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 3]: `` They ?
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 13]: Oh , dost think , sir , that THEY have servants ? ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 21]: The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment , then said -- `` And prithee , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 7]: Who helpeth them undress at night ?
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 8]: Who attireth them when they rise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 5]: `` None , sir .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 19]: Would ` st have them take off their garment , and sleep without -- like the beasts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 4]: `` Their garment !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 6]: Have they but one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 14]: `` Ah , good your worship , what would they do with more ?
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 9]: Truly they have not two bodies each . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 9]: `` It is a quaint and marvellous thought !
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 10]: Thy pardon , I had not meant to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 27]: But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow , and that soon , too : my cofferer shall look to it .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 10]: No , thank me not ; 't is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 12]: Thou speakest well ; thou hast an easy grace in it .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 4]: Art learned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 12]: `` I know not if I am or not , sir .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 20]: The good priest that is called Father Andrew taught me , of his kindness , from his books . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 9]: `` Know ` st thou the Latin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 10]: `` But scantly , sir , I doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 13]: `` Learn it , lad : 't is hard only at first .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 26]: The Greek is harder ; but neither these nor any tongues else , I think , are hard to the Lady Elizabeth and my cousin .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 10]: Thou should ` st hear those damsels at it !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 8]: But tell me of thy Offal Court .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 8]: Hast thou a pleasant life there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 18]: `` In truth , yes , so please you , sir , save when one is hungry .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 13]: There be Punch-and-Judy shows , and monkeys -- oh such antic creatures !
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 5]: and so bravely dressed !
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 47]: -- and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all are slain , and 't is so fine to see , and costeth but a farthing -- albeit 't is main hard to get the farthing , please your worship . ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 6]: `` Tell me more . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 27]: `` We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel , like to the fashion of the ` prentices , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 6]: The prince 's eyes flashed .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 12]: Said he -- `` Marry , that would not I mislike .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 5]: Tell me more . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 18]: `` We strive in races , sir , to see who of us shall be fleetest . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 7]: `` That would I like also .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 4]: Speak on . ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 55]: `` In summer , sir , we wade and swim in the canals and in the river , and each doth duck his neighbour , and splatter him with water , and dive and shout and tumble and -- '' '' ` Twould be worth my father 's kingdom but to enjoy it once !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 5]: Prithee go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 47]: `` We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside ; we play in the sand , each covering his neighbour up ; and times we make mud pastry -- oh the lovely mud , it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world !
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 18]: -- we do fairly wallow in the mud , sir , saving your worship 's presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 13]: `` Oh , prithee , say no more , 't is glorious !
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 44]: If that I could but clothe me in raiment like to thine , and strip my feet , and revel in the mud once , just once , with none to rebuke me or forbid , meseemeth I could forego the crown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 31]: `` And if that I could clothe me once , sweet sir , as thou art clad -- just once -- '' `` Oho , would ` st like it ?
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 6]: Then so shall it be .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: Doff thy rags , and don these splendours , lad !
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 15]: It is a brief happiness , but will be not less keen for that .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 18]: We will have it while we may , and change again before any come to molest . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 35]: A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom 's fluttering odds and ends , and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 30]: The two went and stood side by side before a great mirror , and lo , a miracle : there did not seem to have been any change made !
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 17]: They stared at each other , then at the glass , then at each other again .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 16]: At last the puzzled princeling said -- `` What dost thou make of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 13]: `` Ah , good your worship , require me not to answer .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 15]: It is not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 9]: `` Then will _ I _ utter it .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 31]: Thou hast the same hair , the same eyes , the same voice and manner , the same form and stature , the same face and countenance that I bear .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 21]: Fared we forth naked , there is none could say which was you , and which the Prince of Wales .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 44]: And , now that I am clothed as thou wert clothed , it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier -- Hark ye , is not this a bruise upon your hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 23]: `` Yes ; but it is a slight thing , and your worship knoweth that the poor man-at-arms -- '' `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: It was a shameful thing and a cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 10]: cried the little prince , stamping his bare foot .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 14]: `` If the King -- Stir not a step till I come again !
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 6]: It is a command ! ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 46]: In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national importance that lay upon a table , and was out at the door and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags , with a hot face and glowing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 25]: As soon as he reached the great gate , he seized the bars , and tried to shake them , shouting -- `` Open !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 5]: Unbar the gates ! ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 65]: The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly ; and as the prince burst through the portal , half-smothered with royal wrath , the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the roadway , and said -- `` Take that , thou beggar 's spawn , for what thou got ` st me from his Highness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 6]: The crowd roared with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 43]: The prince picked himself out of the mud , and made fiercely at the sentry , shouting -- `` I am the Prince of Wales , my person is sacred ; and thou shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 20]: The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly -- `` I salute your gracious Highness . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 12]: Then angrily -- `` Be off , thou crazy rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 32]: Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince , and hustled him far down the road , hooting him , and shouting -- `` Way for his Royal Highness !
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 8]: Way for the Prince of Wales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 3]: Chapter IV .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 6]: The Prince 's troubles begin .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 23]: After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution , the little prince was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 61]: As long as he had been able to rage against the mob , and threaten it royally , and royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at , he was very entertaining ; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent , he was no longer of use to his tormentors , and they sought amusement elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 14]: He looked about him , now , but could not recognise the locality .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 14]: He was within the city of London -- that was all he knew .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 21]: He moved on , aimlessly , and in a little while the houses thinned , and the passers-by were infrequent .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 47]: He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then where Farringdon Street now is ; rested a few moments , then passed on , and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it , and a prodigious church .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 5]: He recognised this church .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 18]: Scaffoldings were about , everywhere , and swarms of workmen ; for it was undergoing elaborate repairs .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 19]: The prince took heart at once -- he felt that his troubles were at an end , now .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 45]: He said to himself , `` It is the ancient Grey Friars ' Church , which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children , and new-named it Christ 's Church .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 45]: Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so generously by them -- and the more that that son is himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day , or ever shall be . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 34]: He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running , jumping , playing at ball and leap-frog , and otherwise disporting themselves , and right noisily , too .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 137]: They were all dressed alike , and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and ` prentices -LCB- 1 -RCB- -- that is to say , each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer , which was not useful as a covering , it being of such scanty dimensions , neither was it ornamental ; from beneath it the hair fell , unparted , to the middle of the forehead , and was cropped straight around ; a clerical band at the neck ; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower ; full sleeves ; a broad red belt ; bright yellow stockings , gartered above the knees ; low shoes with large metal buckles .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 7]: It was a sufficiently ugly costume .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 36]: The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince , who said with native dignity -- `` Good lads , say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth speech with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 27]: A great shout went up at this , and one rude fellow said -- `` Marry , art thou his grace 's messenger , beggar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 23]: The prince 's face flushed with anger , and his ready hand flew to his hip , but there was nothing there .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 17]: There was a storm of laughter , and one boy said -- `` Didst mark that ?
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 15]: He fancied he had a sword -- belike he is the prince himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 6]: This sally brought more laughter .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 35]: Poor Edward drew himself up proudly and said -- `` I am the prince ; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my father 's bounty to use me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 10]: This was vastly enjoyed , as the laughter testified .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 32]: The youth who had first spoken , shouted to his comrades -- `` Ho , swine , slaves , pensioners of his grace 's princely father , where be your manners ?
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 22]: Down on your marrow bones , all of ye , and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags ! ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 19]: With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did mock homage to their prey .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 31]: The prince spurned the nearest boy with his foot , and said fiercely -- `` Take thou that , till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 15]: Ah , but this was not a joke -- this was going beyond fun .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 13]: The laughter ceased on the instant , and fury took its place .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 9]: A dozen shouted -- `` Hale him forth !
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 8]: To the horse-pond , to the horse-pond !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 5]: Where be the dogs ?
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 6]: Ho , there , Lion !
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 5]: ho , Fangs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 35]: Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before -- the sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands , and set upon and torn by dogs .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 23]: As night drew to a close that day , the prince found himself far down in the close-built portion of the city .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 19]: His body was bruised , his hands were bleeding , and his rags were all besmirched with mud .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 28]: He wandered on and on , and grew more and more bewildered , and so tired and faint he could hardly drag one foot after the other .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 19]: He had ceased to ask questions of anyone , since they brought him only insult instead of information .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 68]: He kept muttering to himself , `` Offal Court -- that is the name ; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop , then am I saved -- for his people will take me to the palace and prove that I am none of theirs , but the true prince , and I shall have mine own again . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 61]: And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those rude Christ 's Hospital boys , and he said , `` When I am king , they shall not have bread and shelter only , but also teachings out of books ; for a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved , and the heart .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 38]: I will keep this diligently in my remembrance , that this day 's lesson be not lost upon me , and my people suffer thereby ; for learning softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity . ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 28]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- The lights began to twinkle , it came on to rain , the wind rose , and a raw and gusty night set in .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 37]: The houseless prince , the homeless heir to the throne of England , still moved on , drifting deeper into the maze of squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed together .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 31]: Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said -- `` Out to this time of night again , and hast not brought a farthing home , I warrant me !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 31]: If it be so , an ' I do not break all the bones in thy lean body , then am I not John Canty , but some other . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 25]: The prince twisted himself loose , unconsciously brushed his profaned shoulder , and eagerly said -- `` Oh , art HIS father , truly ?
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 18]: Sweet heaven grant it be so -- then wilt thou fetch him away and restore me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 4]: `` HIS father ?
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 38]: I know not what thou mean ` st ; I but know I am THY father , as thou shalt soon have cause to -- '' `` Oh , jest not , palter not , delay not !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 15]: -- I am worn , I am wounded , I can bear no more .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 19]: Take me to the king my father , and he will make thee rich beyond thy wildest dreams .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 8]: Believe me , man , believe me !
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 11]: -- I speak no lie , but only the truth !
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 9]: -- put forth thy hand and save me !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 9]: I am indeed the Prince of Wales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 30]: The man stared down , stupefied , upon the lad , then shook his head and muttered -- `` Gone stark mad as any Tom o ' Bedlam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 49]: -- then collared him once more , and said with a coarse laugh and an oath , `` But mad or no mad , I and thy Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie , or I 'm no true man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 28]: With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away , and disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of human vermin .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 7]: Chapter V. Tom as a patrician .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 18]: Tom Canty , left alone in the prince 's cabinet , made good use of his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 35]: He turned himself this way and that before the great mirror , admiring his finery ; then walked away , imitating the prince 's high-bred carriage , and still observing results in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 62]: Next he drew the beautiful sword , and bowed , kissing the blade , and laying it across his breast , as he had seen a noble knight do , by way of salute to the lieutenant of the Tower , five or six weeks before , when delivering the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 54]: Tom played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh ; he examined the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room ; he tried each of the sumptuous chairs , and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 37]: He wondered if they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home , or if they would shake their heads , and say his overtaxed imagination had at last upset his reason .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 60]: At the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince was gone a long time ; then right away he began to feel lonely ; very soon he fell to listening and longing , and ceased to toy with the pretty things about him ; he grew uneasy , then restless , then distressed .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 23]: Suppose some one should come , and catch him in the prince 's clothes , and the prince not there to explain .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 15]: Might they not hang him at once , and inquire into his case afterward ?
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 12]: He had heard that the great were prompt about small matters .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 35]: His fear rose higher and higher ; and trembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber , resolved to fly and seek the prince , and , through him , protection and release .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 25]: Six gorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree , clothed like butterflies , sprang to their feet and bowed low before him .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 9]: He stepped quickly back and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 11]: He said -- `` Oh , they mock at me !
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 6]: They will go and tell .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 11]: why came I here to cast away my life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 21]: He walked up and down the floor , filled with nameless fears , listening , starting at every trifling sound .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 19]: Presently the door swung open , and a silken page said -- `` The Lady Jane Grey . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 16]: The door closed and a sweet young girl , richly clad , bounded toward him .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 23]: But she stopped suddenly , and said in a distressed voice -- `` Oh , what aileth thee , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 24]: Tom 's breath was nearly failing him ; but he made shift to stammer out -- `` Ah , be merciful , thou !
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 19]: In sooth I am no lord , but only poor Tom Canty of Offal Court in the city .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 25]: Prithee let me see the prince , and he will of his grace restore to me my rags , and let me hence unhurt .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 11]: Oh , be thou merciful , and save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 25]: By this time the boy was on his knees , and supplicating with his eyes and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 6]: The young girl seemed horror-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 13]: She cried out -- `` O my lord , on thy knees ?
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 6]: -- and to ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 30]: Then she fled away in fright ; and Tom , smitten with despair , sank down , murmuring -- `` There is no help , there is no hope .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 9]: Now will they come and take me . ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 16]: Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror , dreadful tidings were speeding through the palace .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 50]: The whisper -- for it was whispered always -- flew from menial to menial , from lord to lady , down all the long corridors , from story to story , from saloon to saloon , `` The prince hath gone mad , the prince hath gone mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 39]: Soon every saloon , every marble hall , had its groups of glittering lords and ladies , and other groups of dazzling lesser folk , talking earnestly together in whispers , and every face had in it dismay .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 22]: Presently a splendid official came marching by these groups , making solemn proclamation -- `` IN THE NAME OF THE KING !
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 25]: Let none list to this false and foolish matter , upon pain of death , nor discuss the same , nor carry it abroad .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 8]: In the name of the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 14]: The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been stricken dumb .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 15]: Soon there was a general buzz along the corridors , of `` The prince !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 7]: See , the prince comes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 29]: Poor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups , trying to bow in return , and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with bewildered and pathetic eyes .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 21]: Great nobles walked upon each side of him , making him lean upon them , and so steady his steps .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 9]: Behind him followed the court-physicians and some servants .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 19]: Presently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard the door close behind him .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 10]: Around him stood those who had come with him .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 29]: Before him , at a little distance , reclined a very large and very fat man , with a wide , pulpy face , and a stern expression .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 27]: His large head was very grey ; and his whiskers , which he wore only around his face , like a frame , were grey also .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 16]: His clothing was of rich stuff , but old , and slightly frayed in places .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 17]: One of his swollen legs had a pillow under it , and was wrapped in bandages .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 22]: There was silence now ; and there was no head there but was bent in reverence , except this man 's .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 9]: This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 25]: He said -- and his face grew gentle as he began to speak -- `` How now , my lord Edward , my prince ?
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 28]: Hast been minded to cozen me , the good King thy father , who loveth thee , and kindly useth thee , with a sorry jest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 59]: Poor Tom was listening , as well as his dazed faculties would let him , to the beginning of this speech ; but when the words ` me , the good King ' fell upon his ear , his face blanched , and he dropped as instantly upon his knees as if a shot had brought him there .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 13]: Lifting up his hands , he exclaimed -- `` Thou the KING ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: Then am I undone indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 8]: This speech seemed to stun the King .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 20]: His eyes wandered from face to face aimlessly , then rested , bewildered , upon the boy before him .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 33]: Then he said in a tone of deep disappointment -- `` Alack , I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth ; but I fear me 't is not so . ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 27]: He breathed a heavy sigh , and said in a gentle voice , `` Come to thy father , child : thou art not well . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 18]: Tom was assisted to his feet , and approached the Majesty of England , humble and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 44]: The King took the frightened face between his hands , and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile , as if seeking some grateful sign of returning reason there , then pressed the curly head against his breast , and patted it tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 13]: Presently he said -- `` Dost not know thy father , child ?
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 13]: Break not mine old heart ; say thou know ` st me .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 10]: Thou DOST know me , dost thou not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 16]: `` Yea : thou art my dread lord the King , whom God preserve ! ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 32]: `` True , true -- that is well -- be comforted , tremble not so ; there is none here would hurt thee ; there is none here but loves thee .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 16]: Thou art better now ; thy ill dream passeth -- is ' t not so ?
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 18]: Thou wilt not miscall thyself again , as they say thou didst a little while agone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 55]: `` I pray thee of thy grace believe me , I did but speak the truth , most dread lord ; for I am the meanest among thy subjects , being a pauper born , and 't is by a sore mischance and accident I am here , albeit I was therein nothing blameful .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 17]: I am but young to die , and thou canst save me with one little word .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 7]: Oh speak it , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 3]: `` Die ?
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 22]: Talk not so , sweet prince -- peace , peace , to thy troubled heart -- thou shalt not die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 30]: Tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry -- `` God requite thy mercy , O my King , and save thee long to bless thy land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 26]: Then springing up , he turned a joyful face toward the two lords in waiting , and exclaimed , `` Thou heard ` st it !
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 13]: I am not to die : the King hath said it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 18]: There was no movement , save that all bowed with grave respect ; but no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 23]: He hesitated , a little confused , then turned timidly toward the King , saying , `` I may go now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 3]: `` Go ?
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 6]: Surely , if thou desirest .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 8]: But why not tarry yet a little ?
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 7]: Whither would ` st go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 80]: Tom dropped his eyes , and answered humbly -- `` Peradventure I mistook ; but I did think me free , and so was I moved to seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery , yet which harboureth my mother and my sisters , and so is home to me ; whereas these pomps and splendours whereunto I am not used -- oh , please you , sir , to let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 19]: The King was silent and thoughtful a while , and his face betrayed a growing distress and uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 33]: Presently he said , with something of hope in his voice -- `` Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain , and hath his wits unmarred as toucheth other matter .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 7]: God send it may be so !
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 6]: We will make trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 19]: Then he asked Tom a question in Latin , and Tom answered him lamely in the same tongue .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 9]: The lords and doctors manifested their gratification also .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 28]: The King said -- '' 'T was not according to his schooling and ability , but showeth that his mind is but diseased , not stricken fatally .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 7]: How say you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 26]: The physician addressed bowed low , and replied -- `` It jumpeth with my own conviction , sire , that thou hast divined aright . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 36]: The King looked pleased with this encouragement , coming as it did from so excellent authority , and continued with good heart -- `` Now mark ye all : we will try him further . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 9]: He put a question to Tom in French .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 35]: Tom stood silent a moment , embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him , then said diffidently -- `` I have no knowledge of this tongue , so please your majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 8]: The King fell back upon his couch .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 29]: The attendants flew to his assistance ; but he put them aside , and said -- `` Trouble me not -- it is nothing but a scurvy faintness .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 3]: Raise me !
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 6]: There , 't is sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 23]: Come hither , child ; there , rest thy poor troubled head upon thy father 's heart , and be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 14]: Thou ` lt soon be well : 't is but a passing fantasy .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 12]: Fear thou not ; thou ` lt soon be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 22]: Then he turned toward the company : his gentle manner changed , and baleful lightnings began to play from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 8]: He said -- `` List ye all !
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 12]: This my son is mad ; but it is not permanent .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 12]: Over-study hath done this , and somewhat too much of confinement .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 7]: Away with his books and teachers !
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 5]: see ye to it .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 19]: Pleasure him with sports , beguile him in wholesome ways , so that his health come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 39]: He raised himself higher still , and went on with energy , `` He is mad ; but he is my son , and England 's heir ; and , mad or sane , still shall he reign !
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 31]: And hear ye further , and proclaim it : whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh against the peace and order of these realms , and shall to the gallows !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 25]: ... Give me to drink -- I burn : this sorrow sappeth my strength ... There , take away the cup ... Support me .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 6]: There , that is well .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 5]: Mad , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 22]: Were he a thousand times mad , yet is he Prince of Wales , and I the King will confirm it .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 17]: This very morrow shall he be installed in his princely dignity in due and ancient form .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: Take instant order for it , my lord Hertford . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 32]: One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch , and said -- `` The King 's majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England lieth attainted in the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 12]: It were not meet that one attainted -- '' `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 9]: Insult not mine ears with his hated name .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 8]: Is this man to live for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 9]: Am I to be baulked of my will ?
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 28]: Is the prince to tarry uninstalled , because , forsooth , the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours ?
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: No , by the splendour of God !
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 24]: Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk 's doom before the sun rise again , else shall they answer for it grievously ! ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 26]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- Lord Hertford said -- `` The King 's will is law ; '' and , rising , returned to his former place .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 23]: Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King 's face , and he said -- `` Kiss me , my prince .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 6]: There ... what fearest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 8]: Am I not thy loving father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 22]: `` Thou art good to me that am unworthy , O mighty and gracious lord : that in truth I know .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 32]: But -- but -- it grieveth me to think of him that is to die , and -- '' `` Ah , 't is like thee , 't is like thee !
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 26]: I know thy heart is still the same , even though thy mind hath suffered hurt , for thou wert ever of a gentle spirit .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 27]: But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours : I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great office .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 16]: Comfort thee , my prince : trouble not thy poor head with this matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 14]: `` But is it not I that speed him hence , my liege ?
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 12]: How long might he not live , but for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 15]: `` Take no thought of him , my prince : he is not worthy .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 19]: Kiss me once again , and go to thy trifles and amusements ; for my malady distresseth me .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 8]: I am aweary , and would rest .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 19]: Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy people , and come again when my body is refreshed . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 31]: Tom , heavy-hearted , was conducted from the presence , for this last sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would be set free .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 20]: Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming , `` The prince , the prince comes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 60]: His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering files of bowing courtiers ; for he recognised that he was indeed a captive now , and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage , a forlorn and friendless prince , except God in his mercy take pity on him and set him free .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 36]: And , turn where he would , he seemed to see floating in the air the severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk , the eyes fixed on him reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 15]: His old dreams had been so pleasant ; but this reality was so dreary !
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 3]: Chapter VI .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 4]: Tom receives instructions .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 40]: Tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite , and made to sit down -- a thing which he was loth to do , since there were elderly men and men of high degree about him .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 22]: He begged them to be seated also , but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them , and remained standing .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 40]: He would have insisted , but his ` uncle ' the Earl of Hertford whispered in his ear -- `` Prithee , insist not , my lord ; it is not meet that they sit in thy presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 33]: The Lord St. John was announced , and after making obeisance to Tom , he said -- `` I come upon the King 's errand , concerning a matter which requireth privacy .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 23]: Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend you here , save my lord the Earl of Hertford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 33]: Observing that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed , Hertford whispered him to make a sign with his hand , and not trouble himself to speak unless he chose .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 55]: When the waiting gentlemen had retired , Lord St. John said -- `` His majesty commandeth , that for due and weighty reasons of state , the prince 's grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his power , till it be passed and he be as he was before .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 206]: To wit , that he shall deny to none that he is the true prince , and heir to England 's greatness ; that he shall uphold his princely dignity , and shall receive , without word or sign of protest , that reverence and observance which unto it do appertain of right and ancient usage ; that he shall cease to speak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured out of the unwholesome imaginings of o'er-wrought fancy ; that he shall strive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which he was wont to know -- and where he faileth he shall hold his peace , neither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath forgot ; that upon occasions of state , whensoever any matter shall perplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should make , he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on , but take advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford , or my humble self , which are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at call , till this commandment be dissolved .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 38]: Thus saith the King 's majesty , who sendeth greeting to your royal highness , and prayeth that God will of His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy keeping . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 10]: The Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 11]: Tom replied resignedly -- `` The King hath said it .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 25]: None may palter with the King 's command , or fit it to his ease , where it doth chafe , with deft evasions .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 7]: The King shall be obeyed . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 47]: Lord Hertford said -- `` Touching the King 's majesty 's ordainment concerning books and such like serious matters , it may peradventure please your highness to ease your time with lightsome entertainment , lest you go wearied to the banquet and suffer harm thereby . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 24]: Tom 's face showed inquiring surprise ; and a blush followed when he saw Lord St. John 's eyes bent sorrowfully upon him .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 42]: His lordship said -- `` Thy memory still wrongeth thee , and thou hast shown surprise -- but suffer it not to trouble thee , for 't is a matter that will not bide , but depart with thy mending malady .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 28]: My Lord of Hertford speaketh of the city 's banquet which the King 's majesty did promise , some two months flown , your highness should attend .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 6]: Thou recallest it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 25]: `` It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me , '' said Tom , in a hesitating voice ; and blushed again .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 14]: At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 15]: The two lords exchanged significant glances , and Hertford stepped quickly toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 52]: As the young girls passed him , he said in a low voice -- `` I pray ye , ladies , seem not to observe his humours , nor show surprise when his memory doth lapse -- it will grieve you to note how it doth stick at every trifle . ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 26]: Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom 's ear -- `` Please you , sir , keep diligently in mind his majesty 's desire .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 11]: Remember all thou canst -- SEEM to remember all else .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 33]: Let them not perceive that thou art much changed from thy wont , for thou knowest how tenderly thy old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how ` twould grieve them .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 9]: Art willing , sir , that I remain ?
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: -- and thine uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 39]: Tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word , for he was already learning , and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself as best he might , according to the King 's command .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 19]: In spite of every precaution , the conversation among the young people became a little embarrassing at times .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 57]: More than once , in truth , Tom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his tremendous part ; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him , or a word from one or the other of the vigilant lords , thrown in apparently by chance , had the same happy effect .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 32]: Once the little Lady Jane turned to Tom and dismayed him with this question , -- `` Hast paid thy duty to the Queen 's majesty to-day , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 76]: Tom hesitated , looked distressed , and was about to stammer out something at hazard , when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him with the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate difficulties and to be ready for them -- `` He hath indeed , madam , and she did greatly hearten him , as touching his majesty 's condition ; is it not so , your highness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 18]: Tom mumbled something that stood for assent , but felt that he was getting upon dangerous ground .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 32]: Somewhat later it was mentioned that Tom was to study no more at present , whereupon her little ladyship exclaimed -- '' 'T is a pity , 't is a pity !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 5]: Thou wert proceeding bravely .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 14]: But bide thy time in patience : it will not be for long .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 29]: Thou ` lt yet be graced with learning like thy father , and make thy tongue master of as many languages as his , good my prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 5]: `` My father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 10]: cried Tom , off his guard for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 51]: `` I trow he can not speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may tell his meaning ; and as for learning of any sort soever -- '' He looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 25]: He stopped , blushed , then continued low and sadly : `` Ah , my malady persecuteth me again , and my mind wandereth .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 10]: I meant the King 's grace no irreverence . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 37]: `` We know it , sir , '' said the Princess Elizabeth , taking her ` brother 's ' hand between her two palms , respectfully but caressingly ; `` trouble not thyself as to that .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 13]: The fault is none of thine , but thy distemper 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 39]: `` Thou ` rt a gentle comforter , sweet lady , '' said Tom , gratefully , `` and my heart moveth me to thank thee for ` t , an ' I may be so bold . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 14]: Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 47]: The Princess Elizabeth 's quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the target 's front that the shaft was overshot ; so she tranquilly delivered a return volley of sounding Greek on Tom 's behalf , and then straightway changed the talk to other matters .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 13]: Time wore on pleasantly , and likewise smoothly , on the whole .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 34]: Snags and sandbars grew less and less frequent , and Tom grew more and more at his ease , seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and overlooking his mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 72]: When it came out that the little ladies were to accompany him to the Lord Mayor 's banquet in the evening , his heart gave a bound of relief and delight , for he felt that he should not be friendless , now , among that multitude of strangers ; whereas , an hour earlier , the idea of their going with him would have been an insupportable terror to him .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 23]: Tom 's guardian angels , the two lords , had had less comfort in the interview than the other parties to it .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 32]: They felt much as if they were piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel ; they were on the alert constantly , and found their office no child 's play .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 63]: Wherefore , at last , when the ladies ' visit was drawing to a close and the Lord Guilford Dudley was announced , they not only felt that their charge had been sufficiently taxed for the present , but also that they themselves were not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their anxious voyage all over again .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 42]: So they respectfully advised Tom to excuse himself , which he was very glad to do , although a slight shade of disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane 's face when she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 17]: There was a pause now , a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 20]: He glanced at Lord Hertford , who gave him a sign -- but he failed to understand that also .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 13]: The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue with her usual easy grace .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 21]: She made reverence and said -- `` Have we leave of the prince 's grace my brother to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 48]: Tom said -- `` Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will , for the asking ; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor power lieth , than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence hence .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 12]: Give ye good den , and God be with ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 40]: Then he smiled inwardly at the thought , '' 'T is not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in my reading , and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered and gracious speech withal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 36]: When the illustrious maidens were gone , Tom turned wearily to his keepers and said -- `` May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner and rest me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 24]: Lord Hertford said -- `` So please your highness , it is for you to command , it is for us to obey .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 22]: That thou should ` st rest is indeed a needful thing , since thou must journey to the city presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 22]: He touched a bell , and a page appeared , who was ordered to desire the presence of Sir William Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 13]: This gentleman came straightway , and conducted Tom to an inner apartment .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 36]: Tom 's first movement there was to reach for a cup of water ; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it , dropped upon one knee , and offered it to him on a golden salver .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 38]: Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins , timidly asking leave with his eye , but another silk-and-velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 49]: He made two or three further efforts to help himself , but being promptly forestalled each time , he finally gave up , with a sigh of resignation and a murmured `` Beshrew me , but I marvel they do not require to breathe for me also ! ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 39]: Slippered , and wrapped in a sumptuous robe , he laid himself down at last to rest , but not to sleep , for his head was too full of thoughts and the room too full of people .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 34]: He could not dismiss the former , so they stayed ; he did not know enough to dismiss the latter , so they stayed also , to his vast regret -- and theirs .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 11]: Tom 's departure had left his two noble guardians alone .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 28]: They mused a while , with much head-shaking and walking the floor , then Lord St. John said -- `` Plainly , what dost thou think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 7]: `` Plainly , then , this .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 22]: The King is near his end ; my nephew is mad -- mad will mount the throne , and mad remain .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 11]: God protect England , since she will need it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 8]: `` Verily it promiseth so , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 21]: But ... have you no misgivings as to ... as to ... '' The speaker hesitated , and finally stopped .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 10]: He evidently felt that he was upon delicate ground .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 32]: Lord Hertford stopped before him , looked into his face with a clear , frank eye , and said -- `` Speak on -- there is none to hear but me .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 6]: Misgivings as to what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 27]: `` I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind , and thou so near to him in blood , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 22]: But craving pardon if I do offend , seemeth it not strange that madness could so change his port and manner ?
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 31]: -- not but that his port and speech are princely still , but that they DIFFER , in one unweighty trifle or another , from what his custom was aforetime .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 47]: Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his father 's very lineaments ; the customs and observances that are his due from such as be about him ; and , leaving him his Latin , strip him of his Greek and French ?
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 20]: My lord , be not offended , but ease my mind of its disquiet and receive my grateful thanks .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 26]: It haunteth me , his saying he was not the prince , and so -- '' `` Peace , my lord , thou utterest treason !
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 7]: Hast forgot the King 's command ?
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 13]: Remember I am party to thy crime if I but listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 20]: St. John paled , and hastened to say -- `` I was in fault , I do confess it .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 25]: Betray me not , grant me this grace out of thy courtesy , and I will neither think nor speak of this thing more .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 14]: Deal not hardly with me , sir , else am I ruined . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 8]: `` I am content , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 24]: So thou offend not again , here or in the ears of others , it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 9]: But thou need ` st not have misgivings .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 25]: He is my sister 's son ; are not his voice , his face , his form , familiar to me from his cradle ?
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 16]: Madness can do all the odd conflicting things thou seest in him , and more .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 80]: Dost not recall how that the old Baron Marley , being mad , forgot the favour of his own countenance that he had known for sixty years , and held it was another 's ; nay , even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene , and that his head was made of Spanish glass ; and , sooth to say , he suffered none to touch it , lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it ?
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 9]: Give thy misgivings easement , good my lord .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 38]: This is the very prince -- I know him well -- and soon will be thy king ; it may advantage thee to bear this in mind , and more dwell upon it than the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 57]: After some further talk , in which the Lord St. John covered up his mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was thoroughly grounded now , and could not be assailed by doubts again , the Lord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper , and sat down to keep watch and ward alone .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 20]: He was soon deep in meditation , and evidently the longer he thought , the more he was bothered .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 10]: By-and-by he began to pace the floor and mutter .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 9]: `` Tush , he MUST be the prince !
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 24]: Will any be in all the land maintain there can be two , not of one blood and birth , so marvellously twinned ?
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 24]: And even were it so , ` twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should cast the one into the other 's place .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: Nay , 't is folly , folly , folly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 26]: Presently he said -- `` Now were he impostor and called himself prince , look you THAT would be natural ; that would be reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 34]: But lived ever an impostor yet , who , being called prince by the king , prince by the court , prince by all , DENIED his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation ?
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 2]: NO !
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 9]: By the soul of St. Swithin , no !
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 10]: This is the true prince , gone mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 3]: Chapter VII .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: Tom 's first royal dinner .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 18]: Somewhat after one in the afternoon , Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal of being dressed for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 23]: He found himself as finely clothed as before , but everything different , everything changed , from his ruff to his stockings .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 23]: He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious and ornate apartment , where a table was already set for one .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 26]: Its furniture was all of massy gold , and beautified with designs which well-nigh made it priceless , since they were the work of Benvenuto .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 8]: The room was half-filled with noble servitors .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 60]: A chaplain said grace , and Tom was about to fall to , for hunger had long been constitutional with him , but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley , who fastened a napkin about his neck ; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince of Wales was hereditary in this nobleman 's family .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 17]: Tom 's cupbearer was present , and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 30]: The Taster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also , prepared to taste any suspicious dish upon requirement , and run the risk of being poisoned .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 49]: He was only an ornamental appendage at this time , and was seldom called upon to exercise his function ; but there had been times , not many generations past , when the office of taster had its perils , and was not a grandeur to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 22]: Why they did not use a dog or a plumber seems strange ; but all the ways of royalty are strange .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 28]: My Lord d'Arcy , First Groom of the Chamber , was there , to do goodness knows what ; but there he was -- let that suffice .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 35]: The Lord Chief Butler was there , and stood behind Tom 's chair , overseeing the solemnities , under command of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook , who stood near .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 37]: Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these ; but they were not all in that room , of course , nor the quarter of them ; neither was Tom aware yet that they existed .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 36]: All those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head , and to be careful to show no surprise at his vagaries .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 25]: These ` vagaries ' were soon on exhibition before them ; but they only moved their compassion and their sorrow , not their mirth .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 15]: It was a heavy affliction to them to see the beloved prince so stricken .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 22]: Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly ; but no one smiled at it , or even seemed to observe it .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 43]: He inspected his napkin curiously , and with deep interest , for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric , then said with simplicity -- `` Prithee , take it away , lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 19]: The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner , and without word or protest of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 49]: Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest , and asked what they were , and if they were to be eaten ; for it was only recently that men had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing them as luxuries from Holland .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 16]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- His question was answered with grave respect , and no surprise manifested .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: When he had finished his dessert , he filled his pockets with nuts ; but nobody appeared to be aware of it , or disturbed by it .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 51]: But the next moment he was himself disturbed by it , and showed discomposure ; for this was the only service he had been permitted to do with his own hands during the meal , and he did not doubt that he had done a most improper and unprincely thing .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 23]: At that moment the muscles of his nose began to twitch , and the end of that organ to lift and wrinkle .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 12]: This continued , and Tom began to evince a growing distress .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 23]: He looked appealingly , first at one and then another of the lords about him , and tears came into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 16]: They sprang forward with dismay in their faces , and begged to know his trouble .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 17]: Tom said with genuine anguish -- `` I crave your indulgence : my nose itcheth cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 10]: What is the custom and usage in this emergence ?
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 18]: Prithee , speed , for 't is but a little time that I can bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 21]: None smiled ; but all were sore perplexed , and looked one to the other in deep tribulation for counsel .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 22]: But behold , here was a dead wall , and nothing in English history to tell how to get over it .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 32]: The Master of Ceremonies was not present : there was no one who felt safe to venture upon this uncharted sea , or risk the attempt to solve this solemn problem .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 6]: there was no Hereditary Scratcher .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 17]: Meantime the tears had overflowed their banks , and begun to trickle down Tom 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 12]: His twitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 40]: At last nature broke down the barriers of etiquette : Tom lifted up an inward prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong , and brought relief to the burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 48]: His meal being ended , a lord came and held before him a broad , shallow , golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it , to cleanse his mouth and fingers with ; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin for his use .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 24]: Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two , then raised it to his lips , and gravely took a draught .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 35]: Then he returned it to the waiting lord , and said -- `` Nay , it likes me not , my lord : it hath a pretty flavour , but it wanteth strength . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 26]: This new eccentricity of the prince 's ruined mind made all the hearts about him ache ; but the sad sight moved none to merriment .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 45]: Tom 's next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair , and with uplifted hands , and closed , uplifted eyes , was in the act of beginning the blessing .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 14]: Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a thing unusual .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 24]: By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private cabinet , and left there alone to his own devices .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 30]: Hanging upon hooks in the oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel armour , covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in gold .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 18]: This martial panoply belonged to the true prince -- a recent present from Madam Parr the Queen .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 116]: Tom put on the greaves , the gauntlets , the plumed helmet , and such other pieces as he could don without assistance , and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the matter , but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from dinner , and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye him , and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services ; so he restored the pretty things to their several places , and soon was cracking nuts , and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time since God for his sins had made him a prince .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 28]: When the nuts were all gone , he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet , among them one about the etiquette of the English court .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 5]: This was a prize .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 17]: He lay down upon a sumptuous divan , and proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 9]: Let us leave him there for the present .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 3]: Chapter VIII .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 6]: The question of the Seal .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 6]: About five o'clock Henry VIII .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 19]: awoke out of an unrefreshing nap , and muttered to himself , `` Troublous dreams , troublous dreams !
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 21]: Mine end is now at hand : so say these warnings , and my failing pulses do confirm it . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 26]: Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye , and he muttered , `` Yet will not I die till HE go before . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 24]: His attendants perceiving that he was awake , one of them asked his pleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor , who was waiting without .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 8]: `` Admit him , admit him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 5]: exclaimed the King eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 74]: The Lord Chancellor entered , and knelt by the King 's couch , saying -- `` I have given order , and , according to the King 's command , the peers of the realm , in their robes , do now stand at the bar of the House , where , having confirmed the Duke of Norfolk 's doom , they humbly wait his majesty 's further pleasure in the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 11]: The King 's face lit up with a fierce joy .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 8]: Said he -- `` Lift me up !
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 58]: In mine own person will I go before my Parliament , and with mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of -- '' His voice failed ; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks ; and the attendants eased him back upon his pillows , and hurriedly assisted him with restoratives .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 17]: Presently he said sorrowfully -- `` Alack , how have I longed for this sweet hour !
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 18]: and lo , too late it cometh , and I am robbed of this so coveted chance .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 7]: But speed ye , speed ye !
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 13]: let others do this happy office sith 't is denied to me .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 24]: I put my Great Seal in commission : choose thou the lords that shall compose it , and get ye to your work .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 5]: Speed ye , man !
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 20]: Before the sun shall rise and set again , bring me his head that I may see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 13]: `` According to the King 's command , so shall it be .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 27]: Will ' t please your majesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me , so that I may forth upon the business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 4]: `` The Seal ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: Who keepeth the Seal but thou ? ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 40]: `` Please your majesty , you did take it from me two days since , saying it should no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon the Duke of Norfolk 's warrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 19]: `` Why , so in sooth I did : I do remember ... What did I with it ?
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 56]: ... I am very feeble ... So oft these days doth my memory play the traitor with me ... 'T is strange , strange -- '' The King dropped into inarticulate mumblings , shaking his grey head weakly from time to time , and gropingly trying to recollect what he had done with the Seal .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 63]: At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and offer information -- `` Sire , if that I may be so bold , here be several that do remember with me how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the Prince of Wales to keep against the day that -- '' `` True , most true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 4]: interrupted the King .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 4]: `` Fetch it !
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 6]: Go : time flieth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 19]: Lord Hertford flew to Tom , but returned to the King before very long , troubled and empty-handed .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 53]: He delivered himself to this effect -- `` It grieveth me , my lord the King , to bear so heavy and unwelcome tidings ; but it is the will of God that the prince 's affliction abideth still , and he can not recall to mind that he received the Seal .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 53]: So came I quickly to report , thinking it were waste of precious time , and little worth withal , that any should attempt to search the long array of chambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high -- '' A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 25]: After a little while his majesty said , with a deep sadness in his tone -- `` Trouble him no more , poor child .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 42]: The hand of God lieth heavy upon him , and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him , and sorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders , and so bring him peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: He closed his eyes , fell to mumbling , and presently was silent .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 23]: After a time he opened his eyes again , and gazed vacantly around until his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 14]: Instantly his face flushed with wrath -- `` What , thou here yet !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 34]: By the glory of God , an ' thou gettest not about that traitor 's business , thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 15]: The trembling Chancellor answered -- `` Good your Majesty , I cry you mercy !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 8]: I but waited for the Seal . ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 8]: `` Man , hast lost thy wits ?
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 18]: The small Seal which aforetime I was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 15]: And , since the Great Seal hath flown away , shall not it suffice ?
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 5]: Hast lost thy wits ?
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 2]: Begone !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 15]: And hark ye -- come no more till thou do bring his head . ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 53]: The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous vicinity ; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament , and appointing the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of England , the luckless Duke of Norfolk .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 6]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- Chapter IX .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 4]: The river pageant .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 17]: At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was blazing with light .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 56]: The river itself , as far as the eye could reach citywards , was so thickly covered with watermen 's boats and with pleasure-barges , all fringed with coloured lanterns , and gently agitated by the waves , that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 63]: The grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water , spacious enough to mass the army of a German principality upon , was a picture to see , with its ranks of royal halberdiers in polished armour , and its troops of brilliantly costumed servitors flitting up and down , and to and fro , in the hurry of preparation .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 16]: Presently a command was given , and immediately all living creatures vanished from the steps .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 13]: Now the air was heavy with the hush of suspense and expectancy .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 40]: As far as one 's vision could carry , he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise up , and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches , and gaze toward the palace .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 14]: A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 15]: They were richly gilt , and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 78]: Some of them were decorated with banners and streamers ; some with cloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms ; others with silken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them , which shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes fluttered them ; others of yet higher pretensions , since they belonged to nobles in the prince 's immediate service , had their sides picturesquely fenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 9]: Each state barge was towed by a tender .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 24]: Besides the rowers , these tenders carried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate , and a company of musicians .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 18]: The advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great gateway , a troop of halberdiers .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 50]: ` They were dressed in striped hose of black and tawny , velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses , and doublets of murrey and blue cloth , embroidered on the front and back with the three feathers , the prince 's blazon , woven in gold .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 20]: Their halberd staves were covered with crimson velvet , fastened with gilt nails , and ornamented with gold tassels .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 27]: Filing off on the right and left , they formed two long lines , extending from the gateway of the palace to the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 25]: A thick rayed cloth or carpet was then unfolded , and laid down between them by attendants in the gold-and-crimson liveries of the prince .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 11]: This done , a flourish of trumpets resounded from within .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 28]: A lively prelude arose from the musicians on the water ; and two ushers with white wands marched with a slow and stately pace from the portal .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 131]: They were followed by an officer bearing the civic mace , after whom came another carrying the city 's sword ; then several sergeants of the city guard , in their full accoutrements , and with badges on their sleeves ; then the Garter King-at-arms , in his tabard ; then several Knights of the Bath , each with a white lace on his sleeve ; then their esquires ; then the judges , in their robes of scarlet and coifs ; then the Lord High Chancellor of England , in a robe of scarlet , open before , and purfled with minever ; then a deputation of aldermen , in their scarlet cloaks ; and then the heads of the different civic companies , in their robes of state .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 43]: Now came twelve French gentlemen , in splendid habiliments , consisting of pourpoints of white damask barred with gold , short mantles of crimson velvet lined with violet taffeta , and carnation coloured hauts-de-chausses , and took their way down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 34]: They were of the suite of the French ambassador , and were followed by twelve cavaliers of the suite of the Spanish ambassador , clothed in black velvet , unrelieved by any ornament .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 12]: Following these came several great English nobles with their attendants . '
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 53]: There was a flourish of trumpets within ; and the Prince 's uncle , the future great Duke of Somerset , emerged from the gateway , arrayed in a ` doublet of black cloth-of-gold , and a cloak of crimson satin flowered with gold , and ribanded with nets of silver . '
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 27]: He turned , doffed his plumed cap , bent his body in a low reverence , and began to step backward , bowing at each step .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 25]: A prolonged trumpet-blast followed , and a proclamation , `` Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward , Prince of Wales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 56]: High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of flame leapt forth with a thunder-crash ; the massed world on the river burst into a mighty roar of welcome ; and Tom Canty , the cause and hero of it all , stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 28]: He was ` magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin , with a front-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue , powdered with diamonds , and edged with ermine .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 36]: Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold , pounced with the triple-feathered crest , lined with blue satin , set with pearls and precious stones , and fastened with a clasp of brilliants .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 30]: About his neck hung the order of the Garter , and several princely foreign orders ; ' and wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 30]: O Tom Canty , born in a hovel , bred in the gutters of London , familiar with rags and dirt and misery , what a spectacle is this !
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 3]: Chapter X .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 6]: The Prince in the toils .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 22]: We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court , with a noisy and delighted mob at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 34]: There was but one person in it who offered a pleading word for the captive , and he was not heeded ; he was hardly even heard , so great was the turmoil .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 45]: The Prince continued to struggle for freedom , and to rage against the treatment he was suffering , until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him , and raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince 's head .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 23]: The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man 's arm , and the blow descended upon his own wrist .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 13]: Canty roared out -- `` Thou ` lt meddle , wilt thou ?
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 6]: Then have thy reward . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 41]: His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler 's head : there was a groan , a dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd , and the next moment it lay there in the dark alone .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 13]: The mob pressed on , their enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 19]: Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty 's abode , with the door closed against the outsiders .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 33]: By the vague light of a tallow candle which was thrust into a bottle , he made out the main features of the loathsome den , and also the occupants of it .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 32]: Two frowsy girls and a middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner , with the aspect of animals habituated to harsh usage , and expecting and dreading it now .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 15]: From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey hair and malignant eyes .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 10]: John Canty said to this one -- `` Tarry !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 6]: There 's fine mummeries here .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 20]: Mar them not till thou ` st enjoyed them : then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 5]: Stand forth , lad .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 14]: Now say thy foolery again , an thou ` st not forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 4]: Name thy name .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 5]: Who art thou ? ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 44]: The insulted blood mounted to the little prince 's cheek once more , and he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man 's face and said -- '' 'T is but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 24]: I tell thee now , as I told thee before , I am Edward , Prince of Wales , and none other . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 24]: The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag 's feet to the floor where she stood , and almost took her breath .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 25]: She stared at the Prince in stupid amazement , which so amused her ruffianly son , that he burst into a roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 13]: But the effect upon Tom Canty 's mother and sisters was different .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 16]: Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different sort .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 23]: They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces , exclaiming -- `` Oh , poor Tom , poor lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 28]: The mother fell on her knees before the Prince , put her hands upon his shoulders , and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 11]: Then she said -- `` Oh , my poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 17]: Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at last , and ta'en thy wit away .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 17]: why did ` st thou cleave to it when I so warned thee ` gainst it ?
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 10]: Thou ` st broke thy mother 's heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 27]: The Prince looked into her face , and said gently -- `` Thy son is well , and hath not lost his wits , good dame .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 25]: Comfort thee : let me to the palace where he is , and straightway will the King my father restore him to thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 6]: `` The King thy father !
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 5]: Oh , my child !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 21]: unsay these words that be freighted with death for thee , and ruin for all that be near to thee .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 6]: Shake of this gruesome dream .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 7]: Call back thy poor wandering memory .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 4]: Look upon me .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 14]: Am not I thy mother that bore thee , and loveth thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 32]: The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said -- `` God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart ; but truly have I never looked upon thy face before . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 29]: The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor , and , covering her eyes with her hands , gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 8]: `` Let the show go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 3]: shouted Canty .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 5]: `` What , Nan !
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 5]: -- what , Bet !
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 3]: mannerless wenches !
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 9]: will ye stand in the Prince 's presence ?
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 14]: Upon your knees , ye pauper scum , and do him reverence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 7]: He followed this with another horse-laugh .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 39]: The girls began to plead timidly for their brother ; and Nan said -- `` An thou wilt but let him to bed , father , rest and sleep will heal his madness : prithee , do . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 19]: `` Do , father , '' said Bet ; `` he is more worn than is his wont .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 21]: To-morrow will he be himself again , and will beg with diligence , and come not empty home again . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 15]: This remark sobered the father 's joviality , and brought his mind to business .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 47]: He turned angrily upon the Prince , and said -- `` The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole ; two pennies , mark ye -- all this money for a half-year 's rent , else out of this we go .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 12]: Show what thou ` st gathered with thy lazy begging . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 13]: The Prince said -- `` Offend me not with thy sordid matters .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 12]: I tell thee again I am the King 's son . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 46]: A sounding blow upon the Prince 's shoulder from Canty 's broad palm sent him staggering into goodwife Canty 's arms , who clasped him to her breast , and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by interposing her own person .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 19]: The frightened girls retreated to their corner ; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 20]: The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty , exclaiming -- `` Thou shalt not suffer for me , madam .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 11]: Let these swine do their will upon me alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 20]: This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about their work without waste of time .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 26]: Between them they belaboured the boy right soundly , and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for showing sympathy for the victim .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 15]: `` Now , '' said Canty , `` to bed , all of ye .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 7]: The entertainment has tired me . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 11]: The light was put out , and the family retired .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 73]: As soon as the snorings of the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep , the young girls crept to where the Prince lay , and covered him tenderly from the cold with straw and rags ; and their mother crept to him also , and stroked his hair , and cried over him , whispering broken words of comfort and compassion in his ear the while .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 31]: She had saved a morsel for him to eat , also ; but the boy 's pains had swept away all appetite -- at least for black and tasteless crusts .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 43]: He was touched by her brave and costly defence of him , and by her commiseration ; and he thanked her in very noble and princely words , and begged her to go to her sleep and try to forget her sorrows .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 19]: And he added that the King his father would not let her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 36]: This return to his ` madness ' broke her heart anew , and she strained him to her breast again and again , and then went back , drowned in tears , to her bed .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 35]: As she lay thinking and mourning , the suggestion began to creep into her mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was lacking in Tom Canty , mad or sane .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 28]: She could not describe it , she could not tell just what it was , and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to detect it and perceive it .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 13]: What if the boy were really not her son , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 4]: Oh , absurd !
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 14]: She almost smiled at the idea , spite of her griefs and troubles .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 23]: No matter , she found that it was an idea that would not ` down , ' but persisted in haunting her .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 22]: It pursued her , it harassed her , it clung to her , and refused to be put away or ignored .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 48]: At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her until she should devise a test that should prove , clearly and without question , whether this lad was her son or not , and so banish these wearing and worrying doubts .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 29]: Ah , yes , this was plainly the right way out of the difficulty ; therefore she set her wits to work at once to contrive that test .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 12]: But it was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 39]: She turned over in her mind one promising test after another , but was obliged to relinquish them all -- none of them were absolutely sure , absolutely perfect ; and an imperfect one could not satisfy her .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 20]: Evidently she was racking her head in vain -- it seemed manifest that she must give the matter up .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 28]: While this depressing thought was passing through her mind , her ear caught the regular breathing of the boy , and she knew he had fallen asleep .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 26]: And while she listened , the measured breathing was broken by a soft , startled cry , such as one utters in a troubled dream .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 16]: This chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests combined .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 34]: She at once set herself feverishly , but noiselessly , to work to relight her candle , muttering to herself , `` Had I but seen him THEN , I should have known !
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 90]: Since that day , when he was little , that the powder burst in his face , he hath never been startled of a sudden out of his dreams or out of his thinkings , but he hath cast his hand before his eyes , even as he did that day ; and not as others would do it , with the palm inward , but always with the palm turned outward -- I have seen it a hundred times , and it hath never varied nor ever failed .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 10]: Yes , I shall soon know , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 23]: By this time she had crept to the slumbering boy 's side , with the candle , shaded , in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 34]: She bent heedfully and warily over him , scarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement , and suddenly flashed the light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 27]: The sleeper 's eyes sprang wide open , and he cast a startled stare about him -- but he made no special movement with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 46]: The poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief ; but she contrived to hide her emotions , and to soothe the boy to sleep again ; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon the disastrous result of her experiment .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 24]: She tried to believe that her Tom 's madness had banished this habitual gesture of his ; but she could not do it .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 28]: `` No , '' she said , `` his HANDS are not mad ; they could not unlearn so old a habit in so brief a time .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 11]: Oh , this is a heavy day for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 113]: Still , hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before ; she could not bring herself to accept the verdict of the test ; she must try the thing again -- the failure must have been only an accident ; so she startled the boy out of his sleep a second and a third time , at intervals -- with the same result which had marked the first test ; then she dragged herself to bed , and fell sorrowfully asleep , saying , `` But I can not give him up -- oh no , I can not , I can not -- he MUST be my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 36]: The poor mother 's interruptions having ceased , and the Prince 's pains having gradually lost their power to disturb him , utter weariness at last sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 14]: Hour after hour slipped away , and still he slept like the dead .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 7]: Thus four or five hours passed .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 7]: Then his stupor began to lighten .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 17]: Presently , while half asleep and half awake , he murmured -- `` Sir William ! ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 11]: After a moment -- `` Ho , Sir William Herbert !
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 16]: Hie thee hither , and list to the strangest dream that ever ... Sir William !
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 3]: dost hear ?
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 16]: Man , I did think me changed to a pauper , and ... Ho there !
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 2]: Guards !
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 3]: Sir William !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 10]: is there no groom of the chamber in waiting ?
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 2]: Alack !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 13]: it shall go hard with -- '' `` What aileth thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 6]: asked a whisper near him .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 7]: `` Who art thou calling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 5]: `` Sir William Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 5]: Who art thou ? ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 10]: Who should I be , but thy sister Nan ?
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 8]: Oh , Tom , I had forgot !
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 25]: Thou ` rt mad yet -- poor lad , thou ` rt mad yet : would I had never woke to know it again !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 16]: But prithee master thy tongue , lest we be all beaten till we die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 38]: The startled Prince sprang partly up , but a sharp reminder from his stiffened bruises brought him to himself , and he sank back among his foul straw with a moan and the ejaculation -- `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 8]: it was no dream , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 70]: In a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished were upon him again , and he realised that he was no longer a petted prince in a palace , with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him , but a pauper , an outcast , clothed in rags , prisoner in a den fit only for beasts , and consorting with beggars and thieves .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 25]: In the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises and shoutings , apparently but a block or two away .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 24]: The next moment there were several sharp raps at the door ; John Canty ceased from snoring and said -- `` Who knocketh ?
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 5]: What wilt thou ? ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 19]: A voice answered -- `` Know ` st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 8]: Neither know I , nor care . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 10]: `` Belike thou ` lt change thy note eftsoons .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 14]: An thou would save thy neck , nothing but flight may stead thee .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 10]: The man is this moment delivering up the ghost .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 9]: 'T is the priest , Father Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 4]: `` God-a-mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 3]: exclaimed Canty .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 26]: He roused his family , and hoarsely commanded , `` Up with ye all and fly -- or bide where ye are and perish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 17]: Scarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and flying for their lives .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 41]: John Canty held the Prince by the wrist , and hurried him along the dark way , giving him this caution in a low voice -- `` Mind thy tongue , thou mad fool , and speak not our name .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 20]: I will choose me a new name , speedily , to throw the law 's dogs off the scent .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 9]: Mind thy tongue , I tell thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 62]: He growled these words to the rest of the family -- `` If it so chance that we be separated , let each make for London Bridge ; whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper 's shop on the bridge , let him tarry there till the others be come , then will we flee into Southwark together . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 42]: At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light ; and not only into light , but into the midst of a multitude of singing , dancing , and shouting people , massed together on the river frontage .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 86]: There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see , up and down the Thames ; London Bridge was illuminated ; Southwark Bridge likewise ; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of coloured lights ; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day ; everywhere were crowds of revellers ; all London seemed to be at large .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 19]: John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat ; but it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 24]: He and his tribe were swallowed up in that swarming hive of humanity , and hopelessly separated from each other in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 21]: We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe ; Canty still kept his grip upon him .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 14]: The Prince 's heart was beating high with hopes of escape , now .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 45]: A burly waterman , considerably exalted with liquor , found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough through the crowd ; he laid his great hand on Canty 's shoulder and said -- `` Nay , whither so fast , friend ?
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 19]: Dost canker thy soul with sordid business when all that be leal men and true make holiday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 29]: `` Mine affairs are mine own , they concern thee not , '' answered Canty , roughly ; `` take away thy hand and let me pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 39]: `` Sith that is thy humour , thou ` lt NOT pass , till thou ` st drunk to the Prince of Wales , I tell thee that , '' said the waterman , barring the way resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 16]: `` Give me the cup , then , and make speed , make speed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 8]: Other revellers were interested by this time .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 11]: They cried out -- `` The loving-cup , the loving-cup !
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 18]: make the sour knave drink the loving-cup , else will we feed him to the fishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 68]: So a huge loving-cup was brought ; the waterman , grasping it by one of its handles , and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary napkin , presented it in due and ancient form to Canty , who had to grasp the opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the other , according to ancient custom .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 15]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- This left the Prince hand-free for a second , of course .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 17]: He wasted no time , but dived among the forest of legs about him and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 33]: In another moment he could not have been harder to find , under that tossing sea of life , if its billows had been the Atlantic 's and he a lost sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 22]: He very soon realised this fact , and straightway busied himself about his own affairs without further thought of John Canty .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: He quickly realised another thing , too .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 19]: To wit , that a spurious Prince of Wales was being feasted by the city in his stead .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 24]: He easily concluded that the pauper lad , Tom Canty , had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous opportunity and become a usurper .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 25]: Therefore there was but one course to pursue -- find his way to the Guildhall , make himself known , and denounce the impostor .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 42]: He also made up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual preparation , and then be hanged , drawn and quartered , according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high treason .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 3]: Chapter XI .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 3]: At Guildhall .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 24]: The royal barge , attended by its gorgeous fleet , took its stately way down the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 86]: The air was laden with music ; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames ; the distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible bonfires ; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky , incrusted with sparkling lights , wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like jewelled lances thrust aloft ; as the fleet swept along , it was greeted from the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless flash and boom of artillery .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 24]: To Tom Canty , half buried in his silken cushions , these sounds and this spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 21]: To his little friends at his side , the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey , they were nothing .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 72]: Arrived at the Dowgate , the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook -LRB- whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under acres of buildings -RRB- to Bucklersbury , past houses and under bridges populous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted , and at last came to a halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard , in the centre of the ancient city of London .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 27]: Tom disembarked , and he and his gallant procession crossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and Basinghall Street to the Guildhall .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 62]: Tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord Mayor and the Fathers of the City , in their gold chains and scarlet robes of state , and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of the great hall , preceded by heralds making proclamation , and by the Mace and the City Sword .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 22]: The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom and his two small friends took their places behind their chairs .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 40]: At a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree were seated , with the magnates of the city ; the commoners took places at a multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 32]: From their lofty vantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog , the ancient guardians of the city , contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar to it in forgotten generations .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 44]: There was a bugle-blast and a proclamation , and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward wall , followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a royal baron of beef , smoking hot and ready for the knife .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 45]: After grace , Tom -LRB- being instructed -RRB- rose -- and the whole house with him -- and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess Elizabeth ; from her it passed to the Lady Jane , and then traversed the general assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 5]: So the banquet began .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 9]: By midnight the revelry was at its height .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 14]: Now came one of those picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 73]: A description of it is still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it : ` Space being made , presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after the Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold ; hats on their heads of crimson velvet , with great rolls of gold , girded with two swords , called scimitars , hanging by great bawdricks of gold .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 76]: Next came yet another baron and another earl , in two long gowns of yellow satin , traversed with white satin , and in every bend of white was a bend of crimson satin , after the fashion of Russia , with furred hats of gray on their heads ; either of them having an hatchet in their hands , and boots with pykes ' -LRB- points a foot long -RRB- , ` turned up .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 73]: And after them came a knight , then the Lord High Admiral , and with him five nobles , in doublets of crimson velvet , voyded low on the back and before to the cannell-bone , laced on the breasts with chains of silver ; and over that , short cloaks of crimson satin , and on their heads hats after the dancers ' fashion , with pheasants ' feathers in them .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 9]: These were appareled after the fashion of Prussia .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 24]: The torchbearers , which were about an hundred , were appareled in crimson satin and green , like Moors , their faces black .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 6]: Next came in a mommarye .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 29]: Then the minstrels , which were disguised , danced ; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also , that it was a pleasure to behold . '
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 69]: And while Tom , in his high seat , was gazing upon this ` wild ' dancing , lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented , the ragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and his wrongs , denouncing the impostor , and clamouring for admission at the gates of Guildhall !
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 20]: The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously , and pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 24]: Presently they began to taunt him and mock at him , purposely to goad him into a higher and still more entertaining fury .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 20]: Tears of mortification sprang to his eyes , but he stood his ground and defied the mob right royally .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 32]: Other taunts followed , added mockings stung him , and he exclaimed -- `` I tell ye again , you pack of unmannerly curs , I am the Prince of Wales !
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 40]: And all forlorn and friendless as I be , with none to give me word of grace or help me in my need , yet will not I be driven from my ground , but will maintain it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 27]: `` Though thou be prince or no prince , 't is all one , thou be ` st a gallant lad , and not friendless neither !
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 35]: Here stand I by thy side to prove it ; and mind I tell thee thou might ` st have a worser friend than Miles Hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 23]: Rest thy small jaw , my child ; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very native . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 18]: The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress , aspect , and bearing .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: He was tall , trim-built , muscular .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 73]: His doublet and trunks were of rich material , but faded and threadbare , and their gold-lace adornments were sadly tarnished ; his ruff was rumpled and damaged ; the plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and disreputable look ; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron sheath ; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of the camp .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 16]: The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an explosion of jeers and laughter .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 13]: Some cried , '' 'T is another prince in disguise ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 13]: ` Ware thy tongue , friend : belike he is dangerous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 12]: `` Marry , he looketh it -- mark his eye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 16]: `` Pluck the lad from him -- to the horse-pond wi ' the cub ! ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 43]: Instantly a hand was laid upon the Prince , under the impulse of this happy thought ; as instantly the stranger 's long sword was out and the meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 14]: The next moment a score of voices shouted , `` Kill the dog !
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 3]: Kill him !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 4]: Kill him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 29]: and the mob closed in on the warrior , who backed himself against a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a madman .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 26]: His victims sprawled this way and that , but the mob-tide poured over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with undiminished fury .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 28]: His moments seemed numbered , his destruction certain , when suddenly a trumpet-blast sounded , a voice shouted , `` Way for the King 's messenger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 28]: and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob , who fled out of harm 's reach as fast as their legs could carry them .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 22]: The bold stranger caught up the Prince in his arms , and was soon far away from danger and the multitude .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 6]: Return we within the Guildhall .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 21]: Suddenly , high above the jubilant roar and thunder of the revel , broke the clear peal of a bugle-note .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 37]: There was instant silence -- a deep hush ; then a single voice rose -- that of the messenger from the palace -- and began to pipe forth a proclamation , the whole multitude standing listening .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 16]: The closing words , solemnly pronounced , were -- `` The King is dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 61]: The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one accord ; remained so , in profound silence , a few moments ; then all sank upon their knees in a body , stretched out their hands toward Tom , and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building -- `` Long live the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 33]: Poor Tom 's dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle , and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him , a moment , then upon the Earl of Hertford .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 8]: A sudden purpose dawned in his face .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 25]: He said , in a low tone , at Lord Hertford 's ear -- `` Answer me truly , on thy faith and honour !
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 36]: Uttered I here a command , the which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter , would such commandment be obeyed , and none rise up to say me nay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 11]: `` None , my liege , in all these realms .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 9]: In thy person bides the majesty of England .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 11]: Thou art the king -- thy word is law . ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 39]: Tom responded , in a strong , earnest voice , and with great animation -- `` Then shall the king 's law be law of mercy , from this day , and never more be law of blood !
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 7]: Up from thy knees and away !
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 18]: To the Tower , and say the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 44]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and wide over the hall , and as Hertford hurried from the presence , another prodigious shout burst forth -- `` The reign of blood is ended !
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 9]: Long live Edward , King of England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 3]: Chapter XII .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 6]: The Prince and his deliverer .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 27]: As soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob , they struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 36]: Their way was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge ; then they ploughed into the multitude again , Hendon keeping a fast grip upon the Prince 's -- no , the King 's -- wrist .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 26]: The tremendous news was already abroad , and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once -- `` The King is dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 22]: The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little waif , and sent a shudder through his frame .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 35]: He realised the greatness of his loss , and was filled with a bitter grief ; for the grim tyrant who had been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 11]: The tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 39]: For an instant he felt himself the most forlorn , outcast , and forsaken of God 's creatures -- then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching thunders : `` Long live King Edward the Sixth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 18]: and this made his eyes kindle , and thrilled him with pride to his fingers ' ends .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 20]: `` Ah , '' he thought , `` how grand and strange it seems -- I AM KING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 13]: Our friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 60]: This structure , which had stood for six hundred years , and had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time , was a curious affair , for a closely packed rank of stores and shops , with family quarters overhead , stretched along both sides of it , from one bank of the river to the other .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 37]: The Bridge was a sort of town to itself ; it had its inn , its beer-houses , its bakeries , its haberdasheries , its food markets , its manufacturing industries , and even its church .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 28]: It looked upon the two neighbours which it linked together -- London and Southwark -- as being well enough as suburbs , but not otherwise particularly important .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 64]: It was a close corporation , so to speak ; it was a narrow town , of a single street a fifth of a mile long , its population was but a village population and everybody in it knew all his fellow-townsmen intimately , and had known their fathers and mothers before them -- and all their little family affairs into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 80]: It had its aristocracy , of course -- its fine old families of butchers , and bakers , and what-not , who had occupied the same old premises for five or six hundred years , and knew the great history of the Bridge from beginning to end , and all its strange legends ; and who always talked bridgy talk , and thought bridgy thoughts , and lied in a long , level , direct , substantial bridgy way .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 15]: It was just the sort of population to be narrow and ignorant and self-conceited .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 36]: Children were born on the Bridge , were reared there , grew to old age , and finally died without ever having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge alone .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 57]: Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and interminable procession which moved through its street night and day , with its confused roar of shouts and cries , its neighings and bellowing and bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp , was the one great thing in this world , and themselves somehow the proprietors of it .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 57]: And so they were , in effect -- at least they could exhibit it from their windows , and did -- for a consideration -- whenever a returning king or hero gave it a fleeting splendour , for there was no place like it for affording a long , straight , uninterrupted view of marching columns .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 15]: Men born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and inane elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 21]: History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at the age of seventy-one and retired to the country .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 31]: But he could only fret and toss in his bed ; he could not go to sleep , the deep stillness was so painful , so awful , so oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 52]: When he was worn out with it , at last , he fled back to his old home , a lean and haggard spectre , and fell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of the lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 42]: In the times of which we are writing , the Bridge furnished ` object lessons ' in English history for its children -- namely , the livid and decaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its gateways .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 4]: But we digress .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 12]: Hendon 's lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 25]: As he neared the door with his small friend , a rough voice said -- `` So , thou ` rt come at last !
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 37]: Thou ` lt not escape again , I warrant thee ; and if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat , thou ` lt not keep us waiting another time , mayhap . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 13]: -- and John Canty put out his hand to seize the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 16]: Miles Hendon stepped in the way and said -- `` Not too fast , friend .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 7]: Thou art needlessly rough , methinks .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 8]: What is the lad to thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 24]: `` If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others ' affairs , he is my son . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 6]: 'T is a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 7]: cried the little King , hotly .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 21]: `` Boldly said , and I believe thee , whether thy small headpiece be sound or cracked , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 41]: But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father or no , 't is all one , he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse , according to his threat , so thou prefer to bide with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 27]: `` I do , I do -- I know him not , I loathe him , and will die before I will go with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 15]: `` Then 't is settled , and there is nought more to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 10]: `` We will see , as to that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 41]: exclaimed John Canty , striding past Hendon to get at the boy ; `` by force shall he -- '' `` If thou do but touch him , thou animated offal , I will spit thee like a goose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 15]: said Hendon , barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword hilt .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 4]: Canty drew back .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 45]: `` Now mark ye , '' continued Hendon , `` I took this lad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled him , mayhap killed him ; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser fate ?
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 41]: -- for whether thou art his father or no -- and sooth to say , I think it is a lie -- a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life in such brute hands as thine .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 28]: So go thy ways , and set quick about it , for I like not much bandying of words , being not over-patient in my nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 19]: John Canty moved off , muttering threats and curses , and was swallowed from sight in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 23]: Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his room , with his charge , after ordering a meal to be sent thither .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 32]: It was a poor apartment , with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old furniture in it , and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 21]: The little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it , almost exhausted with hunger and fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 35]: He had been on his feet a good part of a day and a night -LRB- for it was now two or three o'clock in the morning -RRB- , and had eaten nothing meantime .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 23]: He murmured drowsily -- `` Prithee call me when the table is spread , '' and sank into a deep sleep immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 58]: A smile twinkled in Hendon 's eye , and he said to himself -- `` By the mass , the little beggar takes to one 's quarters and usurps one 's bed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them -- with never a by-your-leave or so-please-it-you , or anything of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 21]: In his diseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales , and bravely doth he keep up the character .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 14]: Poor little friendless rat , doubtless his mind has been disordered with ill-usage .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 29]: Well , I will be his friend ; I have saved him , and it draweth me strongly to him ; already I love the bold-tongued little rascal .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 14]: How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble and flung back his high defiance !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 24]: And what a comely , sweet and gentle face he hath , now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its griefs .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 56]: I will teach him ; I will cure his malady ; yea , I will be his elder brother , and care for him and watch over him ; and whoso would shame him or do him hurt may order his shroud , for though I be burnt for it he shall need it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 31]: He bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying interest , tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the tangled curls with his great brown hand .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 10]: A slight shiver passed over the boy 's form .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 28]: Hendon muttered -- `` See , now , how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill his body with deadly rheums .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 6]: Now what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 22]: ` twill wake him to take him up and put him within the bed , and he sorely needeth sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 44]: He looked about for extra covering , but finding none , doffed his doublet and wrapped the lad in it , saying , `` I am used to nipping air and scant apparel , 't is little I shall mind the cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 20]: -- then walked up and down the room , to keep his blood in motion , soliloquising as before .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 139]: `` His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales ; ` twill be odd to have a Prince of Wales still with us , now that he that WAS the prince is prince no more , but king -- for this poor mind is set upon the one fantasy , and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince and call itself the king ... If my father liveth still , after these seven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon , he will welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake ; so will my good elder brother , Arthur ; my other brother , Hugh -- but I will crack his crown an HE interfere , the fox-hearted , ill-conditioned animal !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: Yes , thither will we fare -- and straightway , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 36]: A servant entered with a smoking meal , disposed it upon a small deal table , placed the chairs , and took his departure , leaving such cheap lodgers as these to wait upon themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 61]: The door slammed after him , and the noise woke the boy , who sprang to a sitting posture , and shot a glad glance about him ; then a grieved look came into his face and he murmured to himself , with a deep sigh , `` Alack , it was but a dream , woe is me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 45]: Next he noticed Miles Hendon 's doublet -- glanced from that to Hendon , comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him , and said , gently -- `` Thou art good to me , yes , thou art very good to me .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 15]: Take it and put it on -- I shall not need it more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 18]: Then he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood there , waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 46]: Hendon said in a cheery voice -- `` We 'll have a right hearty sup and bite , now , for everything is savoury and smoking hot , and that and thy nap together will make thee a little man again , never fear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 34]: The boy made no answer , but bent a steady look , that was filled with grave surprise , and also somewhat touched with impatience , upon the tall knight of the sword .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 13]: Hendon was puzzled , and said -- `` What 's amiss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 10]: `` Good sir , I would wash me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 7]: `` Oh , is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 11]: Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou cravest .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 17]: Make thyself perfectly free here , and welcome , with all that are his belongings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: Still the boy stood , and moved not ; more , he tapped the floor once or twice with his small impatient foot .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 5]: Hendon was wholly perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 12]: Said he -- `` Bless us , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: `` Prithee pour the water , and make not so many words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 23]: Hendon , suppressing a horse-laugh , and saying to himself , `` By all the saints , but this is admirable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 32]: stepped briskly forward and did the small insolent 's bidding ; then stood by , in a sort of stupefaction , until the command , `` Come -- the towel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 5]: woke him sharply up .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 21]: He took up a towel , from under the boy 's nose , and handed it to him without comment .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 32]: He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash , and while he was at it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 32]: Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity , then drew back the other chair and was about to place himself at table , when the boy said , indignantly -- `` Forbear !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 10]: Wouldst sit in the presence of the King ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 8]: This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 19]: He muttered to himself , `` Lo , the poor thing 's madness is up with the time !
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 22]: It hath changed with the great change that is come to the realm , and now in fancy is he KING !
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 30]: Good lack , I must humour the conceit , too -- there is no other way -- faith , he would order me to the Tower , else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 36]: And pleased with this jest , he removed the chair from the table , took his stand behind the King , and proceeded to wait upon him in the courtliest way he was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 26]: While the King ate , the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little , and with his growing contentment came a desire to talk .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 19]: He said -- `` I think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon , if I heard thee aright ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 76]: `` Yes , Sire , '' Miles replied ; then observed to himself , `` If I MUST humour the poor lad 's madness , I must ` Sire ' him , I must ` Majesty ' him , I must not go by halves , I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the part I play , else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable and kindly cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 26]: The King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine , and said -- `` I would know thee -- tell me thy story .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 17]: Thou hast a gallant way with thee , and a noble -- art nobly born ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 14]: `` We are of the tail of the nobility , good your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 33]: My father is a baronet -- one of the smaller lords by knight service -LCB- 2 -RCB- -- Sir Richard Hendon of Hendon Hall , by Monk 's Holm in Kent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 8]: `` The name has escaped my memory .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 10]: Go on -- tell me thy story . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 22]: 'T is not much , your Majesty , yet perchance it may beguile a short half-hour for want of a better .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 17]: My father , Sir Richard , is very rich , and of a most generous nature .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 10]: My mother died whilst I was yet a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 41]: I have two brothers : Arthur , my elder , with a soul like to his father 's ; and Hugh , younger than I , a mean spirit , covetous , treacherous , vicious , underhanded -- a reptile .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 35]: Such was he from the cradle ; such was he ten years past , when I last saw him -- a ripe rascal at nineteen , I being twenty then , and Arthur twenty-two .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 47]: There is none other of us but the Lady Edith , my cousin -- she was sixteen then -- beautiful , gentle , good , the daughter of an earl , the last of her race , heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 6]: My father was her guardian .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 30]: I loved her and she loved me ; but she was betrothed to Arthur from the cradle , and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be broken .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 33]: Arthur loved another maid , and bade us be of good cheer and hold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give success to our several causes .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 38]: Hugh loved the Lady Edith 's fortune , though in truth he said it was herself he loved -- but then 't was his way , alway , to say the one thing and mean the other .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 19]: But he lost his arts upon the girl ; he could deceive my father , but none else .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 72]: My father loved him best of us all , and trusted and believed him ; for he was the youngest child , and others hated him -- these qualities being in all ages sufficient to win a parent 's dearest love ; and he had a smooth persuasive tongue , with an admirable gift of lying -- and these be qualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 61]: I was wild -- in troth I might go yet farther and say VERY wild , though 't was a wildness of an innocent sort , since it hurt none but me , brought shame to none , nor loss , nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness , or what might not beseem mine honourable degree .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 60]: `` Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account -- he seeing that our brother Arthur 's health was but indifferent , and hoping the worst might work him profit were I swept out of the path -- so -- but ` twere a long tale , good my liege , and little worth the telling .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 74]: Briefly , then , this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them crimes ; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine apartments -- conveyed thither by his own means -- and did convince my father by this , and suborned evidence of servants and other lying knaves , that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in rank defiance of his will .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 31]: `` Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier and a man of me , my father said , and teach me some degree of wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 52]: I fought out my long probation in the continental wars , tasting sumptuously of hard knocks , privation , and adventure ; but in my last battle I was taken captive , and during the seven years that have waxed and waned since then , a foreign dungeon hath harboured me .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 53]: Through wit and courage I won to the free air at last , and fled hither straight ; and am but just arrived , right poor in purse and raiment , and poorer still in knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall , its people and belongings .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 13]: So please you , sir , my meagre tale is told . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 8]: `` Thou hast been shamefully abused ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 10]: said the little King , with a flashing eye .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 13]: `` But I will right thee -- by the cross will I !
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 7]: The King hath said it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 32]: Then , fired by the story of Miles 's wrongs , he loosed his tongue and poured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his astonished listener .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 19]: When he had finished , Miles said to himself -- `` Lo , what an imagination he hath !
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 39]: Verily , this is no common mind ; else , crazed or sane , it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this out of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 19]: Poor ruined little head , it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I bide with the living .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 17]: He shall never leave my side ; he shall be my pet , my little comrade .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 6]: And he shall be cured !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 71]: -- ay , made whole and sound -- then will he make himself a name -- and proud shall I be to say , ` Yes , he is mine -- I took him , a homeless little ragamuffin , but I saw what was in him , and I said his name would be heard some day -- behold him , observe him -- was I right ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 29]: The King spoke -- in a thoughtful , measured voice -- `` Thou didst save me injury and shame , perchance my life , and so my crown .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 6]: Such service demandeth rich reward .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 21]: Name thy desire , and so it be within the compass of my royal power , it is thine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: This fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 76]: He was about to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only done his duty and desired no reward , but a wiser thought came into his head , and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the gracious offer -- an idea which the King gravely approved , remarking that it was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 57]: Miles reflected during some moments , then said to himself , `` Yes , that is the thing to do -- by any other means it were impossible to get at it -- and certes , this hour 's experience has taught me ` twould be most wearing and inconvenient to continue it as it is .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 22]: Yes , I will propose it ; 't was a happy accident that I did not throw the chance away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 56]: Then he dropped upon one knee and said -- `` My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject 's simple duty , and therefore hath no merit ; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold it worthy some reward , I take heart of grace to make petition to this effect .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 55]: Near four hundred years ago , as your grace knoweth , there being ill blood betwixt John , King of England , and the King of France , it was decreed that two champions should fight together in the lists , and so settle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 40]: These two kings , and the Spanish king , being assembled to witness and judge the conflict , the French champion appeared ; but so redoubtable was he , that our English knights refused to measure weapons with him .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 21]: So the matter , which was a weighty one , was like to go against the English monarch by default .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 29]: Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy , the mightiest arm in England , stripped of his honours and possessions , and wasting with long captivity .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 46]: Appeal was made to him ; he gave assent , and came forth arrayed for battle ; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge frame and hear his famous name but he fled away , and the French king 's cause was lost .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 88]: King John restored De Courcy 's titles and possessions , and said , ` Name thy wish and thou shalt have it , though it cost me half my kingdom ; ' whereat De Courcy , kneeling , as I do now , made answer , ` This , then , I ask , my liege ; that I and my successors may have and hold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of England , henceforth while the throne shall last . '
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 69]: The boon was granted , as your Majesty knoweth ; and there hath been no time , these four hundred years , that that line has failed of an heir ; and so , even unto this day , the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the King 's Majesty , without let or hindrance , and this none other may do .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 62]: -LCB- 3 -RCB- Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer , I beseech the King to grant to me but this one grace and privilege -- to my more than sufficient reward -- and none other , to wit : that I and my heirs , for ever , may SIT in the presence of the Majesty of England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 31]: `` Rise , Sir Miles Hendon , Knight , '' said the King , gravely -- giving the accolade with Hendon 's sword -- `` rise , and seat thyself .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 5]: Thy petition is granted .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 16]: Whilst England remains , and the crown continues , the privilege shall not lapse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 41]: His Majesty walked apart , musing , and Hendon dropped into a chair at table , observing to himself , '' 'T was a brave thought , and hath wrought me a mighty deliverance ; my legs are grievously wearied .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 27]: An I had not thought of that , I must have had to stand for weeks , till my poor lad 's wits are cured . ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 24]: After a little , he went on , `` And so I am become a knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 39]: A most odd and strange position , truly , for one so matter-of-fact as I. I will not laugh -- no , God forbid , for this thing which is so substanceless to me is REAL to him .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 32]: And to me , also , in one way , it is not a falsity , for it reflects with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 20]: After a pause : `` Ah , what if he should call me by my fine title before folk !
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 14]: -- there 'd be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment !
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 23]: But no matter , let him call me what he will , so it please him ; I shall be content . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 3]: Chapter XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: The disappearance of the Prince .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 10]: A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 10]: The King said -- `` Remove these rags . ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 5]: -- meaning his clothing .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 48]: Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark , tucked him up in bed , then glanced about the room , saying to himself , ruefully , `` He hath taken my bed again , as before -- marry , what shall _ I _ do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 14]: The little King observed his perplexity , and dissipated it with a word .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 18]: He said , sleepily -- `` Thou wilt sleep athwart the door , and guard it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 16]: In a moment more he was out of his troubles , in a deep slumber .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 13]: `` Dear heart , he should have been born a king ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 15]: muttered Hendon , admiringly ; `` he playeth the part to a marvel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 40]: Then he stretched himself across the door , on the floor , saying contentedly -- `` I have lodged worse for seven years ; ` twould be but ill gratitude to Him above to find fault with this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 8]: He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 24]: Toward noon he rose , uncovered his unconscious ward -- a section at a time -- and took his measure with a string .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 25]: The King awoke , just as he had completed his work , complained of the cold , and asked what he was doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 35]: 'T is done , now , my liege , '' said Hendon ; `` I have a bit of business outside , but will presently return ; sleep thou again -- thou needest it .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 18]: There -- let me cover thy head also -- thou ` lt be warm the sooner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 12]: The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 53]: Miles slipped softly out , and slipped as softly in again , in the course of thirty or forty minutes , with a complete second-hand suit of boy 's clothing , of cheap material , and showing signs of wear ; but tidy , and suited to the season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 122]: He seated himself , and began to overhaul his purchase , mumbling to himself -- `` A longer purse would have got a better sort , but when one has not the long purse one must be content with what a short one may do -- '' ` There was a woman in our town , In our town did dwell -- ' `` He stirred , methinks -- I must sing in a less thunderous key ; 't is not good to mar his sleep , with this journey before him , and he so wearied out , poor chap ... This garment -- 't is well enough -- a stitch here and another one there will set it aright .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 91]: This other is better , albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it , likewise ... THESE be very good and sound , and will keep his small feet warm and dry -- an odd new thing to him , belike , since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare , winters and summers the same ... Would thread were bread , seeing one getteth a year 's sufficiency for a farthing , and such a brave big needle without cost , for mere love .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 14]: Now shall I have the demon 's own time to thread it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 5]: And so he had .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 45]: He did as men have always done , and probably always will do , to the end of time -- held the needle still , and tried to thrust the thread through the eye , which is the opposite of a woman 's way .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 48]: Time and time again the thread missed the mark , going sometimes on one side of the needle , sometimes on the other , sometimes doubling up against the shaft ; but he was patient , having been through these experiences before , when he was soldiering .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 26]: He succeeded at last , and took up the garment that had lain waiting , meantime , across his lap , and began his work .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 63]: `` The inn is paid -- the breakfast that is to come , included -- and there is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at Hendon Hall -- '' ` She loved her hus -- ' `` Body o ' me !
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 9]: I have driven the needle under my nail !
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 33]: ... It matters little -- 't is not a novelty -- yet 't is not a convenience , neither ... We shall be merry there , little one , never doubt it !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 33]: Thy troubles will vanish there , and likewise thy sad distemper -- '' ` She loved her husband dearilee , But another man -- ' `` These be noble large stitches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 72]: -- holding the garment up and viewing it admiringly -- `` they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause these small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and plebeian -- '' ` She loved her husband dearilee , But another man he loved she , -- ' `` Marry , 't is done -- a goodly piece of work , too , and wrought with expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 41]: Now will I wake him , apparel him , pour for him , feed him , and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark and -- be pleased to rise , my liege !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 11]: -- he answereth not -- what ho , my liege !
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 22]: -- of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch , sith his slumber is deaf to speech .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 3]: What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 11]: He threw back the covers -- the boy was gone !
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 39]: He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment ; noticed for the first time that his ward 's ragged raiment was also missing ; then he began to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 10]: At that moment a servant entered with the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 15]: `` Explain , thou limb of Satan , or thy time is come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 33]: roared the man of war , and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not find his tongue , for the instant , for fright and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 7]: `` Where is the boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 12]: In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information desired .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 41]: `` You were hardly gone from the place , your worship , when a youth came running and said it was your worship 's will that the boy come to you straight , at the bridge-end on the Southwark side .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 78]: I brought him hither ; and when he woke the lad and gave his message , the lad did grumble some little for being disturbed ` so early , ' as he called it , but straightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth , only saying it had been better manners that your worship came yourself , not sent a stranger -- and so -- '' `` And so thou ` rt a fool !
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 12]: -- a fool and easily cozened -- hang all thy breed !
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 7]: Yet mayhap no hurt is done .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 8]: Possibly no harm is meant the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 6]: I will go fetch him .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 5]: Make the table ready .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 2]: Stay !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 20]: the coverings of the bed were disposed as if one lay beneath them -- happened that by accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 9]: `` I know not , good your worship .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 16]: I saw the youth meddle with them -- he that came for the boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 4]: `` Thousand deaths !
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 17]: 'T was done to deceive me -- 't is plain 't was done to gain time .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 3]: Hark ye !
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 6]: Was that youth alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 8]: `` All alone , your worship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: `` Art sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 7]: `` Sure , your worship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 15]: `` Collect thy scattered wits -- bethink thee -- take time , man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 60]: After a moment 's thought , the servant said -- `` When he came , none came with him ; but now I remember me that as the two stepped into the throng of the Bridge , a ruffian-looking man plunged out from some near place ; and just as he was joining them -- '' `` What THEN ?
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 6]: -- out with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 7]: thundered the impatient Hendon , interrupting .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 77]: `` Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in , and I saw no more , being called by my master , who was in a rage because a joint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot , though I take all the saints to witness that to blame ME for that miscarriage were like holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com -- '' `` Out of my sight , idiot !
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 6]: Thy prating drives me mad !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 2]: Hold !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 4]: Whither art flying ?
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 7]: Canst not bide still an instant ?
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 6]: Went they toward Southwark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 36]: `` Even so , your worship -- for , as I said before , as to that detestable joint , the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than -- '' `` Art here YET !
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 4]: And prating still !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 8]: Vanish , lest I throttle thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 4]: The servitor vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 34]: Hendon followed after him , passed him , and plunged down the stairs two steps at a stride , muttering , '' 'T is that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 26]: I have lost thee , my poor little mad master -- it is a bitter thought -- and I had come to love thee so !
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 8]: by book and bell , NOT lost !
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 15]: Not lost , for I will ransack the land till I find thee again .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 30]: Poor child , yonder is his breakfast -- and mine , but I have no hunger now ; so , let the rats have it -- speed , speed !
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 6]: that is the word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 72]: As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes upon the Bridge he several times said to himself -- clinging to the thought as if it were a particularly pleasing one -- `` He grumbled , but he WENT -- he went , yes , because he thought Miles Hendon asked it , sweet lad -- he would ne'er have done it for another , I know it well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 3]: Chapter XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 11]: ` Le Roi est mort -- vive le Roi . '
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 23]: Toward daylight of the same morning , Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy sleep and opened his eyes in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 49]: He lay silent a few moments , trying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions , and get some sort of meaning out of them ; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous but guarded voice -- `` I see it all , I see it all !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 12]: Now God be thanked , I am indeed awake at last !
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 4]: Come , joy !
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 4]: vanish , sorrow !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 4]: Ho , Nan !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 2]: Bet !
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 41]: kick off your straw and hie ye hither to my side , till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the wildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to astonish the soul of man withal !
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 8]: ... Ho , Nan , I say !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 3]: Bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 22]: A dim form appeared at his side , and a voice said -- `` Wilt deign to deliver thy commands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 3]: `` Commands ?
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 12]: ... O , woe is me , I know thy voice !
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 8]: Speak thou -- who am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 3]: `` Thou ?
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 26]: In sooth , yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales ; to-day art thou my most gracious liege , Edward , King of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 19]: Tom buried his head among his pillows , murmuring plaintively -- `` Alack , it was no dream !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 15]: Go to thy rest , sweet sir -- leave me to my sorrows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 14]: Tom slept again , and after a time he had this pleasant dream .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 54]: He thought it was summer , and he was playing , all alone , in the fair meadow called Goodman 's Fields , when a dwarf only a foot high , with long red whiskers and a humped back , appeared to him suddenly and said , `` Dig by that stump . ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 14]: He did so , and found twelve bright new pennies -- wonderful riches !
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 19]: Yet this was not the best of it ; for the dwarf said -- `` I know thee .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 24]: Thou art a good lad , and a deserving ; thy distresses shall end , for the day of thy reward is come .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 20]: Dig here every seventh day , and thou shalt find always the same treasure , twelve bright new pennies .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 8]: Tell none -- keep the secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 51]: Then the dwarf vanished , and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize , saying to himself , `` Every night will I give my father a penny ; he will think I begged it , it will glad his heart , and I shall no more be beaten .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 23]: One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall have ; mother , Nan , and Bet the other four .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 20]: We be done with hunger and rags , now , done with fears and frets and savage usage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 41]: In his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath , but with eyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm ; cast four of his pennies into his mother 's lap and cried out -- `` They are for thee !
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 8]: -- all of them , every one !
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 19]: -- for thee and Nan and Bet -- and honestly come by , not begged nor stolen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 27]: The happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and exclaimed -- `` It waxeth late -- may it please your Majesty to rise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: that was not the answer he was expecting .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 10]: The dream had snapped asunder -- he was awake .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 19]: He opened his eyes -- the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was kneeling by his couch .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 23]: The gladness of the lying dream faded away -- the poor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 23]: The room was filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles -- the mourning colour -- and with noble servants of the monarch .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 18]: Tom sat up in bed and gazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 35]: The weighty business of dressing began , and one courtier after another knelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences upon his heavy loss , whilst the dressing proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 164]: In the beginning , a shirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting , who passed it to the First Lord of the Buckhounds , who passed it to the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber , who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest , who passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole , who passed it to the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster , who passed it to the Master of the Wardrobe , who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms , who passed it to the Constable of the Tower , who passed it to the Chief Steward of the Household , who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer , who passed it to the Lord High Admiral of England , who passed it to the Archbishop of Canterbury , who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber , who took what was left of it and put it on Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 15]: Poor little wondering chap , it reminded him of passing buckets at a fire .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 60]: Each garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process ; consequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony ; so weary that he felt an almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose begin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter was drawing near .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 6]: But he exulted too soon .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 57]: The First Lord of the Bedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom 's legs in them , when a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things back into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded look and a whispered , `` See , my lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 9]: pointing to a something connected with the hose .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 26]: The Archbishop paled , then flushed , and passed the hose to the Lord High Admiral , whispering , `` See , my lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 29]: The Admiral passed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer , and had hardly breath enough in his body to ejaculate , `` See , my lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 79]: The hose drifted backward along the line , to the Chief Steward of the Household , the Constable of the Tower , Norroy King-at-Arms , the Master of the Wardrobe , the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster , the Third Groom of the Stole , the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest , the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber , the First Lord of the Buckhounds , -- accompanied always with that amazed and frightened `` See !
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 3]: see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 49]: -- till they finally reached the hands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting , who gazed a moment , with a pallid face , upon what had caused all this dismay , then hoarsely whispered , `` Body of my life , a tag gone from a truss-point !
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 15]: -- to the Tower with the Head Keeper of the King 's Hose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 34]: -- after which he leaned upon the shoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to regather his vanished strength whilst fresh hose , without any damaged strings to them , were brought .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 24]: But all things must have an end , and so in time Tom Canty was in a condition to get out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 41]: The proper official poured water , the proper official engineered the washing , the proper official stood by with a towel , and by-and-by Tom got safely through the purifying stage and was ready for the services of the Hairdresser-royal .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 36]: When he at length emerged from this master 's hands , he was a gracious figure and as pretty as a girl , in his mantle and trunks of purple satin , and purple-plumed cap .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 37]: He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room , through the midst of the courtly assemblage ; and as he passed , these fell back , leaving his way free , and dropped upon their knees .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 39]: After breakfast he was conducted , with regal ceremony , attended by his great officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt battle-axes , to the throne-room , where he proceeded to transact business of state .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 24]: His ` uncle , ' Lord Hertford , took his stand by the throne , to assist the royal mind with wise counsel .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 45]: The body of illustrious men named by the late King as his executors appeared , to ask Tom 's approval of certain acts of theirs -- rather a form , and yet not wholly a form , since there was no Protector as yet .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 86]: The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of the decree of the Council of Executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious Majesty , and finished by reading the signatures of the Executors , to wit : the Archbishop of Canterbury ; the Lord Chancellor of England ; William Lord St. John ; John Lord Russell ; Edward Earl of Hertford ; John Viscount Lisle ; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham -- Tom was not listening -- an earlier clause of the document was puzzling him .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 25]: At this point he turned and whispered to Lord Hertford -- `` What day did he say the burial hath been appointed for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 13]: `` The sixteenth of the coming month , my liege . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 6]: 'T is a strange folly .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 5]: Will he keep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 37]: Poor chap , he was still new to the customs of royalty ; he was used to seeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the way with a very different sort of expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 16]: However , the Lord Hertford set his mind at rest with a word or two .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 30]: A secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the morrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors , and desired the King 's assent .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 18]: Tom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford , who whispered -- `` Your Majesty will signify consent .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 25]: They come to testify their royal masters ' sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your Grace and the realm of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 7]: Tom did as he was bidden .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 92]: Another secretary began to read a preamble concerning the expenses of the late King 's household , which had amounted to 28,000 pounds during the preceding six months -- a sum so vast that it made Tom Canty gasp ; he gasped again when the fact appeared that 20,000 pounds of this money was still owing and unpaid ; -LCB- 4 -RCB- and once more when it appeared that the King 's coffers were about empty , and his twelve hundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 20]: Tom spoke out , with lively apprehension -- `` We be going to the dogs , 't is plain .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 61]: 'T is meet and necessary that we take a smaller house and set the servants at large , sith they be of no value but to make delay , and trouble one with offices that harass the spirit and shame the soul , they misbecoming any but a doll , that hath nor brains nor hands to help itself withal .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 55]: I remember me of a small house that standeth over against the fish-market , by Billingsgate -- '' A sharp pressure upon Tom 's arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a blush to his face ; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this strange speech had been remarked or given concern .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 160]: A secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had provided in his will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl of Hertford and raising his brother , Sir Thomas Seymour , to the peerage , and likewise Hertford 's son to an earldom , together with similar aggrandisements to other great servants of the Crown , the Council had resolved to hold a sitting on the 16th of February for the delivering and confirming of these honours , and that meantime , the late King not having granted , in writing , estates suitable to the support of these dignities , the Council , knowing his private wishes in that regard , had thought proper to grant to Seymour ' 500 pound lands , ' and to Hertford 's son ' 800 pound lands , and 300 pound of the next bishop 's lands which should fall vacant , ' -- his present Majesty being willing .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 63]: -LCB- 5 -RCB- Tom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the late King 's debts first , before squandering all this money , but a timely touch upon his arm , from the thoughtful Hertford , saved him this indiscretion ; wherefore he gave the royal assent , without spoken comment , but with much inward discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 43]: While he sat reflecting a moment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering miracles , a happy thought shot into his mind : why not make his mother Duchess of Offal Court , and give her an estate ?
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 57]: But a sorrowful thought swept it instantly away : he was only a king in name , these grave veterans and great nobles were his masters ; to them his mother was only the creature of a diseased mind ; they would simply listen to his project with unbelieving ears , then send for the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 7]: The dull work went tediously on .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 79]: Petitions were read , and proclamations , patents , and all manner of wordy , repetitious , and wearisome papers relating to the public business ; and at last Tom sighed pathetically and murmured to himself , `` In what have I offended , that the good God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the sunshine , to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 36]: Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his shoulder ; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want of that august factor , the ratifying power .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 18]: Silence ensued around the slumbering child , and the sages of the realm ceased from their deliberations .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 93]: During the forenoon , Tom had an enjoyable hour , by permission of his keepers , Hertford and St. John , with the Lady Elizabeth and the little Lady Jane Grey ; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued by the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house ; and at the end of the visit his ` elder sister ' -- afterwards the ` Bloody Mary ' of history -- chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in his eyes , its brevity .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 51]: He had a few moments to himself , and then a slim lad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence , whose clothing , except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists , was of black , -- doublet , hose , and all .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 16]: He bore no badge of mourning but a knot of purple ribbon on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 20]: He advanced hesitatingly , with head bowed and bare , and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 10]: Tom sat still and contemplated him soberly a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 9]: Then he said -- `` Rise , lad .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 4]: Who art thou .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: What wouldst have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 20]: The boy rose , and stood at graceful ease , but with an aspect of concern in his face .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 15]: He said -- `` Of a surety thou must remember me , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 6]: I am thy whipping-boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 5]: `` My WHIPPING-boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 7]: `` The same , your Grace .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 8]: I am Humphrey -- Humphrey Marlow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 16]: Tom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have posted him about .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 5]: The situation was delicate .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: What should he do ?
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 23]: -- pretend he knew this lad , and then betray by his every utterance that he had never heard of him before ?
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 7]: No , that would not do .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 63]: An idea came to his relief : accidents like this might be likely to happen with some frequency , now that business urgencies would often call Hertford and St. John from his side , they being members of the Council of Executors ; therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan himself to meet the requirements of such emergencies .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 26]: Yes , that would be a wise course -- he would practise on this boy , and see what sort of success he might achieve .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 43]: So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment or two , and presently said -- `` Now I seem to remember thee somewhat -- but my wit is clogged and dim with suffering -- '' `` Alack , my poor master ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 31]: ejaculated the whipping-boy , with feeling ; adding , to himself , `` In truth 't is as they said -- his mind is gone -- alas , poor soul !
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 10]: But misfortune catch me , how am I forgetting !
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 17]: They said one must not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 17]: 'T is strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 30]: `` But mind it not -- I mend apace -- a little clue doth often serve to bring me back again the things and names which had escaped me .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 27]: -LRB- And not they , only , forsooth , but e ` en such as I ne'er heard before -- as this lad shall see . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: Give thy business speech . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 24]: 'T is matter of small weight , my liege , yet will I touch upon it , an ' it please your Grace .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 25]: Two days gone by , when your Majesty faulted thrice in your Greek -- in the morning lessons , -- dost remember it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: `` Y-e-s -- methinks I do .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 32]: -LRB- It is not much of a lie -- an ' I had meddled with the Greek at all , I had not faulted simply thrice , but forty times . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 13]: Yes , I do recall it , now -- go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 35]: `` The master , being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish work , did promise that he would soundly whip me for it -- and -- '' `` Whip THEE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 11]: said Tom , astonished out of his presence of mind .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 12]: `` Why should he whip THEE for faults of mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 8]: `` Ah , your Grace forgetteth again .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 13]: He always scourgeth me when thou dost fail in thy lessons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 9]: `` True , true -- I had forgot .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 34]: Thou teachest me in private -- then if I fail , he argueth that thy office was lamely done , and -- '' `` Oh , my liege , what words are these ?
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 14]: I , the humblest of thy servants , presume to teach THEE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 7]: `` Then where is thy blame ?
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 5]: What riddle is this ?
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 12]: Am I in truth gone mad , or is it thou ?
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 6]: Explain -- speak out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 14]: `` But , good your Majesty , there 's nought that needeth simplifying .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 46]: -- None may visit the sacred person of the Prince of Wales with blows ; wherefore , when he faulteth , 't is I that take them ; and meet it is and right , for that it is mine office and my livelihood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 54]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- Tom stared at the tranquil boy , observing to himself , `` Lo , it is a wonderful thing , -- a most strange and curious trade ; I marvel they have not hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me -- would heaven they would !
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 27]: -- an ' they will do this thing , I will take my lashings in mine own person , giving God thanks for the change . ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 21]: Then he said aloud -- `` And hast thou been beaten , poor friend , according to the promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 66]: `` No , good your Majesty , my punishment was appointed for this day , and peradventure it may be annulled , as unbefitting the season of mourning that is come upon us ; I know not , and so have made bold to come hither and remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my behalf -- '' `` With the master ?
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 7]: To save thee thy whipping ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 8]: `` Ah , thou dost remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 8]: `` My memory mendeth , thou seest .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 19]: Set thy mind at ease -- thy back shall go unscathed -- I will see to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 10]: `` Oh , thanks , my good lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 10]: cried the boy , dropping upon his knee again .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 34]: `` Mayhap I have ventured far enow ; and yet -- '' Seeing Master Humphrey hesitate , Tom encouraged him to go on , saying he was `` in the granting mood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 15]: `` Then will I speak it out , for it lieth near my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 56]: Sith thou art no more Prince of Wales but King , thou canst order matters as thou wilt , with none to say thee nay ; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt longer vex thyself with dreary studies , but wilt burn thy books and turn thy mind to things less irksome .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 13]: Then am I ruined , and mine orphan sisters with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 3]: `` Ruined ?
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 4]: Prithee how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 12]: `` My back is my bread , O my gracious liege !
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 8]: if it go idle , I starve .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 17]: An ' thou cease from study mine office is gone thou ` lt need no whipping-boy .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 7]: Do not turn me away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 8]: Tom was touched with this pathetic distress .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 19]: He said , with a right royal burst of generosity -- `` Discomfort thyself no further , lad .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 14]: Thine office shall be permanent in thee and thy line for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 36]: Then he struck the boy a light blow on the shoulder with the flat of his sword , exclaiming , `` Rise , Humphrey Marlow , Hereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 37]: Banish sorrow -- I will betake me to my books again , and study so ill that they must in justice treble thy wage , so mightily shall the business of thine office be augmented . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 27]: The grateful Humphrey responded fervidly -- `` Thanks , O most noble master , this princely lavishness doth far surpass my most distempered dreams of fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 19]: Now shall I be happy all my days , and all the house of Marlow after me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 18]: Tom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful to him .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 12]: He encouraged Humphrey to talk , and he was nothing loath .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 66]: He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom 's ` cure ' ; for always , as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom 's diseased mind the various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal school-room and elsewhere about the palace , he noticed that Tom was then able to ` recall ' the circumstances quite clearly .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 67]: At the end of an hour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information concerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court ; so he resolved to draw instruction from this source daily ; and to this end he would give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might come , provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 16]: Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with more trouble for Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 97]: He said that the Lords of the Council , fearing that some overwrought report of the King 's damaged health might have leaked out and got abroad , they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to dine in public after a day or two -- his wholesome complexion and vigorous step , assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and grace of demeanour , would more surely quiet the general pulse -- in case any evil rumours HAD gone about -- than any other scheme that could be devised .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 96]: Then the Earl proceeded , very delicately , to instruct Tom as to the observances proper to the stately occasion , under the rather thin disguise of ` reminding ' him concerning things already known to him ; but to his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help in this line -- he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction , for Humphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine in public ; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 9]: Tom kept these facts to himself , however .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 34]: Seeing the royal memory so improved , the Earl ventured to apply a few tests to it , in an apparently casual way , to find out how far its amendment had progressed .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 31]: The results were happy , here and there , in spots -- spots where Humphrey 's tracks remained -- and on the whole my lord was greatly pleased and encouraged .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 74]: So encouraged was he , indeed , that he spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice -- `` Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet a little further , it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal -- a loss which was of moment yesterday , although of none to-day , since its term of service ended with our late lord 's life .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 11]: May it please your Grace to make the trial ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 17]: Tom was at sea -- a Great Seal was something which he was totally unacquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 22]: After a moment 's hesitation he looked up innocently and asked -- `` What was it like , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 20]: The Earl started , almost imperceptibly , muttering to himself , `` Alack , his wits are flown again !
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 44]: -- it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain them '' -- then he deftly turned the talk to other matters , with the purpose of sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom 's thoughts -- a purpose which easily succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 3]: Chapter XV .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 4]: Tom as King .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 24]: The next day the foreign ambassadors came , with their gorgeous trains ; and Tom , throned in awful state , received them .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 45]: The splendours of the scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first , but the audience was long and dreary , and so were most of the addresses -- wherefore , what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and home-sickness by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 45]: Tom said the words which Hertford put into his mouth from time to time , and tried hard to acquit himself satisfactorily , but he was too new to such things , and too ill at ease to accomplish more than a tolerable success .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 17]: He looked sufficiently like a king , but he was ill able to feel like one .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 10]: He was cordially glad when the ceremony was ended .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 29]: The larger part of his day was ` wasted ' -- as he termed it , in his own mind -- in labours pertaining to his royal office .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 30]: Even the two hours devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a burden to him than otherwise , they were so fettered by restrictions and ceremonious observances .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 28]: However , he had a private hour with his whipping-boy which he counted clear gain , since he got both entertainment and needful information out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 88]: The third day of Tom Canty 's kingship came and went much as the others had done , but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way -- he felt less uncomfortable than at first ; he was getting a little used to his circumstances and surroundings ; his chains still galled , but not all the time ; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and embarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 30]: But for one single dread , he could have seen the fourth day approach without serious distress -- the dining in public ; it was to begin that day .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 131]: There were greater matters in the programme -- for on that day he would have to preside at a council which would take his views and commands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign nations scattered far and near over the great globe ; on that day , too , Hertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector ; other things of note were appointed for that fourth day , also ; but to Tom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all by himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a multitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance , -- and upon his mistakes , if he should be so unlucky as to make any .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 14]: Still , nothing could stop that fourth day , and so it came .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 20]: It found poor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded , and this mood continued ; he could not shake it off .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 15]: The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon his hands , and wearied him .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 12]: Once more he felt the sense of captivity heavy upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 41]: Late in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber , conversing with the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour appointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great officials and courtiers .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 81]: After a little while , Tom , who had wandered to a window and become interested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the palace gates -- and not idly interested , but longing with all his heart to take part in person in its stir and freedom -- saw the van of a hooting and shouting mob of disorderly men , women , and children of the lowest and poorest degree approaching from up the road .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 11]: `` I would I knew what 't is about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 13]: he exclaimed , with all a boy 's curiosity in such happenings .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 7]: `` Thou art the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 9]: solemnly responded the Earl , with a reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 11]: `` Have I your Grace 's leave to act ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 6]: `` O blithely , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 6]: O gladly , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 34]: exclaimed Tom excitedly , adding to himself with a lively sense of satisfaction , `` In truth , being a king is not all dreariness -- it hath its compensations and conveniences . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 36]: The Earl called a page , and sent him to the captain of the guard with the order -- `` Let the mob be halted , and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its movement .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 7]: By the King 's command ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 33]: A few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards , cased in flashing steel , filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front of the multitude .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 35]: A messenger returned , to report that the crowd were following a man , a woman , and a young girl to execution for crimes committed against the peace and dignity of the realm .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 12]: Death -- and a violent death -- for these poor unfortunates !
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 7]: The thought wrung Tom 's heart-strings .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 61]: The spirit of compassion took control of him , to the exclusion of all other considerations ; he never thought of the offended laws , or of the grief or loss which these three criminals had inflicted upon their victims ; he could think of nothing but the scaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 44]: His concern made him even forget , for the moment , that he was but the false shadow of a king , not the substance ; and before he knew it he had blurted out the command -- `` Bring them here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 44]: Then he blushed scarlet , and a sort of apology sprung to his lips ; but observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or the waiting page , he suppressed the words he was about to utter .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 25]: The page , in the most matter-of-course way , made a profound obeisance and retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 19]: Tom experienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating advantages of the kingly office .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 62]: He said to himself , `` Truly it is like what I was used to feel when I read the old priest 's tales , and did imagine mine own self a prince , giving law and command to all , saying ` Do this , do that , ' whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 32]: Now the doors swung open ; one high-sounding title after another was announced , the personages owning them followed , and the place was quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 29]: But Tom was hardly conscious of the presence of these people , so wrought up was he and so intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 49]: He seated himself absently in his chair of state , and turned his eyes upon the door with manifestations of impatient expectancy ; seeing which , the company forbore to trouble him , and fell to chatting a mixture of public business and court gossip one with another .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 36]: In a little while the measured tread of military men was heard approaching , and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an under-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king 's guard .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 32]: The civil officer knelt before Tom , then stood aside ; the three doomed persons knelt , also , and remained so ; the guard took position behind Tom 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: Tom scanned the prisoners curiously .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 17]: Something about the dress or appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 20]: `` Methinks I have seen this man ere now ... but the when or the where fail me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: -- Such was Tom 's thought .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 39]: Just then the man glanced quickly up and quickly dropped his face again , not being able to endure the awful port of sovereignty ; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 123]: He said to himself : `` Now is the matter clear ; this is the stranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames , and saved his life , that windy , bitter , first day of the New Year -- a brave good deed -- pity he hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case ... I have not forgot the day , neither the hour ; by reason that an hour after , upon the stroke of eleven , I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer Canty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that went before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by comparison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 40]: Tom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence for a little time ; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff , saying -- `` Good sir , what is this man 's offence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 25]: The officer knelt , and answered -- `` So please your Majesty , he hath taken the life of a subject by poison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 26]: Tom 's compassion for the prisoner , and admiration of him as the daring rescuer of a drowning boy , experienced a most damaging shock .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: `` The thing was proven upon him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: `` Most clearly , sire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 17]: Tom sighed , and said -- `` Take him away -- he hath earned his death .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 26]: 'T is a pity , for he was a brave heart -- na -- na , I mean he hath the LOOK of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 52]: The prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy , and wrung them despairingly , at the same time appealing imploringly to the ` King ' in broken and terrified phrases -- `` O my lord the King , an ' thou canst pity the lost , have pity upon me !
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 57]: I am innocent -- neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than but lamely proved -- yet I speak not of that ; the judgment is gone forth against me and may not suffer alteration ; yet in mine extremity I beg a boon , for my doom is more than I can bear .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 11]: A grace , a grace , my lord the King !
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 16]: in thy royal compassion grant my prayer -- give commandment that I be hanged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 4]: Tom was amazed .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 10]: This was not the outcome he had looked for .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 9]: `` Odds my life , a strange BOON !
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 9]: Was it not the fate intended thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 9]: `` O good my liege , not so !
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 10]: It is ordered that I be BOILED ALIVE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 14]: The hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 20]: As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out -- `` Have thy wish , poor soul !
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 18]: an ' thou had poisoned a hundred men thou shouldst not suffer so miserable a death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 31]: The prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate expressions of gratitude -- ending with -- `` If ever thou shouldst know misfortune -- which God forefend !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 14]: -- may thy goodness to me this day be remembered and requited ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 30]: Tom turned to the Earl of Hertford , and said -- `` My lord , is it believable that there was warrant for this man 's ferocious doom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 12]: `` It is the law , your Grace -- for poisoners .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 59]: In Germany coiners be boiled to death in OIL -- not cast in of a sudden , but by a rope let down into the oil by degrees , and slowly ; first the feet , then the legs , then -- '' `` O prithee no more , my lord , I can not bear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 15]: cried Tom , covering his eyes with his hands to shut out the picture .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 29]: `` I beseech your good lordship that order be taken to change this law -- oh , let no more poor creatures be visited with its tortures . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 32]: The Earl 's face showed profound gratification , for he was a man of merciful and generous impulses -- a thing not very common with his class in that fierce age .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 15]: He said -- `` These your Grace 's noble words have sealed its doom .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 13]: History will remember it to the honour of your royal house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 33]: The under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner ; Tom gave him a sign to wait ; then he said -- `` Good sir , I would look into this matter further .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 11]: The man has said his deed was but lamely proved .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: Tell me what thou knowest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 78]: `` If the King 's grace please , it did appear upon the trial that this man entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay sick -- three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning , and two say it was some minutes later -- the sick man being alone at the time , and sleeping -- and presently the man came forth again and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 16]: The sick man died within the hour , being torn with spasms and retchings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 8]: `` Did any see the poison given ?
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 5]: Was poison found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: `` Marry , no , my liege . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 14]: `` Then how doth one know there was poison given at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 19]: `` Please your Majesty , the doctors testified that none die with such symptoms but by poison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 10]: Weighty evidence , this , in that simple age .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 21]: Tom recognised its formidable nature , and said -- `` The doctor knoweth his trade -- belike they were right .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 11]: The matter hath an ill-look for this poor man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 16]: `` Yet was not this all , your Majesty ; there is more and worse .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 71]: Many testified that a witch , since gone from the village , none know whither , did foretell , and speak it privately in their ears , that the sick man WOULD DIE BY POISON -- and more , that a stranger would give it -- a stranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb ; and surely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 21]: Please your Majesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due , seeing it was FORETOLD . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 12]: This was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 22]: Tom felt that the thing was settled ; if evidence was worth anything , this poor fellow 's guilt was proved .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 23]: Still he offered the prisoner a chance , saying -- `` If thou canst say aught in thy behalf , speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 9]: `` Nought that will avail , my King .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 12]: I am innocent , yet can not I make it appear .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 69]: I have no friends , else might I show that I was not in Islington that day ; so also might I show that at that hour they name I was above a league away , seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs ; yea more , my King , for I could show , that whilst they say I was TAKING life , I was SAVING it .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 8]: A drowning boy -- '' `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 11]: Sheriff , name the day the deed was done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 39]: `` At ten in the morning , or some minutes later , the first day of the New Year , most illustrious -- '' `` Let the prisoner go free -- it is the King 's will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 38]: Another blush followed this unregal outburst , and he covered his indecorum as well as he could by adding -- `` It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle , hare-brained evidence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 10]: A low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 55]: It was not admiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom , for the propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing which few there would have felt justified in either admitting or admiring -- no , the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which Tom had displayed .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 24]: Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect -- `` This is no mad king -- he hath his wits sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 24]: `` How sanely he put his questions -- how like his former natural self was this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 10]: `` God be thanked , his infirmity is spent !
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 9]: This is no weakling , but a king .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 11]: He hath borne himself like to his own father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 17]: The air being filled with applause , Tom 's ear necessarily caught a little of it .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 27]: The effect which this had upon him was to put him greatly at his ease , and also to charge his system with very gratifying sensations .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 53]: However , his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant thoughts and feelings ; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief the woman and the little girl could have been about ; so , by his command , the two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 10]: `` What is it that these have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 6]: he inquired of the sheriff .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 33]: `` Please your Majesty , a black crime is charged upon them , and clearly proven ; wherefore the judges have decreed , according to the law , that they be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 13]: They sold themselves to the devil -- such is their crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 3]: Tom shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 13]: He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked thing .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 29]: Still , he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding his curiosity for all that ; so he asked -- `` Where was this done ?
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 5]: -- and when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 16]: `` On a midnight in December , in a ruined church , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 4]: Tom shuddered again .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 7]: `` Who was there present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 13]: `` Only these two , your grace -- and THAT OTHER . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 6]: `` Have these confessed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 14]: `` Nay , not so , sire -- they do deny it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 10]: `` Then prithee , how was it known ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 28]: `` Certain witness did see them wending thither , good your Majesty ; this bred the suspicion , and dire effects have since confirmed and justified it .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 31]: In particular , it is in evidence that through the wicked power so obtained , they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the region round about .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 33]: Above forty witnesses have proved the storm ; and sooth one might have had a thousand , for all had reason to remember it , sith all had suffered by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 9]: `` Certes this is a serious matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 27]: Tom turned this dark piece of scoundrelism over in his mind a while , then asked -- `` Suffered the woman also by the storm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 16]: Several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of the wisdom of this question .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 35]: The sheriff , however , saw nothing consequential in the inquiry ; he answered , with simple directness -- `` Indeed did she , your Majesty , and most righteously , as all aver .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 14]: Her habitation was swept away , and herself and child left shelterless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 15]: `` Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 47]: She had been cheated , had she paid but a farthing for it ; that she paid her soul , and her child 's , argueth that she is mad ; if she is mad she knoweth not what she doth , therefore sinneth not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 63]: The elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom 's wisdom once more , and one individual murmured , `` An ' the King be mad himself , according to report , then is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I wot of , if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 8]: `` What age hath the child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: `` Nine years , please your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 20]: `` By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: asked Tom , turning to a learned judge .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 44]: `` The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty matter , good my liege , holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope with the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 36]: The DEVIL may buy a child , if he so choose , and the child agree thereto , but not an Englishman -- in this latter case the contract would be null and void . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 27]: `` It seemeth a rude unchristian thing , and ill contrived , that English law denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 7]: cried Tom , with honest heat .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 37]: This novel view of the matter excited many smiles , and was stored away in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom 's originality as well as progress toward mental health .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 24]: The elder culprit had ceased from sobbing , and was hanging upon Tom 's words with an excited interest and a growing hope .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 19]: Tom noticed this , and it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and unfriended situation .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 14]: Presently he asked -- `` How wrought they to bring the storm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 10]: `` BY PULLING OFF THEIR STOCKINGS , sire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 13]: This astonished Tom , and also fired his curiosity to fever heat .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 10]: He said , eagerly -- `` It is wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 8]: Hath it always this dread effect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 30]: `` Always , my liege -- at least if the woman desire it , and utter the needful words , either in her mind or with her tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 24]: Tom turned to the woman , and said with impetuous zeal -- `` Exert thy power -- I would see a storm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 45]: There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage , and a general , though unexpressed , desire to get out of the place -- all of which was lost upon Tom , who was dead to everything but the proposed cataclysm .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 26]: Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman 's face , he added , excitedly -- `` Never fear -- thou shalt be blameless .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 12]: More -- thou shalt go free -- none shall touch thee .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: Exert thy power . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 20]: `` Oh , my lord the King , I have it not -- I have been falsely accused . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 6]: `` Thy fears stay thee .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 11]: Be of good heart , thou shalt suffer no harm .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 62]: Make a storm -- it mattereth not how small a one -- I require nought great or harmful , but indeed prefer the opposite -- do this and thy life is spared -- thou shalt go out free , with thy child , bearing the King 's pardon , and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 56]: The woman prostrated herself , and protested , with tears , that she had no power to do the miracle , else she would gladly win her child 's life alone , and be content to lose her own , if by obedience to the King 's command so precious a grace might be acquired .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 11]: Tom urged -- the woman still adhered to her declarations .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 13]: Finally he said -- `` I think the woman hath said true .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 47]: An ' MY mother were in her place and gifted with the devil 's functions , she had not stayed a moment to call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins , if the saving of my forfeit life were the price she got !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 12]: It is argument that other mothers are made in like mould .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 18]: Thou art free , goodwife -- thou and thy child -- for I do think thee innocent .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 16]: NOW thou ` st nought to fear , being pardoned -- pull off thy stockings !
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 16]: -- an ' thou canst make me a storm , thou shalt be rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 40]: The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude , and proceeded to obey , whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy , a little marred by apprehension ; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided discomfort and uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 38]: The woman stripped her own feet and her little girl 's also , and plainly did her best to reward the King 's generosity with an earthquake , but it was all a failure and a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 25]: Tom sighed , and said -- `` There , good soul , trouble thyself no further , thy power is departed out of thee .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 27]: Go thy way in peace ; and if it return to thee at any time , forget me not , but fetch me a storm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 6]: -LCB- 13 -RCB- Chapter XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 4]: The State Dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 24]: The dinner hour drew near -- yet strangely enough , the thought brought but slight discomfort to Tom , and hardly any terror .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 42]: The morning 's experiences had wonderfully built up his confidence ; the poor little ash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret , after four days ' habit , than a mature person could have become in a full month .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 15]: A child 's facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more strikingly illustrated .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 27]: Let us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a glance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the imposing occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 18]: It is a spacious apartment , with gilded pillars and pilasters , and pictured walls and ceilings .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 23]: At the door stand tall guards , as rigid as statues , dressed in rich and picturesque costumes , and bearing halberds .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 29]: In a high gallery which runs all around the place is a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes , in brilliant attire .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 17]: In the centre of the room , upon a raised platform , is Tom 's table .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 158]: Now let the ancient chronicler speak : `` A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod , and along with him another bearing a tablecloth , which , after they have both kneeled three times with the utmost veneration , he spreads upon the table , and after kneeling again they both retire ; then come two others , one with the rod again , the other with a salt-cellar , a plate , and bread ; when they have kneeled as the others had done , and placed what was brought upon the table , they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first ; at last come two nobles , richly clothed , one bearing a tasting-knife , who , after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful manner , approach and rub the table with bread and salt , with as much awe as if the King had been present . ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 9]: -LCB- 6 -RCB- So end the solemn preliminaries .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 23]: Now , far down the echoing corridors we hear a bugle-blast , and the indistinct cry , `` Place for the King !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 10]: Way for the King 's most excellent majesty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 37]: These sounds are momently repeated -- they grow nearer and nearer -- and presently , almost in our faces , the martial note peals and the cry rings out , `` Way for the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 20]: At this instant the shining pageant appears , and files in at the door , with a measured march .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 106]: Let the chronicler speak again : -- `` First come Gentlemen , Barons , Earls , Knights of the Garter , all richly dressed and bareheaded ; next comes the Chancellor , between two , one of which carries the royal sceptre , the other the Sword of State in a red scabbard , studded with golden fleurs-de-lis , the point upwards ; next comes the King himself -- whom , upon his appearing , twelve trumpets and many drums salute with a great burst of welcome , whilst all in the galleries rise in their places , crying ` God save the King ! '
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 31]: After him come nobles attached to his person , and on his right and left march his guard of honour , his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners , with gilt battle-axes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 7]: This was all fine and pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 15]: Tom 's pulse beat high , and a glad light was in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 71]: He bore himself right gracefully , and all the more so because he was not thinking of how he was doing it , his mind being charmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him -- and besides , nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful clothes after he has grown a little used to them -- especially if he is for the moment unconscious of them .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 31]: Tom remembered his instructions , and acknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head , and a courteous `` I thank ye , my good people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 62]: He seated himself at table , without removing his cap ; and did it without the least embarrassment ; for to eat with one 's cap on was the one solitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon common ground , neither party having any advantage over the other in the matter of old familiarity with it .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 13]: The pageant broke up and grouped itself picturesquely , and remained bareheaded .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 85]: Now to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered , -- `` the tallest and mightiest men in England , they being carefully selected in this regard , '' -- but we will let the chronicler tell about it : -- `` The Yeomen of the Guard entered , bareheaded , clothed in scarlet , with golden roses upon their backs ; and these went and came , bringing in each turn a course of dishes , served in plate .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 47]: These dishes were received by a gentleman in the same order they were brought , and placed upon the table , while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the particular dish he had brought , for fear of any poison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 57]: Tom made a good dinner , notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds of eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an interest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly explosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about the place .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 32]: He was careful not to hurry , and equally careful not to do anything whatever for himself , but wait till the proper official knelt down and did it for him .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 12]: He got through without a mistake -- flawless and precious triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 87]: When the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his bright pageant , with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles , rolling drums , and thundering acclamations , he felt that if he had seen the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad to endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself free from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 3]: Chapter XVII .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 4]: Foo-foo the First .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 31]: Miles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge , keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought , and hoping and expecting to overtake them presently .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 8]: He was disappointed in this , however .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 32]: By asking questions , he was enabled to track them part of the way through Southwark ; then all traces ceased , and he was perplexed as to how to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 17]: Still , he continued his efforts as best he could during the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 47]: Nightfall found him leg-weary , half-famished , and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever ; so he supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed , resolved to make an early start in the morning , and give the town an exhaustive search .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 41]: As he lay thinking and planning , he presently began to reason thus : The boy would escape from the ruffian , his reputed father , if possible ; would he go back to London and seek his former haunts ?
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 13]: No , he would not do that , he would avoid recapture .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 8]: What , then , would he do ?
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 43]: Never having had a friend in the world , or a protector , until he met Miles Hendon , he would naturally try to find that friend again , provided the effort did not require him to go toward London and danger .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 30]: He would strike for Hendon Hall , that is what he would do , for he knew Hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find him .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 39]: Yes , the case was plain to Hendon -- he must lose no more time in Southwark , but move at once through Kent , toward Monk 's Holm , searching the wood and inquiring as he went .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: Let us return to the vanished little King now .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 39]: The ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw ` about to join ' the youth and the King did not exactly join them , but fell in close behind them and followed their steps .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 4]: He said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 33]: His left arm was in a sling , and he wore a large green patch over his left eye ; he limped slightly , and used an oaken staff as a support .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 20]: The youth led the King a crooked course through Southwark , and by-and-by struck into the high road beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 31]: The King was irritated , now , and said he would stop here -- it was Hendon 's place to come to him , not his to go to Hendon .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 14]: He would not endure such insolence ; he would stop where he was .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 21]: The youth said -- `` Thou ` lt tarry here , and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: So be it , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 8]: The King 's manner changed at once .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 7]: He cried out -- `` Wounded ?
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 8]: And who hath dared to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 11]: But that is apart ; lead on , lead on !
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 4]: Faster , sirrah !
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 5]: Art shod with lead ?
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 5]: Wounded , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 17]: Now though the doer of it be a duke 's son he shall rue it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 15]: It was some distance to the wood , but the space was speedily traversed .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 54]: The youth looked about him , discovered a bough sticking in the ground , with a small bit of rag tied to it , then led the way into the forest , watching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals ; they were evidently guides to the point he was aiming at .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 29]: By-and-by an open place was reached , where were the charred remains of a farm-house , and near them a barn which was falling to ruin and decay .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 13]: There was no sign of life anywhere , and utter silence prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: The youth entered the barn , the King following eagerly upon his heels .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 4]: No one there !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 21]: The King shot a surprised and suspicious glance at the youth , and asked -- `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 7]: A mocking laugh was his answer .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 35]: The King was in a rage in a moment ; he seized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth when another mocking laugh fell upon his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 14]: It was from the lame ruffian who had been following at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 12]: The King turned and said angrily -- `` Who art thou ?
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 7]: What is thy business here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 15]: `` Leave thy foolery , '' said the man , `` and quiet thyself .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 19]: My disguise is none so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 7]: `` Thou art not my father .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 5]: I know thee not .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 5]: I am the King .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 24]: If thou hast hid my servant , find him for me , or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou hast done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 36]: John Canty replied , in a stern and measured voice -- `` It is plain thou art mad , and I am loath to punish thee ; but if thou provoke me , I must .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 42]: Thy prating doth no harm here , where there are no ears that need to mind thy follies ; yet it is well to practise thy tongue to wary speech , that it may do no hurt when our quarters change .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 23]: I have done a murder , and may not tarry at home -- neither shalt thou , seeing I need thy service .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 25]: My name is changed , for wise reasons ; it is Hobbs -- John Hobbs ; thine is Jack -- charge thy memory accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 6]: Now , then , speak .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: Where is thy mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 5]: Where are thy sisters ?
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 15]: They came not to the place appointed -- knowest thou whither they went ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 13]: The King answered sullenly -- `` Trouble me not with these riddles .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 13]: My mother is dead ; my sisters are in the palace . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 56]: The youth near by burst into a derisive laugh , and the King would have assaulted him , but Canty -- or Hobbs , as he now called himself -- prevented him , and said -- `` Peace , Hugo , vex him not ; his mind is astray , and thy ways fret him .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 21]: Sit thee down , Jack , and quiet thyself ; thou shalt have a morsel to eat , anon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 27]: Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together , in low voices , and the King removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 26]: He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn , where he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 21]: He lay down here , drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets , and was soon absorbed in thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 25]: He had many griefs , but the minor ones were swept almost into forgetfulness by the supreme one , the loss of his father .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 12]: To the rest of the world the name of Henry VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 46]: brought a shiver , and suggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand dealt scourgings and death ; but to this boy the name brought only sensations of pleasure ; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that was all gentleness and affection .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 38]: He called to mind a long succession of loving passages between his father and himself , and dwelt fondly upon them , his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that possessed his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 23]: As the afternoon wasted away , the lad , wearied with his troubles , sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 52]: After a considerable time -- he could not tell how long -- his senses struggled to a half-consciousness , and as he lay with closed eyes vaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening , he noted a murmurous sound , the sullen beating of rain upon the roof .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 28]: A snug sense of comfort stole over him , which was rudely broken , the next moment , by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 17]: It startled him disagreeably , and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 9]: A grim and unsightly picture met his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 57]: A bright fire was burning in the middle of the floor , at the other end of the barn ; and around it , and lit weirdly up by the red glare , lolled and sprawled the motliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians , of both sexes , he had ever read or dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 151]: There were huge stalwart men , brown with exposure , long-haired , and clothed in fantastic rags ; there were middle-sized youths , of truculent countenance , and similarly clad ; there were blind mendicants , with patched or bandaged eyes ; crippled ones , with wooden legs and crutches ; diseased ones , with running sores peeping from ineffectual wrappings ; there was a villain-looking pedlar with his pack ; a knife-grinder , a tinker , and a barber-surgeon , with the implements of their trades ; some of the females were hardly-grown girls , some were at prime , some were old and wrinkled hags , and all were loud , brazen , foul-mouthed ; and all soiled and slatternly ; there were three sore-faced babies ; there were a couple of starveling curs , with strings about their necks , whose office was to lead the blind .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 28]: The night was come , the gang had just finished feasting , an orgy was beginning ; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 10]: A general cry broke forth -- `` A song !
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 11]: a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 34]: One of the blind men got up , and made ready by casting aside the patches that sheltered his excellent eyes , and the pathetic placard which recited the cause of his calamity .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 50]: Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself of his timber leg and took his place , upon sound and healthy limbs , beside his fellow-rascal ; then they roared out a rollicking ditty , and were reinforced by the whole crew , at the end of each stanza , in a rousing chorus .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 44]: By the time the last stanza was reached , the half-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch , that everybody joined in and sang it clear through from the beginning , producing a volume of villainous sound that made the rafters quake .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 39]: These were the inspiring words : -- ` Bien Darkman 's then , Bouse Mort and Ken , The bien Coves bings awast , On Chates to trine by Rome Coves dine For his long lib at last .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 36]: Bing 'd out bien Morts and toure , and toure , Bing out of the Rome vile bine , And toure the Cove that cloy 'd your duds , Upon the Chates to trine . '
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 8]: -LRB- From ` The English Rogue . '
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 5]: London , 1665 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 27]: Conversation followed ; not in the thieves ' dialect of the song , for that was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 31]: In the course of it , it appeared that ` John Hobbs ' was not altogether a new recruit , but had trained in the gang at some former time .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 49]: His later history was called for , and when he said he had ` accidentally ' killed a man , considerable satisfaction was expressed ; when he added that the man was a priest , he was roundly applauded , and had to take a drink with everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 18]: Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously , and new ones were proud to shake him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 14]: He was asked why he had ` tarried away so many months . '
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 28]: He answered -- `` London is better than the country , and safer , these late years , the laws be so bitter and so diligently enforced .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 14]: An ' I had not had that accident , I had stayed there .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 20]: I had resolved to stay , and never more venture country-wards -- but the accident has ended that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 10]: He inquired how many persons the gang numbered now .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 34]: The ` ruffler , ' or chief , answered -- `` Five and twenty sturdy budges , bulks , files , clapperdogeons and maunders , counting the dells and doxies and other morts .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 18]: -LCB- 7 -RCB- Most are here , the rest are wandering eastward , along the winter lay .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 6]: We follow at dawn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 14]: `` I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 6]: Where may he be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 19]: `` Poor lad , his diet is brimstone , now , and over hot for a delicate taste .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 12]: He was killed in a brawl , somewhere about midsummer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 18]: `` I sorrow to hear that ; the Wen was a capable man , and brave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 7]: `` That was he , truly .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 42]: Black Bess , his dell , is of us yet , but absent on the eastward tramp ; a fine lass , of nice ways and orderly conduct , none ever seeing her drunk above four days in the seven . ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 19]: `` She was ever strict -- I remember it well -- a goodly wench and worthy all commendation .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 25]: Her mother was more free and less particular ; a troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame , but furnished with a wit above the common . ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: `` We lost her through it .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 21]: Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch 's name and fame .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 11]: The law roasted her to death at a slow fire .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 56]: It did touch me to a sort of tenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot -- cursing and reviling all the crowd that gaped and gazed around her , whilst the flames licked upward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about her old gray head -- cursing them !
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 21]: why an ' thou should ` st live a thousand years thoud ` st never hear so masterful a cursing .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 8]: Alack , her art died with her .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 14]: There be base and weakling imitations left , but no true blasphemy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 75]: The Ruffler sighed ; the listeners sighed in sympathy ; a general depression fell upon the company for a moment , for even hardened outcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment , but are able to feel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and under peculiarly favouring circumstances -- as in cases like to this , for instance , when genius and culture depart and leave no heir .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 15]: However , a deep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 11]: `` Have any others of our friends fared hardly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 3]: asked Hobbs .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 5]: `` Some -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 29]: Particularly new comers -- such as small husbandmen turned shiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from them to be changed to sheep ranges .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 61]: They begged , and were whipped at the cart 's tail , naked from the girdle up , till the blood ran ; then set in the stocks to be pelted ; they begged again , were whipped again , and deprived of an ear ; they begged a third time -- poor devils , what else could they do ?
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 28]: -- and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron , then sold for slaves ; they ran away , were hunted down , and hanged .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 10]: 'T is a brief tale , and quickly told .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 8]: Others of us have fared less hardly .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 15]: Stand forth , Yokel , Burns , and Hodge -- show your adornments ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 126]: These stood up and stripped away some of their rags , exposing their backs , criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash ; one turned up his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been ; another showed a brand upon his shoulder -- the letter V -- and a mutilated ear ; the third said -- `` I am Yokel , once a farmer and prosperous , with loving wife and kids -- now am I somewhat different in estate and calling ; and the wife and kids are gone ; mayhap they are in heaven , mayhap in -- in the other place -- but the kindly God be thanked , they bide no more in ENGLAND !
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 42]: My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick ; one of these died , the doctors knew not how , so my mother was burnt for a witch , whilst my babes looked on and wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 3]: English law !
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 9]: -- up , all , with your cups !
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 9]: -- now all together and with a cheer !
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 15]: -- drink to the merciful English law that delivered HER from the English hell !
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 9]: Thank you , mates , one and all .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 41]: I begged , from house to house -- I and the wife -- bearing with us the hungry kids -- but it was crime to be hungry in England -- so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 10]: Drink ye all again to the merciful English law !
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 18]: -- for its lash drank deep of my Mary 's blood and its blessed deliverance came quick .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 15]: She lies there , in the potter 's field , safe from all harms .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 19]: And the kids -- well , whilst the law lashed me from town to town , they starved .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 22]: Drink , lads -- only a drop -- a drop to the poor kids , that never did any creature harm .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 45]: I begged again -- begged , for a crust , and got the stocks and lost an ear -- see , here bides the stump ; I begged again , and here is the stump of the other to keep me minded of it .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 38]: And still I begged again , and was sold for a slave -- here on my cheek under this stain , if I washed it off , ye might see the red S the branding-iron left there !
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 3]: A SLAVE !
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 6]: Do you understand that word ?
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 4]: An English SLAVE !
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 9]: -- that is he that stands before ye .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 30]: I have run from my master , and when I am found -- the heavy curse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it !
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 6]: -- I shall hang ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 17]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- A ringing voice came through the murky air -- `` Thou shalt NOT !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 13]: -- and this day the end of that law is come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 39]: All turned , and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching hurriedly ; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed , a general explosion of inquiries broke out -- `` Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 4]: WHAT is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 7]: Who art thou , manikin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 31]: The boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and questioning eyes , and answered with princely dignity -- `` I am Edward , King of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 21]: A wild burst of laughter followed , partly of derision and partly of delight in the excellence of the joke .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 5]: The King was stung .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 22]: He said sharply -- `` Ye mannerless vagrants , is this your recognition of the royal boon I have promised ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 24]: He said more , with angry voice and excited gesture , but it was lost in a whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 52]: ` John Hobbs ' made several attempts to make himself heard above the din , and at last succeeded -- saying -- `` Mates , he is my son , a dreamer , a fool , and stark mad -- mind him not -- he thinketh he IS the King . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 27]: `` I AM the King , '' said Edward , turning toward him , `` as thou shalt know to thy cost , in good time .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 13]: Thou hast confessed a murder -- thou shalt swing for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 5]: `` THOU'LT betray me ?
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 3]: -- THOU ?
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 14]: An ' I get my hands upon thee -- '' `` Tut-tut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 34]: said the burley Ruffler , interposing in time to save the King , and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist , `` hast respect for neither Kings NOR Rufflers ?
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 17]: An ' thou insult my presence so again , I 'll hang thee up myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 32]: Then he said to his Majesty , `` Thou must make no threats against thy mates , lad ; and thou must guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 17]: BE King , if it please thy mad humour , but be not harmful in it .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 47]: Sink the title thou hast uttered -- 't is treason ; we be bad men in some few trifling ways , but none among us is so base as to be traitor to his King ; we be loving and loyal hearts , in that regard .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 6]: Note if I speak truth .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 16]: Now -- all together : ` Long live Edward , King of England ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 10]: `` LONG LIVE EDWARD , KING OF ENGLAND ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 20]: The response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the crazy building vibrated to the sound .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 35]: The little King 's face lighted with pleasure for an instant , and he slightly inclined his head , and said with grave simplicity -- `` I thank you , my good people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 11]: This unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 37]: When something like quiet was presently come again , the Ruffler said , firmly , but with an accent of good nature -- `` Drop it , boy , 't is not wise , nor well .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 15]: Humour thy fancy , if thou must , but choose some other title . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 18]: A tinker shrieked out a suggestion -- `` Foo-foo the First , King of the Mooncalves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 35]: The title ` took , ' at once , every throat responded , and a roaring shout went up , of -- `` Long live Foo-foo the First , King of the Mooncalves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 11]: followed by hootings , cat-calls , and peals of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 10]: `` Hale him forth , and crown him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 5]: `` Robe him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 5]: `` Sceptre him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: `` Throne him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: These and twenty other cries broke out at once !
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 38]: and almost before the poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin , robed in a tattered blanket , throned upon a barrel , and sceptred with the tinker 's soldering-iron .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 47]: Then all flung themselves upon their knees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings , and mocking supplications , whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and ragged sleeves and aprons -- `` Be gracious to us , O sweet King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 13]: `` Trample not upon thy beseeching worms , O noble Majesty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 14]: `` Pity thy slaves , and comfort them with a royal kick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 18]: `` Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays , O flaming sun of sovereignty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 22]: `` Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot , that we may eat the dirt and be ennobled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 31]: `` Deign to spit upon us , O Sire , that our children 's children may tell of thy princely condescension , and be proud and happy for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 18]: But the humorous tinker made the ` hit ' of the evening and carried off the honours .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 79]: Kneeling , he pretended to kiss the King 's foot , and was indignantly spurned ; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste over the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot , saying it must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air , and that he should make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to view at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 19]: He made himself so killingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy rabble .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 59]: Tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch 's eyes ; and the thought in his heart was , `` Had I offered them a deep wrong they could not be more cruel -- yet have I proffered nought but to do them a kindness -- and it is thus they use me for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 3]: Chapter XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 6]: The Prince with the tramps .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 17]: The troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn , and set forward on their march .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 20]: There was a lowering sky overhead , sloppy ground under foot , and a winter chill in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 28]: All gaiety was gone from the company ; some were sullen and silent , some were irritable and petulant , none were gentle-humoured , all were thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 43]: The Ruffler put ` Jack ' in Hugo 's charge , with some brief instructions , and commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone ; he also warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 14]: After a while the weather grew milder , and the clouds lifted somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 13]: The troop ceased to shiver , and their spirits began to improve .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 21]: They grew more and more cheerful , and finally began to chaff each other and insult passengers along the highway .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 17]: This showed that they were awaking to an appreciation of life and its joys once more .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 33]: The dread in which their sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the road , and took their ribald insolences meekly , without venturing to talk back .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 34]: They snatched linen from the hedges , occasionally in full view of the owners , who made no protest , but only seemed grateful that they did not take the hedges , too .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 29]: By-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to furnish a breakfast for them .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 34]: They chucked the housewife and her daughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands , and made coarse jests about them , accompanied with insulting epithets and bursts of horse-laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 29]: They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer and his sons , kept them dodging all the time , and applauded uproariously when a good hit was made .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 18]: They ended by buttering the head of one of the daughters who resented some of their familiarities .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 34]: When they took their leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the heads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 27]: About noon , after a long and weary tramp , the gang came to a halt behind a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 34]: An hour was allowed for rest , then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village at different points to ply their various trades -- ` Jack ' was sent with Hugo .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 42]: They wandered hither and thither for some time , Hugo watching for opportunities to do a stroke of business , but finding none -- so he finally said -- `` I see nought to steal ; it is a paltry place .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 6]: Wherefore we will beg . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 5]: `` WE , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 8]: Follow thy trade -- it befits thee .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 9]: But _ I _ will not beg . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 8]: `` Thou ` lt not beg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 9]: exclaimed Hugo , eyeing the King with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 10]: `` Prithee , since when hast thou reformed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 7]: `` What dost thou mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 3]: `` Mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 13]: Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 4]: Thou idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 12]: `` Spare thy compliments -- thy stock will last the longer .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 10]: Thy father says thou hast begged all thy days .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 4]: Mayhap he lied .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 17]: Peradventure you will even make so bold as to SAY he lied , '' scoffed Hugo .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 7]: `` Him YOU call my father ?
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 6]: Yes , he lied . ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 25]: `` Come , play not thy merry game of madman so far , mate ; use it for thy amusement , not thy hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 16]: An ' I tell him this , he will scorch thee finely for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 6]: `` Save thyself the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 6]: I will tell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 19]: `` I like thy spirit , I do in truth ; but I do not admire thy judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 21]: Bone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life , without going out of one 's way to invite them .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 14]: But a truce to these matters ; _ I _ believe your father .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 32]: I doubt not he can lie ; I doubt not he DOTH lie , upon occasion , for the best of us do that ; but there is no occasion here .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 15]: A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for nought .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 19]: But come ; sith it is thy humour to give over begging , wherewithal shall we busy ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 5]: With robbing kitchens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 18]: The King said , impatiently -- `` Have done with this folly -- you weary me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 26]: Hugo replied , with temper -- `` Now harkee , mate ; you will not beg , you will not rob ; so be it .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 10]: But I will tell you what you WILL do .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 10]: You will play decoy whilst _ I _ beg .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 11]: Refuse , an ' you think you may venture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 17]: The King was about to reply contemptuously , when Hugo said , interrupting -- `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 8]: Here comes one with a kindly face .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 9]: Now will I fall down in a fit .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 100]: When the stranger runs to me , set you up a wail , and fall upon your knees , seeming to weep ; then cry out as all the devils of misery were in your belly , and say , ` Oh , sir , it is my poor afflicted brother , and we be friendless ; o ' God 's name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful look upon a sick , forsaken , and most miserable wretch ; bestow one little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to perish ! '
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 28]: -- and mind you , keep you ON wailing , and abate not till we bilk him of his penny , else shall you rue it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 54]: Then immediately Hugo began to moan , and groan , and roll his eyes , and reel and totter about ; and when the stranger was close at hand , down he sprawled before him , with a shriek , and began to writhe and wallow in the dirt , in seeming agony .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 9]: `` O , dear , O dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 18]: cried the benevolent stranger , `` O poor soul , poor soul , how he doth suffer !
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 9]: There -- let me help thee up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 31]: `` O noble sir , forbear , and God love you for a princely gentleman -- but it giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 20]: My brother there will tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 23]: A penny , dear sir , a penny , to buy a little food ; then leave me to my sorrows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 4]: `` A penny !
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 25]: thou shalt have three , thou hapless creature , '' -- and he fumbled in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 12]: `` There , poor lad , take them and most welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 35]: Now come hither , my boy , and help me carry thy stricken brother to yon house , where -- '' `` I am not his brother , '' said the King , interrupting .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 5]: not his brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 7]: `` Oh , hear him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 9]: groaned Hugo , then privately ground his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 17]: `` He denies his own brother -- and he with one foot in the grave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 16]: `` Boy , thou art indeed hard of heart , if this is thy brother .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 3]: For shame !
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 11]: -- and he scarce able to move hand or foot .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 14]: If he is not thy brother , who is he , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 7]: `` A beggar and a thief !
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 12]: He has got your money and has picked your pocket likewise .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 25]: An ' thou would ` st do a healing miracle , lay thy staff over his shoulders and trust Providence for the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 9]: But Hugo did not tarry for the miracle .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 27]: In a moment he was up and off like the wind , the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry lustily as he went .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 34]: The King , breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for his own release , fled in the opposite direction , and did not slacken his pace until he was out of harm 's reach .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 16]: He took the first road that offered , and soon put the village behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 42]: He hurried along , as briskly as he could , during several hours , keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder for pursuit ; but his fears left him at last , and a grateful sense of security took their place .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 15]: He recognised , now , that he was hungry , and also very tired .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 24]: So he halted at a farmhouse ; but when he was about to speak , he was cut short and driven rudely away .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 6]: His clothes were against him .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 23]: He wandered on , wounded and indignant , and was resolved to put himself in the way of like treatment no more .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 50]: But hunger is pride 's master ; so , as the evening drew near , he made an attempt at another farmhouse ; but here he fared worse than before ; for he was called hard names and was promised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 18]: The night came on , chilly and overcast ; and still the footsore monarch laboured slowly on .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 26]: He was obliged to keep moving , for every time he sat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 28]: All his sensations and experiences , as he moved through the solemn gloom and the empty vastness of the night , were new and strange to him .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 49]: At intervals he heard voices approach , pass by , and fade into silence ; and as he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless drifting blur , there was something spectral and uncanny about it all that made him shudder .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 116]: Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a light -- always far away , apparently -- almost in another world ; if he heard the tinkle of a sheep 's bell , it was vague , distant , indistinct ; the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in vanishing cadences , a mournful sound ; now and then came the complaining howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest ; all sounds were remote ; they made the little King feel that all life and activity were far removed from him , and that he stood solitary , companionless , in the centre of a measureless solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 51]: He stumbled along , through the gruesome fascinations of this new experience , startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves overhead , so like human whispers they seemed to sound ; and by-and-by he came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 9]: He stepped back into the shadows and waited .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 11]: The lantern stood by the open door of a barn .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 15]: The King waited some time -- there was no sound , and nobody stirring .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 27]: He got so cold , standing still , and the hospitable barn looked so enticing , that at last he resolved to risk everything and enter .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 20]: He started swiftly and stealthily , and just as he was crossing the threshold he heard voices behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 14]: He darted behind a cask , within the barn , and stooped down .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 19]: Two farm-labourers came in , bringing the lantern with them , and fell to work , talking meanwhile .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 51]: Whilst they moved about with the light , the King made good use of his eyes and took the bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end of the place , purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 36]: He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets , midway of the route , with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the crown of England for one night .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 20]: By-and-by the men finished and went away , fastening the door behind them and taking the lantern with them .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 32]: The shivering King made for the blankets , with as good speed as the darkness would allow ; gathered them up , and then groped his way safely to the stall .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 18]: Of two of the blankets he made a bed , then covered himself with the remaining two .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 36]: He was a glad monarch , now , though the blankets were old and thin , and not quite warm enough ; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost suffocatingly powerful .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 41]: Although the King was hungry and chilly , he was also so tired and so drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage of the former , and he presently dozed off into a state of semi-consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 21]: Then , just as he was on the point of losing himself wholly , he distinctly felt something touch him !
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 13]: He was broad awake in a moment , and gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 17]: The cold horror of that mysterious touch in the dark almost made his heart stand still .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 10]: He lay motionless , and listened , scarcely breathing .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 10]: But nothing stirred , and there was no sound .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 26]: He continued to listen , and wait , during what seemed a long time , but still nothing stirred , and there was no sound .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 25]: So he began to drop into a drowse once more , at last ; and all at once he felt that mysterious touch again !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 25]: It was a grisly thing , this light touch from this noiseless and invisible presence ; it made the boy sick with ghostly fears .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 5]: What should he do ?
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 15]: That was the question ; but he did not know how to answer it .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 14]: Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly from this inscrutable horror ?
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 4]: But fly whither ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 56]: He could not get out of the barn ; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and thither in the dark , within the captivity of the four walls , with this phantom gliding after him , and visiting him with that soft hideous touch upon cheek or shoulder at every turn , was intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 19]: But to stay where he was , and endure this living death all night -- was that better ?
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 10]: What , then , was there left to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 24]: Ah , there was but one course ; he knew it well -- he must put out his hand and find that thing !
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 19]: It was easy to think this ; but it was hard to brace himself up to try it .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 46]: Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark , gingerly ; and snatched it suddenly back , with a gasp -- not because it had encountered anything , but because he had felt so sure it was just GOING to .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 22]: But the fourth time , he groped a little further , and his hand lightly swept against something soft and warm .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 36]: This petrified him , nearly , with fright ; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine the thing to be nothing else than a corpse , newly dead and still warm .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 11]: He thought he would rather die than touch it again .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 18]: But he thought this false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of human curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 29]: In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping again -- against his judgment , and without his consent -- but groping persistently on , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 36]: It encountered a bunch of long hair ; he shuddered , but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm rope ; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf !
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 17]: -- for the rope was not a rope at all , but the calf 's tail .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 79]: The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf ; but he need not have felt so about it , for it was not the calf that frightened him , but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for ; and any other boy , in those old superstitious times , would have acted and suffered just as he had done .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 47]: The King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a calf , but delighted to have the calf 's company ; for he had been feeling so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even this humble animal were welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 55]: And he had been so buffeted , so rudely entreated by his own kind , that it was a real comfort to him to feel that he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at least a soft heart and a gentle spirit , whatever loftier attributes might be lacking .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 13]: So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the calf .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 33]: While stroking its sleek warm back -- for it lay near him and within easy reach -- it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways than one .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 62]: Whereupon he re-arranged his bed , spreading it down close to the calf ; then he cuddled himself up to the calf 's back , drew the covers up over himself and his friend , and in a minute or two was as warm and comfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace of Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 13]: Pleasant thoughts came at once ; life took on a cheerfuller seeming .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 37]: He was free of the bonds of servitude and crime , free of the companionship of base and brutal outlaws ; he was warm ; he was sheltered ; in a word , he was happy .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 84]: The night wind was rising ; it swept by in fitful gusts that made the old barn quake and rattle , then its forces died down at intervals , and went moaning and wailing around corners and projections -- but it was all music to the King , now that he was snug and comfortable : let it blow and rage , let it batter and bang , let it moan and wail , he minded it not , he only enjoyed it .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 36]: He merely snuggled the closer to his friend , in a luxury of warm contentment , and drifted blissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that was full of serenity and peace .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 64]: The distant dogs howled , the melancholy kine complained , and the winds went on raging , whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the roof ; but the Majesty of England slept on , undisturbed , and the calf did the same , it being a simple creature , and not easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 3]: Chapter XIX .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 6]: The Prince with the peasants .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 36]: When the King awoke in the early morning , he found that a wet but thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy bed for itself in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 8]: Being disturbed now , it scampered away .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 15]: The boy smiled , and said , `` Poor fool , why so fearful ?
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 7]: I am as forlorn as thou .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 18]: ` Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless , who am myself so helpless .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 52]: Moreover , I owe you thanks for a good omen ; for when a king has fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him , it surely meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn , since it is plain he can no lower go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 22]: He got up and stepped out of the stall , and just then he heard the sound of children 's voices .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 13]: The barn door opened and a couple of little girls came in .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 46]: As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased , and they stopped and stood still , gazing at him with strong curiosity ; they presently began to whisper together , then they approached nearer , and stopped again to gaze and whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 11]: By-and-by they gathered courage and began to discuss him aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 11]: One said -- `` He hath a comely face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 10]: The other added -- `` And pretty hair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 8]: `` But is ill clothed enow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 8]: `` And how starved he looketh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 56]: They came still nearer , sidling shyly around and about him , examining him minutely from all points , as if he were some strange new kind of animal , but warily and watchfully the while , as if they half feared he might be a sort of animal that would bite , upon occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 48]: Finally they halted before him , holding each other 's hands for protection , and took a good satisfying stare with their innocent eyes ; then one of them plucked up all her courage and inquired with honest directness -- `` Who art thou , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 12]: `` I am the King , '' was the grave answer .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 23]: The children gave a little start , and their eyes spread themselves wide open and remained so during a speechless half minute .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 10]: Then curiosity broke the silence -- `` The KING ?
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 4]: What King ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 7]: `` The King of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 32]: The children looked at each other -- then at him -- then at each other again -- wonderingly , perplexedly ; then one said -- `` Didst hear him , Margery ?
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 8]: -- he said he is the King .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 6]: Can that be true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 11]: `` How can it be else but true , Prissy ?
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 6]: Would he say a lie ?
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 19]: For look you , Prissy , an ' it were not true , it WOULD be a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 5]: It surely would be .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 5]: Now think o n't .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 21]: For all things that be not true , be lies -- thou canst make nought else out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 27]: It was a good tight argument , without a leak in it anywhere ; and it left Prissy 's half-doubts not a leg to stand on .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 31]: She considered a moment , then put the King upon his honour with the simple remark -- `` If thou art truly the King , then I believe thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 8]: `` I am truly the King . ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 5]: This settled the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 54]: His Majesty 's royalty was accepted without further question or discussion , and the two little girls began at once to inquire into how he came to be where he was , and how he came to be so unroyally clad , and whither he was bound , and all about his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 54]: It was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not be scoffed at or doubted ; so he told his tale with feeling , forgetting even his hunger for the time ; and it was received with the deepest and tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 38]: But when he got down to his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without food , they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a breakfast for him .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 68]: The King was cheerful and happy now , and said to himself , `` When I am come to mine own again , I will always honour little children , remembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time of trouble ; whilst they that were older , and thought themselves wiser , mocked at me and held me for a liar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 28]: The children 's mother received the King kindly , and was full of pity ; for his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her womanly heart .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 24]: She was a widow , and rather poor ; consequently she had seen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 84]: She imagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or keepers ; so she tried to find out whence he had come , in order that she might take measures to return him ; but all her references to neighbouring towns and villages , and all her inquiries in the same line went for nothing -- the boy 's face , and his answers , too , showed that the things she was talking of were not familiar to him .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 44]: He spoke earnestly and simply about court matters , and broke down , more than once , when speaking of the late King ` his father ' ; but whenever the conversation changed to baser topics , he lost interest and became silent .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 13]: The woman was mightily puzzled ; but she did not give up .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 23]: As she proceeded with her cooking , she set herself to contriving devices to surprise the boy into betraying his real secret .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 74]: She talked about cattle -- he showed no concern ; then about sheep -- the same result : so her guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error ; she talked about mills ; and about weavers , tinkers , smiths , trades and tradesmen of all sorts ; and about Bedlam , and jails , and charitable retreats : but no matter , she was baffled at all points .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 19]: Not altogether , either ; for she argued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 22]: Yes , she was sure she was on the right track , now ; he must have been a house servant .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 7]: So she led up to that .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 6]: But the result was discouraging .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 22]: The subject of sweeping appeared to weary him ; fire-building failed to stir him ; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 23]: The goodwife touched , with a perishing hope , and rather as a matter of form , upon the subject of cooking .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 17]: To her surprise , and her vast delight , the King 's face lighted at once !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 32]: Ah , she had hunted him down at last , she thought ; and she was right proud , too , of the devious shrewdness and tact which had accomplished it .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 76]: Her tired tongue got a chance to rest , now ; for the King 's , inspired by gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering pots and pans , turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an eloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes , that within three minutes the woman said to herself , `` Of a truth I was right -- he hath holpen in a kitchen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 28]: Then he broadened his bill of fare , and discussed it with such appreciation and animation , that the goodwife said to herself , `` Good lack !
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 14]: how can he know so many dishes , and so fine ones withal ?
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 13]: For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 6]: Ah , now I see !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 34]: ragged outcast as he is , he must have served in the palace before his reason went astray ; yes , he must have helped in the very kitchen of the King himself !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 6]: I will test him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 52]: Full of eagerness to prove her sagacity , she told the King to mind the cooking a moment -- hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or two , if he chose ; then she went out of the room and gave her children a sign to follow after .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 38]: The King muttered -- `` Another English king had a commission like to this , in a bygone time -- it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the great Alfred stooped to assume .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 20]: But I will try to better serve my trust than he ; for he let the cakes burn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 44]: The intent was good , but the performance was not answerable to it , for this King , like the other one , soon fell into deep thinkings concerning his vast affairs , and the same calamity resulted -- the cookery got burned .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 30]: The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire destruction ; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a brisk and cordial tongue-lashing .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 26]: Then , seeing how troubled he was over his violated trust , she softened at once , and was all goodness and gentleness toward him .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 18]: The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal , and was greatly refreshed and gladdened by it .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 34]: It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious feature , that rank was waived on both sides ; yet neither recipient of the favour was aware that it had been extended .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 145]: The goodwife had intended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner , like any other tramp or like a dog ; but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had given him , that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters , on ostensible terms of equality with them ; and the King , on his side , was so remorseful for having broken his trust , after the family had been so kind to him , that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself to the family level , instead of requiring the woman and her children to stand and wait upon him , while he occupied their table in the solitary state due to his birth and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 9]: It does us all good to unbend sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 44]: This good woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a tramp ; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious humility toward a humble peasant woman .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 16]: When breakfast was over , the housewife told the King to wash up the dishes .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 48]: This command was a staggerer , for a moment , and the King came near rebelling ; but then he said to himself , `` Alfred the Great watched the cakes ; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too -- therefore will I essay it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 31]: He made a sufficiently poor job of it ; and to his surprise too , for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 17]: It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work , but he finished it at last .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 27]: He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now ; however , he was not to lose this thrifty dame 's society so easily .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 25]: She furnished him some little odds and ends of employment , which he got through with after a fair fashion and with some credit .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 37]: Then she set him and the little girls to paring some winter apples ; but he was so awkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to grind .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 51]: Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in story-books and histories , and so he was half-minded to resign .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 24]: And when , just after the noonday dinner , the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown , he did resign .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 43]: At least he was just going to resign -- for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere , and it seemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing -- when there was an interruption .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 18]: The interruption was John Canty -- with a peddler 's pack on his back -- and Hugo .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 47]: The King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they had had a chance to see him ; so he said nothing about drawing the line , but took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way , without a word .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 20]: He left the creatures in an out-house , and hurried on , into a narrow lane at the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 3]: Chapter XX .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 6]: The Prince and the hermit .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 37]: The high hedge hid him from the house , now ; and so , under the impulse of a deadly fright , he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 26]: He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter of the forest ; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 34]: That was sufficient ; he did not wait to scan them critically , but hurried on , and never abated his pace till he was far within the twilight depths of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 13]: Then he stopped ; being persuaded that he was now tolerably safe .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 22]: He listened intently , but the stillness was profound and solemn -- awful , even , and depressing to the spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 42]: At wide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds , but they were so remote , and hollow , and mysterious , that they seemed not to be real sounds , but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed ones .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 14]: So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 44]: It was his purpose , in the beginning , to stay where he was the rest of the day ; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body , and he was at last obliged to resume movement in order to get warm .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 22]: He struck straight through the forest , hoping to pierce to a road presently , but he was disappointed in this .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 20]: He travelled on and on ; but the farther he went , the denser the wood became , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 19]: The gloom began to thicken , by-and-by , and the King realised that the night was coming on .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 58]: It made him shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place ; so he tried to hurry faster , but he only made the less speed , for he could not now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously ; consequently he kept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 16]: And how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light !
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 14]: He approached it warily , stopping often to look about him and listen .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 12]: It came from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 32]: He heard a voice , now , and felt a disposition to run and hide ; but he changed his mind at once , for this voice was praying , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 21]: He glided to the one window of the hut , raised himself on tiptoe , and stole a glance within .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 109]: The room was small ; its floor was the natural earth , beaten hard by use ; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or two ; near it was a pail , a cup , a basin , and two or three pots and pans ; there was a short bench and a three-legged stool ; on the hearth the remains of a faggot fire were smouldering ; before a shrine , which was lighted by a single candle , knelt an aged man , and on an old wooden box at his side lay an open book and a human skull .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 37]: The man was of large , bony frame ; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white ; he was clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his heels .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 6]: `` A holy hermit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 14]: said the King to himself ; `` now am I indeed fortunate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 11]: The hermit rose from his knees ; the King knocked .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 8]: A deep voice responded -- `` Enter !
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 17]: -- but leave sin behind , for the ground whereon thou shalt stand is holy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 7]: The King entered , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 22]: The hermit turned a pair of gleaming , unrestful eyes upon him , and said -- `` Who art thou ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 15]: `` I am the King , '' came the answer , with placid simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 6]: `` Welcome , King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 7]: cried the hermit , with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 52]: Then , bustling about with feverish activity , and constantly saying , `` Welcome , welcome , '' he arranged his bench , seated the King on it , by the hearth , threw some faggots on the fire , and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous stride .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 3]: `` Welcome !
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 17]: Many have sought sanctuary here , but they were not worthy , and were turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 46]: But a King who casts his crown away , and despises the vain splendours of his office , and clothes his body in rags , to devote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh -- he is worthy , he is welcome !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 13]: -- here shall he abide all his days till death come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 42]: The King hastened to interrupt and explain , but the hermit paid no attention to him -- did not even hear him , apparently , but went right on with his talk , with a raised voice and a growing energy .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 9]: `` And thou shalt be at peace here .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 27]: None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee with supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God hath moved thee to abandon .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 57]: Thou shalt pray here ; thou shalt study the Book ; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world , and upon the sublimities of the world to come ; thou shalt feed upon crusts and herbs , and scourge thy body with whips , daily , to the purifying of thy soul .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 56]: Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin ; thou shalt drink water only ; and thou shalt be at peace ; yes , wholly at peace ; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again , baffled ; he shall not find thee , he shall not molest thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 20]: The old man , still pacing back and forth , ceased to speak aloud , and began to mutter .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 23]: The King seized this opportunity to state his case ; and he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 12]: But the hermit went on muttering , and gave no heed .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 16]: And still muttering , he approached the King and said impressively -- '' ` Sh !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 8]: I will tell you a secret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 17]: He bent down to impart it , but checked himself , and assumed a listening attitude .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 51]: After a moment or two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening , put his head out , and peered around in the gloaming , then came tiptoeing back again , put his face close down to the King 's , and whispered -- `` I am an archangel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 33]: The King started violently , and said to himself , `` Would God I were with the outlaws again ; for lo , now am I the prisoner of a madman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 13]: His apprehensions were heightened , and they showed plainly in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 17]: In a low excited voice the hermit continued -- `` I see you feel my atmosphere !
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 7]: There 's awe in your face !
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 21]: None may be in this atmosphere and not be thus affected ; for it is the very atmosphere of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 13]: I go thither and return , in the twinkling of an eye .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 27]: I was made an archangel on this very spot , it is five years ago , by angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 10]: Their presence filled this place with an intolerable brightness .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 8]: And they knelt to me , King !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 7]: yes , they knelt to me !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 7]: for I was greater than they .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 16]: I have walked in the courts of heaven , and held speech with the patriarchs .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 11]: Touch my hand -- be not afraid -- touch it .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 19]: There -- now thou hast touched a hand which has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 19]: For I have walked in the golden courts ; I have seen the Deity face to face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 40]: He paused , to give this speech effect ; then his face suddenly changed , and he started to his feet again saying , with angry energy , `` Yes , I am an archangel ; A MERE ARCHANGEL !
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 8]: -- I that might have been pope !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 5]: It is verily true .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 24]: I was told it from heaven in a dream , twenty years ago ; ah , yes , I was to be pope !
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 44]: -- and I SHOULD have been pope , for Heaven had said it -- but the King dissolved my religious house , and I , poor obscure unfriended monk , was cast homeless upon the world , robbed of my mighty destiny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 50]: Here he began to mumble again , and beat his forehead in futile rage , with his fist ; now and then articulating a venomous curse , and now and then a pathetic `` Wherefore I am nought but an archangel -- I that should have been pope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 18]: So he went on , for an hour , whilst the poor little King sat and suffered .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 17]: Then all at once the old man 's frenzy departed , and he became all gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 33]: His voice softened , he came down out of his clouds , and fell to prattling along so simply and so humanly , that he soon won the King 's heart completely .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 86]: The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and made him comfortable ; doctored his small bruises and abrasions with a deft and tender hand ; and then set about preparing and cooking a supper -- chatting pleasantly all the time , and occasionally stroking the lad 's cheek or patting his head , in such a gently caressing way that in a little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were changed to reverence and affection for the man .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 79]: This happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper ; then , after a prayer before the shrine , the hermit put the boy to bed , in a small adjoining room , tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother might ; and so , with a parting caress , left him and sat down by the fire , and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 28]: Presently he paused ; then tapped his forehead several times with his fingers , as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 5]: Apparently he was unsuccessful .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 22]: Now he started quickly up , and entered his guest 's room , and said -- `` Thou art King ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' was the response , drowsily uttered .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 5]: `` What King ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 5]: `` Of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 4]: `` Of England ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: Then Henry is gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 7]: `` Alack , it is so .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 6]: I am his son . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 22]: A black frown settled down upon the hermit 's face , and he clenched his bony hands with a vindictive energy .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 37]: He stood a few moments , breathing fast and swallowing repeatedly , then said in a husky voice -- `` Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and homeless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 5]: There was no response .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 19]: The old man bent down and scanned the boy 's reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 23]: `` He sleeps -- sleeps soundly ; '' and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of evil satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 10]: A smile flitted across the dreaming boy 's features .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 18]: The hermit muttered , `` So -- his heart is happy ; '' and he turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 46]: He went stealthily about the place , seeking here and there for something ; now and then halting to listen , now and then jerking his head around and casting a quick glance toward the bed ; and always muttering , always mumbling to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 19]: At last he found what he seemed to want -- a rusty old butcher knife and a whetstone .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 32]: Then he crept to his place by the fire , sat himself down , and began to whet the knife softly on the stone , still muttering , mumbling , ejaculating .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 21]: The winds sighed around the lonely place , the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the distances .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 38]: The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at the old man from cracks and coverts , but he went on with his work , rapt , absorbed , and noted none of these things .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 21]: At long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife , and nodded his head with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 17]: `` It grows sharper , '' he said ; `` yes , it grows sharper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 49]: He took no note of the flight of time , but worked tranquilly on , entertaining himself with his thoughts , which broke out occasionally in articulate speech -- `` His father wrought us evil , he destroyed us -- and is gone down into the eternal fires !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 8]: Yes , down into the eternal fires !
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 23]: He escaped us -- but it was God 's will , yes it was God 's will , we must not repine .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 8]: But he hath not escaped the fires !
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 23]: No , he hath not escaped the fires , the consuming , unpitying , remorseless fires -- and THEY are everlasting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 37]: And so he wrought , and still wrought -- mumbling , chuckling a low rasping chuckle at times -- and at times breaking again into words -- `` It was his father that did it all .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 15]: I am but an archangel ; but for him I should be pope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 4]: The King stirred .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 25]: The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside , and went down upon his knees , bending over the prostrate form with his knife uplifted .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 40]: The boy stirred again ; his eyes came open for an instant , but there was no speculation in them , they saw nothing ; the next moment his tranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 57]: The hermit watched and listened , for a time , keeping his position and scarcely breathing ; then he slowly lowered his arms , and presently crept away , saying , -- `` It is long past midnight ; it is not best that he should cry out , lest by accident someone be passing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 43]: He glided about his hovel , gathering a rag here , a thong there , and another one yonder ; then he returned , and by careful and gentle handling he managed to tie the King 's ankles together without waking him .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 66]: Next he essayed to tie the wrists ; he made several attempts to cross them , but the boy always drew one hand or the other away , just as the cord was ready to be applied ; but at last , when the archangel was almost ready to despair , the boy crossed his hands himself , and the next moment they were bound .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 49]: Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper 's chin and brought up over his head and tied fast -- and so softly , so gradually , and so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted , that the boy slept peacefully through it all without stirring .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 3]: Chapter XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 5]: Hendon to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 18]: The old man glided away , stooping , stealthy , cat-like , and brought the low bench .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 92]: He seated himself upon it , half his body in the dim and flickering light , and the other half in shadow ; and so , with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy , he kept his patient vigil there , heedless of the drift of time , and softly whetted his knife , and mumbled and chuckled ; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as a grizzly , monstrous spider , gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and helpless in his web .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 43]: After a long while , the old man , who was still gazing , -- yet not seeing , his mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction , -- observed , on a sudden , that the boy 's eyes were open !
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 5]: wide open and staring !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 10]: -- staring up in frozen horror at the knife .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 38]: The smile of a gratified devil crept over the old man 's face , and he said , without changing his attitude or his occupation -- `` Son of Henry the Eighth , hast thou prayed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 36]: The boy struggled helplessly in his bonds , and at the same time forced a smothered sound through his closed jaws , which the hermit chose to interpret as an affirmative answer to his question .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 5]: `` Then pray again .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 8]: Pray the prayer for the dying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 13]: A shudder shook the boy 's frame , and his face blenched .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 82]: Then he struggled again to free himself -- turning and twisting himself this way and that ; tugging frantically , fiercely , desperately -- but uselessly -- to burst his fetters ; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him , and nodded his head , and placidly whetted his knife ; mumbling , from time to time , `` The moments are precious , they are few and precious -- pray the prayer for the dying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 15]: The boy uttered a despairing groan , and ceased from his struggles , panting .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 32]: The tears came , then , and trickled , one after the other , down his face ; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the savage old man .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 35]: The dawn was coming now ; the hermit observed it , and spoke up sharply , with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice -- `` I may not indulge this ecstasy longer !
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 6]: The night is already gone .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 17]: It seems but a moment -- only a moment ; would it had endured a year !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 29]: Seed of the Church 's spoiler , close thy perishing eyes , an ' thou fearest to look upon -- '' The rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 22]: The old man sank upon his knees , his knife in his hand , and bent himself over the moaning boy .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 32]: There was a sound of voices near the cabin -- the knife dropped from the hermit 's hand ; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 31]: The sounds increased , and presently the voices became rough and angry ; then came blows , and cries for help ; then a clatter of swift footsteps , retreating .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 18]: Immediately came a succession of thundering knocks upon the cabin door , followed by -- `` Hullo-o-o !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 2]: Open !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 12]: And despatch , in the name of all the devils ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 26]: Oh , this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King 's ears ; for it was Miles Hendon 's voice !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 51]: The hermit , grinding his teeth in impotent rage , moved swiftly out of the bedchamber , closing the door behind him ; and straightway the King heard a talk , to this effect , proceeding from the ` chapel ' : -- `` Homage and greeting , reverend sir !
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 9]: Where is the boy -- MY boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 7]: `` What boy , friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 4]: `` What boy !
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 13]: Lie me no lies , sir priest , play me no deceptions !
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 10]: -- I am not in the humour for it .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 40]: Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I judged did steal him from me , and I made them confess ; they said he was at large again , and they had tracked him to your door .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 7]: They showed me his very footprints .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 25]: Now palter no more ; for look you , holy sir , an ' thou produce him not -- Where is the boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 18]: `` O good sir , peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried here the night .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 25]: If such as you take an interest in such as he , know , then , that I have sent him of an errand .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 7]: He will be back anon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 4]: `` How soon ?
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 3]: How soon ?
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 13]: Come , waste not the time -- can not I overtake him ?
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 8]: How soon will he be back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 14]: `` Thou need ` st not stir ; he will return quickly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 7]: `` So be it , then .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 6]: I will try to wait .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 3]: But stop !
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 8]: -- YOU sent him of an errand ?
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 3]: -- you !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 11]: Verily this is a lie -- he would not go .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 17]: He would pull thy old beard , an ' thou didst offer him such an insolence .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 11]: Thou hast lied , friend ; thou hast surely lied !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 13]: He would not go for thee , nor for any man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 10]: `` For any MAN -- no ; haply not .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 8]: But I am not a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 3]: `` WHAT !
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 13]: Now o ' God 's name what art thou , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 12]: `` It is a secret -- mark thou reveal it not .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 6]: I am an archangel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 27]: There was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon -- not altogether unprofane -- followed by -- `` This doth well and truly account for his complaisance !
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 38]: Right well I knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any mortal ; but , lord , even a king must obey when an archangel gives the word o ' command !
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 6]: Let me -- ` sh !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 6]: What noise was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 66]: All this while the little King had been yonder , alternately quaking with terror and trembling with hope ; and all the while , too , he had thrown all the strength he could into his anguished moanings , constantly expecting them to reach Hendon 's ear , but always realising , with bitterness , that they failed , or at least made no impression .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 43]: So this last remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying ; and he exerted himself once more , and with all his energy , just as the hermit was saying -- `` Noise ?
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 7]: I heard only the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 5]: `` Mayhap it was .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 7]: Yes , doubtless that was it .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 14]: I have been hearing it faintly all the -- there it is again !
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 6]: It is not the wind !
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 5]: What an odd sound !
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 9]: Come , we will hunt it out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 9]: Now the King 's joy was nearly insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 25]: His tired lungs did their utmost -- and hopefully , too -- but the sealed jaws and the muffling sheepskin sadly crippled the effort .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 29]: Then the poor fellow 's heart sank , to hear the hermit say -- `` Ah , it came from without -- I think from the copse yonder .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 9]: Come , I will lead the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 30]: The King heard the two pass out , talking ; heard their footsteps die quickly away -- then he was alone with a boding , brooding , awful silence .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 31]: It seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching again -- and this time he heard an added sound , -- the trampling of hoofs , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 13]: Then he heard Hendon say -- `` I will not wait longer .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 6]: I CAN NOT wait longer .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 10]: He has lost his way in this thick wood .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 5]: Which direction took he ?
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 9]: Quick -- point it out to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 13]: `` He -- but wait ; I will go with thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 5]: `` Good -- good !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: Why , truly thou art better than thy looks .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 18]: Marry I do not think there 's not another archangel with so right a heart as thine .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 3]: Wilt ride ?
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 32]: Wilt take the wee donkey that 's for my boy , or wilt thou fork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have provided for myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 33]: -- and had been cheated in too , had he cost but the indifferent sum of a month 's usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker out of work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 25]: `` No -- ride thy mule , and lead thine ass ; I am surer on mine own feet , and will walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 30]: `` Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my hands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 47]: Then followed a confusion of kicks , cuffs , tramplings and plungings , accompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses , and finally a bitter apostrophe to the mule , which must have broken its spirit , for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 18]: With unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and footsteps fade away and die out .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 21]: All hope forsook him , now , for the moment , and a dull despair settled down upon his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 50]: `` My only friend is deceived and got rid of , '' he said ; `` the hermit will return and -- '' He finished with a gasp ; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with his bonds again , that he shook off the smothering sheepskin .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 8]: And now he heard the door open !
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 19]: The sound chilled him to the marrow -- already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 23]: Horror made him close his eyes ; horror made him open them again -- and before him stood John Canty and Hugo !
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 9]: He would have said `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 7]: if his jaws had been free .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 32]: A moment or two later his limbs were at liberty , and his captors , each gripping him by an arm , were hurrying him with all speed through the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 3]: Chapter XXII .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 5]: A victim of treachery .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 48]: Once more ` King Foo-foo the First ' was roving with the tramps and outlaws , a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries , and sometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and Hugo when the Ruffler 's back was turned .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 9]: None but Canty and Hugo really disliked him .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 15]: Some of the others liked him , and all admired his pluck and spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 54]: During two or three days , Hugo , in whose ward and charge the King was , did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable ; and at night , during the customary orgies , he amused the company by putting small indignities upon him -- always as if by accident .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 60]: Twice he stepped upon the King 's toes -- accidentally -- and the King , as became his royalty , was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it ; but the third time Hugo entertained himself in that way , the King felled him to the ground with a cudgel , to the prodigious delight of the tribe .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 25]: Hugo , consumed with anger and shame , sprang up , seized a cudgel , and came at his small adversary in a fury .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 16]: Instantly a ring was formed around the gladiators , and the betting and cheering began .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 8]: But poor Hugo stood no chance whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 41]: His frantic and lubberly ` prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against an arm which had been trained by the first masters of Europe in single-stick , quarter-staff , and every art and trick of swordsmanship .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 78]: The little King stood , alert but at graceful ease , and caught and turned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which set the motley on-lookers wild with admiration ; and every now and then , when his practised eye detected an opening , and a lightning-swift rap upon Hugo 's head followed as a result , the storm of cheers and laughter that swept the place was something wonderful to hear .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 99]: At the end of fifteen minutes , Hugo , all battered , bruised , and the target for a pitiless bombardment of ridicule , slunk from the field ; and the unscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the shoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the Ruffler , where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the Game-Cocks ; his meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled , and a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who should thenceforth utter it .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 13]: All attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 16]: He had stubbornly refused to act ; moreover , he was always trying to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 30]: He had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen , the first day of his return ; he not only came forth empty-handed , but tried to rouse the housemates .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 52]: He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work ; he would not work ; moreover , he threatened the tinker with his own soldering-iron ; and finally both Hugo and the tinker found their hands full with the mere matter of keeping his from getting away .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 24]: He delivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered his liberties or tried to force him to service .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 50]: He was sent out , in Hugo 's charge , in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby , to beg ; but the result was not encouraging -- he declined to plead for the mendicants , or be a party to their cause in any way .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 62]: Thus several days went by ; and the miseries of this tramping life , and the weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it , became gradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at last to feel that his release from the hermit 's knife must prove only a temporary respite from death , at best .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 24]: But at night , in his dreams , these things were forgotten , and he was on his throne , and master again .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 47]: This , of course , intensified the sufferings of the awakening -- so the mortifications of each succeeding morning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the combat with Hugo , grew bitterer and bitterer , and harder and harder to bear .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 20]: The morning after that combat , Hugo got up with a heart filled with vengeful purposes against the King .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 8]: He had two plans , in particular .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 60]: One was to inflict upon the lad what would be , to his proud spirit and ` imagined ' royalty , a peculiar humiliation ; and if he failed to accomplish this , his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the King , and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 68]: In pursuance of the first plan , he purposed to put a ` clime ' upon the King 's leg ; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and perfect degree ; and as soon as the clime should operate , he meant to get Canty 's help , and FORCE the King to expose his leg in the highway and beg for alms .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 14]: ` Clime ' was the cant term for a sore , artificially created .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 43]: To make a clime , the operator made a paste or poultice of unslaked lime , soap , and the rust of old iron , and spread it upon a piece of leather , which was then bound tightly upon the leg .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 38]: This would presently fret off the skin , and make the flesh raw and angry-looking ; blood was then rubbed upon the limb , which , being fully dried , took on a dark and repulsive colour .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 32]: Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in a cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen , and move the compassion of the passer-by .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 62]: -LCB- 8 -RCB- Hugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the soldering-iron ; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp , and as soon as they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker held him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 41]: The King raged and stormed , and promised to hang the two the moment the sceptre was in his hand again ; but they kept a firm grip upon him and enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 28]: This continued until the poultice began to bite ; and in no long time its work would have been perfected , if there had been no interruption .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 43]: But there was ; for about this time the ` slave ' who had made the speech denouncing England 's laws , appeared on the scene , and put an end to the enterprise , and stripped off the poultice and bandage .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 57]: The King wanted to borrow his deliverer 's cudgel and warm the jackets of the two rascals on the spot ; but the man said no , it would bring trouble -- leave the matter till night ; the whole tribe being together , then , the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 65]: He marched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler , who listened , pondered , and then decided that the King should not be again detailed to beg , since it was plain he was worthy of something higher and better -- wherefore , on the spot he promoted him from the mendicant rank and appointed him to steal !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 4]: Hugo was overjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 44]: He had already tried to make the King steal , and failed ; but there would be no more trouble of that sort , now , for of course the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered directly from head-quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 90]: So he planned a raid for that very afternoon , purposing to get the King in the law 's grip in the course of it ; and to do it , too , with such ingenious strategy , that it should seem to be accidental and unintentional ; for the King of the Game-Cocks was popular now , and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular member who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him over to the common enemy , the law .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 64]: All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village with his prey ; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after another , the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil purpose , and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and get free of his infamous captivity for ever .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 47]: Both threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities ; for both , in their secret hearts , were resolved to make absolutely sure work this time , and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into any venture that had much uncertainty about it .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 6]: Hugo 's chance came first .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 18]: For at last a woman approached who carried a fat package of some sort in a basket .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 44]: Hugo 's eyes sparkled with sinful pleasure as he said to himself , `` Breath o ' my life , an ' I can but put THAT upon him , 't is good-den and God keep thee , King of the Game-Cocks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 51]: He waited and watched -- outwardly patient , but inwardly consuming with excitement -- till the woman had passed by , and the time was ripe ; then said , in a low voice -- `` Tarry here till I come again , '' and darted stealthily after the prey .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 28]: The King 's heart was filled with joy -- he could make his escape , now , if Hugo 's quest only carried him far enough away .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 9]: But he was to have no such luck .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 30]: Hugo crept behind the woman , snatched the package , and came running back , wrapping it in an old piece of blanket which he carried on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 34]: The hue and cry was raised in a moment , by the woman , who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden , although she had not seen the pilfering done .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 31]: Hugo thrust the bundle into the King 's hands without halting , saying -- `` Now speed ye after me with the rest , and cry ` Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 8]: but mind ye lead them astray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 43]: The next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked alley -- and in another moment or two he lounged into view again , looking innocent and indifferent , and took up a position behind a post to watch results .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 75]: The insulted King threw the bundle on the ground ; and the blanket fell away from it just as the woman arrived , with an augmenting crowd at her heels ; she seized the King 's wrist with one hand , snatched up her bundle with the other , and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy while he struggled , without success , to free himself from her grip .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 50]: Hugo had seen enough -- his enemy was captured and the law would get him , now -- so he slipped away , jubilant and chuckling , and wended campwards , framing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler 's crew as he strode along .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 42]: The King continued to struggle in the woman 's strong grasp , and now and then cried out in vexation -- `` Unhand me , thou foolish creature ; it was not I that bereaved thee of thy paltry goods . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 101]: The crowd closed around , threatening the King and calling him names ; a brawny blacksmith in leather apron , and sleeves rolled to his elbows , made a reach for him , saying he would trounce him well , for a lesson ; but just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing force upon the man 's arm , flat side down , the fantastic owner of it remarking pleasantly , at the same time -- `` Marry , good souls , let us proceed gently , not with ill blood and uncharitable words .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 15]: This is matter for the law 's consideration , not private and unofficial handling .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 10]: Loose thy hold from the boy , goodwife . ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 41]: The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance , then went muttering away , rubbing his arm ; the woman released the boy 's wrist reluctantly ; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly , but prudently closed their mouths .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 44]: The King sprang to his deliverer 's side , with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes , exclaiming -- `` Thou hast lagged sorely , but thou comest in good season , now , Sir Miles ; carve me this rabble to rags ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 3]: Chapter XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: The Prince a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 40]: Hendon forced back a smile , and bent down and whispered in the King 's ear -- `` Softly , softly , my prince , wag thy tongue warily -- nay , suffer it not to wag at all .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 13]: Trust in me -- all shall go well in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 10]: Then he added to himself : `` SIR Miles !
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 12]: Bless me , I had totally forgot I was a knight !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 22]: Lord , how marvellous a thing it is , the grip his memory doth take upon his quaint and crazy fancies !
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 63]: ... An empty and foolish title is mine , and yet it is something to have deserved it ; for I think it is more honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows , than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of the REAL kingdoms of this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 49]: The crowd fell apart to admit a constable , who approached and was about to lay his hand upon the King 's shoulder , when Hendon said -- `` Gently , good friend , withhold your hand -- he shall go peaceably ; I am responsible for that .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 8]: Lead on , we will follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 25]: The officer led , with the woman and her bundle ; Miles and the King followed after , with the crowd at their heels .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 47]: The King was inclined to rebel ; but Hendon said to him in a low voice -- `` Reflect , Sire -- your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty ; shall their source resist them , yet require the branches to respect them ?
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 48]: Apparently one of these laws has been broken ; when the King is on his throne again , can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was seemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and submitted to its authority ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 42]: `` Thou art right ; say no more ; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King of England requires a subject to suffer , under the law , he will himself suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 48]: When the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the peace , she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who had committed the theft ; there was none able to show the contrary , so the King stood convicted .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 52]: The bundle was now unrolled , and when the contents proved to be a plump little dressed pig , the judge looked troubled , whilst Hendon turned pale , and his body was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay ; but the King remained unmoved , protected by his ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 31]: The judge meditated , during an ominous pause , then turned to the woman , with the question -- `` What dost thou hold this property to be worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 29]: The woman courtesied and replied -- `` Three shillings and eightpence , your worship -- I could not abate a penny and set forth the value honestly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 28]: The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd , then nodded to the constable , and said -- `` Clear the court and close the doors . ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 4]: It was done .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 17]: None remained but the two officials , the accused , the accuser , and Miles Hendon .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 29]: This latter was rigid and colourless , and on his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered , broke and blended together , and trickled down his face .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 59]: The judge turned to the woman again , and said , in a compassionate voice -- '' 'T is a poor ignorant lad , and mayhap was driven hard by hunger , for these be grievous times for the unfortunate ; mark you , he hath not an evil face -- but when hunger driveth -- Good woman !
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 26]: dost know that when one steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha ` penny the law saith he shall HANG for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 23]: The little King started , wide-eyed with consternation , but controlled himself and held his peace ; but not so the woman .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 25]: She sprang to her feet , shaking with fright , and cried out -- `` Oh , good lack , what have I done !
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 14]: God-a-mercy , I would not hang the poor thing for the whole world !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 21]: Ah , save me from this , your worship -- what shall I do , what CAN I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 32]: The justice maintained his judicial composure , and simply said -- `` Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value , since it is not yet writ upon the record . ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 26]: `` Then in God 's name call the pig eightpence , and heaven bless the day that freed my conscience of this awesome thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 28]: Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight ; and surprised the King and wounded his dignity , by throwing his arms around him and hugging him .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 32]: The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig ; and when the constable opened the door for her , he followed her out into the narrow hall .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 10]: The justice proceeded to write in his record book .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 30]: Hendon , always alert , thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman out ; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 33]: He heard a conversation to this effect -- `` It is a fat pig , and promises good eating ; I will buy it of thee ; here is the eightpence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 5]: `` Eightpence , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 8]: Thou ` lt do no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 29]: It cost me three shillings and eightpence , good honest coin of the last reign , that old Harry that 's just dead ne'er touched or tampered with .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 7]: A fig for thy eightpence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 8]: `` Stands the wind in that quarter ?
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 18]: Thou wast under oath , and so swore falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 15]: Come straightway back with me before his worship , and answer for the crime !
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 9]: -- and then the lad will hang . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 16]: `` There , there , dear heart , say no more , I am content .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 14]: Give me the eightpence , and hold thy peace about the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 29]: The woman went off crying : Hendon slipped back into the court room , and the constable presently followed , after hiding his prize in some convenient place .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 37]: The justice wrote a while longer , then read the King a wise and kindly lecture , and sentenced him to a short imprisonment in the common jail , to be followed by a public flogging .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 47]: The astounded King opened his mouth , and was probably going to order the good judge to be beheaded on the spot ; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon , and succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 29]: Hendon took him by the hand , now , made reverence to the justice , and the two departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 34]: The moment the street was reached , the inflamed monarch halted , snatched away his hand , and exclaimed -- `` Idiot , dost imagine I will enter a common jail ALIVE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 16]: Hendon bent down and said , somewhat sharply -- `` WILL you trust in me ?
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 2]: Peace !
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 10]: and forbear to worsen our chances with dangerous speech .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 44]: What God wills , will happen ; thou canst not hurry it , thou canst not alter it ; therefore wait , and be patient -- ` twill be time enow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 6]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- Chapter XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 3]: The escape .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 8]: The short winter day was nearly ended .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 51]: The streets were deserted , save for a few random stragglers , and these hurried straight along , with the intent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands as quickly as possible , and then snugly house themselves from the rising wind and the gathering twilight .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 28]: They looked neither to the right nor to the left ; they paid no attention to our party , they did not even seem to see them .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 23]: Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his way to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 15]: By-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square , and proceeded to cross it .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 48]: When he had reached the middle of it , Hendon laid his hand upon his arm , and said in a low voice -- `` Bide a moment , good sir , there is none in hearing , and I would say a word to thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 19]: `` My duty forbids it , sir ; prithee hinder me not , the night comes on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 12]: `` Stay , nevertheless , for the matter concerns thee nearly .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 18]: Turn thy back a moment and seem not to see : LET THIS POOR LAD ESCAPE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: `` This to me , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 14]: I arrest thee in -- '' `` Nay , be not too hasty .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 47]: See thou be careful and commit no foolish error , '' -- then he shut his voice down to a whisper , and said in the man 's ear -- `` the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck , man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 63]: The poor constable , taken by surprise , was speechless , at first , then found his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening ; but Hendon was tranquil , and waited with patience till his breath was spent ; then said -- `` I have a liking to thee , friend , and would not willingly see thee come to harm .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 10]: Observe , I heard it all -- every word .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 8]: I will prove it to thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 36]: Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman had had together in the hall , word for word , and ended with -- `` There -- have I set it forth correctly ?
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 19]: Should not I be able to set it forth correctly before the judge , if occasion required ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 48]: The man was dumb with fear and distress , for a moment ; then he rallied , and said with forced lightness -- '' 'T is making a mighty matter , indeed , out of a jest ; I but plagued the woman for mine amusement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 11]: `` Kept you the woman 's pig for amusement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 22]: The man answered sharply -- `` Nought else , good sir -- I tell thee 't was but a jest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 97]: `` I do begin to believe thee , '' said Hendon , with a perplexing mixture of mockery and half-conviction in his tone ; `` but tarry thou here a moment whilst I run and ask his worship -- for nathless , he being a man experienced in law , in jests , in -- '' He was moving away , still talking ; the constable hesitated , fidgeted , spat out an oath or two , then cried out -- `` Hold , hold , good sir -- prithee wait a little -- the judge !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 18]: Why , man , he hath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse !
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 9]: -- come , and we will speak further .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 3]: Ods body !
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 17]: I seem to be in evil case -- and all for an innocent and thoughtless pleasantry .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 29]: I am a man of family ; and my wife and little ones -- List to reason , good your worship : what wouldst thou of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 45]: `` Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a hundred thousand -- counting slowly , '' said Hendon , with the expression of a man who asks but a reasonable favour , and that a very little one .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 7]: `` It is my destruction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 5]: said the constable despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 38]: `` Ah , be reasonable , good sir ; only look at this matter , on all its sides , and see how mere a jest it is -- how manifestly and how plainly it is so .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 42]: And even if one granted it were not a jest , it is a fault so small that e ` en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and warning from the judge 's lips . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 32]: Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him -- `` This jest of thine hath a name , in law , -- wot you what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 6]: `` I knew it not !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 6]: Peradventure I have been unwise .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 20]: I never dreamed it had a name -- ah , sweet heaven , I thought it was original . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 8]: `` Yes , it hath a name .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 18]: In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi . ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 7]: `` Ah , my God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 8]: `` And the penalty is death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 10]: `` God be merciful to me a sinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 86]: `` By advantage taken of one in fault , in dire peril , and at thy mercy , thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha ` penny , paying but a trifle for the same ; and this , in the eye of the law , is constructive barratry , misprision of treason , malfeasance in office , ad hominem expurgatis in statu quo -- and the penalty is death by the halter , without ransom , commutation , or benefit of clergy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 18]: `` Bear me up , bear me up , sweet sir , my legs do fail me !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 23]: Be thou merciful -- spare me this doom , and I will turn my back and see nought that shall happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 8]: now thou ` rt wise and reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 9]: And thou ` lt restore the pig ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 23]: `` I will , I will indeed -- nor ever touch another , though heaven send it and an archangel fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 13]: Go -- I am blind for thy sake -- I see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 17]: I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by force .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 22]: It is but a crazy , ancient door -- I will batter it down myself betwixt midnight and the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 41]: `` Do it , good soul , no harm will come of it ; the judge hath a loving charity for this poor lad , and will shed no tears and break no jailer 's bones for his escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 3]: Chapter XXV .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 3]: Hendon Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 45]: As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable , his Majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town , and wait there , whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 17]: Half an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on Hendon 's sorry steeds .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 30]: The King was warm and comfortable , now , for he had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which Hendon had bought on London Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 104]: Hendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy ; he judged that hard journeys , irregular meals , and illiberal measures of sleep would be bad for his crazed mind ; whilst rest , regularity , and moderate exercise would be pretty sure to hasten its cure ; he longed to see the stricken intellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the tormented little head ; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages toward the home whence he had so long been banished , instead of obeying the impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 29]: When he and the King had journeyed about ten miles , they reached a considerable village , and halted there for the night , at a good inn .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 53]: The former relations were resumed ; Hendon stood behind the King 's chair , while he dined , and waited upon him ; undressed him when he was ready for bed ; then took the floor for his own quarters , and slept athwart the door , rolled up in a blanket .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 32]: The next day , and the day after , they jogged lazily along talking over the adventures they had met since their separation , and mightily enjoying each other 's narratives .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 50]: Hendon detailed all his wide wanderings in search of the King , and described how the archangel had led him a fool 's journey all over the forest , and taken him back to the hut , finally , when he found he could not get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 45]: Then -- he said -- the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back looking broken-hearted , and saying he had expected to find that the boy had returned and laid down in there to rest , but it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 28]: Hendon had waited at the hut all day ; hope of the King 's return died out , then , and he departed upon the quest again .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 27]: `` And old Sanctum Sanctorum WAS truly sorry your highness came not back , '' said Hendon ; `` I saw it in his face . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 9]: `` Marry I will never doubt THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 24]: said the King -- and then told his own story ; after which , Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 14]: During the last day of the trip , Hendon 's spirits were soaring .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 5]: His tongue ran constantly .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 53]: He talked about his old father , and his brother Arthur , and told of many things which illustrated their high and generous characters ; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith , and was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and brotherly things about Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 33]: He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall ; what a surprise it would be to everybody , and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 41]: It was a fair region , dotted with cottages and orchards , and the road led through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses , marked with gentle elevations and depressions , suggested the swelling and subsiding undulations of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 33]: In the afternoon the returning prodigal made constant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock he might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 28]: At last he was successful , and cried out excitedly -- `` There is the village , my Prince , and there is the Hall close by !
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 20]: You may see the towers from here ; and that wood there -- that is my father 's park .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 13]: Ah , NOW thou ` lt know what state and grandeur be !
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 10]: A house with seventy rooms -- think of that !
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 7]: -- and seven and twenty servants !
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 13]: A brave lodging for such as we , is it not so ?
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 15]: Come , let us speed -- my impatience will not brook further delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 19]: All possible hurry was made ; still , it was after three o'clock before the village was reached .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 14]: The travellers scampered through it , Hendon 's tongue going all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 19]: `` Here is the church -- covered with the same ivy -- none gone , none added . ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 19]: `` Yonder is the inn , the old Red Lion , -- and yonder is the market-place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 46]: `` Here is the Maypole , and here the pump -- nothing is altered ; nothing but the people , at any rate ; ten years make a change in people ; some of these I seem to know , but none know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 6]: So his chat ran on .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 57]: The end of the village was soon reached ; then the travellers struck into a crooked , narrow road , walled in with tall hedges , and hurried briskly along it for half a mile , then passed into a vast flower garden through an imposing gateway , whose huge stone pillars bore sculptured armorial devices .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: A noble mansion was before them .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 10]: `` Welcome to Hendon Hall , my King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 3]: exclaimed Miles .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 9]: `` Ah , 't is a great day !
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 105]: My father and my brother , and the Lady Edith will be so mad with joy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first transports of the meeting , and so thou ` lt seem but coldly welcomed -- but mind it not ; ` twill soon seem otherwise ; for when I say thou art my ward , and tell them how costly is my love for thee , thou ` lt see them take thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon 's sake , and make their house and hearts thy home for ever after ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 28]: The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door , helped the King down , then took him by the hand and rushed within .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 42]: A few steps brought him to a spacious apartment ; he entered , seated the King with more hurry than ceremony , then ran toward a young man who sat at a writing-table in front of a generous fire of logs .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 22]: `` Embrace me , Hugh , '' he cried , `` and say thou ` rt glad I am come again !
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 30]: and call our father , for home is not home till I shall touch his hand , and see his face , and hear his voice once more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 60]: But Hugh only drew back , after betraying a momentary surprise , and bent a grave stare upon the intruder -- a stare which indicated somewhat of offended dignity , at first , then changed , in response to some inward thought or purpose , to an expression of marvelling curiosity , mixed with a real or assumed compassion .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 39]: Presently he said , in a mild voice -- `` Thy wits seem touched , poor stranger ; doubtless thou hast suffered privations and rude buffetings at the world 's hands ; thy looks and dress betoken it .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 9]: Whom dost thou take me to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 4]: `` Take thee ?
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 9]: Prithee for whom else than whom thou art ?
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 14]: I take thee to be Hugh Hendon , '' said Miles , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 21]: The other continued , in the same soft tone -- `` And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 9]: `` Imagination hath nought to do with it !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 14]: Dost thou pretend thou knowest me not for thy brother Miles Hendon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 18]: An expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh 's face , and he exclaimed -- `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 5]: thou art not jesting ?
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 7]: can the dead come to life ?
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 8]: God be praised if it be so !
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 14]: Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these cruel years !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 31]: Ah , it seems too good to be true , it IS too good to be true -- I charge thee , have pity , do not trifle with me !
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 14]: Quick -- come to the light -- let me scan thee well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 100]: He seized Miles by the arm , dragged him to the window , and began to devour him from head to foot with his eyes , turning him this way and that , and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him from all points of view ; whilst the returned prodigal , all aglow with gladness , smiled , laughed , and kept nodding his head and saying -- `` Go on , brother , go on , and fear not ; thou ` lt find nor limb nor feature that can not bide the test .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 35]: Scour and scan me to thy content , my good old Hugh -- I am indeed thy old Miles , thy same old Miles , thy lost brother , is ' t not so ?
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 16]: Ah , 't is a great day -- I SAID 't was a great day !
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 22]: Give me thy hand , give me thy cheek -- lord , I am like to die of very joy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 49]: He was about to throw himself upon his brother ; but Hugh put up his hand in dissent , then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast , saying with emotion -- `` Ah , God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous disappointment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 25]: Miles , amazed , could not speak for a moment ; then he found his tongue , and cried out -- `` WHAT disappointment ?
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 7]: Am I not thy brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 32]: Hugh shook his head sadly , and said -- `` I pray heaven it may prove so , and that other eyes may find the resemblances that are hid from mine .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 13]: Alack , I fear me the letter spoke but too truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 5]: `` What letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 15]: `` One that came from over sea , some six or seven years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 9]: It said my brother died in battle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 6]: `` It was a lie !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 10]: Call thy father -- he will know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 9]: `` One may not call the dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 4]: `` Dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 11]: Miles 's voice was subdued , and his lips trembled .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 5]: `` My father dead !
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: -- oh , this is heavy news .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 8]: Half my new joy is withered now .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 22]: Prithee let me see my brother Arthur -- he will know me ; he will know me and console me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 9]: `` He , also , is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 11]: `` God be merciful to me , a stricken man !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 17]: Gone , -- both gone -- the worthy taken and the worthless spared , in me !
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 5]: I crave your mercy !
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 13]: -- do not say the Lady Edith -- '' `` Is dead ?
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 6]: No , she lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 13]: `` Then , God be praised , my joy is whole again !
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 11]: Speed thee , brother -- let her come to me !
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 31]: An ' SHE say I am not myself -- but she will not ; no , no , SHE will know me , I were a fool to doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 17]: Bring her -- bring the old servants ; they , too , will know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 19]: `` All are gone but five -- Peter , Halsey , David , Bernard , and Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 8]: So saying , Hugh left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 34]: Miles stood musing a while , then began to walk the floor , muttering -- `` The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and honest -- 't is an odd thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 18]: He continued walking back and forth , muttering to himself ; he had forgotten the King entirely .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 51]: By-and-by his Majesty said gravely , and with a touch of genuine compassion , though the words themselves were capable of being interpreted ironically -- `` Mind not thy mischance , good man ; there be others in the world whose identity is denied , and whose claims are derided .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 5]: Thou hast company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 27]: `` Ah , my King , '' cried Hendon , colouring slightly , `` do not thou condemn me -- wait , and thou shalt see .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 21]: I am no impostor -- she will say it ; you shall hear it from the sweetest lips in England .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 4]: I an impostor ?
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 31]: Why , I know this old hall , these pictures of my ancestors , and all these things that are about us , as a child knoweth its own nursery .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 43]: Here was I born and bred , my lord ; I speak the truth ; I would not deceive thee ; and should none else believe , I pray thee do not THOU doubt me -- I could not bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 19]: `` I do not doubt thee , '' said the King , with a childlike simplicity and faith .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 10]: `` I thank thee out of my heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 12]: exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which showed that he was touched .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 17]: The King added , with the same gentle simplicity -- `` Dost thou doubt ME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 31]: A guilty confusion seized upon Hendon , and he was grateful that the door opened to admit Hugh , at that moment , and saved him the necessity of replying .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 18]: A beautiful lady , richly clothed , followed Hugh , and after her came several liveried servants .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 17]: The lady walked slowly , with her head bowed and her eyes fixed upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 6]: The face was unspeakably sad .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 37]: Miles Hendon sprang forward , crying out -- `` Oh , my Edith , my darling -- '' But Hugh waved him back , gravely , and said to the lady -- `` Look upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 6]: Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 24]: At the sound of Miles 's voice the woman had started slightly , and her cheeks had flushed ; she was trembling now .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 73]: She stood still , during an impressive pause of several moments ; then slowly lifted up her head and looked into Hendon 's eyes with a stony and frightened gaze ; the blood sank out of her face , drop by drop , till nothing remained but the grey pallor of death ; then she said , in a voice as dead as the face , `` I know him not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 18]: and turned , with a moan and a stifled sob , and tottered out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 14]: Miles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 17]: After a pause , his brother said to the servants -- `` You have observed him .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 6]: Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 19]: They shook their heads ; then the master said -- `` The servants know you not , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 7]: I fear there is some mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 11]: You have seen that my wife knew you not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 5]: `` Thy WIFE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 18]: In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall , with an iron grip about his throat .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 12]: `` Oh , thou fox-hearted slave , I see it all !
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 19]: Thou ` st writ the lying letter thyself , and my stolen bride and goods are its fruit .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 23]: There -- now get thee gone , lest I shame mine honourable soldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 26]: Hugh , red-faced , and almost suffocated , reeled to the nearest chair , and commanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 23]: They hesitated , and one of them said -- `` He is armed , Sir Hugh , and we are weaponless . ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 3]: `` Armed !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 9]: What of it , and ye so many ?
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 7]: Upon him , I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 36]: But Miles warned them to be careful what they did , and added -- `` Ye know me of old -- I have not changed ; come on , an ' it like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 14]: This reminder did not hearten the servants much ; they still held back .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 26]: `` Then go , ye paltry cowards , and arm yourselves and guard the doors , whilst I send one to fetch the watch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 29]: He turned at the threshold , and said to Miles , `` You 'll find it to your advantage to offend not with useless endeavours at escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 3]: `` Escape ?
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 13]: Spare thyself discomfort , an ' that is all that troubles thee .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 13]: For Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 9]: He will remain -- doubt it not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 3]: Chapter XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 2]: Disowned .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 22]: The King sat musing a few moments , then looked up and said -- '' 'T is strange -- most strange .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 8]: I can not account for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 11]: `` No , it is not strange , my liege .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 11]: I know him , and this conduct is but natural .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 9]: He was a rascal from his birth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 13]: `` Oh , I spake not of HIM , Sir Miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 5]: `` Not of him ?
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 4]: Then of what ?
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 8]: What is it that is strange ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 9]: `` That the King is not missed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 2]: Which ?
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 8]: I doubt I do not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 3]: `` Indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 28]: Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and making search for me ?
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 26]: Is it no matter for commotion and distress that the Head of the State is gone ; that I am vanished away and lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 12]: `` Most true , my King , I had forgot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 22]: Then Hendon sighed , and muttered to himself , `` Poor ruined mind -- still busy with its pathetic dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 41]: `` But I have a plan that shall right us both -- I will write a paper , in three tongues -- Latin , Greek and English -- and thou shalt haste away with it to London in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 27]: Give it to none but my uncle , the Lord Hertford ; when he shall see it , he will know and say I wrote it .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 8]: Then he will send for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 27]: `` Might it not be best , my Prince , that we wait here until I prove myself and make my rights secure to my domains ?
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 21]: I should be so much the better able then to -- '' The King interrupted him imperiously -- `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 28]: What are thy paltry domains , thy trivial interests , contrasted with matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a throne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 44]: Then , he added , in a gentle voice , as if he were sorry for his severity , `` Obey , and have no fear ; I will right thee , I will make thee whole -- yes , more than whole .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 8]: I shall remember , and requite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 14]: So saying , he took the pen , and set himself to work .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 59]: Hendon contemplated him lovingly a while , then said to himself -- `` An ' it were dark , I should think it WAS a king that spoke ; there 's no denying it , when the humour 's upon on him he doth thunder and lighten like your true King ; now where got he that trick ?
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 59]: See him scribble and scratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks , fancying them to be Latin and Greek -- and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device for diverting him from his purpose , I shall be forced to pretend to post away to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 15]: The next moment Sir Miles 's thoughts had gone back to the recent episode .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 36]: So absorbed was he in his musings , that when the King presently handed him the paper which he had been writing , he received it and pocketed it without being conscious of the act .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 11]: `` How marvellous strange she acted , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 16]: `` I think she knew me -- and I think she did NOT know me .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 38]: These opinions do conflict , I perceive it plainly ; I can not reconcile them , neither can I , by argument , dismiss either of the two , or even persuade one to outweigh the other .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 26]: The matter standeth simply thus : she MUST have known my face , my figure , my voice , for how could it be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 20]: Yet she SAID she knew me not , and that is proof perfect , for she can not lie .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 10]: But stop -- I think I begin to see .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 14]: Peradventure he hath influenced her , commanded her , compelled her to lie .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 5]: That is the solution .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 5]: The riddle is unriddled .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 14]: She seemed dead with fear -- yes , she was under his compulsion .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 23]: I will seek her ; I will find her ; now that he is away , she will speak her true mind .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 33]: She will remember the old times when we were little playfellows together , and this will soften her heart , and she will no more betray me , but will confess me .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 17]: There is no treacherous blood in her -- no , she was always honest and true .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 27]: She has loved me , in those old days -- this is my security ; for whom one has loved , one can not betray . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 19]: He stepped eagerly toward the door ; at that moment it opened , and the Lady Edith entered .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 24]: She was very pale , but she walked with a firm step , and her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 8]: Her face was as sad as before .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 30]: Miles sprang forward , with a happy confidence , to meet her , but she checked him with a hardly perceptible gesture , and he stopped where he was .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 11]: She seated herself , and asked him to do likewise .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 24]: Thus simply did she take the sense of old comradeship out of him , and transform him into a stranger and a guest .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 35]: The surprise of it , the bewildering unexpectedness of it , made him begin to question , for a moment , if he WAS the person he was pretending to be , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 15]: The Lady Edith said -- `` Sir , I have come to warn you .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 23]: The mad can not be persuaded out of their delusions , perchance ; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid perils .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 36]: I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to you , and therefore is not criminal -- but do not tarry here with it ; for here it is dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 42]: She looked steadily into Miles 's face a moment , then added , impressively , `` It is the more dangerous for that you ARE much like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 11]: `` Heavens , madam , but I AM he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 10]: `` I truly think you think it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 17]: I question not your honesty in that ; I but warn you , that is all .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 25]: My husband is master in this region ; his power hath hardly any limit ; the people prosper or starve , as he wills .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 62]: If you resembled not the man whom you profess to be , my husband might bid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace ; but trust me , I know him well ; I know what he will do ; he will say to all that you are but a mad impostor , and straightway all will echo him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 78]: She bent upon Miles that same steady look once more , and added : `` If you WERE Miles Hendon , and he knew it and all the region knew it -- consider what I am saying , weigh it well -- you would stand in the same peril , your punishment would be no less sure ; he would deny you and denounce you , and none would be bold enough to give you countenance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 13]: `` Most truly I believe it , '' said Miles , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 47]: `` The power that can command one life-long friend to betray and disown another , and be obeyed , may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are on the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 48]: A faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady 's cheek , and she dropped her eyes to the floor ; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she proceeded -- `` I have warned you -- I must still warn you -- to go hence .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 8]: This man will destroy you , else .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 9]: He is a tyrant who knows no pity .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 11]: I , who am his fettered slave , know this .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 41]: Poor Miles , and Arthur , and my dear guardian , Sir Richard , are free of him , and at rest : better that you were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this miscreant .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 27]: Your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions ; you have assaulted him in his own house : you are ruined if you stay .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 6]: Go -- do not hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 23]: If you lack money , take this purse , I beg of you , and bribe the servants to let you pass .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 15]: Oh , be warned , poor soul , and escape while you may . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 16]: Miles declined the purse with a gesture , and rose up and stood before her .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 10]: `` Grant me one thing , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 18]: `` Let your eyes rest upon mine , so that I may see if they be steady .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 6]: There -- now answer me .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 6]: Am I Miles Hendon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 6]: I know you not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 5]: `` Swear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 13]: The answer was low , but distinct -- `` I swear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 8]: `` Oh , this passes belief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 3]: `` Fly !
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 8]: Why will you waste the precious time ?
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 7]: Fly , and save yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 25]: At that moment the officers burst into the room , and a violent struggle began ; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 15]: The King was taken also , and both were bound and led to prison .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 3]: Chapter XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 3]: In prison .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 26]: The cells were all crowded ; so the two friends were chained in a large room where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 30]: They had company , for there were some twenty manacled and fettered prisoners here , of both sexes and of varying ages , -- an obscene and noisy gang .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 21]: The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put upon his royalty , but Hendon was moody and taciturn .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 37]: He was pretty thoroughly bewildered ; he had come home , a jubilant prodigal , expecting to find everybody wild with joy over his return ; and instead had got the cold shoulder and a jail .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 27]: The promise and the fulfilment differed so widely that the effect was stunning ; he could not decide whether it was most tragic or most grotesque .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 23]: He felt much as a man might who had danced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow , and got struck by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 24]: But gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into some sort of order , and then his mind centred itself upon Edith .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 24]: He turned her conduct over , and examined it in all lights , but he could not make anything satisfactory out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 12]: Did she know him -- or did n't she know him ?
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 36]: It was a perplexing puzzle , and occupied him a long time ; but he ended , finally , with the conviction that she did know him , and had repudiated him for interested reasons .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 33]: He wanted to load her name with curses now ; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found he could not bring his tongue to profane it .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 20]: Wrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition , Hendon and the King passed a troubled night .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 30]: For a bribe the jailer had furnished liquor to some of the prisoners ; singing of ribald songs , fighting , shouting , and carousing was the natural consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 35]: At last , a while after midnight , a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by beating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could come to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 49]: The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound clubbing about the head and shoulders -- then the carousing ceased ; and after that , all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the annoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 59]: During the ensuing week , the days and nights were of a monotonous sameness as to events ; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less distinctly , came , by day , to gaze at the ` impostor ' and repudiate and insult him ; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with symmetrical regularity .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 11]: However , there was a change of incident at last .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 37]: The jailer brought in an old man , and said to him -- `` The villain is in this room -- cast thy old eyes about and see if thou canst say which is he . ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 21]: Hendon glanced up , and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first time since he had been in the jail .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 35]: He said to himself , `` This is Blake Andrews , a servant all his life in my father 's family -- a good honest soul , with a right heart in his breast .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 5]: That is , formerly .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 10]: But none are true now ; all are liars .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 18]: This man will know me -- and will deny me , too , like the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 34]: The old man gazed around the room , glanced at each face in turn , and finally said -- `` I see none here but paltry knaves , scum o ' the streets .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 5]: Which is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 4]: The jailer laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 20]: `` Here , '' he said ; `` scan this big animal , and grant me an opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 34]: The old man approached , and looked Hendon over , long and earnestly , then shook his head and said -- `` Marry , THIS is no Hendon -- nor ever was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 7]: Thy old eyes are sound yet .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 43]: An ' I were Sir Hugh , I would take the shabby carle and -- '' The jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary halter , at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat suggestive of suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 19]: The old man said , vindictively -- `` Let him bless God an ' he fare no worse .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 24]: An ' _ I _ had the handling o ' the villain he should roast , or I am no true man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 28]: The jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh , and said -- `` Give him a piece of thy mind , old man -- they all do it .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 9]: Thou ` lt find it good diversion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 9]: Then he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 24]: The old man dropped upon his knees and whispered -- `` God be thanked , thou ` rt come again , my master !
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 17]: I believed thou wert dead these seven years , and lo , here thou art alive !
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 36]: I knew thee the moment I saw thee ; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance and seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o ' the streets .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 30]: I am old and poor , Sir Miles ; but say the word and I will go forth and proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 12]: `` No , '' said Hendon ; `` thou shalt not .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 14]: It would ruin thee , and yet help but little in my cause .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 21]: But I thank thee , for thou hast given me back somewhat of my lost faith in my kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 50]: The old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King ; for he dropped in several times a day to ` abuse ' the former , and always smuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare ; he also furnished the current news .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 34]: Hendon reserved the dainties for the King ; without them his Majesty might not have survived , for he was not able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 58]: Andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits , in order to avoid suspicion ; but he managed to impart a fair degree of information each time -- information delivered in a low voice , for Hendon 's benefit , and interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for the benefit of other hearers .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 14]: So , little by little , the story of the family came out .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 7]: Arthur had been dead six years .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 120]: This loss , with the absence of news from Hendon , impaired the father 's health ; he believed he was going to die , and he wished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away ; but Edith begged hard for delay , hoping for Miles 's return ; then the letter came which brought the news of Miles 's death ; the shock prostrated Sir Richard ; he believed his end was very near , and he and Hugh insisted upon the marriage ; Edith begged for and obtained a month 's respite , then another , and finally a third ; the marriage then took place by the death-bed of Sir Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 8]: It had not proved a happy one .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 51]: It was whispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride found among her husband 's papers several rough and incomplete drafts of the fatal letter , and had accused him of precipitating the marriage -- and Sir Richard 's death , too -- by a wicked forgery .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 52]: Tales of cruelty to the Lady Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands ; and since the father 's death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become a pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his domains for bread .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 28]: There was a bit of Andrew 's gossip which the King listened to with a lively interest -- `` There is rumour that the King is mad .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 25]: But in charity forbear to say _ I _ mentioned it , for 't is death to speak of it , they say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 44]: His Majesty glared at the old man and said -- `` The King is NOT mad , good man -- and thou ` lt find it to thy advantage to busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this seditious prattle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 8]: `` What doth the lad mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 14]: said Andrews , surprised at this brisk assault from such an unexpected quarter .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 56]: Hendon gave him a sign , and he did not pursue his question , but went on with his budget -- `` The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two -- the 16th of the month -- and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 57]: `` Methinks they must needs find him first , '' muttered his Majesty ; then added , confidently , `` but they will look to that -- and so also shall I. '' `` In the name of -- '' But the old man got no further -- a warning sign from Hendon checked his remark .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 21]: He resumed the thread of his gossip -- `` Sir Hugh goeth to the coronation -- and with grand hopes .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 21]: He confidently looketh to come back a peer , for he is high in favour with the Lord Protector . ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 6]: `` What Lord Protector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 4]: asked his Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 9]: `` His Grace the Duke of Somerset . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 7]: `` What Duke of Somerset ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 15]: `` Marry , there is but one -- Seymour , Earl of Hertford . ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 18]: The King asked sharply -- `` Since when is HE a duke , and Lord Protector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 9]: `` Since the last day of January . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 9]: `` And prithee who made him so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 14]: `` Himself and the Great Council -- with help of the King . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 5]: His Majesty started violently .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 5]: `` The KING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 8]: `` WHAT king , good sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 6]: `` What king , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 9]: -LRB- God-a-mercy , what aileth the boy ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 26]: Sith we have but one , 't is not difficult to answer -- his most sacred Majesty King Edward the Sixth -- whom God preserve !
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 93]: Yea , and a dear and gracious little urchin is he , too ; and whether he be mad or no -- and they say he mendeth daily -- his praises are on all men 's lips ; and all bless him , likewise , and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in England ; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk 's life , and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that harry and oppress the people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 31]: This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement , and plunged him into so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man 's gossip .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 23]: He wondered if the ` little urchin ' was the beggar-boy whom he left dressed in his own garments in the palace .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 44]: It did not seem possible that this could be , for surely his manners and speech would betray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales -- then he would be driven out , and search made for the true prince .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 18]: Could it be that the Court had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place ?
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 25]: No , for his uncle would not allow that -- he was all-powerful and could and would crush such a movement , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 34]: The boy 's musings profited him nothing ; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he became , the more his head ached , and the worse he slept .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 16]: His impatience to get to London grew hourly , and his captivity became almost unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 28]: Hendon 's arts all failed with the King -- he could not be comforted ; but a couple of women who were chained near him succeeded better .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 14]: Under their gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 24]: He was very grateful , and came to love them dearly and to delight in the sweet and soothing influence of their presence .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 37]: He asked them why they were in prison , and when they said they were Baptists , he smiled , and inquired -- `` Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison ?
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 23]: Now I grieve , for I shall lose ye -- they will not keep ye long for such a little thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 14]: They did not answer ; and something in their faces made him uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 27]: He said , eagerly -- `` You do not speak ; be good to me , and tell me -- there will be no other punishment ?
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 11]: Prithee tell me there is no fear of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 24]: They tried to change the topic , but his fears were aroused , and he pursued it -- `` Will they scourge thee ?
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 11]: No , no , they would not be so cruel !
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 5]: Say they would not .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 10]: Come , they WILL not , will they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 42]: The women betrayed confusion and distress , but there was no avoiding an answer , so one of them said , in a voice choked with emotion -- `` Oh , thou ` lt break our hearts , thou gentle spirit !
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 17]: -- God will help us to bear our -- '' `` It is a confession ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 5]: the King broke in .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 11]: `` Then they WILL scourge thee , the stony-hearted wretches !
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 14]: But oh , thou must not weep , I can not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 28]: Keep up thy courage -- I shall come to my own in time to save thee from this bitter thing , and I will do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 13]: When the King awoke in the morning , the women were gone .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 6]: `` They are saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 16]: he said , joyfully ; then added , despondently , `` but woe is me !
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 8]: -- for they were my comforters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 19]: Each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing , in token of remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 29]: He said he would keep these things always ; and that soon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them under his protection .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 21]: Just then the jailer came in with some subordinates , and commanded that the prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 24]: The King was overjoyed -- it would be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air once more .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 35]: He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers , but his turn came at last , and he was released from his staple and ordered to follow the other prisoners with Hendon .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 13]: The court or quadrangle was stone-paved , and open to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 26]: The prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry , and were placed in file , standing , with their backs against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 18]: A rope was stretched in front of them , and they were also guarded by their officers .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 33]: It was a chill and lowering morning , and a light snow which had fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added to the general dismalness of its aspect .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 19]: Now and then a wintry wind shivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 14]: In the centre of the court stood two women , chained to posts .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 12]: A glance showed the King that these were his good friends .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 22]: He shuddered , and said to himself , `` Alack , they are not gone free , as I had thought .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 11]: To think that such as these should know the lash !
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 4]: -- in England !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 16]: Ay , there 's the shame of it -- not in Heathennesse , Christian England !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 52]: They will be scourged ; and I , whom they have comforted and kindly entreated , must look on and see the great wrong done ; it is strange , so strange , that I , the very source of power in this broad realm , am helpless to protect them .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 28]: But let these miscreants look well to themselves , for there is a day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 15]: For every blow they strike now , they shall feel a hundred then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 14]: A great gate swung open , and a crowd of citizens poured in .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 16]: They flocked around the two women , and hid them from the King 's view .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 15]: A clergyman entered and passed through the crowd , and he also was hidden .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 29]: The King now heard talking , back and forth , as if questions were being asked and answered , but he could not make out what was said .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 46]: Next there was a deal of bustle and preparation , and much passing and repassing of officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the women ; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the people .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 26]: Now , by command , the masses parted and fell aside , and the King saw a spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 17]: Faggots had been piled about the two women , and a kneeling man was lighting them !
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 76]: The women bowed their heads , and covered their faces with their hands ; the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling faggots , and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind ; the clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer -- just then two young girls came flying through the great gate , uttering piercing screams , and threw themselves upon the women at the stake .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 52]: Instantly they were torn away by the officers , and one of them was kept in a tight grip , but the other broke loose , saying she would die with her mother ; and before she could be stopped she had flung her arms about her mother 's neck again .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 14]: She was torn away once more , and with her gown on fire .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 54]: Two or three men held her , and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown flaming aside , she struggling all the while to free herself , and saying she would be alone in the world , now ; and begging to be allowed to die with her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 55]: Both the girls screamed continually , and fought for freedom ; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of heart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony -- the King glanced from the frantic girls to the stake , then turned away and leaned his ashen face against the wall , and looked no more .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 50]: He said , `` That which I have seen , in that one little moment , will never go out from my memory , but will abide there ; and I shall see it all the days , and dream of it all the nights , till I die .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 8]: Would God I had been blind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 6]: Hendon was watching the King .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 21]: He said to himself , with satisfaction , `` His disorder mendeth ; he hath changed , and groweth gentler .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 31]: If he had followed his wont , he would have stormed at these varlets , and said he was King , and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 19]: Soon his delusion will pass away and be forgotten , and his poor mind will be whole again .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 6]: God speed the day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 35]: That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night , who were being conveyed , under guard , to various places in the kingdom , to undergo punishment for crimes committed .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 42]: The King conversed with these -- he had made it a point , from the beginning , to instruct himself for the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity offered -- and the tale of their woes wrung his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 29]: One of them was a poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a weaver -- she was to be hanged for it .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 70]: Another was a man who had been accused of stealing a horse ; he said the proof had failed , and he had imagined that he was safe from the halter ; but no -- he was hardly free before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King 's park ; this was proved against him , and now he was on his way to the gallows .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 60]: There was a tradesman 's apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King ; this youth said he found a hawk , one evening , that had escaped from its owner , and he took it home with him , imagining himself entitled to it ; but the court convicted him of stealing it , and sentenced him to death .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 44]: The King was furious over these inhumanities , and wanted Hendon to break jail and fly with him to Westminster , so that he could mount his throne and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and save their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 39]: `` Poor child , '' sighed Hendon , `` these woeful tales have brought his malady upon him again ; alack , but for this evil hap , he would have been well in a little time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 19]: Among these prisoners was an old lawyer -- a man with a strong face and a dauntless mien .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 56]: Three years past , he had written a pamphlet against the Lord Chancellor , accusing him of injustice , and had been punished for it by the loss of his ears in the pillory , and degradation from the bar , and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for life .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 42]: Lately he had repeated his offence ; and in consequence was now under sentence to lose WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS , pay a fine of 5,000 pounds , be branded on both cheeks , and remain in prison for life .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 29]: `` These be honourable scars , '' he said , and turned back his grey hair and showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 8]: The King 's eye burned with passion .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 13]: He said -- `` None believe in me -- neither wilt thou .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 39]: But no matter -- within the compass of a month thou shalt be free ; and more , the laws that have dishonoured thee , and shamed the English name , shall be swept from the statute books .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 25]: The world is made wrong ; kings should go to school to their own laws , at times , and so learn mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 6]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- Chapter XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 3]: The sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 11]: Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and inaction .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 32]: But now his trial came on , to his great gratification , and he thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 7]: But he was mistaken about that .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 39]: He was in a fine fury when he found himself described as a ` sturdy vagabond ' and sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character and for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 31]: His pretensions as to brothership with his prosecutor , and rightful heirship to the Hendon honours and estates , were left contemptuously unnoticed , as being not even worth examination .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 38]: He raged and threatened on his way to punishment , but it did no good ; he was snatched roughly along by the officers , and got an occasional cuff , besides , for his irreverent conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 30]: The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind ; so he was obliged to follow in the rear , remote from his good friend and servant .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 35]: The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for being in such bad company , but had been let off with a lecture and a warning , in consideration of his youth .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 40]: When the crowd at last halted , he flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim , hunting a place to get through ; and at last , after a deal of difficulty and delay , succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 30]: There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks , the sport and butt of a dirty mob -- he , the body servant of the King of England !
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 18]: Edward had heard the sentence pronounced , but he had not realised the half that it meant .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 59]: His anger began to rise as the sense of this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home ; it jumped to summer heat , the next moment , when he saw an egg sail through the air and crush itself against Hendon 's cheek , and heard the crowd roar its enjoyment of the episode .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 19]: He sprang across the open circle and confronted the officer in charge , crying -- `` For shame !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 9]: This is my servant -- set him free !
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 11]: I am the -- '' `` Oh , peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 14]: exclaimed Hendon , in a panic , `` thou ` lt destroy thyself .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 11]: Mind him not , officer , he is mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 39]: `` Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him , good man , I have small mind to mind him ; but as to teaching him somewhat , to that I am well inclined . ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 27]: He turned to a subordinate and said , `` Give the little fool a taste or two of the lash , to mend his manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 33]: `` Half a dozen will better serve his turn , '' suggested Sir Hugh , who had ridden up , a moment before , to take a passing glance at the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 5]: The King was seized .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 29]: He did not even struggle , so paralysed was he with the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be inflicted upon his sacred person .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 33]: History was already defiled with the record of the scourging of an English king with whips -- it was an intolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful page .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 25]: He was in the toils , there was no help for him ; he must either take this punishment or beg for its remission .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 22]: Hard conditions ; he would take the stripes -- a king might do that , but a king could not beg .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 10]: But meantime , Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 26]: `` Let the child go , '' said he ; `` ye heartless dogs , do ye not see how young and frail he is ?
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 11]: Let him go -- I will take his lashes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 25]: `` Marry , a good thought -- and thanks for it , '' said Sir Hugh , his face lighting with a sardonic satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 26]: `` Let the little beggar go , and give this fellow a dozen in his place -- an honest dozen , well laid on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 55]: The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest , but Sir Hugh silenced him with the potent remark , `` Yes , speak up , do , and free thy mind -- only , mark ye , that for each word you utter he shall get six strokes the more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 37]: Hendon was removed from the stocks , and his back laid bare ; and whilst the lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 25]: `` Ah , brave good heart , '' he said to himself , `` this loyal deed shall never perish out of my memory .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 12]: I will not forget it -- and neither shall THEY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 6]: he added , with passion .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 31]: Whilst he mused , his appreciation of Hendon 's magnanimous conduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind , and so also did his gratefulness for it .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 43]: Presently he said to himself , `` Who saves his prince from wounds and possible death -- and this he did for me -- performs high service ; but it is little -- it is nothing -- oh , less than nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 18]: -- when 't is weighed against the act of him who saves his prince from SHAME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 17]: Hendon made no outcry under the scourge , but bore the heavy blows with soldierly fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 50]: This , together with his redeeming the boy by taking his stripes for him , compelled the respect of even that forlorn and degraded mob that was gathered there ; and its gibes and hootings died away , and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 35]: The stillness that pervaded the place , when Hendon found himself once more in the stocks , was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour which had prevailed there so little a while before .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 52]: The King came softly to Hendon 's side , and whispered in his ear -- `` Kings can not ennoble thee , thou good , great soul , for One who is higher than kings hath done that for thee ; but a king can confirm thy nobility to men . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 30]: He picked up the scourge from the ground , touched Hendon 's bleeding shoulders lightly with it , and whispered , `` Edward of England dubs thee Earl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 4]: Hendon was touched .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 43]: The water welled to his eyes , yet at the same time the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his gravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward mirth from showing outside .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 36]: To be suddenly hoisted , naked and gory , from the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of an Earldom , seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the grotesque .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 14]: He said to himself , `` Now am I finely tinselled , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 22]: The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a spectre-earl -- a dizzy flight for a callow wing !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 22]: An ' this go on , I shall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and make-believe honours .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 20]: But I shall value them , all valueless as they are , for the love that doth bestow them .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 34]: Better these poor mock dignities of mine , that come unasked , from a clean hand and a right spirit , than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested power . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 32]: The dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about , and as he spurred away , the living wall divided silently to let him pass , and as silently closed together again .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 40]: And so remained ; nobody went so far as to venture a remark in favour of the prisoner , or in compliment to him ; but no matter -- the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 59]: A late comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances , and who delivered a sneer at the ` impostor , ' and was in the act of following it with a dead cat , was promptly knocked down and kicked out , without any words , and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 3]: Chapter XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 3]: To London .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 27]: When Hendon 's term of service in the stocks was finished , he was released and ordered to quit the region and come back no more .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 15]: His sword was restored to him , and also his mule and his donkey .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 30]: He mounted and rode off , followed by the King , the crowd opening with quiet respectfulness to let them pass , and then dispersing when they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 7]: Hendon was soon absorbed in thought .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 10]: There were questions of high import to be answered .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 5]: What should he do ?
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 5]: Whither should he go ?
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 24]: Powerful help must be found somewhere , or he must relinquish his inheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor besides .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 10]: Where could he hope to find this powerful help ?
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 4]: Where , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 6]: It was a knotty question .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 36]: By-and-by a thought occurred to him which pointed to a possibility -- the slenderest of slender possibilities , certainly , but still worth considering , for lack of any other that promised anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 23]: He remembered what old Andrews had said about the young King 's goodness and his generous championship of the wronged and unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 15]: Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice ?
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 20]: Ah , yes , but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the august presence of a monarch ?
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 29]: Never mind -- let that matter take care of itself ; it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should come to it .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 25]: He was an old campaigner , and used to inventing shifts and expedients : no doubt he would be able to find a way .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 9]: Yes , he would strike for the capital .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 44]: Maybe his father 's old friend Sir Humphrey Marlow would help him -- ` good old Sir Humphrey , Head Lieutenant of the late King 's kitchen , or stables , or something ' -- Miles could not remember just what or which .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 46]: Now that he had something to turn his energies to , a distinctly defined object to accomplish , the fog of humiliation and depression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away , and he raised his head and looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 18]: He was surprised to see how far he had come ; the village was away behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 26]: The King was jogging along in his wake , with his head bowed ; for he , too , was deep in plans and thinkings .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 39]: A sorrowful misgiving clouded Hendon 's new-born cheerfulness : would the boy be willing to go again to a city where , during all his brief life , he had never known anything but ill-usage and pinching want ?
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 33]: But the question must be asked ; it could not be avoided ; so Hendon reined up , and called out -- `` I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 7]: Thy commands , my liege ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 5]: `` To London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 17]: Hendon moved on again , mightily contented with the answer -- but astounded at it too .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 11]: The whole journey was made without an adventure of importance .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 6]: But it ended with one .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 80]: About ten o'clock on the night of the 19th of February they stepped upon London Bridge , in the midst of a writhing , struggling jam of howling and hurrahing people , whose beer-jolly faces stood out strongly in the glare from manifold torches -- and at that instant the decaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between them , striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the hurrying confusion of feet .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 12]: So evanescent and unstable are men 's works in this world !
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 38]: -- the late good King is but three weeks dead and three days in his grave , and already the adornments which he took such pains to select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 46]: A citizen stumbled over that head , and drove his own head into the back of somebody in front of him , who turned and knocked down the first person that came handy , and was promptly laid out himself by that person 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 65]: It was the right ripe time for a free fight , for the festivities of the morrow -- Coronation Day -- were already beginning ; everybody was full of strong drink and patriotism ; within five minutes the free fight was occupying a good deal of ground ; within ten or twelve it covered an acre of so , and was become a riot .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 27]: By this time Hendon and the King were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the rush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 6]: And so we leave them .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 3]: Chapter XXX .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 4]: Tom 's progress .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 52]: Whilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad , poorly fed , cuffed and derided by tramps one while , herding with thieves and murderers in a jail another , and called idiot and impostor by all impartially , the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different experience .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 18]: When we saw him last , royalty was just beginning to have a bright side for him .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 26]: This bright side went on brightening more and more every day : in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and delightfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 26]: He lost his fears ; his misgivings faded out and died ; his embarrassments departed , and gave place to an easy and confident bearing .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 9]: He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 42]: He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence when he wanted to play or talk , and dismissed them when he was done with them , with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 16]: It no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at parting .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 24]: He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night , and dressed with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 41]: It came to be a proud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession of officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms ; insomuch , indeed , that he doubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms , and made them a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 25]: He liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors , and the distant voices responding , `` Way for the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 25]: He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council , and seeming to be something more than the Lord Protector 's mouthpiece .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 27]: He liked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains , and listen to the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who called him brother .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 10]: O happy Tom Canty , late of Offal Court !
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 27]: He enjoyed his splendid clothes , and ordered more : he found his four hundred servants too few for his proper grandeur , and trebled them .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 14]: The adulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 57]: He remained kind and gentle , and a sturdy and determined champion of all that were oppressed , and he made tireless war upon unjust laws : yet upon occasion , being offended , he could turn upon an earl , or even a duke , and give him a look that would make him tremble .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 129]: Once , when his royal ` sister , ' the grimly holy Lady Mary , set herself to reason with him against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who would otherwise be jailed , or hanged , or burned , and reminded him that their august late father 's prisons had sometimes contained as high as sixty thousand convicts at one time , and that during his admirable reign he had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death by the executioner , -LCB- 9 -RCB- the boy was filled with generous indignation , and commanded her to go to her closet , and beseech God to take away the stone that was in her breast , and give her a human heart .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 37]: Did Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince who had treated him so kindly , and flown out with such hot zeal to avenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate ?
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 38]: Yes ; his first royal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts about the lost prince , and with sincere longings for his return , and happy restoration to his native rights and splendours .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 71]: But as time wore on , and the prince did not come , Tom 's mind became more and more occupied with his new and enchanting experiences , and by little and little the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts ; and finally , when he did intrude upon them at intervals , he was become an unwelcome spectre , for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 15]: Tom 's poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 64]: At first he pined for them , sorrowed for them , longed to see them , but later , the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt , and betraying him with their kisses , and pulling him down from his lofty place , and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums , made him shudder .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 11]: At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost wholly .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 34]: And he was content , even glad : for , whenever their mournful and accusing faces did rise before him now , they made him feel more despicable than the worms that crawl .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 55]: At midnight of the 19th of February , Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in his rich bed in the palace , guarded by his loyal vassals , and surrounded by the pomps of royalty , a happy boy ; for tomorrow was the day appointed for his solemn crowning as King of England .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 82]: At that same hour , Edward , the true king , hungry and thirsty , soiled and draggled , worn with travel , and clothed in rags and shreds -- his share of the results of the riot -- was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep interest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of Westminster Abbey , busy as ants : they were making the last preparation for the royal coronation .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 3]: Chapter XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 4]: The Recognition procession .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 25]: When Tom Canty awoke the next morning , the air was heavy with a thunderous murmur : all the distances were charged with it .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 27]: It was music to him ; for it meant that the English world was out in its strength to give loyal welcome to the great day .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 41]: Presently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful floating pageant on the Thames ; for by ancient custom the ` recognition procession ' through London must start from the Tower , and he was bound thither .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 130]: When he arrived there , the sides of the venerable fortress seemed suddenly rent in a thousand places , and from every rent leaped a red tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke ; a deafening explosion followed , which drowned the shoutings of the multitude , and made the ground tremble ; the flame-jets , the smoke , and the explosions , were repeated over and over again with marvellous celerity , so that in a few moments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke , all but the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower ; this , with its banners , stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak projects above a cloud-rack .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 125]: Tom Canty , splendidly arrayed , mounted a prancing war-steed , whose rich trappings almost reached to the ground ; his ` uncle , ' the Lord Protector Somerset , similarly mounted , took place in his rear ; the King 's Guard formed in single ranks on either side , clad in burnished armour ; after the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of resplendent nobles attended by their vassals ; after these came the lord mayor and the aldermanic body , in crimson velvet robes , and with their gold chains across their breasts ; and after these the officers and members of all the guilds of London , in rich raiment , and bearing the showy banners of the several corporations .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 63]: Also in the procession , as a special guard of honour through the city , was the Ancient and Honourable Artillery Company -- an organisation already three hundred years old at that time , and the only military body in England possessing the privilege -LRB- which it still possesses in our day -RRB- of holding itself independent of the commands of Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 29]: It was a brilliant spectacle , and was hailed with acclamations all along the line , as it took its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 90]: The chronicler says , ` The King , as he entered the city , was received by the people with prayers , welcomings , cries , and tender words , and all signs which argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign ; and the King , by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off , and most tender language to those that stood nigh his Grace , showed himself no less thankful to receive the people 's goodwill than they to offer it .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 11]: To all that wished him well , he gave thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 23]: To such as bade `` God save his Grace , '' he said in return , `` God save you all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 13]: and added that `` he thanked them with all his heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 16]: Wonderfully transported were the people with the loving answers and gestures of their King . '
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 25]: In Fenchurch Street a ` fair child , in costly apparel , ' stood on a stage to welcome his Majesty to the city .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 17]: The last verse of his greeting was in these words -- ` Welcome , O King !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 45]: as much as hearts can think ; Welcome , again , as much as tongue can tell , -- Welcome to joyous tongues , and hearts that will not shrink : God thee preserve , we pray , and wish thee ever well . '
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 19]: The people burst forth in a glad shout , repeating with one voice what the child had said .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 44]: Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of eager faces , and his heart swelled with exultation ; and he felt that the one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king , and a nation 's idol .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 54]: Presently he caught sight , at a distance , of a couple of his ragged Offal Court comrades -- one of them the lord high admiral in his late mimic court , the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the same pretentious fiction ; and his pride swelled higher than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 10]: Oh , if they could only recognise him now !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 50]: What unspeakable glory it would be , if they could recognise him , and realise that the derided mock king of the slums and back alleys was become a real King , with illustrious dukes and princes for his humble menials , and the English world at his feet !
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 60]: But he had to deny himself , and choke down his desire , for such a recognition might cost more than it would come to : so he turned away his head , and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and glad adulations , unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them upon .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 12]: Every now and then rose the cry , `` A largess !
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 4]: a largess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 19]: and Tom responded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the multitude to scramble for .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 46]: The chronicler says , ` At the upper end of Gracechurch Street , before the sign of the Eagle , the city had erected a gorgeous arch , beneath which was a stage , which stretched from one side of the street to the other .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 13]: This was an historical pageant , representing the King 's immediate progenitors .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 59]: There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense white rose , whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her ; by her side was Henry VII. , issuing out of a vast red rose , disposed in the same manner : the hands of the royal pair were locked together , and the wedding-ring ostentatiously displayed .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 49]: From the red and white roses proceeded a stem , which reached up to a second stage , occupied by Henry VIII. , issuing from a red and white rose , with the effigy of the new King 's mother , Jane Seymour , represented by his side .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 22]: One branch sprang from this pair , which mounted to a third stage , where sat the effigy of Edward VI .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 23]: himself , enthroned in royal majesty ; and the whole pageant was framed with wreaths of roses , red and white . '
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 35]: This quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people , that their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child whose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 28]: But Tom Canty was not sorry ; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him than any poetry , no matter what its quality might be .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 35]: Whithersoever Tom turned his happy young face , the people recognised the exactness of his effigy 's likeness to himself , the flesh and blood counterpart ; and new whirlwinds of applause burst forth .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 49]: The great pageant moved on , and still on , under one triumphal arch after another , and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical tableaux , each of which typified and exalted some virtue , or talent , or merit , of the little King 's .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 61]: ` Throughout the whole of Cheapside , from every penthouse and window , hung banners and streamers ; and the richest carpets , stuffs , and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets -- specimens of the great wealth of the stores within ; and the splendour of this thoroughfare was equalled in the other streets , and in some even surpassed . '
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 16]: `` And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me -- me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 4]: murmured Tom Canty .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 24]: The mock King 's cheeks were flushed with excitement , his eyes were flashing , his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 47]: At this point , just as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess , he caught sight of a pale , astounded face , which was strained forward out of the second rank of the crowd , its intense eyes riveted upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 12]: A sickening consternation struck through him ; he recognised his mother !
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 29]: and up flew his hand , palm outward , before his eyes -- that old involuntary gesture , born of a forgotten episode , and perpetuated by habit .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 25]: In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press , and past the guards , and was at his side .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 23]: She embraced his leg , she covered it with kisses , she cried , `` O my child , my darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 13]: lifting toward him a face that was transfigured with joy and love .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 34]: The same instant an officer of the King 's Guard snatched her away with a curse , and sent her reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his strong arm .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 12]: The words `` I do not know you , woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 74]: were falling from Tom Canty 's lips when this piteous thing occurred ; but it smote him to the heart to see her treated so ; and as she turned for a last glimpse of him , whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight , she seemed so wounded , so broken-hearted , that a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride to ashes , and withered his stolen royalty .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 17]: His grandeurs were stricken valueless : they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 33]: The procession moved on , and still on , through ever augmenting splendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome ; but to Tom Canty they were as if they had not been .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 6]: He neither saw nor heard .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 15]: Royalty had lost its grace and sweetness ; its pomps were become a reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 7]: Remorse was eating his heart out .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 14]: He said , `` Would God I were free of my captivity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 17]: He had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days of his compulsory greatness .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 53]: The shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city , and through the huzzaing hosts ; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes , seeing only his mother 's face and that wounded look in it .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 6]: `` Largess , largess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 8]: The cry fell upon an unheeding ear .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 8]: `` Long live Edward of England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 20]: It seemed as if the earth shook with the explosion ; but there was no response from the King .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 66]: He heard it only as one hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a great distance , for it was smothered under another sound which was still nearer , in his own breast , in his accusing conscience -- a voice which kept repeating those shameful words , `` I do not know you , woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 40]: The words smote upon the King 's soul as the strokes of a funeral bell smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 63]: New glories were unfolded at every turning ; new wonders , new marvels , sprang into view ; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released ; new raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes : but the King gave no sign , and the accusing voice that went moaning through his comfortless breast was all the sound he heard .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 36]: By-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little , and became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety : an abatement in the volume of the applause was observable too .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 19]: The Lord Protector was quick to notice these things : he was as quick to detect the cause .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 31]: He spurred to the King 's side , bent low in his saddle , uncovered , and said -- `` My liege , it is an ill time for dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 19]: The people observe thy downcast head , thy clouded mien , and they take it for an omen .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 22]: Be advised : unveil the sun of royalty , and let it shine upon these boding vapours , and disperse them .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 12]: Lift up thy face , and smile upon the people . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 21]: So saying , the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left , then retired to his place .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 11]: The mock King did mechanically as he had been bidden .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 21]: His smile had no heart in it , but few eyes were near enough or sharp enough to detect that .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 51]: The noddings of his plumed head as he saluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness ; the largess which he delivered from his hand was royally liberal : so the people 's anxiety vanished , and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a volume as before .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 24]: Still once more , a little before the progress was ended , the Duke was obliged to ride forward , and make remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 8]: He whispered -- `` O dread sovereign !
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 16]: shake off these fatal humours ; the eyes of the world are upon thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 14]: Then he added with sharp annoyance , `` Perdition catch that crazy pauper !
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 10]: 't was she that hath disturbed your Highness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 25]: The gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke , and said in a dead voice -- `` She was my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 21]: groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his post , `` the omen was pregnant with prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 7]: He is gone mad again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 3]: Chapter XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 3]: Coronation Day .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 27]: Let us go backward a few hours , and place ourselves in Westminster Abbey , at four o'clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 63]: We are not without company ; for although it is still night , we find the torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well content to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall come for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their lives -- the coronation of a King .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 49]: Yes , London and Westminster have been astir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o'clock , and already crowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying to find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances reserved for their sort .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 7]: The hours drag along tediously enough .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 17]: All stir has ceased for some time , for every gallery has long ago been packed .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 14]: We may sit , now , and look and think at our leisure .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 50]: We have glimpses , here and there and yonder , through the dim cathedral twilight , of portions of many galleries and balconies , wedged full with other people , the other portions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by intervening pillars and architectural projections .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 22]: We have in view the whole of the great north transept -- empty , and waiting for England 's privileged ones .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 19]: We see also the ample area or platform , carpeted with rich stuffs , whereon the throne stands .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 21]: The throne occupies the centre of the platform , and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 47]: Within the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock -- the stone of Scone -- which many generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned , and so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for English monarchs .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 13]: Both the throne and its footstool are covered with cloth of gold .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 13]: Stillness reigns , the torches blink dully , the time drags heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 23]: But at last the lagging daylight asserts itself , the torches are extinguished , and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 24]: All features of the noble building are distinct now , but soft and dreamy , for the sun is lightly veiled with clouds .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 81]: At seven o'clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs ; for on the stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept , clothed like Solomon for splendour , and is conducted to her appointed place by an official clad in satins and velvets , whilst a duplicate of him gathers up the lady 's long train , follows after , and , when the lady is seated , arranges the train across her lap for her .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 37]: He then places her footstool according to her desire , after which he puts her coronet where it will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous coroneting of the nobles shall arrive .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 30]: By this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream , and the satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere , seating them and making them comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 7]: The scene is animated enough now .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 11]: There is stir and life , and shifting colour everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 47]: After a time , quiet reigns again ; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their places , a solid acre or such a matter , of human flowers , resplendent in variegated colours , and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 37]: There are all ages here : brown , wrinkled , white-haired dowagers who are able to go back , and still back , down the stream of time , and recall the crowning of Richard III .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 71]: and the troublous days of that old forgotten age ; and there are handsome middle-aged dames ; and lovely and gracious young matrons ; and gentle and beautiful young girls , with beaming eyes and fresh complexions , who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets awkwardly when the great time comes ; for the matter will be new to them , and their excitement will be a sore hindrance .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 38]: Still , this may not happen , for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a special view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its place when the signal comes .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 37]: We have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with diamonds , and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle -- but now we are about to be astonished in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 66]: About nine , the clouds suddenly break away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere , and drifts slowly along the ranks of ladies ; and every rank it touches flames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires , and we tingle to our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by the surprise and the beauty of the spectacle !
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 70]: Presently a special envoy from some distant corner of the Orient , marching with the general body of foreign ambassadors , crosses this bar of sunshine , and we catch our breath , the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is so overpowering ; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems , and his slightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: Let us change the tense for convenience .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 42]: The time drifted along -- one hour -- two hours -- two hours and a half ; then the deep booming of artillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at last ; so the waiting multitude rejoiced .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 43]: All knew that a further delay must follow , for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn ceremony ; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling of the peers of the realm in their stately robes .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 56]: These were conducted ceremoniously to their seats , and their coronets placed conveniently at hand ; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with interest , for most of them were beholding for the first time , dukes , earls , and barons , whose names had been historical for five hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 29]: When all were finally seated , the spectacle from the galleries and all coigns of vantage was complete ; a gorgeous one to look upon and to remember .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 49]: Now the robed and mitred great heads of the church , and their attendants , filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places ; these were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials , and these again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 45]: There was a waiting pause ; then , at a signal , a triumphant peal of music burst forth , and Tom Canty , clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold , appeared at a door , and stepped upon the platform .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 13]: The entire multitude rose , and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 28]: Then a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound ; and thus heralded and welcomed , Tom Canty was conducted to the throne .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 54]: The ancient ceremonies went on , with impressive solemnity , whilst the audience gazed ; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion , Tom Canty grew pale , and still paler , and a deep and steadily deepening woe and despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful heart .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 9]: At last the final act was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 24]: The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted up the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the trembling mock-King 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 42]: In the same instant a rainbow-radiance flashed along the spacious transept ; for with one impulse every individual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised it over his or her head -- and paused in that attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 7]: A deep hush pervaded the Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 35]: At this impressive moment , a startling apparition intruded upon the scene -- an apparition observed by none in the absorbed multitude , until it suddenly appeared , moving up the great central aisle .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 22]: It was a boy , bareheaded , ill shod , and clothed in coarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 39]: He raised his hand with a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect , and delivered this note of warning -- `` I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 6]: I am the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 45]: In an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy ; but in the same instant Tom Canty , in his regal vestments , made a swift step forward , and cried out in a ringing voice -- `` Loose him and forbear !
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 6]: He IS the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 53]: A sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage , and they partly rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and at the chief figures in this scene , like persons who wondered whether they were awake and in their senses , or asleep and dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 41]: The Lord Protector was as amazed as the rest , but quickly recovered himself , and exclaimed in a voice of authority -- `` Mind not his Majesty , his malady is upon him again -- seize the vagabond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 21]: He would have been obeyed , but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried out -- `` On your peril !
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 10]: Touch him not , he is the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 41]: The hands were withheld ; a paralysis fell upon the house ; no one moved , no one spoke ; indeed , no one knew how to act or what to say , in so strange and surprising an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 105]: While all minds were struggling to right themselves , the boy still moved steadily forward , with high port and confident mien ; he had never halted from the beginning ; and while the tangled minds still floundered helplessly , he stepped upon the platform , and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him ; and fell on his knees before him and said -- `` Oh , my lord the King , let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to thee , and say , ` Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 30]: The Lord Protector 's eye fell sternly upon the new-comer 's face ; but straightway the sternness vanished away , and gave place to an expression of wondering surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 10]: This thing happened also to the other great officers .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 17]: They glanced at each other , and retreated a step by a common and unconscious impulse .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 16]: The thought in each mind was the same : `` What a strange resemblance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 45]: The Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity , then he said , with grave respectfulness -- `` By your favour , sir , I desire to ask certain questions which -- '' `` I will answer them , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 29]: The Duke asked him many questions about the Court , the late King , the prince , the princesses -- the boy answered them correctly and without hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 24]: He described the rooms of state in the palace , the late King 's apartments , and those of the Prince of Wales .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 21]: It was strange ; it was wonderful ; yes , it was unaccountable -- so all said that heard it .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 50]: The tide was beginning to turn , and Tom Canty 's hopes to run high , when the Lord Protector shook his head and said -- `` It is true it is most wonderful -- but it is no more than our lord the King likewise can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 27]: This remark , and this reference to himself as still the King , saddened Tom Canty , and he felt his hopes crumbling from under him .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 11]: `` These are not PROOFS , '' added the Protector .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 37]: The tide was turning very fast now , very fast indeed -- but in the wrong direction ; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne , and sweeping the other out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 50]: The Lord Protector communed with himself -- shook his head -- the thought forced itself upon him , `` It is perilous to the State and to us all , to entertain so fateful a riddle as this ; it could divide the nation and undermine the throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 17]: He turned and said -- `` Sir Thomas , arrest this -- No , hold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 21]: His face lighted , and he confronted the ragged candidate with this question -- `` Where lieth the Great Seal ?
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 23]: Answer me this truly , and the riddle is unriddled ; for only he that was Prince of Wales CAN so answer !
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 13]: On so trivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 10]: It was a lucky thought , a happy thought .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 32]: That it was so considered by the great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from eye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 70]: Yes , none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the vanished Great Seal -- this forlorn little impostor had been taught his lesson well , but here his teachings must fail , for his teacher himself could not answer THAT question -- ah , very good , very good indeed ; now we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in short order !
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 26]: And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with satisfaction , and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy of guilty confusion .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 47]: How surprised they were , then , to see nothing of the sort happen -- how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly , in a confident and untroubled voice , and say -- `` There is nought in this riddle that is difficult . ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 128]: Then , without so much as a by-your-leave to anybody , he turned and gave this command , with the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things : `` My Lord St. John , go you to my private cabinet in the palace -- for none knoweth the place better than you -- and , close down to the floor , in the left corner remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber , you shall find in the wall a brazen nail-head ; press upon it and a little jewel-closet will fly open which not even you do know of -- no , nor any soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did contrive it for me .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 19]: The first thing that falleth under your eye will be the Great Seal -- fetch it hither . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 48]: All the company wondered at this speech , and wondered still more to see the little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent fear of mistake , and call him by name with such a placidly convincing air of having known him all his life .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 8]: The peer was almost surprised into obeying .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 24]: He even made a movement as if to go , but quickly recovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 16]: Tom Canty turned upon him and said , sharply -- `` Why dost thou hesitate ?
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 8]: Hast not heard the King 's command ?
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 3]: Go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 49]: The Lord St. John made a deep obeisance -- and it was observed that it was a significantly cautious and non-committal one , it not being delivered at either of the kings , but at the neutral ground about half-way between the two -- and took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 88]: Now began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group which was slow , scarcely perceptible , and yet steady and persistent -- a movement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly , whereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join themselves to another -- a movement which , little by little , in the present case , dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty and clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 6]: Tom Canty stood almost alone .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 40]: Now ensued a brief season of deep suspense and waiting -- during which even the few faint hearts still remaining near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to glide , one by one , over to the majority .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 31]: So at last Tom Canty , in his royal robes and jewels , stood wholly alone and isolated from the world , a conspicuous figure , occupying an eloquent vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 9]: Now the Lord St. John was seen returning .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 47]: As he advanced up the mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of conversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by a profound hush , a breathless stillness , through which his footfalls pulsed with a dull and distant sound .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 11]: Every eye was fastened upon him as he moved along .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 32]: He reached the platform , paused a moment , then moved toward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance , and said -- `` Sire , the Seal is not there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 37]: A mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more haste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from the presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 28]: In a moment he stood all alone , without friend or supporter , a target upon which was concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 32]: The Lord Protector called out fiercely -- `` Cast the beggar into the street , and scourge him through the town -- the paltry knave is worth no more consideration ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 21]: Officers of the guard sprang forward to obey , but Tom Canty waved them off and said -- `` Back !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 8]: Whoso touches him perils his life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: The Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 13]: He said to the Lord St. John -- `` Searched you well ?
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 9]: -- but it boots not to ask that .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 6]: It doth seem passing strange .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 73]: Little things , trifles , slip out of one 's ken , and one does not think it matter for surprise ; but how so bulky a thing as the Seal of England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it again -- a massy golden disk -- '' Tom Canty , with beaming eyes , sprang forward and shouted -- `` Hold , that is enough !
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 4]: Was it round ?
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 4]: -- and thick ?
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 11]: -- and had it letters and devices graved upon it ?
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 3]: -- yes ?
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 20]: Oh , NOW I know what this Great Seal is that there 's been such worry and pother about .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 18]: An ' ye had described it to me , ye could have had it three weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 21]: Right well I know where it lies ; but it was not I that put it there -- first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 9]: `` Who , then , my liege ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 5]: asked the Lord Protector .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 12]: `` He that stands there -- the rightful King of England .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 22]: And he shall tell you himself where it lies -- then you will believe he knew it of his own knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 46]: Bethink thee , my King -- spur thy memory -- it was the last , the very LAST thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from the palace , clothed in my rags , to punish the soldier that insulted me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 80]: A silence ensued , undisturbed by a movement or a whisper , and all eyes were fixed upon the new-comer , who stood , with bent head and corrugated brow , groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless recollections for one single little elusive fact , which , found , would seat him upon a throne -- unfound , would leave him as he was , for good and all -- a pauper and an outcast .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 24]: Moment after moment passed -- the moments built themselves into minutes -- still the boy struggled silently on , and gave no sign .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 47]: But at last he heaved a sigh , shook his head slowly , and said , with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice -- `` I call the scene back -- all of it -- but the Seal hath no place in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 51]: He paused , then looked up , and said with gentle dignity , `` My lords and gentlemen , if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of this evidence which he is not able to furnish , I may not stay ye , being powerless .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 16]: But -- '' `` Oh , folly , oh , madness , my King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 11]: cried Tom Canty , in a panic , `` wait !
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 3]: -- think !
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 5]: Do not give up !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 7]: -- the cause is not lost !
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 6]: Nor SHALL be , neither !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 27]: List to what I say -- follow every word -- I am going to bring that morning back again , every hap just as it happened .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 59]: We talked -- I told you of my sisters , Nan and Bet -- ah , yes , you remember that ; and about mine old grandam -- and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court -- yes , you remember these things also ; very well , follow me still , you shall recall everything .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 39]: You gave me food and drink , and did with princely courtesy send away the servants , so that my low breeding might not shame me before them -- ah , yes , this also you remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 53]: As Tom checked off his details , and the other boy nodded his head in recognition of them , the great audience and the officials stared in puzzled wonderment ; the tale sounded like true history , yet how could this impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come about ?
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 18]: Never was a company of people so perplexed , so interested , and so stupefied , before .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 13]: `` For a jest , my prince , we did exchange garments .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 32]: Then we stood before a mirror ; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had been no change made -- yes , you remember that .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 13]: Then you noticed that the soldier had hurt my hand -- look !
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 19]: here it is , I can not yet even write with it , the fingers are so stiff .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 67]: At this your Highness sprang up , vowing vengeance upon that soldier , and ran towards the door -- you passed a table -- that thing you call the Seal lay on that table -- you snatched it up and looked eagerly about , as if for a place to hide it -- your eye caught sight of -- '' `` There , 't is sufficient !
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: -- and the good God be thanked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 10]: exclaimed the ragged claimant , in a mighty excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 29]: `` Go , my good St. John -- in an arm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall , thou ` lt find the Seal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 6]: `` Right , my King !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 3]: right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 31]: cried Tom Canty ; `` NOW the sceptre of England is thine own ; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he had been born dumb !
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 13]: Go , my Lord St. John , give thy feet wings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 24]: The whole assemblage was on its feet now , and well-nigh out of its mind with uneasiness , apprehension , and consuming excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 51]: On the floor and on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst forth , and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was interested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear , or he was shouting into his neighbour 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 15]: Time -- nobody knew how much of it -- swept by unheeded and unnoted .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 32]: At last a sudden hush fell upon the house , and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform , and held the Great Seal aloft in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 15]: Then such a shout went up -- `` Long live the true King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 67]: For five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical instruments , and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs ; and through it all a ragged lad , the most conspicuous figure in England , stood , flushed and happy and proud , in the centre of the spacious platform , with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 38]: Then all rose , and Tom Canty cried out -- `` Now , O my King , take these regal garments back , and give poor Tom , thy servant , his shreds and remnants again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 20]: The Lord Protector spoke up -- `` Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 19]: But the new King , the true King , said -- `` I will not have it so .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 22]: But for him I had not got my crown again -- none shall lay a hand upon him to harm him .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 57]: And as for thee , my good uncle , my Lord Protector , this conduct of thine is not grateful toward this poor lad , for I hear he hath made thee a duke '' -- the Protector blushed -- `` yet he was not a king ; wherefore what is thy fine title worth now ?
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 28]: To-morrow you shall sue to me , THROUGH HIM , for its confirmation , else no duke , but a simple earl , shalt thou remain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 20]: Under this rebuke , his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from the front for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 36]: The King turned to Tom , and said kindly -- `` My poor boy , how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I could not remember it myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 18]: `` Ah , my King , that was easy , since I used it divers days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 13]: `` Used it -- yet could not explain where it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 11]: `` I did not know it was THAT they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 10]: They did not describe it , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 8]: `` Then how used you it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 21]: The red blood began to steal up into Tom 's cheeks , and he dropped his eyes and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 16]: `` Speak up , good lad , and fear nothing , '' said the King .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 11]: `` How used you the Great Seal of England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 22]: Tom stammered a moment , in a pathetic confusion , then got it out -- `` To crack nuts with ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 17]: Poor child , the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him off his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 33]: But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was not the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of royalty , this reply disposed of it utterly .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 28]: Meantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom 's shoulders to the King 's , whose rags were effectually hidden from sight under it .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 38]: Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed ; the true King was anointed and the crown set upon his head , whilst cannon thundered the news to the city , and all London seemed to rock with applause .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 3]: Chapter XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 4]: Edward as King .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 26]: Miles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on London Bridge -- he was more so when he got out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 18]: He had but little money when he got in , none at all when he got out .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 10]: The pickpockets had stripped him of his last farthing .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 10]: But no matter , so he found his boy .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 30]: Being a soldier , he did not go at his task in a random way , but set to work , first of all , to arrange his campaign .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 7]: What would the boy naturally do ?
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 6]: Where would he naturally go ?
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 35]: Well -- argued Miles -- he would naturally go to his former haunts , for that is the instinct of unsound minds , when homeless and forsaken , as well as of sound ones .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 6]: Whereabouts were his former haunts ?
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 41]: His rags , taken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even claimed to be his father , indicated that his home was in one or another of the poorest and meanest districts of London .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: Would the search for him be difficult , or long ?
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 11]: No , it was likely to be easy and brief .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 66]: He would not hunt for the boy , he would hunt for a crowd ; in the centre of a big crowd or a little one , sooner or later , he should find his poor little friend , sure ; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself with pestering and aggravating the boy , who would be proclaiming himself King , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 36]: Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people , and carry off his little ward , and comfort and cheer him with loving words , and the two would never be separated any more .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 7]: So Miles started on his quest .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 32]: Hour after hour he tramped through back alleys and squalid streets , seeking groups and crowds , and finding no end of them , but never any sign of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 11]: This greatly surprised him , but did not discourage him .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 39]: To his notion , there was nothing the matter with his plan of campaign ; the only miscalculation about it was that the campaign was becoming a lengthy one , whereas he had expected it to be short .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 37]: When daylight arrived , at last , he had made many a mile , and canvassed many a crowd , but the only result was that he was tolerably tired , rather hungry and very sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 14]: He wanted some breakfast , but there was no way to get it .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 54]: To beg for it did not occur to him ; as to pawning his sword , he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour ; he could spare some of his clothes -- yes , but one could as easily find a customer for a disease as for such clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 33]: At noon he was still tramping -- among the rabble which followed after the royal procession , now ; for he argued that this regal display would attract his little lunatic powerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 22]: He followed the pageant through all its devious windings about London , and all the way to Westminster and the Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 44]: He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes that were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time , baffled and perplexed , and finally wandered off , thinking , and trying to contrive some way to better his plan of campaign .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 29]: By-and-by , when he came to himself out of his musings , he discovered that the town was far behind him and that the day was growing old .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 31]: He was near the river , and in the country ; it was a region of fine rural seats -- not the sort of district to welcome clothes like his .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 25]: It was not at all cold ; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee of a hedge to rest and think .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 41]: Drowsiness presently began to settle upon his senses ; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear , and he said to himself , `` The new King is crowned , '' and straightway fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 15]: He had not slept or rested , before , for more than thirty hours .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 14]: He did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 45]: He got up , lame , stiff , and half famished , washed himself in the river , stayed his stomach with a pint or two of water , and trudged off toward Westminster , grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 56]: Hunger helped him to a new plan , now ; he would try to get speech with old Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks , and -- but that was enough of a plan for the present ; it would be time enough to enlarge it when this first stage should be accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 37]: Toward eleven o'clock he approached the palace ; and although a host of showy people were about him , moving in the same direction , he was not inconspicuous -- his costume took care of that .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 46]: He watched these people 's faces narrowly , hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might be willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant -- as to trying to get into the palace himself , that was simply out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 50]: Presently our whipping-boy passed him , then wheeled about and scanned his figure well , saying to himself , `` An ' that is not the very vagabond his Majesty is in such a worry about , then am I an ass -- though belike I was that before .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 23]: He answereth the description to a rag -- that God should make two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 13]: I would I could contrive an excuse to speak with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 65]: Miles Hendon saved him the trouble ; for he turned about , then , as a man generally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from behind ; and observing a strong interest in the boy 's eyes , he stepped toward him and said -- `` You have just come out from the palace ; do you belong there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 7]: `` Yes , your worship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 8]: `` Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 12]: The boy started , and said to himself , `` Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 6]: mine old departed father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 13]: Then he answered aloud , `` Right well , your worship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 8]: `` Good -- is he within ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' said the boy ; and added , to himself , `` within his grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 26]: `` Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him , and say I beg to say a word in his ear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 13]: `` I will despatch the business right willingly , fair sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 28]: `` Then say Miles Hendon , son of Sir Richard , is here without -- I shall be greatly bounden to you , my good lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 5]: The boy looked disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 43]: `` The King did not name him so , '' he said to himself ; `` but it mattereth not , this is his twin brother , and can give his Majesty news of t ` other Sir-Odds-and-Ends , I warrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 25]: So he said to Miles , `` Step in there a moment , good sir , and wait till I bring you word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 32]: Hendon retired to the place indicated -- it was a recess sunk in the palace wall , with a stone bench in it -- a shelter for sentinels in bad weather .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 18]: He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers , in charge of an officer , passed by .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 16]: The officer saw him , halted his men , and commanded Hendon to come forth .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 19]: He obeyed , and was promptly arrested as a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 6]: Things began to look ugly .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 25]: Poor Miles was going to explain , but the officer roughly silenced him , and ordered his men to disarm him and search him .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 34]: `` God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat , '' said poor Miles ; `` I have searched enow , and failed , yet is my need greater than theirs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 7]: Nothing was found but a document .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 29]: The officer tore it open , and Hendon smiled when he recognised the ` pot-hooks ' made by his lost little friend that black day at Hendon Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 24]: The officer 's face grew dark as he read the English paragraph , and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he listened .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 9]: `` Another new claimant of the Crown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 4]: cried the officer .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 9]: `` Verily they breed like rabbits , to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 27]: Seize the rascal , men , and see ye keep him fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the King . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 14]: He hurried away , leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 36]: `` Now is my evil luck ended at last , '' muttered Hendon , `` for I shall dangle at a rope 's end for a certainty , by reason of that bit of writing .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 9]: And what will become of my poor lad !
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 10]: -- ah , only the good God knoweth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 30]: By-and-by he saw the officer coming again , in a great hurry ; so he plucked his courage together , purposing to meet his trouble as became a man .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 34]: The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his sword to him ; then bowed respectfully , and said -- `` Please you , sir , to follow me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 38]: Hendon followed , saying to himself , `` An ' I were not travelling to death and judgment , and so must needs economise in sin , I would throttle this knave for his mock courtesy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 168]: The two traversed a populous court , and arrived at the grand entrance of the palace , where the officer , with another bow , delivered Hendon into the hands of a gorgeous official , who received him with profound respect and led him forward through a great hall , lined on both sides with rows of splendid flunkeys -LRB- who made reverential obeisance as the two passed along , but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately scarecrow the moment his back was turned -RRB- , and up a broad staircase , among flocks of fine folk , and finally conducted him into a vast room , clove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England , then made a bow , reminded him to take his hat off , and left him standing in the middle of the room , a mark for all eyes , for plenty of indignant frowns , and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 6]: Miles Hendon was entirely bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 39]: There sat the young King , under a canopy of state , five steps away , with his head bent down and aside , speaking with a sort of human bird of paradise -- a duke , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 29]: Hendon observed to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death in the full vigour of life , without having this peculiarly public humiliation added .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 21]: He wished the King would hurry about it -- some of the gaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 20]: At this moment the King raised his head slightly , and Hendon caught a good view of his face .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 8]: The sight nearly took his breath away !
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 34]: -- He stood gazing at the fair young face like one transfixed ; then presently ejaculated -- `` Lo , the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 49]: He muttered some broken sentences , still gazing and marvelling ; then turned his eyes around and about , scanning the gorgeous throng and the splendid saloon , murmuring , `` But these are REAL -- verily these are REAL -- surely it is not a dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 47]: He stared at the King again -- and thought , `` IS it a dream ... or IS he the veritable Sovereign of England , and not the friendless poor Tom o ' Bedlam I took him for -- who shall solve me this riddle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 36]: A sudden idea flashed in his eye , and he strode to the wall , gathered up a chair , brought it back , planted it on the floor , and sat down in it !
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 26]: A buzz of indignation broke out , a rough hand was laid upon him and a voice exclaimed -- `` Up , thou mannerless clown !
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 12]: would ` st sit in the presence of the King ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 28]: The disturbance attracted his Majesty 's attention , who stretched forth his hand and cried out -- `` Touch him not , it is his right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 7]: The throng fell back , stupefied .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 59]: The King went on -- `` Learn ye all , ladies , lords , and gentlemen , that this is my trusty and well-beloved servant , Miles Hendon , who interposed his good sword and saved his prince from bodily harm and possible death -- and for this he is a knight , by the King 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 46]: Also learn , that for a higher service , in that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame , taking these upon himself , he is a peer of England , Earl of Kent , and shall have gold and lands meet for the dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 55]: More -- the privilege which he hath just exercised is his by royal grant ; for we have ordained that the chiefs of his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the Majesty of England henceforth , age after age , so long as the crown shall endure .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 5]: Molest him not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 58]: Two persons , who , through delay , had only arrived from the country during this morning , and had now been in this room only five minutes , stood listening to these words and looking at the King , then at the scarecrow , then at the King again , in a sort of torpid bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 9]: These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 9]: But the new Earl did not see them .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 24]: He was still staring at the monarch , in a dazed way , and muttering -- `` Oh , body o ' me !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 4]: THIS my pauper !
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 4]: This my lunatic !
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 23]: This is he whom _ I _ would show what grandeur was , in my house of seventy rooms and seven-and-twenty servants !
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 22]: This is he who had never known aught but rags for raiment , kicks for comfort , and offal for diet !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 13]: This is he whom _ I _ adopted and would make respectable !
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 13]: Would God I had a bag to hide my head in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 36]: Then his manners suddenly came back to him , and he dropped upon his knees , with his hands between the King 's , and swore allegiance and did homage for his lands and titles .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 21]: Then he rose and stood respectfully aside , a mark still for all eyes -- and much envy , too .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 44]: Now the King discovered Sir Hugh , and spoke out with wrathful voice and kindling eye -- `` Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates , and put him under lock and key till I have need of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: The late Sir Hugh was led away .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 41]: There was a stir at the other end of the room , now ; the assemblage fell apart , and Tom Canty , quaintly but richly clothed , marched down , between these living walls , preceded by an usher .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 28]: He knelt before the King , who said -- `` I have learned the story of these past few weeks , and am well pleased with thee .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 12]: Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 10]: Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again ?
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 23]: Good ; they shall be cared for -- and thy father shall hang , if thou desire it and the law consent .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 67]: Know , all ye that hear my voice , that from this day , they that abide in the shelter of Christ 's Hospital and share the King 's bounty shall have their minds and hearts fed , as well as their baser parts ; and this boy shall dwell there , and hold the chief place in its honourable body of governors , during life .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 81]: And for that he hath been a king , it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due ; wherefore note this his dress of state , for by it he shall be known , and none shall copy it ; and wheresoever he shall come , it shall remind the people that he hath been royal , in his time , and none shall deny him his due of reverence or fail to give him salutation .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 31]: He hath the throne 's protection , he hath the crown 's support , he shall be known and called by the honourable title of the King 's Ward . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 21]: The proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King 's hand , and was conducted from the presence .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 34]: He did not waste any time , but flew to his mother , to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help him enjoy the great news .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 5]: -LCB- 1 -RCB- Conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 4]: Justice and retribution .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 77]: When the mysteries were all cleared up , it came out , by confession of Hugh Hendon , that his wife had repudiated Miles by his command , that day at Hendon Hall -- a command assisted and supported by the perfectly trustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was Miles Hendon , and stand firmly to it , he would have her life ; whereupon she said , `` Take it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 28]: -- she did not value it -- and she would not repudiate Miles ; then the husband said he would spare her life but have Miles assassinated !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 15]: This was a different matter ; so she gave her word and kept it .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 47]: Hugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brother 's estates and title , because the wife and brother would not testify against him -- and the former would not have been allowed to do it , even if she had wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 26]: Hugh deserted his wife and went over to the continent , where he presently died ; and by-and-by the Earl of Kent married his relict .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 20]: There were grand times and rejoicings at Hendon village when the couple paid their first visit to the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 10]: Tom Canty 's father was never heard of again .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 40]: The King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave , and reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler 's gang , and put him in the way of a comfortable livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 14]: He also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 36]: He provided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist women whom he saw burned at the stake , and roundly punished the official who laid the undeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon 's back .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 51]: He saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon , and also the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver ; but he was too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in the royal forest .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 41]: He showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed to have stolen a pig , and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in the public esteem and become a great and honoured man .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 86]: As long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of his adventures , all through , from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him away from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed himself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the Abbey and climbed up and hid himself in the Confessor 's tomb , and then slept so long , next day , that he came within one of missing the Coronation altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 62]: He said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson kept him strong in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to his people ; and so , whilst his life was spared he should continue to tell the story , and thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his memory and the springs of pity replenished in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 25]: Miles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King , all through his brief reign , and his sincere mourners when he died .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 53]: The good Earl of Kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege ; but he exercised it twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was called from this world -- once at the accession of Queen Mary , and once at the accession of Queen Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 89]: A descendant of his exercised it at the accession of James I. Before this one 's son chose to use the privilege , near a quarter of a century had elapsed , and the ` privilege of the Kents ' had faded out of most people 's memories ; so , when the Kent of that day appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down in the sovereign 's presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house , there was a fine stir indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 12]: But the matter was soon explained , and the right confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 26]: The last Earl of the line fell in the wars of the Commonwealth fighting for the King , and the odd privilege ended with him .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 23]: Tom Canty lived to be a very old man , a handsome , white-haired old fellow , of grave and benignant aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 71]: As long as he lasted he was honoured ; and he was also reverenced , for his striking and peculiar costume kept the people reminded that ` in his time he had been royal ; ' so , wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart , making way for him , and whispering , one to another , `` Doff thy hat , it is the King 's Ward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 28]: -- and so they saluted , and got his kindly smile in return -- and they valued it , too , for his was an honourable history .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 6]: Yes , King Edward VI .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 15]: lived only a few years , poor boy , but he lived them worthily .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 80]: More than once , when some great dignitary , some gilded vassal of the crown , made argument against his leniency , and urged that some law which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose , and wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind , the young King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate eyes upon him and answered -- `` What dost THOU know of suffering and oppression ?
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 11]: I and my people know , but not thou . ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 6]: The reign of Edward VI .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 10]: was a singularly merciful one for those harsh times .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 23]: Now that we are taking leave of him , let us try to keep this in our minds , to his credit .

Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 9]: It is thought that both are Danish importations .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 17]: As far back as knowledge goes , the loving-cup has always been drunk at English banquets .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 8]: Tradition explains the ceremonies in this way .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 45]: In the rude ancient times it was deemed a wise precaution to have both hands of both drinkers employed , lest while the pledger pledged his love and fidelity to the pledgee , the pledgee take that opportunity to slip a dirk into him !

Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 50]: But if he -LRB- the Protector -RRB- gave offence by assuming too much state , he deserves great praise on account of the laws passed this session , by which the rigour of former statutes was much mitigated , and some security given to the freedom of the constitution .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 51]: All laws were repealed which extended the crime of treason beyond the statute of the twenty-fifth of Edward III. ; all laws enacted during the late reign extending the crime of felony ; all the former laws against Lollardy or heresy , together with the statute of the Six Articles .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 17]: None were to be accused for words , but within a month after they were spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 36]: By these repeals several of the most rigorous laws that ever had passed in England were annulled ; and some dawn , both of civil and religious liberty , began to appear to the people .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 29]: A repeal also passed of that law , the destruction of all laws , by which the King 's proclamation was made of equal force with a statute .

Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 42]: This peasant was suffering from this law BY ANTICIPATION ; the King was venting his indignation against a law which was not yet in existence ; for this hideous statute was to have birth in this little King 's OWN REIGN .

Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 39]: The curious old book called The English Rogue makes the limit thirteen pence ha ` penny : death being the portion of any who steal a thing ` above the value of thirteen pence ha ` penny . '
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 5]: NOTES to Chapter XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 36]: From many descriptions of larceny the law expressly took away the benefit of clergy : to steal a horse , or a HAWK , or woollen cloth from the weaver , was a hanging matter .
