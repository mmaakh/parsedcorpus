Parsing [sent. 1 len. 45]: THE $ 30,000 BEQUEST and Other Stories by Mark Twain THE $ 30,000 BEQUEST CHAPTER I Lakeside was a pleasant little town of five or six thousand inhabitants , and a rather pretty one , too , as towns go in the Far West .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 42]: It had church accommodations for thirty-five thousand , which is the way of the Far West and the South , where everybody is religious , and where each of the Protestant sects is represented and has a plant of its own .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 26]: Rank was unknown in Lakeside -- unconfessed , anyway ; everybody knew everybody and his dog , and a sociable friendliness was the prevailing atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 20]: Saladin Foster was book-keeper in the principal store , and the only high-salaried man of his profession in Lakeside .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 71]: He was thirty-five years old , now ; he had served that store for fourteen years ; he had begun in his marriage-week at four hundred dollars a year , and had climbed steadily up , a hundred dollars a year , for four years ; from that time forth his wage had remained eight hundred -- a handsome figure indeed , and everybody conceded that he was worth it .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 26]: His wife , Electra , was a capable helpmeet , although -- like himself -- a dreamer of dreams and a private dabbler in romance .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 48]: The first thing she did , after her marriage -- child as she was , aged only nineteen -- was to buy an acre of ground on the edge of the town , and pay down the cash for it -- twenty-five dollars , all her fortune .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 7]: Saladin had less , by fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 27]: She instituted a vegetable garden there , got it farmed on shares by the nearest neighbor , and made it pay her a hundred per cent .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 3]: a year .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 38]: Out of Saladin 's first year 's wage she put thirty dollars in the savings-bank , sixty out of his second , a hundred out of his third , a hundred and fifty out of his fourth .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 37]: His wage went to eight hundred a year , then , and meantime two children had arrived and increased the expenses , but she banked two hundred a year from the salary , nevertheless , thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 36]: When she had been married seven years she built and furnished a pretty and comfortable two-thousand-dollar house in the midst of her garden-acre , paid half of the money down and moved her family in .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 18]: Seven years later she was out of debt and had several hundred dollars out earning its living .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 54]: Earning it by the rise in landed estate ; for she had long ago bought another acre or two and sold the most of it at a profit to pleasant people who were willing to build , and would be good neighbors and furnish a general comradeship for herself and her growing family .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 34]: She had an independent income from safe investments of about a hundred dollars a year ; her children were growing in years and grace ; and she was a pleased and happy woman .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 21]: Happy in her husband , happy in her children , and the husband and the children were happy in her .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 10]: It is at this point that this history begins .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 33]: The youngest girl , Clytemnestra -- called Clytie for short -- was eleven ; her sister , Gwendolen -- called Gwen for short -- was thirteen ; nice girls , and comely .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 23]: The names betray the latent romance-tinge in the parental blood , the parents ' names indicate that the tinge was an inheritance .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 35]: It was an affectionate family , hence all four of its members had pet names , Saladin 's was a curious and unsexing one -- Sally ; and so was Electra 's -- Aleck .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 90]: All day long Sally was a good and diligent book-keeper and salesman ; all day long Aleck was a good and faithful mother and housewife , and thoughtful and calculating business woman ; but in the cozy living-room at night they put the plodding world away , and lived in another and a fairer , reading romances to each other , dreaming dreams , comrading with kings and princes and stately lords and ladies in the flash and stir and splendor of noble palaces and grim and ancient castles .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 7]: CHAPTER II Now came great news !
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 9]: Stunning news -- joyous news , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 16]: It came from a neighboring state , where the family 's only surviving relative lived .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 39]: It was Sally 's relative -- a sort of vague and indefinite uncle or second or third cousin by the name of Tilbury Foster , seventy and a bachelor , reputed well off and corresponding sour and crusty .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 26]: Sally had tried to make up to him once , by letter , in a bygone time , and had not made that mistake again .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 58]: Tilbury now wrote to Sally , saying he should shortly die , and should leave him thirty thousand dollars , cash ; not for love , but because money had given him most of his troubles and exasperations , and he wished to place it where there was good hope that it would continue its malignant work .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 15]: The bequest would be found in his will , and would be paid over .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 49]: PROVIDED , that Sally should be able to prove to the executors that he had TAKEN NO NOTICE OF THE GIFT BY SPOKEN WORD OR BY LETTER , HAD MADE NO INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE MORIBUND 'S PROGRESS TOWARD THE EVERLASTING TROPICS , AND HAD NOT ATTENDED THE FUNERAL .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 30]: As soon as Aleck had partially recovered from the tremendous emotions created by the letter , she sent to the relative 's habitat and subscribed for the local paper .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 70]: Man and wife entered into a solemn compact , now , to never mention the great news to any one while the relative lived , lest some ignorant person carry the fact to the death-bed and distort it and make it appear that they were disobediently thankful for the bequest , and just the same as confessing it and publishing it , right in the face of the prohibition .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 50]: For the rest of the day Sally made havoc and confusion with his books , and Aleck could not keep her mind on her affairs , not even take up a flower-pot or book or a stick of wood without forgetting what she had intended to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 5]: For both were dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 6]: `` Thir-ty thousand dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 16]: All day long the music of those inspiring words sang through those people 's heads .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 32]: From his marriage-day forth , Aleck 's grip had been upon the purse , and Sally had seldom known what it was to be privileged to squander a dime on non-necessities .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 6]: `` Thir-ty thousand dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 7]: the song went on and on .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 8]: A vast sum , an unthinkable sum !
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 21]: All day long Aleck was absorbed in planning how to invest it , Sally in planning how to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 7]: There was no romance-reading that night .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 19]: The children took themselves away early , for their parents were silent , distraught , and strangely unentertaining .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 42]: The good-night kisses might as well have been impressed upon vacancy , for all the response they got ; the parents were not aware of the kisses , and the children had been gone an hour before their absence was noticed .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 17]: Two pencils had been busy during that hour -- note-making ; in the way of plans .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 10]: It was Sally who broke the stillness at last .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 16]: He said , with exultation : `` Ah , it 'll be grand , Aleck !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 27]: Out of the first thousand we 'll have a horse and a buggy for summer , and a cutter and a skin lap-robe for winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 13]: Aleck responded with decision and composure -- `` Out of the CAPITAL ?
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 5]: Nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 8]: Not if it was a million ! ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 13]: Sally was deeply disappointed ; the glow went out of his face .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 6]: `` Oh , Aleck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 5]: he said , reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 42]: `` We 've always worked so hard and been so scrimped : and now that we are rich , it does seem -- '' He did not finish , for he saw her eye soften ; his supplication had touched her .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 23]: She said , with gentle persuasiveness : `` We must not spend the capital , dear , it would not be wise .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 19]: Out of the income from it -- '' `` That will answer , that will answer , Aleck !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 7]: How dear and good you are !
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 36]: There will be a noble income and if we can spend that -- '' `` Not ALL of it , dear , not all of it , but you can spend a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 7]: That is , a reasonable part .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 24]: But the whole of the capital -- every penny of it -- must be put right to work , and kept at it .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 12]: You see the reasonableness of that , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 5]: `` Why , ye-s .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 5]: Yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 9]: But we 'll have to wait so long .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 10]: Six months before the first interest falls due . ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 7]: `` Yes -- maybe longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 5]: `` Longer , Aleck ?
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 7]: Do n't they pay half-yearly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 20]: `` THAT kind of an investment -- yes ; but I sha 'n' t invest in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 7]: `` What way , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 6]: `` For big returns . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 3]: `` Big .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 4]: That 's good .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: Go on , Aleck .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 3]: `` Coal .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 4]: The new mines .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 2]: Cannel .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 8]: I mean to put in ten thousand .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 3]: Ground floor .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 13]: When we organize , we 'll get three shares for one . ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 11]: `` By George , but it sounds good , Aleck !
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 10]: Then the shares will be worth -- how much ?
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 4]: And when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 5]: `` About a year .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 7]: They 'll pay ten per cent .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 9]: half yearly , and be worth thirty thousand .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 16]: I know all about it ; the advertisement is in the Cincinnati paper here . ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 12]: `` Land , thirty thousand for ten -- in a year !
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 12]: Let 's jam in the whole capital and pull out ninety !
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 15]: I 'll write and subscribe right now -- tomorrow it maybe too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 19]: He was flying to the writing-desk , but Aleck stopped him and put him back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 11]: She said : `` Do n't lose your head so .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 18]: WE must n't subscribe till we 've got the money ; do n't you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 17]: Sally 's excitement went down a degree or two , but he was not wholly appeased .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 19]: `` Why , Aleck , we 'll HAVE it , you know -- and so soon , too .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 25]: He 's probably out of his troubles before this ; it 's a hundred to nothing he 's selecting his brimstone-shovel this very minute .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 19]: Now , I think -- '' Aleck shuddered , and said : `` How CAN you , Sally !
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 13]: Do n't talk in that way , it is perfectly scandalous . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 30]: `` Oh , well , make it a halo , if you like , _ I _ do n't care for his outfit , I was only just talking .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 9]: Ca n't you let a person talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 13]: `` But why should you WANT to talk in that dreadful way ?
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 19]: How would you like to have people talk so about YOU , and you not cold yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 32]: `` Not likely to be , for ONE while , I reckon , if my last act was giving away money for the sake of doing somebody a harm with it .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 15]: But never mind about Tilbury , Aleck , let 's talk about something worldly .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 16]: It does seem to me that that mine is the place for the whole thirty .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 6]: What 's the objection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 14]: `` All the eggs in one basket -- that 's the objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 9]: `` All right , if you say so .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 6]: What about the other twenty ?
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 10]: What do you mean to do with that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 20]: `` There is no hurry ; I am going to look around before I do anything with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 15]: `` All right , if your mind 's made up , '' signed Sally .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 27]: He was deep in thought awhile , then he said : `` There 'll be twenty thousand profit coming from the ten a year from now .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 11]: We can spend that , can we , Aleck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 5]: Aleck shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 24]: `` No , dear , '' she said , `` it wo n't sell high till we 've had the first semi-annual dividend .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 8]: You can spend part of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 13]: `` Shucks , only THAT -- and a whole year to wait !
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 13]: Confound it , I -- '' `` Oh , do be patient !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 17]: It might even be declared in three months -- it 's quite within the possibilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 5]: `` Oh , jolly !
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 5]: oh , thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 11]: and Sally jumped up and kissed his wife in gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 11]: `` It 'll be three thousand -- three whole thousand !
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 10]: how much of it can we spend , Aleck ?
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 4]: Make it liberal !
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 12]: -- do , dear , that 's a good fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 30]: Aleck was pleased ; so pleased that she yielded to the pressure and conceded a sum which her judgment told her was a foolish extravagance -- a thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 21]: Sally kissed her half a dozen times and even in that way could not express all his joy and thankfulness .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 58]: This new access of gratitude and affection carried Aleck quite beyond the bounds of prudence , and before she could restrain herself she had made her darling another grant -- a couple of thousand out of the fifty or sixty which she meant to clear within a year of the twenty which still remained of the bequest .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 23]: The happy tears sprang to Sally 's eyes , and he said : `` Oh , I want to hug you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 5]: And he did it .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 28]: Then he got his notes and sat down and began to check off , for first purchase , the luxuries which he should earliest wish to secure .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 27]: `` Horse -- buggy -- cutter -- lap-robe -- patent-leathers -- dog -- plug-hat -- church-pew -- stem-winder -- new teeth -- SAY , Aleck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 8]: `` Ciphering away , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 4]: That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 10]: Have you got the twenty thousand invested yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 20]: `` No , there 's no hurry about that ; I must look around first , and think . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 12]: `` But you are ciphering ; what 's it about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 24]: `` Why , I have to find work for the thirty thousand that comes out of the coal , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 7]: `` Scott , what a head !
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 6]: I never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 6]: How are you getting along ?
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 6]: Where have you arrived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 10]: `` Not very far -- two years or three .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 16]: I 've turned it over twice ; once in oil and once in wheat . ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 9]: `` Why , Aleck , it 's splendid !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 6]: How does it aggregate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 29]: `` I think -- well , to be on the safe side , about a hundred and eighty thousand clear , though it will probably be more . ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 5]: is n't it wonderful ?
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 3]: By gracious !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 17]: luck has come our way at last , after all the hard sledding , Aleck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 25]: `` I 'm going to cash in a whole three hundred on the missionaries -- what real right have we care for expenses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 25]: `` You could n't do a nobler thing , dear ; and it 's just like your generous nature , you unselfish boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 39]: The praise made Sally poignantly happy , but he was fair and just enough to say it was rightfully due to Aleck rather than to himself , since but for her he should never have had the money .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 24]: Then they went up to bed , and in their delirium of bliss they forgot and left the candle burning in the parlor .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 30]: They did not remember until they were undressed ; then Sally was for letting it burn ; he said they could afford it , if it was a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 9]: But Aleck went down and put it out .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 37]: A good job , too ; for on her way back she hit on a scheme that would turn the hundred and eighty thousand into half a million before it had had time to get cold .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 33]: CHAPTER III The little newspaper which Aleck had subscribed for was a Thursday sheet ; it would make the trip of five hundred miles from Tilbury 's village and arrive on Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 40]: Tilbury 's letter had started on Friday , more than a day too late for the benefactor to die and get into that week 's issue , but in plenty of time to make connection for the next output .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 26]: Thus the Fosters had to wait almost a complete week to find out whether anything of a satisfactory nature had happened to him or not .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 16]: It was a long , long week , and the strain was a heavy one .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 19]: The pair could hardly have borne it if their minds had not had the relief of wholesome diversion .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 8]: We have seen that they had that .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 30]: The woman was piling up fortunes right along , the man was spending them -- spending all his wife would give him a chance at , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 12]: At last the Saturday came , and the WEEKLY SAGAMORE arrived .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 6]: Mrs. Eversly Bennett was present .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 17]: She was the Presbyterian parson 's wife , and was working the Fosters for a charity .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 12]: Talk now died a sudden death -- on the Foster side .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 29]: Mrs. Bennett presently discovered that her hosts were not hearing a word she was saying ; so she got up , wondering and indignant , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 31]: The moment she was out of the house , Aleck eagerly tore the wrapper from the paper , and her eyes and Sally 's swept the columns for the death-notices .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 2]: Disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 6]: Tilbury was not anywhere mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 23]: Aleck was a Christian from the cradle , and duty and the force of habit required her to go through the motions .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 12]: She pulled herself together and said , with a pious two-per-cent .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 31]: trade joyousness : `` Let us be humbly thankful that he has been spared ; and -- '' `` Damn his treacherous hide , I wish -- '' `` Sally !
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 4]: For shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 7]: `` I do n't care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 5]: retorted the angry man .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 25]: `` It 's the way YOU feel , and if you were n't so immorally pious you 'd be honest and say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 22]: Aleck said , with wounded dignity : `` I do not see how you can say such unkind and unjust things .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 10]: There is no such thing as immoral piety . ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 44]: Sally felt a pang , but tried to conceal it under a shuffling attempt to save his case by changing the form of it -- as if changing the form while retaining the juice could deceive the expert he was trying to placate .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 54]: He said : `` I did n't mean so bad as that , Aleck ; I did n't really mean immoral piety , I only meant -- meant -- well , conventional piety , you know ; er -- shop piety ; the -- the -- why , YOU know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 75]: Aleck -- the -- well , where you put up that plated article and play it for solid , you know , without intending anything improper , but just out of trade habit , ancient policy , petrified custom , loyalty to -- to -- hang it , I ca n't find the right words , but YOU know what I mean , Aleck , and that there is n't any harm in it .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 5]: I 'll try again .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: You see , it 's this way .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 26]: If a person -- '' `` You have said quite enough , '' said Aleck , coldly ; `` let the subject be dropped . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 26]: `` I 'M willing , '' fervently responded Sally , wiping the sweat from his forehead and looking the thankfulness he had no words for .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 9]: Then , musingly , he apologized to himself .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 18]: `` I certainly held threes -- I KNOW it -- but I drew and did n't fill .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 12]: That 's where I 'm so often weak in the game .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 11]: If I had stood pat -- but I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 4]: I never do .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 7]: I do n't know enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 11]: Confessedly defeated , he was properly tame now and subdued .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 7]: Aleck forgave him with her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 28]: The grand interest , the supreme interest , came instantly to the front again ; nothing could keep it in the background many minutes on a stretch .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 14]: The couple took up the puzzle of the absence of Tilbury 's death-notice .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 49]: They discussed it every which way , more or less hopefully , but they had to finish where they began , and concede that the only really sane explanation of the absence of the notice must be -- and without doubt was -- that Tilbury was not dead .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 28]: There was something sad about it , something even a little unfair , maybe , but there it was , and had to be put up with .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 7]: They were agreed as to that .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 78]: To Sally it seemed a strangely inscrutable dispensation ; more inscrutable than usual , he thought ; one of the most unnecessary inscrutable he could call to mind , in fact -- and said so , with some feeling ; but if he was hoping to draw Aleck he failed ; she reserved her opinion , if she had one ; she had not the habit of taking injudicious risks in any market , worldly or other .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 15]: The pair must wait for next week 's paper -- Tilbury had evidently postponed .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 8]: That was their thought and their decision .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 20]: So they put the subject away and went about their affairs again with as good heart as they could .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 18]: Now , if they had but known it , they had been wronging Tilbury all the time .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 21]: Tilbury had kept faith , kept it to the letter ; he was dead , he had died to schedule .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 77]: He was dead more than four days now and used to it ; entirely dead , perfectly dead , as dead as any other new person in the cemetery ; dead in abundant time to get into that week 's SAGAMORE , too , and only shut out by an accident ; an accident which could not happen to a metropolitan journal , but which happens easily to a poor little village rag like the SAGAMORE .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 54]: On this occasion , just as the editorial page was being locked up , a gratis quart of strawberry ice-water arrived from Hostetter 's Ladies and Gents Ice-Cream Parlors , and the stickful of rather chilly regret over Tilbury 's translation got crowded out to make room for the editor 's frantic gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 12]: On its way to the standing-galley Tilbury 's notice got pied .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 38]: Otherwise it would have gone into some future edition , for WEEKLY SAGAMORES do not waste `` live '' matter , and in their galleys `` live '' matter is immortal , unless a pi accident intervenes .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 29]: But a thing that gets pied is dead , and for such there is no resurrection ; its chance of seeing print is gone , forever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 38]: And so , let Tilbury like it or not , let him rave in his grave to his fill , no matter -- no mention of his death would ever see the light in the WEEKLY SAGAMORE .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 8]: CHAPTER IV Five weeks drifted tediously along .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 18]: The SAGAMORE arrived regularly on the Saturdays , but never once contained a mention of Tilbury Foster .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 25]: Sally 's patience broke down at this point , and he said , resentfully : `` Damn his livers , he 's immortal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 38]: Aleck give him a very severe rebuke , and added with icy solemnity : `` How would you feel if you were suddenly cut out just after such an awful remark had escaped out of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 24]: Without sufficient reflection Sally responded : `` I 'd feel I was lucky I had n't got caught with it IN me . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 25]: Pride had forced him to say something , and as he could not think of any rational thing to say he flung that out .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 30]: Then he stole a base -- as he called it -- that is , slipped from the presence , to keep from being brayed in his wife 's discussion-mortar .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 6]: Six months came and went .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 8]: The SAGAMORE was still silent about Tilbury .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 23]: Meantime , Sally had several times thrown out a feeler -- that is , a hint that he would like to know .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 6]: Aleck had ignored the hints .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 12]: Sally now resolved to brace up and risk a frontal attack .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 22]: So he squarely proposed to disguise himself and go to Tilbury 's village and surreptitiously find out as to the prospects .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 13]: Aleck put her foot on the dangerous project with energy and decision .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 11]: She said : `` What can you be thinking of ?
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 7]: You do keep my hands full !
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 23]: You have to be watched all the time , like a little child , to keep you from walking into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 9]: You 'll stay right where you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 22]: `` Why , Aleck , I could do it and not be found out -- I 'm certain of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 16]: `` Sally Foster , do n't you know you would have to inquire around ? ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 9]: `` Of course , but what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 8]: Nobody would suspect who I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 8]: `` Oh , listen to the man !
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 15]: Some day you 've got to prove to the executors that you never inquired .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 4]: What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 6]: He had forgotten that detail .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 12]: He did n't reply ; there was n't anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 24]: Aleck added : `` Now then , drop that notion out of your mind , and do n't ever meddle with it again .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 7]: Tilbury set that trap for you .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 9]: Do n't you know it 's a trap ?
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 15]: He is on the watch , and fully expecting you to blunder into it .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 17]: Well , he is going to be disappointed -- at least while I am on deck .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 3]: Sally ! ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 22]: `` As long as you live , if it 's a hundred years , do n't you ever make an inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 3]: Promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 11]: `` All right , '' with a sigh and reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 12]: Then Aleck softened and said : `` Do n't be impatient .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 13]: We are prospering ; we can wait ; there is no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 34]: Our small dead-certain income increases all the time ; and as to futures , I have not made a mistake yet -- they are piling up by the thousands and tens of thousands .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 14]: There is not another family in the state with such prospects as ours .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 10]: Already we are beginning to roll in eventual wealth .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 9]: You know that , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 11]: `` Yes , Aleck , it 's certainly so . ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 15]: `` Then be grateful for what God is doing for us and stop worrying .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 22]: You do not believe we could have achieved these prodigious results without His special help and guidance , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 10]: Hesitatingly , `` N-no , I suppose not . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 56]: Then , with feeling and admiration , `` And yet , when it comes to judiciousness in watering a stock or putting up a hand to skin Wall Street I do n't give in that YOU need any outside amateur help , if I do wish I -- '' `` Oh , DO shut up !
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 34]: I know you do not mean any harm or any irreverence , poor boy , but you ca n't seem to open your mouth without letting out things to make a person shudder .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 7]: You keep me in constant dread .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 8]: For you and for all of us .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 33]: Once I had no fear of the thunder , but now when I hear it I -- '' Her voice broke , and she began to cry , and could not finish .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 36]: The sight of this smote Sally to the heart and he took her in his arms and petted her and comforted her and promised better conduct , and upbraided himself and remorsefully pleaded for forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 25]: And he was in earnest , and sorry for what he had done and ready for any sacrifice that could make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 23]: And so , in privacy , he thought long and deeply over the matter , resolving to do what should seem best .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 14]: It was easy to PROMISE reform ; indeed he had already promised it .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 12]: But would that do any real good , any permanent good ?
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 28]: No , it would be but temporary -- he knew his weakness , and confessed it to himself with sorrow -- he could not keep the promise .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 13]: Something surer and better must be devised ; and he devised it .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 25]: At cost of precious money which he had long been saving up , shilling by shilling , he put a lightning-rod on the house .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 7]: At a subsequent time he relapsed .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 6]: What miracles habit can do !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 20]: and how quickly and how easily habits are acquired -- both trifling habits and habits which profoundly change us .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 51]: If by accident we wake at two in the morning a couple of nights in succession , we have need to be uneasy , for another repetition can turn the accident into a habit ; and a month 's dallying with whiskey -- but we all know these commonplace facts .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: The castle-building habit , the day-dreaming habit -- how it grows !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 72]: what a luxury it becomes ; how we fly to its enchantments at every idle moment , how we revel in them , steep our souls in them , intoxicate ourselves with their beguiling fantasies -- oh yes , and how soon and how easily our dream life and our material life become so intermingled and so fused together that we ca n't quite tell which is which , any more .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 16]: By and by Aleck subscribed to a Chicago daily and for the WALL STREET POINTER .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 21]: With an eye single to finance she studied these as diligently all the week as she studied her Bible Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 37]: Sally was lost in admiration , to note with what swift and sure strides her genius and judgment developed and expanded in the forecasting and handling of the securities of both the material and spiritual markets .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 27]: He was proud of her nerve and daring in exploiting worldly stocks , and just as proud of her conservative caution in working her spiritual deals .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 40]: He noted that she never lost her head in either case ; that with a splendid courage she often went short on worldly futures , but heedfully drew the line there -- she was always long on the others .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 88]: Her policy was quite sane and simple , as she explained it to him : what she put into earthly futures was for speculation , what she put into spiritual futures was for investment ; she was willing to go into the one on a margin , and take chances , but in the case of the other , `` margin her no margins '' -- she wanted to cash in a hundred cents per dollar 's worth , and have the stock transferred on the books .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 16]: It took but a very few months to educate Aleck 's imagination and Sally 's .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 16]: Each day 's training added something to the spread and effectiveness of the two machines .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 42]: As a consequence , Aleck made imaginary money much faster than at first she had dreamed of making it , and Sally 's competency in spending the overflow of it kept pace with the strain put upon it , right along .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 34]: In the beginning , Aleck had given the coal speculation a twelvemonth in which to materialize , and had been loath to grant that this term might possibly be shortened by nine months .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 27]: But that was the feeble work , the nursery work , of a financial fancy that had had no teaching , no experience , no practice .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 25]: These aids soon came , then that nine months vanished , and the imaginary ten-thousand-dollar investment came marching home with three hundred per cent .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 5]: profit on its back !
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 11]: It was a great day for the pair of Fosters .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 6]: They were speechless for joy .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 44]: Also speechless for another reason : after much watching of the market , Aleck had lately , with fear and trembling , made her first flyer on a `` margin , '' using the remaining twenty thousand of the bequest in this risk .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 65]: In her mind 's eye she had seen it climb , point by point -- always with a chance that the market would break -- until at last her anxieties were too great for further endurance -- she being new to the margin business and unhardened , as yet -- and she gave her imaginary broker an imaginary order by imaginary telegraph to sell .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: She said forty thousand dollars ' profit was enough .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 19]: The sale was made on the very day that the coal venture had returned with its rich freight .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 36]: As I have said , the couple were speechless , they sat dazed and blissful that night , trying to realize that they were actually worth a hundred thousand dollars in clean , imaginary cash .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 5]: Yet so it was .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 41]: It was the last time that ever Aleck was afraid of a margin ; at least afraid enough to let it break her sleep and pale her cheek to the extent that this first experience in that line had done .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 7]: Indeed it was a memorable night .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 25]: Gradually the realization that they were rich sank securely home into the souls of the pair , then they began to place the money .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 99]: If we could have looked out through the eyes of these dreamers , we should have seen their tidy little wooden house disappear , and two-story brick with a cast-iron fence in front of it take its place ; we should have seen a three-globed gas-chandelier grow down from the parlor ceiling ; we should have seen the homely rag carpet turn to noble Brussels , a dollar and a half a yard ; we should have seen the plebeian fireplace vanish away and a recherche , big base-burner with isinglass windows take position and spread awe around .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 26]: And we should have seen other things , too ; among them the buggy , the lap-robe , the stove-pipe hat , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 60]: From that time forth , although the daughters and the neighbors saw only the same old wooden house there , it was a two-story brick to Aleck and Sally and not a night went by that Aleck did not worry about the imaginary gas-bills , and get for all comfort Sally 's reckless retort : `` What of it ?
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 6]: We can afford it . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 23]: Before the couple went to bed , that first night that they were rich , they had decided that they must celebrate .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 11]: They must give a party -- that was the idea .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 13]: But how to explain it -- to the daughters and the neighbors ?
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: They could not expose the fact that they were rich .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 22]: Sally was willing , even anxious , to do it ; but Aleck kept her head and would not allow it .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 25]: She said that although the money was as good as in , it would be as well to wait until it was actually in .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 13]: On that policy she took her stand , and would not budge .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 18]: The great secret must be kept , she said -- kept from the daughters and everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 5]: The pair were puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 23]: They must celebrate , they were determined to celebrate , but since the secret must be kept , what could they celebrate ?
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 8]: No birthdays were due for three months .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 20]: Tilbury was n't available , evidently he was going to live forever ; what the nation COULD they celebrate ?
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 20]: That was Sally 's way of putting it ; and he was getting impatient , too , and harassed .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 36]: But at last he hit it -- just by sheer inspiration , as it seemed to him -- and all their troubles were gone in a moment ; they would celebrate the Discovery of America .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 4]: A splendid idea !
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 20]: Aleck was almost too proud of Sally for words -- she said SHE never would have thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 38]: But Sally , although he was bursting with delight in the compliment and with wonder at himself , tried not to let on , and said it was n't really anything , anybody could have done it .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 19]: Whereat Aleck , with a prideful toss of her happy head , said : `` Oh , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 7]: Anybody could -- oh , anybody !
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 6]: Hosannah Dilkins , for instance !
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 11]: Or maybe Adelbert Peanut -- oh , DEAR -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 15]: Well , I 'd like to see them try it , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 57]: Dear-me-suz , if they could think of the discovery of a forty-acre island it 's more than _ I _ believe they could ; and as for the whole continent , why , Sally Foster , you know perfectly well it would strain the livers and lights out of them and THEN they could n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 40]: The dear woman , she knew he had talent ; and if affection made her over-estimate the size of it a little , surely it was a sweet and gentle crime , and forgivable for its source 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 8]: CHAPTER V The celebration went off well .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 13]: The friends were all present , both the young and the old .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 36]: Among the young were Flossie and Gracie Peanut and their brother Adelbert , who was a rising young journeyman tinner , also Hosannah Dilkins , Jr. , journeyman plasterer , just out of his apprenticeship .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 29]: For many months Adelbert and Hosannah had been showing interest in Gwendolen and Clytemnestra Foster , and the parents of the girls had noticed this with private satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 11]: But they suddenly realized now that that feeling had passed .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 21]: They recognized that the changed financial conditions had raised up a social bar between their daughters and the young mechanics .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 10]: The daughters could now look higher -- and must .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 4]: Yes , must .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 27]: They need marry nothing below the grade of lawyer or merchant ; poppa and momma would take care of this ; there must be no mesalliances .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 28]: However , these thinkings and projects of their were private , and did not show on the surface , and therefore threw no shadow upon the celebration .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 32]: What showed upon the surface was a serene and lofty contentment and a dignity of carriage and gravity of deportment which compelled the admiration and likewise the wonder of the company .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 20]: All noticed it and all commented upon it , but none was able to divine the secret of it .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 8]: It was a marvel and a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 26]: Three several persons remarked , without suspecting what clever shots they were making : `` It 's as if they 'd come into property . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 7]: That was just it , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 69]: Most mothers would have taken hold of the matrimonial matter in the old regulation way ; they would have given the girls a talking to , of a solemn sort and untactful -- a lecture calculated to defeat its own purpose , by producing tears and secret rebellion ; and the said mothers would have further damaged the business by requesting the young mechanics to discontinue their attentions .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 6]: But this mother was different .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 4]: She was practical .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 19]: She said nothing to any of the young people concerned , nor to any one else except Sally .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 11]: He listened to her and understood ; understood and admired .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 9]: He said : `` I get the idea .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 39]: Instead of finding fault with the samples on view , thus hurting feelings and obstructing trade without occasion , you merely offer a higher class of goods for the money , and leave nature to take her course .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 15]: It 's wisdom , Aleck , solid wisdom , and sound as a nut .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 5]: Who 's your fish ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 7]: Have you nominated him yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 6]: No , she had n't .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 11]: They must look the market over -- which they did .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 21]: To start with , they considered and discussed Brandish , rising young lawyer , and Fulton , rising young dentist .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 7]: Sally must invite them to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 13]: But not right away ; there was no hurry , Aleck said .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 23]: Keep an eye on the pair , and wait ; nothing would be lost by going slowly in so important a matter .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 35]: It turned out that this was wisdom , too ; for inside of three weeks Aleck made a wonderful strike which swelled her imaginary hundred thousand to four hundred thousand of the same quality .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 10]: She and Sally were in the clouds that evening .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 10]: For the first time they introduced champagne at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 17]: Not real champagne , but plenty real enough for the amount of imagination expended on it .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 12]: It was Sally that did it , and Aleck weakly submitted .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 58]: At bottom both were troubled and ashamed , for he was a high-up Son of Temperance , and at funerals wore an apron which no dog could look upon and retain his reason and his opinion ; and she was a W. C. T. U. , with all that that implies of boiler-iron virtue and unendurable holiness .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: But there is was ; the pride of riches was beginning its disintegrating work .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 47]: They had lived to prove , once more , a sad truth which had been proven many times before in the world : that whereas principle is a great and noble protection against showy and degrading vanities and vices , poverty is worth six of it .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 10]: More than four hundred thousand dollars to the good .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 8]: They took up the matrimonial matter again .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 21]: Neither the dentist nor the lawyer was mentioned ; there was no occasion , they were out of the running .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 2]: Disqualified .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 15]: They discussed the son of the pork-packer and the son of the village banker .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 22]: But finally , as in the previous case , they concluded to wait and think , and go cautiously and sure .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 6]: Luck came their way again .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 17]: Aleck , ever watchful saw a great and risky chance , and took a daring flyer .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 24]: A time of trembling , of doubt , of awful uneasiness followed , for non-success meant absolute ruin and nothing short of it .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 38]: Then came the result , and Aleck , faint with joy , could hardly control her voice when she said : `` The suspense is over , Sally -- and we are worth a cold million ! ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 39]: Sally wept for gratitude , and said : `` Oh , Electra , jewel of women , darling of my heart , we are free at last , we roll in wealth , we need never scrimp again .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 9]: It 's a case for Veuve Cliquot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 33]: and he got out a pint of spruce-beer and made sacrifice , he saying `` Damn the expense , '' and she rebuking him gently with reproachful but humid and happy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 28]: They shelved the pork-packer 's son and the banker 's son , and sat down to consider the Governor 's son and the son of the Congressman .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 24]: CHAPTER VI It were a weariness to follow in detail the leaps and bounds the Foster fictitious finances took from this time forth .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 12]: It was marvelous , it was dizzying , it was dazzling .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 16]: Everything Aleck touched turned to fairy gold , and heaped itself glittering toward the firmament .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 21]: Millions upon millions poured in , and still the mighty stream flowed thundering along , still its vast volume increased .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 18]: Five millions -- ten millions -- twenty -- thirty -- was there never to be an end ?
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 19]: Two years swept by in a splendid delirium , the intoxicated Fosters scarcely noticing the flight of time .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 59]: They were now worth three hundred million dollars ; they were in every board of directors of every prodigious combine in the country ; and still as time drifted along , the millions went on piling up , five at a time , ten at a time , as fast as they could tally them off , almost .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 19]: The three hundred double itself -- then doubled again -- and yet again -- and yet once more .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 4]: Twenty-four hundred millions !
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 8]: The business was getting a little confused .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 15]: It was necessary to take an account of stock , and straighten it out .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 44]: The Fosters knew it , they felt it , they realized that it was imperative ; but they also knew that to do it properly and perfectly the task must be carried to a finish without a break when once it was begun .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 17]: A ten-hours ' job ; and where could THEY find ten leisure hours in a bunch ?
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 47]: Sally was selling pins and sugar and calico all day and every day ; Aleck was cooking and washing dishes and sweeping and making beds all day and every day , with none to help , for the daughters were being saved up for high society .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 17]: The Fosters knew there was one way to get the ten hours , and only one .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 16]: Both were ashamed to name it ; each waited for the other to do it .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 12]: Finally Sally said : `` Somebody 's got to give in .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 6]: It 's up to me .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 15]: Consider that I 've named it -- never mind pronouncing it out aloud . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 7]: Aleck colored , but was grateful .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 7]: Without further remark , they fell .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 8]: Fell , and -- broke the Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 9]: For that was their only free ten-hour stretch .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 10]: It was but another step in the downward path .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 4]: Others would follow .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 20]: Vast wealth has temptations which fatally and surely undermine the moral structure of persons not habituated to its possession .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 10]: They pulled down the shades and broke the Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 13]: With hard and patient labor they overhauled their holdings and listed them .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 10]: And a long-drawn procession of formidable names it was !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 43]: Starting with the Railway Systems , Steamer Lines , Standard Oil , Ocean Cables , Diluted Telegraph , and all the rest , and winding up with Klondike , De Beers , Tammany Graft , and Shady Privileges in the Post-office Department .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 16]: Twenty-four hundred millions , and all safely planted in Good Things , gilt-edged and interest-bearing .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 7]: Income , $ 120,000,000 a year .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 18]: Aleck fetched a long purr of soft delight , and said : `` Is it enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 7]: `` It is , Aleck . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 7]: `` What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 5]: `` Stand pat . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 6]: `` Retire from business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 6]: `` That 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 5]: `` I am agreed .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 18]: The good work is finished ; we will take a long rest and enjoy the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 3]: Aleck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 6]: `` Yes , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 11]: `` How much of the income can we spend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 7]: `` The whole of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 15]: It seemed to her husband that a ton of chains fell from his limbs .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 16]: He did not say a word ; he was happy beyond the power of speech .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 16]: After that , they broke the Sabbaths right along as fast as they turned up .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 9]: It is the first wrong step that counts .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 24]: Every Sunday they put in the whole day , after morning service , on inventions -- inventions of ways to spend the money .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 43]: They got to continuing this delicious dissipation until past midnight ; and at every seance Aleck lavished millions upon great charities and religious enterprises , and Sally lavished like sums upon matters to which -LRB- at first -RRB- he gave definite names .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 4]: Only at first .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 26]: Later the names gradually lost sharpness of outline , and eventually faded into `` sundries , '' thus becoming entirely -- but safely -- undescriptive .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 5]: For Sally was crumbling .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 19]: The placing of these millions added seriously and most uncomfortably to the family expenses -- in tallow candles .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 7]: For a while Aleck was worried .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 19]: Then , after a little , she ceased to worry , for the occasion of it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 23]: She was pained , she was grieved , she was ashamed ; but she said nothing , and so became an accessory .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: Sally was taking candles ; he was robbing the store .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 5]: It is ever thus .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 25]: Vast wealth , to the person unaccustomed to it , is a bane ; it eats into the flesh and bone of his morals .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 15]: When the Fosters were poor , they could have been trusted with untold candles .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 12]: But now they -- but let us not dwell upon it .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 28]: From candles to apples is but a step : Sally got to taking apples ; then soap ; then maple-sugar ; then canned goods ; then crockery .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 21]: How easy it is to go from bad to worse , when once we have started upon a downward course !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 17]: Meantime , other effects had been milestoning the course of the Fosters ' splendid financial march .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 39]: The fictitious brick dwelling had given place to an imaginary granite one with a checker-board mansard roof ; in time this one disappeared and gave place to a still grander home -- and so on and so on .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 111]: Mansion after mansion , made of air , rose , higher , broader , finer , and each in its turn vanished away ; until now in these latter great days , our dreamers were in fancy housed , in a distant region , in a sumptuous vast palace which looked out from a leafy summit upon a noble prospect of vale and river and receding hills steeped in tinted mists -- and all private , all the property of the dreamers ; a palace swarming with liveried servants , and populous with guests of fame and power , hailing from all the world 's capitals , foreign and domestic .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 37]: This palace was far , far away toward the rising sun , immeasurably remote , astronomically remote , in Newport , Rhode Island , Holy Land of High Society , ineffable Domain of the American Aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 38]: As a rule they spent a part of every Sabbath -- after morning service -- in this sumptuous home , the rest of it they spent in Europe , or in dawdling around in their private yacht .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 34]: Six days of sordid and plodding fact life at home on the ragged edge of Lakeside and straitened means , the seventh in Fairyland -- such had been their program and their habit .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 22]: In their sternly restricted fact life they remained as of old -- plodding , diligent , careful , practical , economical .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 31]: They stuck loyally to the little Presbyterian Church , and labored faithfully in its interests and stood by its high and tough doctrines with all their mental and spiritual energies .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 25]: But in their dream life they obeyed the invitations of their fancies , whatever they might be , and howsoever the fancies might change .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 20]: Aleck 's fancies were not very capricious , and not frequent , but Sally 's scattered a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 50]: Aleck , in her dream life , went over to the Episcopal camp , on account of its large official titles ; next she became High-church on account of the candles and shows ; and next she naturally changed to Rome , where there were cardinals and more candles .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 10]: But these excursions were a nothing to Sally 's .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 34]: His dream life was a glowing and continuous and persistent excitement , and he kept every part of it fresh and sparkling by frequent changes , the religious part along with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 13]: He worked his religions hard , and changed them with his shirt .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 27]: The liberal spendings of the Fosters upon their fancies began early in their prosperities , and grew in prodigality step by step with their advancing fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 7]: In time they became truly enormous .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 76]: Aleck built a university or two per Sunday ; also a hospital or two ; also a Rowton hotel or so ; also a batch of churches ; now and then a cathedral ; and once , with untimely and ill-chosen playfulness , Sally said , `` It was a cold day when she did n't ship a cargo of missionaries to persuade unreflecting Chinamen to trade off twenty-four carat Confucianism for counterfeit Christianity . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 19]: This rude and unfeeling language hurt Aleck to the heart , and she went from the presence crying .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 26]: That spectacle went to his own heart , and in his pain and shame he would have given worlds to have those unkind words back .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 13]: She had uttered no syllable of reproach -- and that cut him .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 27]: Not one suggestion that he look at his own record -- and she could have made , oh , so many , and such blistering ones !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 62]: Her generous silence brought a swift revenge , for it turned his thoughts upon himself , it summoned before him a spectral procession , a moving vision of his life as he had been leading it these past few years of limitless prosperity , and as he sat there reviewing it his cheeks burned and his soul was steeped in humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 39]: Look at her life -- how fair it was , and tending ever upward ; and look at his own -- how frivolous , how charged with mean vanities , how selfish , how empty , how ignoble !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 13]: And its trend -- never upward , but downward , ever downward !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 10]: He instituted comparisons between her record and his own .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 13]: He had found fault with her -- so he mused -- HE !
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 8]: And what could he say for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 11]: When she built her first church what was he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 38]: Gathering other blase multimillionaires into a Poker Club ; defiling his own palace with it ; losing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting , and sillily vain of the admiring notoriety it made for him .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 13]: When she was building her first university , what was he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 25]: Polluting himself with a gay and dissipated secret life in the company of other fast bloods , multimillionaires in money and paupers in character .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 14]: When she was building her first foundling asylum , what was he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 19]: When she was projecting her noble Society for the Purifying of the Sex , what was he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 6]: Ah , what , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 34]: When she and the W. C. T. U. and the Woman with the Hatchet , moving with resistless march , were sweeping the fatal bottle from the land , what was he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 7]: Getting drunk three times a day .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 36]: When she , builder of a hundred cathedrals , was being gratefully welcomed and blest in papal Rome and decorated with the Golden Rose which she had so honorably earned , what was he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 7]: Breaking the bank at Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 3]: He stopped .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 13]: He could go no farther ; he could not bear the rest .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 38]: He rose up , with a great resolution upon his lips : this secret life should be revealing , and confessed ; no longer would he live it clandestinely , he would go and tell her All .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 7]: And that is what he did .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 22]: He told her All ; and wept upon her bosom ; wept , and moaned , and begged for her forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 47]: It was a profound shock , and she staggered under the blow , but he was her own , the core of her heart , the blessing of her eyes , her all in all , she could deny him nothing , and she forgave him .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 56]: She felt that he could never again be quite to her what he had been before ; she knew that he could only repent , and not reform ; yet all morally defaced and decayed as he was , was he not her own , her very own , the idol of her deathless worship ?
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 21]: She said she was his serf , his slave , and she opened her yearning heart and took him in .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 32]: CHAPTER VII One Sunday afternoon some time after this they were sailing the summer seas in their dream yacht , and reclining in lazy luxury under the awning of the after-deck .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 13]: There was silence , for each was busy with his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 23]: These seasons of silence had insensibly been growing more and more frequent of late ; the old nearness and cordiality were waning .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 44]: Sally 's terrible revelation had done its work ; Aleck had tried hard to drive the memory of it out of her mind , but it would not go , and the shame and bitterness of it were poisoning her gracious dream life .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 19]: She could see now -LRB- on Sundays -RRB- that her husband was becoming a bloated and repulsive Thing .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 28]: She could not close her eyes to this , and in these days she no longer looked at him , Sundays , when she could help it .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 9]: But she -- was she herself without blemish ?
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 8]: Alas , she knew she was not .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 24]: She was keeping a secret from him , she was acting dishonorably toward him , and many a pang it was costing her .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 12]: SHE WAS BREAKING THE COMPACT , AND CONCEALING IT FROM HIM .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 58]: Under strong temptation she had gone into business again ; she had risked their whole fortune in a purchase of all the railway systems and coal and steel companies in the country on a margin , and she was now trembling , every Sabbath hour , lest through some chance word of hers he find it out .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 41]: In her misery and remorse for this treachery she could not keep her heart from going out to him in pity ; she was filled with compunctions to see him lying there , drunk and contented , and ever suspecting .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 34]: Never suspecting -- trusting her with a perfect and pathetic trust , and she holding over him by a thread a possible calamity of so devastating a -- `` SAY -- Aleck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 9]: The interrupting words brought her suddenly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 32]: She was grateful to have that persecuting subject from her thoughts , and she answered , with much of the old-time tenderness in her tone : `` Yes , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 21]: `` Do you know , Aleck , I think we are making a mistake -- that is , you are .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 8]: I mean about the marriage business . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 19]: He sat up , fat and froggy and benevolent , like a bronze Buddha , and grew earnest .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 10]: `` Consider -- it 's more than five years .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 22]: You 've continued the same policy from the start : with every rise , always holding on for five points higher .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 25]: Always when I think we are going to have some weddings , you see a bigger thing ahead , and I undergo another disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 11]: _ I _ think you are too hard to please .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 7]: Some day we 'll get left .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 11]: First , we turned down the dentist and the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 9]: That was all right -- it was sound .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 21]: Next , we turned down the banker 's son and the pork-butcher 's heir -- right again , and sound .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 23]: Next , we turned down the Congressman 's son and the Governor 's -- right as a trivet , I confess it .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 28]: Next the Senator 's son and the son of the Vice-President of the United States -- perfectly right , there 's no permanency about those little distinctions .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 19]: Then you went for the aristocracy ; and I thought we had struck oil at last -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 61]: We would make a plunge at the Four Hundred , and pull in some ancient lineage , venerable , holy , ineffable , mellow with the antiquity of a hundred and fifty years , disinfected of the ancestral odors of salt-cod and pelts all of a century ago , and unsmirched by a day 's work since , and then !
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 9]: why , then the marriages , of course .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: But no , along comes a pair a real aristocrats from Europe , and straightway you throw over the half-breeds .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 7]: It was awfully discouraging , Aleck !
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 7]: Since then , what a procession !
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 46]: You turned down the baronets for a pair of barons ; you turned down the barons for a pair of viscounts ; the viscounts for a pair of earls ; the earls for a pair of marquises ; the marquises for a brace of dukes .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 7]: NOW , Aleck , cash in !
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 7]: -- you 've played the limit .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 37]: You 've got a job lot of four dukes under the hammer ; of four nationalities ; all sound in the wind and limb and pedigree , all bankrupt and in debt up to the ears .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 10]: They come high , but we can afford it .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 30]: Come , Aleck , do n't delay any longer , do n't keep up the suspense : take the whole lay-out , and leave the girls to choose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 60]: Aleck had been smiling blandly and contentedly all through this arraignment of her marriage policy , a pleasant light , as of triumph with perhaps a nice surprise peeping out through it , rose in her eyes , and she said , as calmly as she could : `` Sally , what would you say to -- ROYALTY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 2]: Prodigious !
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 22]: Poor man , it knocked him silly , and he fell over the garboard-strake and barked his shin on the cat-heads .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 39]: He was dizzy for a moment , then he gathered himself up and limped over and sat down by his wife and beamed his old-time admiration and affection upon her in floods , out of his bleary eyes .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 20]: he said , fervently , `` Aleck , you ARE great -- the greatest woman in the whole earth !
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 11]: I ca n't ever learn the whole size of you .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 11]: I ca n't ever learn the immeasurable deeps of you .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 12]: Here I 've been considering myself qualified to criticize your game .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 3]: _ I !
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 23]: _ Why , if I had stopped to think , I 'd have known you had a lone hand up your sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 17]: Now , dear heart , I 'm all red-hot impatience -- tell me about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 17]: The flattered and happy woman put her lips to his ear and whispered a princely name .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 14]: It made him catch his breath , it lit his face with exultation .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 4]: `` Land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 10]: he said , `` it 's a stunning catch !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 23]: He 's got a gambling-hall , and a graveyard , and a bishop , and a cathedral -- all his very own .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 5]: And all gilt-edged five-hundred-per-cent .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 46]: stock , every detail of it ; the tidiest little property in Europe ; and that graveyard -- it 's the selectest in the world : none but suicides admitted ; YES , sir , and the free-list suspended , too , ALL the time .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 24]: There is n't much land in the principality , but there 's enough : eight hundred acres in the graveyard and forty-two outside .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 15]: It 's a SOVEREIGNTY -- that 's the main thing ; LAND 'S nothing .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 12]: There 's plenty land , Sahara 's drugged with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 8]: Aleck glowed ; she was profoundly happy .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 35]: She said : `` Think of it , Sally -- it is a family that has never married outside the Royal and Imperial Houses of Europe : our grandchildren will sit upon thrones ! ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 27]: `` True as you live , Aleck -- and bear scepters , too ; and handle them as naturally and nonchantly as I handle a yardstick .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 8]: It 's a grand catch , Aleck .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 7]: He 's corralled , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 5]: Ca n't get away ?
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 10]: You did n't take him on a margin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 5]: Trust me for that .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 11]: He 's not a liability , he 's an asset .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 7]: So is the other one . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 8]: `` Who is it , Aleck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 14]: `` His Royal Highness Sigismund-Siegfriend-Lauenfeld-Dinkelspiel-Schwartzenberg Blutwurst , Hereditary Grant Duke of Katzenyammer . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 7]: You ca n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 21]: `` It 's as true as I 'm sitting here , I give you my word , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 28]: His cup was full , and he hugged her to his heart with rapture , saying : `` How wonderful it all seems , and how beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 38]: It 's one of the oldest and noblest of the three hundred and sixty-four ancient German principalities , and one of the few that was allowed to retain its royal estate when Bismarck got done trimming them .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 10]: I know that farm , I 've been there .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 12]: It 's got a rope-walk and a candle-factory and an army .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 3]: Standing army .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 4]: Infantry and cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 6]: Three soldier and a horse .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 25]: Aleck , it 's been a long wait , and full of heartbreak and hope deferred , but God knows I am happy now .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: Happy , and grateful to you , my own , who have done it all .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 7]: When is it to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 5]: `` Next Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 18]: And we 'll want to do these weddings up in the very regalest style that 's going .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 16]: It 's properly due to the royal quality of the parties of the first part .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 29]: Now as I understand it , there is only one kind of marriage that is sacred to royalty , exclusive to royalty : it 's the morganatic . ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 12]: `` What do they call it that for , Sally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 17]: `` I do n't know ; but anyway it 's royal , and royal only . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 8]: `` Then we will insist upon it .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 7]: More -- I will compel it .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 8]: It is morganatic marriage or none . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 6]: `` That settles it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 9]: said Sally , rubbing his hands with delight .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 11]: `` And it will be the very first in America .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 9]: Aleck , it will make Newport sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 35]: Then they fell silent , and drifted away upon their dream wings to the far regions of the earth to invite all the crowned heads and their families and provide gratis transportation to them .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 18]: CHAPTER VIII During three days the couple walked upon air , with their heads in the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 88]: They were but vaguely conscious of their surroundings ; they saw all things dimly , as through a veil ; they were steeped in dreams , often they did not hear when they were spoken to ; they often did not understand when they heard ; they answered confusedly or at random ; Sally sold molasses by weight , sugar by the yard , and furnished soap when asked for candles , and Aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk to the soiled linen .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 22]: Everybody was stunned and amazed , and went about muttering , `` What CAN be the matter with the Fosters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 3]: Three days .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 4]: Then came events !
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 19]: Things had taken a happy turn , and for forty-eight hours Aleck 's imaginary corner had been booming .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 7]: Up -- up -- still up !
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 5]: Cost point was passed .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 9]: Still up -- and up -- and up !
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 5]: Cost point was passed .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 9]: STill up -- and up -- and up !
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 12]: Five points above cost -- then ten -- fifteen -- twenty !
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 26]: Twenty points cold profit on the vast venture , now , and Aleck 's imaginary brokers were shouting frantically by imaginary long-distance , `` Sell !
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 2]: sell !
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 7]: for Heaven 's sake SELL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 18]: She broke the splendid news to Sally , and he , too , said , `` Sell !
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 17]: sell -- oh , do n't make a blunder , now , you own the earth !
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 6]: -- sell , sell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 27]: But she set her iron will and lashed it amidships , and said she would hold on for five points more if she died for it .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 6]: It was a fatal resolve .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 52]: The very next day came the historic crash , the record crash , the devastating crash , when the bottom fell out of Wall Street , and the whole body of gilt-edged stocks dropped ninety-five points in five hours , and the multimillionaire was seen begging his bread in the Bowery .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 38]: Aleck sternly held her grip and `` put up '' as long as she could , but at last there came a call which she was powerless to meet , and her imaginary brokers sold her out .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 22]: Then , and not till then , the man in her was vanished , and the woman in her resumed sway .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 31]: She put her arms about her husband 's neck and wept , saying : `` I am to blame , do not forgive me , I can not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 4]: We are paupers !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 8]: Paupers , and I am so miserable .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 23]: The weddings will never come off ; all that is past ; we could not even buy the dentist , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 42]: A bitter reproach was on Sally 's tongue : `` I BEGGED you to sell , but you -- '' He did not say it ; he had not the heart to add a hurt to that broken and repentant spirit .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 22]: A nobler thought came to him and he said : `` Bear up , my Aleck , all is not lost !
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 38]: You really never invested a penny of my uncle 's bequest , but only its unmaterialized future ; what we have lost was only the incremented harvest from that future by your incomparable financial judgment and sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 39]: Cheer up , banish these griefs ; we still have the thirty thousand untouched ; and with the experience which you have acquired , think what you will be able to do with it in a couple years !
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 12]: The marriages are not off , they are only postponed . ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 5]: These are blessed words .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 30]: Aleck saw how true they were , and their influence was electric ; her tears ceased to flow , and her great spirit rose to its full stature again .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 35]: With flashing eye and grateful heart , and with hand uplifted in pledge and prophecy , she said : `` Now and here I proclaim -- '' But she was interrupted by a visitor .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 10]: It was the editor and proprietor of the SAGAMORE .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 62]: He had happened into Lakeside to pay a duty-call upon an obscure grandmother of his who was nearing the end of her pilgrimage , and with the idea of combining business with grief he had looked up the Fosters , who had been so absorbed in other things for the past four years that they neglected to pay up their subscription .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 4]: Six dollars due .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 8]: No visitor could have been more welcome .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 19]: He would know all about Uncle Tilbury and what his chances might be getting to be , cemeterywards .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 33]: They could , of course , ask no questions , for that would squelch the bequest , but they could nibble around on the edge of the subject and hope for results .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 6]: The scheme did not work .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 24]: The obtuse editor did not know he was being nibbled at ; but at last , chance accomplished what art had failed in .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 28]: In illustration of something under discussion which required the help of metaphor , the editor said : `` Land , it 's a tough as Tilbury Foster !
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 6]: -- as WE say . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 11]: It was sudden , and it made the Fosters jump .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 18]: The editor noticed , and said , apologetically : `` No harm intended , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 17]: It 's just a saying ; just a joke , you know -- nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 5]: Relation of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 36]: Sally crowded his burning eagerness down , and answered with all the indifference he could assume : `` I -- well , not that I know of , but we 've heard of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 10]: The editor was thankful , and resumed his composure .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 13]: Sally added : `` Is he -- is he -- well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 5]: `` Is he WELL ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 13]: Why , bless you he 's in Sheol these five years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 13]: The Fosters were trembling with grief , though it felt like joy .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 30]: Sally said , non-committally -- and tentatively : `` Ah , well , such is life , and none can escape -- not even the rich are spared . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 4]: The editor laughed .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 17]: `` If you are including Tilbury , '' said he , `` it do n't apply .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 14]: HE had n't a cent ; the town had to bury him . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 12]: The Fosters sat petrified for two minutes ; petrified and cold .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 14]: Then , white-faced and weak-voiced , Sally asked : `` Is it true ?
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 9]: Do you KNOW it to be true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 7]: `` Well , I should say !
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 7]: I was one of the executors .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 17]: He had n't anything to leave but a wheelbarrow , and he left that to me .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 12]: It had n't any wheel , and was n't any good .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 33]: Still , it was something , and so , to square up , I scribbled off a sort of a little obituarial send-off for him , but it got crowded out . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 17]: The Fosters were not listening -- their cup was full , it could contain no more .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 17]: They sat with bowed heads , dead to all things but the ache at their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 4]: An hour later .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 20]: Still they sat there , bowed , motionless , silent , the visitor long ago gone , they unaware .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 36]: Then they stirred , and lifted their heads wearily , and gazed at each other wistfully , dreamily , dazed ; then presently began to twaddle to each other in a wandering and childish way .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: At intervals they lapsed into silences , leaving a sentence unfinished , seemingly either unaware of it or losing their way .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 94]: Sometimes , when they woke out of these silences they had a dim and transient consciousness that something had happened to their minds ; then with a dumb and yearning solicitude they would softly caress each other 's hands in mutual compassion and support , as if they would say : `` I am near you , I will not forsake you , we will bear it together ; somewhere there is release and forgetfulness , somewhere there is a grave and peace ; be patient , it will not be long . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 34]: They lived yet two years , in mental night , always brooding , steeped in vague regrets and melancholy dreams , never speaking ; then release came to both on the same day .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 34]: Toward the end the darkness lifted from Sally 's ruined mind for a moment , and he said : `` Vast wealth , acquired by sudden and unwholesome means , is a snare .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 35]: It did us no good , transient were its feverish pleasures ; yet for its sake we threw away our sweet and simple and happy life -- let others take warning by us . ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 54]: He lay silent awhile , with closed eyes ; then as the chill of death crept upward toward his heart , and consciousness was fading from his brain , he muttered : `` Money had brought him misery , and he took his revenge upon us , who had done him no harm .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 34]: He had his desire : with base and cunning calculation he left us but thirty thousand , knowing we would try to increase it , and ruin our life and break our hearts .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 69]: Without added expense he could have left us far above desire of increase , far above the temptation to speculate , and a kinder soul would have done it ; but in him was no generous spirit , no pity , no -- '' A DOG 'S TALE CHAPTER I My father was a St. Bernard , my mother was a collie , but I am a Presbyterian .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 17]: This is what my mother told me , I do not know these nice distinctions myself .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 11]: To me they are only fine large words meaning nothing .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 32]: My mother had a fondness for such ; she liked to say them , and see other dogs look surprised and envious , as wondering how she got so much education .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 103]: But , indeed , it was not real education ; it was only show : she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room when there was company , and by going with the children to Sunday-school and listening there ; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over to herself many times , and so was able to keep it until there was a dogmatic gathering in the neighborhood , then she would get it off , and surprise and distress them all , from pocket-pup to mastiff , which rewarded her for all her trouble .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 28]: If there was a stranger he was nearly sure to be suspicious , and when he got his breath again he would ask her what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 6]: And she always told him .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 37]: He was never expecting this but thought he would catch her ; so when she told him , he was the one that looked ashamed , whereas he had thought it was going to be she .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 32]: The others were always waiting for this , and glad of it and proud of her , for they knew what was going to happen , because they had had experience .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 74]: When she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right one ; and that was natural , because , for one thing , she answered up so promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking , and for another thing , where could they find out whether it was right or not ?
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 10]: for she was the only cultivated dog there was .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 91]: By and by , when I was older , she brought home the word Unintellectual , one time , and worked it pretty hard all the week at different gatherings , making much unhappiness and despondency ; and it was at this time that I noticed that during that week she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages , and flashed out a fresh definition every time , which showed me that she had more presence of mind than culture , though I said nothing , of course .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 45]: She had one word which she always kept on hand , and ready , like a life-preserver , a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed overboard in a sudden way -- that was the word Synonymous .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 194]: When she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and its prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile , if there was a stranger there of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes , then he would come to , and by that time she would be away down wind on another tack , and not expecting anything ; so when he 'd hail and ask her to cash in , I -LRB- the only dog on the inside of her game -RRB- could see her canvas flicker a moment -- but only just a moment -- then it would belly out taut and full , and she would say , as calm as a summer 's day , `` It 's synonymous with supererogation , '' or some godless long reptile of a word like that , and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack , perfectly comfortable , you know , and leave that stranger looking profane and embarrassed , and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 8]: And it was the same with phrases .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 70]: She would drag home a whole phrase , if it had a grand sound , and play it six nights and two matinees , and explain it a new way every time -- which she had to , for all she cared for was the phrase ; she was n't interested in what it meant , and knew those dogs had n't wit enough to catch her , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 7]: Yes , she was a daisy !
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 21]: She got so she was n't afraid of anything , she had such confidence in the ignorance of those creatures .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 99]: She even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over ; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut , where , of course , it did n't fit and had n't any point ; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way , while I could see that she was wondering to herself why it did n't seem as funny as it did when she first heard it .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 41]: But no harm was done ; the others rolled and barked too , privately ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point , and never suspecting that the fault was not with them and there was n't any to see .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 32]: You can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous character ; still , she had virtues , and enough to make up , I think .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 90]: She had a kind heart and gentle ways , and never harbored resentments for injuries done her , but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them ; and she taught her children her kindly way , and from her we learned also to be brave and prompt in time of danger , and not to run away , but face the peril that threatened friend or stranger , and help him the best we could without stopping to think what the cost might be to us .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 27]: And she taught us not by words only , but by example , and that is the best way and the surest and the most lasting .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 12]: Why , the brave things she did , the splendid things !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 43]: she was just a soldier ; and so modest about it -- well , you could n't help admiring her , and you could n't help imitating her ; not even a King Charles spaniel could remain entirely despicable in her society .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 15]: So , as you see , there was more to her than her education .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 25]: CHAPTER II When I was well grown , at last , I was sold and taken away , and I never saw her again .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 77]: She was broken-hearted , and so was I , and we cried ; but she comforted me as well as she could , and said we were sent into this world for a wise and good purpose , and must do our duties without repining , take our life as we might find it , live it for the best good of others , and never mind about the results ; they were not our affair .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 55]: She said men who did like this would have a noble and beautiful reward by and by in another world , and although we animals would not go there , to do well and right without reward would give to our brief lives a worthiness and dignity which in itself would be a reward .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 54]: She had gathered these things from time to time when she had gone to the Sunday-school with the children , and had laid them up in her memory more carefully than she had done with those other words and phrases ; and she had studied them deeply , for her good and ours .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 26]: One may see by this that she had a wise and thoughtful head , for all there was so much lightness and vanity in it .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 76]: So we said our farewells , and looked our last upon each other through our tears ; and the last thing she said -- keeping it for the last to make me remember it the better , I think -- was , `` In memory of me , when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself , think of your mother , and do as she would do . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 8]: Do you think I could forget that ?
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 9]: CHAPTER III It was such a charming home !
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 65]: -- my new one ; a fine great house , with pictures , and delicate decorations , and rich furniture , and no gloom anywhere , but all the wilderness of dainty colors lit up with flooding sunshine ; and the spacious grounds around it , and the great garden -- oh , greensward , and noble trees , and flowers , no end !
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 53]: And I was the same as a member of the family ; and they loved me , and petted me , and did not give me a new name , but called me by my old one that was dear to me because my mother had given it me -- Aileen Mavoureen .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 23]: She got it out of a song ; and the Grays knew that song , and said it was a beautiful name .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 141]: Mrs. Gray was thirty , and so sweet and so lovely , you can not imagine it ; and Sadie was ten , and just like her mother , just a darling slender little copy of her , with auburn tails down her back , and short frocks ; and the baby was a year old , and plump and dimpled , and fond of me , and never could get enough of hauling on my tail , and hugging me , and laughing out its innocent happiness ; and Mr. Gray was thirty-eight , and tall and slender and handsome , a little bald in front , alert , quick in his movements , business-like , prompt , decided , unsentimental , and with that kind of trim-chiseled face that just seems to glint and sparkle with frosty intellectuality !
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 6]: He was a renowned scientist .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 22]: I do not know what the word means , but my mother would know how to use it and get effects .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 19]: She would know how to depress a rat-terrier with it and make a lap-dog look sorry he came .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: But that is not the best one ; the best one was Laboratory .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 19]: My mother could organize a Trust on that one that would skin the tax-collars off the whole herd .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 166]: The laboratory was not a book , or a picture , or a place to wash your hands in , as the college president 's dog said -- no , that is the lavatory ; the laboratory is quite different , and is filled with jars , and bottles , and electrics , and wires , and strange machines ; and every week other scientists came there and sat in the place , and used the machines , and discussed , and made what they called experiments and discoveries ; and often I came , too , and stood around and listened , and tried to learn , for the sake of my mother , and in loving memory of her , although it was a pain to me , as realizing what she was losing out of her life and I gaining nothing at all ; for try as I might , I was never able to make anything out of it at all .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 173]: Other times I lay on the floor in the mistress 's work-room and slept , she gently using me for a foot-stool , knowing it pleased me , for it was a caress ; other times I spent an hour in the nursery , and got well tousled and made happy ; other times I watched by the crib there , when the baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby 's affairs ; other times I romped and raced through the grounds and the garden with Sadie till we were tired out , then slumbered on the grass in the shade of a tree while she read her book ; other times I went visiting among the neighbor dogs -- for there were some most pleasant ones not far away , and one very handsome and courteous and graceful one , a curly-haired Irish setter by the name of Robin Adair , who was a Presbyterian like me , and belonged to the Scotch minister .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 29]: The servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me , and so , as you see , mine was a pleasant life .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 16]: There could not be a happier dog that I was , nor a gratefuler one .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 50]: I will say this for myself , for it is only the truth : I tried in all ways to do well and right , and honor my mother 's memory and her teachings , and earn the happiness that had come to me , as best I could .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 20]: By and by came my little puppy , and then my cup was full , my happiness was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 68]: It was the dearest little waddling thing , and so smooth and soft and velvety , and had such cunning little awkward paws , and such affectionate eyes , and such a sweet and innocent face ; and it made me so proud to see how the children and their mother adored it , and fondled it , and exclaimed over every little wonderful thing it did .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 18]: It did seem to me that life was just too lovely to -- Then came the winter .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 11]: One day I was standing a watch in the nursery .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 12]: That is to say , I was asleep on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 21]: The baby was asleep in the crib , which was alongside the bed , on the side next the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 23]: It was the kind of crib that has a lofty tent over it made of gauzy stuff that you can see through .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 12]: The nurse was out , and we two sleepers were alone .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: A spark from the wood-fire was shot out , and it lit on the slope of the tent .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 27]: I suppose a quiet interval followed , then a scream from the baby awoke me , and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling !
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 135]: Before I could think , I sprang to the floor in my fright , and in a second was half-way to the door ; but in the next half-second my mother 's farewell was sounding in my ears , and I was back on the bed again. , I reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the waist-band , and tugged it along , and we fell to the floor together in a cloud of smoke ; I snatched a new hold , and dragged the screaming little creature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall , and was still tugging away , all excited and happy and proud , when the master 's voice shouted : `` Begone you cursed beast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 90]: and I jumped to save myself ; but he was furiously quick , and chased me up , striking furiously at me with his cane , I dodging this way and that , in terror , and at last a strong blow fell upon my left foreleg , which made me shriek and fall , for the moment , helpless ; the cane went up for another blow , but never descended , for the nurse 's voice rang wildly out , `` The nursery 's on fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 16]: and the master rushed away in that direction , and my other bones were saved .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 72]: The pain was cruel , but , no matter , I must not lose any time ; he might come back at any moment ; so I limped on three legs to the other end of the hall , where there was a dark little stairway leading up into a garret where old boxes and such things were kept , as I had heard say , and where people seldom went .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 31]: I managed to climb up there , then I searched my way through the dark among the piles of things , and hid in the secretest place I could find .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 44]: It was foolish to be afraid there , yet still I was ; so afraid that I held in and hardly even whimpered , though it would have been such a comfort to whimper , because that eases the pain , you know .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 13]: But I could lick my leg , and that did some good .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 24]: For half an hour there was a commotion downstairs , and shoutings , and rushing footsteps , and then there was quiet again .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 34]: Quiet for some minutes , and that was grateful to my spirit , for then my fears began to go down ; and fears are worse than pains -- oh , much worse .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 8]: Then came a sound that froze me .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 14]: They were calling me -- calling me by name -- hunting for me !
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 32]: It was muffled by distance , but that could not take the terror out of it , and it was the most dreadful sound to me that I had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 60]: It went all about , everywhere , down there : along the halls , through all the rooms , in both stories , and in the basement and the cellar ; then outside , and farther and farther away -- then back , and all about the house again , and I thought it would never , never stop .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 26]: But at last it did , hours and hours after the vague twilight of the garret had long ago been blotted out by black darkness .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 21]: Then in that blessed stillness my terrors fell little by little away , and I was at peace and slept .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 18]: It was a good rest I had , but I woke before the twilight had come again .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 15]: I was feeling fairly comfortable , and I could think out a plan now .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 85]: I made a very good one ; which was , to creep down , all the way down the back stairs , and hide behind the cellar door , and slip out and escape when the iceman came at dawn , while he was inside filling the refrigerator ; then I would hide all day , and start on my journey when night came ; my journey to -- well , anywhere where they would not know me and betray me to the master .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 22]: I was feeling almost cheerful now ; then suddenly I thought : Why , what would life be without my puppy !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 4]: That was despair .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 47]: There was no plan for me ; I saw that ; I must say where I was ; stay , and wait , and take what might come -- it was not my affair ; that was what life is -- my mother had said it .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 10]: Then -- well , then the calling began again !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 6]: All my sorrows came back .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 11]: I said to myself , the master will never forgive .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 39]: I did not know what I had done to make him so bitter and so unforgiving , yet I judged it was something a dog could not understand , but which was clear to a man and dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 14]: They called and called -- days and nights , it seemed to me .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 22]: So long that the hunger and thirst near drove me mad , and I recognized that I was getting very weak .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 15]: When you are this way you sleep a great deal , and I did .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 22]: Once I woke in an awful fright -- it seemed to me that the calling was right there in the garret !
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 115]: And so it was : it was Sadie 's voice , and she was crying ; my name was falling from her lips all broken , poor thing , and I could not believe my ears for the joy of it when I heard her say : `` Come back to us -- oh , come back to us , and forgive -- it is all so sad without our -- '' I broke in with SUCH a grateful little yelp , and the next moment Sadie was plunging and stumbling through the darkness and the lumber and shouting for the family to hear , `` She 's found , she 's found ! ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 11]: The days that followed -- well , they were wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 17]: The mother and Sadie and the servants -- why , they just seemed to worship me .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 65]: They could n't seem to make me a bed that was fine enough ; and as for food , they could n't be satisfied with anything but game and delicacies that were out of season ; and every day the friends and neighbors flocked in to hear about my heroism -- that was the name they called it by , and it means agriculture .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 153]: I remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once , and explaining it in that way , but did n't say what agriculture was , except that it was synonymous with intramural incandescence ; and a dozen times a day Mrs. Gray and Sadie would tell the tale to new-comers , and say I risked my life to say the baby 's , and both of us had burns to prove it , and then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about me , and you could see the pride in the eyes of Sadie and her mother ; and when the people wanted to know what made me limp , they looked ashamed and changed the subject , and sometimes when people hunted them this way and that way with questions about it , it looked to me as if they were going to cry .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 148]: And this was not all the glory ; no , the master 's friends came , a whole twenty of the most distinguished people , and had me in the laboratory , and discussed me as if I was a kind of discovery ; and some of them said it was wonderful in a dumb beast , the finest exhibition of instinct they could call to mind ; but the master said , with vehemence , `` It 's far above instinct ; it 's REASON , and many a man , privileged to be saved and go with you and me to a better world by right of its possession , has less of it that this poor silly quadruped that 's foreordained to perish '' ; and then he laughed , and said : `` Why , look at me -- I 'm a sarcasm !
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 43]: bless you , with all my grand intelligence , the only think I inferred was that the dog had gone mad and was destroying the child , whereas but for the beast 's intelligence -- it 's REASON , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 8]: -- the child would have perished ! ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 42]: They disputed and disputed , and _ I _ was the very center of subject of it all , and I wished my mother could know that this grand honor had come to me ; it would have made her proud .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 167]: Then they discussed optics , as they called it , and whether a certain injury to the brain would produce blindness or not , but they could not agree about it , and said they must test it by experiment by and by ; and next they discussed plants , and that interested me , because in the summer Sadie and I had planted seeds -- I helped her dig the holes , you know -- and after days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there , and it was a wonder how that could happen ; but it did , and I wished I could talk -- I would have told those people about it and shown then how much I knew , and been all alive with the subject ; but I did n't care for the optics ; it was dull , and when they came back to it again it bored me , and I went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 83]: Pretty soon it was spring , and sunny and pleasant and lovely , and the sweet mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-by , and went away on a journey and a visit to their kin , and the master was n't any company for us , but we played together and had good times , and the servants were kind and friendly , so we got along quite happily and counted the days and waited for the family .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 52]: And one day those men came again , and said , now for the test , and they took the puppy to the laboratory , and I limped three-leggedly along , too , feeling proud , for any attention shown to the puppy was a pleasure to me , of course .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 51]: They discussed and experimented , and then suddenly the puppy shrieked , and they set him on the floor , and he went staggering around , with his head all bloody , and the master clapped his hands and shouted : `` There , I 've won -- confess it !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 9]: He 's a blind as a bat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 46]: And they all said : `` It 's so -- you 've proved your theory , and suffering humanity owes you a great debt from henceforth , '' and they crowded around him , and wrung his hand cordially and thankfully , and praised him .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 75]: But I hardly saw or heard these things , for I ran at once to my little darling , and snuggled close to it where it lay , and licked the blood , and it put its head against mine , whimpering softly , and I knew in my heart it was a comfort to it in its pain and trouble to feel its mother 's touch , though it could not see me .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 29]: Then it dropped down , presently , and its little velvet nose rested upon the floor , and it was still , and did not move any more .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 66]: Soon the master stopped discussing a moment , and rang in the footman , and said , `` Bury it in the far corner of the garden , '' and then went on with the discussion , and I trotted after the footman , very happy and grateful , for I knew the puppy was out of its pain now , because it was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 124]: We went far down the garden to the farthest end , where the children and the nurse and the puppy and I used to play in the summer in the shade of a great elm , and there the footman dug a hole , and I saw he was going to plant the puppy , and I was glad , because it would grow and come up a fine handsome dog , like Robin Adair , and be a beautiful surprise for the family when they came home ; so I tried to help him dig , but my lame leg was no good , being stiff , you know , and you have to have two , or it is no use .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 39]: When the footman had finished and covered little Robin up , he patted my head , and there were tears in his eyes , and he said : `` Poor little doggie , you saved HIS child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 14]: I have watched two whole weeks , and he does n't come up !
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 11]: This last week a fright has been stealing upon me .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: I think there is something terrible about this .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 69]: I do not know what it is , but the fear makes me sick , and I can not eat , though the servants bring me the best of food ; and they pet me so , and even come in the night , and cry , and say , `` Poor doggie -- do give it up and come home ; DO N'T break our hearts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 16]: and all this terrifies me the more , and makes me sure something has happened .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 17]: And I am so weak ; since yesterday I can not stand on my feet anymore .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 41]: And within this hour the servants , looking toward the sun where it was sinking out of sight and the night chill coming on , said things I could not understand , but they carried something cold to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 5]: `` Those poor creatures !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 5]: They do not suspect .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 52]: They will come home in the morning , and eagerly ask for the little doggie that did the brave deed , and who of us will be strong enough to say the truth to them : ` The humble little friend is gone where go the beasts that perish . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 4]: WAS IT HEAVEN ?
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 3]: OR HELL ?
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 9]: CHAPTER I `` You told a LIE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 16]: `` You confess it -- you actually confess it -- you told a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 43]: CHAPTER II The family consisted of four persons : Margaret Lester , widow , aged thirty six ; Helen Lester , her daughter , aged sixteen ; Mrs. Lester 's maiden aunts , Hannah and Hester Gray , twins , aged sixty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 90]: Waking and sleeping , the three women spent their days and night in adoring the young girl ; in watching the movements of her sweet spirit in the mirror of her face ; in refreshing their souls with the vision of her bloom and beauty ; in listening to the music of her voice ; in gratefully recognizing how rich and fair for them was the world with this presence in it ; in shuddering to think how desolate it would be with this light gone out of it .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 45]: By nature -- and inside -- the aged aunts were utterly dear and lovable and good , but in the matter of morals and conduct their training had been so uncompromisingly strict that it had made them exteriorly austere , not to say stern .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 31]: Their influence was effective in the house ; so effective that the mother and the daughter conformed to its moral and religious requirements cheerfully , contentedly , happily , unquestionably .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 10]: To do this was become second nature to them .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 20]: And so in this peaceful heaven there were no clashings , no irritations , no fault-finding , no heart-burnings .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 8]: In it a lie had no place .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 7]: In it a lie was unthinkable .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 26]: In it speech was restricted to absolute truth , iron-bound truth , implacable and uncompromising truth , let the resulting consequences be what they might .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 32]: At last , one day , under stress of circumstances , the darling of the house sullied her lips with a lie -- and confessed it , with tears and self-upbraidings .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 14]: There are not any words that can paint the consternation of the aunts .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 22]: It was as if the sky had crumpled up and collapsed and the earth had tumbled to ruin with a crash .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 77]: They sat side by side , white and stern , gazing speechless upon the culprit , who was on her knees before them with her face buried first in one lap and then the other , moaning and sobbing , and appealing for sympathy and forgiveness and getting no response , humbly kissing the hand of the one , then of the other , only to see it withdrawn as suffering defilement by those soiled lips .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 20]: Twice , at intervals , Aunt Hester said , in frozen amazement : `` You told a LIE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 31]: Twice , at intervals , Aunt Hannah followed with the muttered and amazed ejaculation : `` You confess it -- you actually confess it -- you told a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 7]: It was all they could say .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 32]: The situation was new , unheard of , incredible ; they could not understand it , they did not know how to take hold of it , it approximately paralyzed speech .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 29]: At length it was decided that the erring child must be taken to her mother , who was ill , and who ought to know what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 63]: Helen begged , besought , implored that she might be spared this further disgrace , and that her mother might be spared the grief and pain of it ; but this could not be : duty required this sacrifice , duty takes precedence of all things , nothing can absolve one from a duty , with a duty no compromise is possible .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 31]: Helen still begged , and said the sin was her own , her mother had had no hand in it -- why must she be made to suffer for it ?
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 66]: But the aunts were obdurate in their righteousness , and said the law that visited the sins of the parent upon the child was by all right and reason reversible ; and therefore it was but just that the innocent mother of a sinning child should suffer her rightful share of the grief and pain and shame which were the allotted wages of the sin .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 7]: The three moved toward the sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 10]: At this time the doctor was approaching the house .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 10]: He was still a good distance away , however .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 56]: He was a good doctor and a good man , and he had a good heart , but one had to know him a year to get over hating him , two years to learn to endure him , three to learn to like him , and four and five to learn to love him .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 12]: It was a slow and trying education , but it paid .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 40]: He was of great stature ; he had a leonine head , a leonine face , a rough voice , and an eye which was sometimes a pirate 's and sometimes a woman 's , according to the mood .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 28]: He knew nothing about etiquette , and cared nothing about it ; in speech , manner , carriage , and conduct he was the reverse of conventional .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 40]: He was frank , to the limit ; he had opinions on all subjects ; they were always on tap and ready for delivery , and he cared not a farthing whether his listener liked them or did n't .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 25]: Whom he loved he loved , and manifested it ; whom he did n't love he hated , and published it from the housetops .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 22]: In his young days he had been a sailor , and the salt-airs of all the seas blew from him yet .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 44]: He was a sturdy and loyal Christian , and believed he was the best one in the land , and the only one whose Christianity was perfectly sound , healthy , full-charged with common sense , and had no decayed places in it .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 73]: People who had an ax to grind , or people who for any reason wanted wanted to get on the soft side of him , called him The Christian -- a phrase whose delicate flattery was music to his ears , and whose capital T was such an enchanting and vivid object to him that he could SEE it when it fell out of a person 's mouth even in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 67]: Many who were fond of him stood on their consciences with both feet and brazenly called him by that large title habitually , because it was a pleasure to them to do anything that would please him ; and with eager and cordial malice his extensive and diligently cultivated crop of enemies gilded it , beflowered it , expanded it to `` The ONLY Christian . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 25]: Of these two titles , the latter had the wider currency ; the enemy , being greatly in the majority , attended to that .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 44]: Whatever the doctor believed , he believed with all his heart , and would fight for it whenever he got the chance ; and if the intervals between chances grew to be irksomely wide , he would invent ways of shortening them himself .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 39]: He was severely conscientious , according to his rather independent lights , and whatever he took to be a duty he performed , no matter whether the judgment of the professional moralists agreed with his own or not .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 51]: At sea , in his young days , he had used profanity freely , but as soon as he was converted he made a rule , which he rigidly stuck to ever afterward , never to use it except on the rarest occasions , and then only when duty commanded .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 75]: He had been a hard drinker at sea , but after his conversion he became a firm and outspoken teetotaler , in order to be an example to the young , and from that time forth he seldom drank ; never , indeed , except when it seemed to him to be a duty -- a condition which sometimes occurred a couple of times a year , but never as many as five times .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 12]: Necessarily , such a man is impressionable , impulsive , emotional .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 26]: This one was , and had no gift at hiding his feelings ; or if he had it he took no trouble to exercise it .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 33]: He carried his soul 's prevailing weather in his face , and when he entered a room the parasols or the umbrellas went up -- figuratively speaking -- according to the indications .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 30]: When the soft light was in his eye it meant approval , and delivered a benediction ; when he came with a frown he lowered the temperature ten degrees .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 18]: He was a well-beloved man in the house of his friends , but sometimes a dreaded one .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 19]: He had a deep affection for the Lester household and its several members returned this feeling with interest .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 27]: They mourned over his kind of Christianity , and he frankly scoffed at theirs ; but both parties went on loving each other just the same .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 22]: He was approaching the house -- out of the distance ; the aunts and the culprit were moving toward the sick-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 20]: CHAPTER III The three last named stood by the bed ; the aunts austere , the transgressor softly sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 38]: The mother turned her head on the pillow ; her tired eyes flamed up instantly with sympathy and passionate mother-love when they fell upon her child , and she opened the refuge and shelter of her arms .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 18]: said Aunt Hannah , and put out her hand and stayed the girl from leaping into them .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 17]: `` Helen , '' said the other aunt , impressively , `` tell your mother all .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 9]: Purge your soul ; leave nothing unconfessed . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 39]: Standing stricken and forlorn before her judges , the young girl mourned her sorrowful tale through the end , then in a passion of appeal cried out : `` Oh , mother , ca n't you forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: wo n't you forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 7]: -- I am so desolate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 7]: `` Forgive you , my darling ?
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 7]: Oh , come to my arms !
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 15]: -- there , lay your head upon my breast , and be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 23]: If you had told a thousand lies -- '' There was a sound -- a warning -- the clearing of a throat .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 21]: The aunts glanced up , and withered in their clothes -- there stood the doctor , his face a thunder-cloud .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 29]: Mother and child knew nothing of his presence ; they lay locked together , heart to heart , steeped in immeasurable content , dead to all things else .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 37]: The physician stood many moments glaring and glooming upon the scene before him ; studying it , analyzing it , searching out its genesis ; then he put up his hand and beckoned to the aunts .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 14]: They came trembling to him , and stood humbly before him and waited .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 21]: He bent down and whispered : `` Did n't I tell you this patient must be protected from all excitement ?
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 8]: What the hell have you been doing ?
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 7]: Clear out of the place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 3]: They obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 51]: Half an hour later he appeared in the parlor , serene , cheery , clothed in sunshine , conducting Helen , with his arm about her waist , petting her , and saying gentle and playful things to her ; and she also was her sunny and happy self again .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 14]: `` Now , then ; '' he said , `` good-by , dear .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 16]: Go to your room , and keep away from your mother , and behave yourself .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 8]: But wait -- put out your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 15]: There , that will do -- you 're as sound as a nut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 21]: He patted her cheek and added , `` Run along now ; I want to talk to these aunts . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 6]: She went from the presence .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 32]: His face clouded over again at once ; and as he sat down he said : `` You too have been doing a lot of damage -- and maybe some good .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 10]: Some good , yes -- such as it is .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 7]: That woman 's disease is typhoid !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 26]: You 've brought it to a show-up , I think , with your insanities , and that 's a service -- such as it is .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 13]: I had n't been able to determine what it was before . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 15]: With one impulse the old ladies sprang to their feet , quaking with terror .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 4]: `` Sit down !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 8]: What are you proposing to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 3]: `` Do ?
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: We must fly to her .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 21]: We -- '' `` You 'll do nothing of the kind ; you 've done enough harm for one day .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 17]: Do you want to squander all your capital of crimes and follies on a single deal ?
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 7]: Sit down , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 35]: I have arranged for her to sleep ; she needs it ; if you disturb her without my orders , I 'll brain you -- if you 've got the materials for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 14]: They sat down , distressed and indignant , but obedient , under compulsion .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 14]: He proceeded : `` Now , then , I want this case explained .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 20]: THEY wanted to explain it to me -- as if there had n't been emotion or excitement enough already .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 20]: You knew my orders ; how did you dare to go in there and get up that riot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 23]: Hester looked appealing at Hannah ; Hannah returned a beseeching look at Hester -- neither wanted to dance to this unsympathetic orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 7]: The doctor came to their help .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 9]: He said : `` Begin , Hester . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 34]: Fingering at the fringes of her shawl , and with lowered eyes , Hester said , timidly : `` We should not have disobeyed for any ordinary cause , but this was vital .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 5]: This was a duty .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 19]: With a duty one has no choice ; one must put all lighter considerations aside and perform it .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 10]: We were obliged to arraign her before her mother .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 7]: She had told a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 39]: The doctor glowered upon the woman a moment , and seemed to be trying to work up in his mind an understand of a wholly incomprehensible proposition ; then he stormed out : `` She told a lie !
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 3]: DID she ?
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 5]: God bless my soul !
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: I tell a million a day !
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 6]: And so does every doctor .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 12]: And so does everybody -- including you -- for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 22]: And THAT was the important thing that authorized you to venture to disobey my orders and imperil that woman 's life !
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 26]: Look here , Hester Gray , this is pure lunacy ; that girl COULD N'T tell a lie that was intended to injure a person .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 8]: The thing is impossible -- absolutely impossible .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 16]: You know it yourselves -- both of you ; you know it perfectly well . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 27]: Hannah came to her sister 's rescue : `` Hester did n't mean that it was that kind of a lie , and it was n't .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 7]: But it was a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 13]: `` Well , upon my word , I never heard such nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 11]: Have n't you got sense enough to discriminate between lies !
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 18]: Do n't you know the difference between a lie that helps and a lie that hurts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 25]: `` ALL lies are sinful , '' said Hannah , setting her lips together like a vise ; `` all lies are forbidden . ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 9]: The Only Christian fidgeted impatiently in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 19]: He went to attack this proposition , but he did not quite know how or where to begin .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 27]: Finally he made a venture : `` Hester , would n't you tell a lie to shield a person from an undeserved injury or shame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 7]: `` Not even a friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 8]: `` Not even your dearest friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 5]: I would not . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 29]: The doctor struggled in silence awhile with this situation ; then he asked : `` Not even to save him from bitter pain and misery and grief ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: Not even to save his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 3]: Another pause .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: Then : `` Nor his soul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 32]: There was a hush -- a silence which endured a measurable interval -- then Hester answered , in a low voice , but with decision : `` Nor his soul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 23]: No one spoke for a while ; then the doctor said : `` Is it with you the same , Hannah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 9]: `` I ask you both -- why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 40]: `` Because to tell such a lie , or any lie , is a sin , and could cost us the loss of our own souls -- WOULD , indeed , if we died without time to repent . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 11]: `` Strange ... strange ... it is past belief . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 17]: Then he asked , roughly : `` Is such a soul as that WORTH saving ? ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 18]: He rose up , mumbling and grumbling , and started for the door , stumping vigorously along .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 14]: At the threshold he turned and rasped out an admonition : `` Reform !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 31]: Drop this mean and sordid and selfish devotion to the saving of your shabby little souls , and hunt up something to do that 's got some dignity to it !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 4]: RISK your souls !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 17]: risk them in good causes ; then if you lose them , why should you care ?
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 3]: Reform ! ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 23]: The good old gentlewomen sat paralyzed , pulverized , outraged , insulted , and brooded in bitterness and indignation over these blasphemies .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 20]: They were hurt to the heart , poor old ladies , and said they could never forgive these injuries .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 4]: `` Reform ! ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 7]: They kept repeating that word resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: `` Reform -- and learn to tell lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 15]: Time slipped along , and in due course a change came over their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 40]: They had completed the human being 's first duty -- which is to think about himself until he has exhausted the subject , then he is in a condition to take up minor interests and think of other people .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 11]: This changes the complexion of his spirits -- generally wholesomely .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 94]: The minds of the two old ladies reverted to their beloved niece and the fearful disease which had smitten her ; instantly they forgot the hurts their self-love had received , and a passionate desire rose in their hearts to go to the help of the sufferer and comfort her with their love , and minister to her , and labor for her the best they could with their weak hands , and joyfully and affectionately wear out their poor old bodies in her dear service if only they might have the privilege .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 8]: `` And we shall have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 11]: said Hester , with the tears running down her face .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 37]: `` There are no nurses comparable to us , for there are no others that will stand their watch by that bed till they drop and die , and God knows we would do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 21]: `` Amen , '' said Hannah , smiling approval and endorsement through the mist of moisture that blurred her glasses .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 21]: `` The doctor knows us , and knows we will not disobey again ; and he will call no others .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 6]: He will not dare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 4]: `` Dare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 24]: said Hester , with temper , and dashing the water from her eyes ; `` he will dare anything -- that Christian devil !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 18]: But it will do no good for him to try it this time -- but , laws !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 2]: Hannah !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 39]: after all 's said and done , he is gifted and wise and good , and he would not think of such a thing ... It is surely time for one of us to go to that room .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 5]: What is keeping him ?
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 10]: Why does n't he come and say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 9]: They caught the sound of his approaching step .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 11]: He entered , sat down , and began to talk .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 11]: `` Margaret is a sick woman , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 21]: `` She is still sleeping , but she will wake presently ; then one of you must go to her .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 9]: She will be worse before she is better .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 9]: Pretty soon a night-and-day watch must be set .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 10]: How much of it can you two undertake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 6]: `` All of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: burst from both ladies at once .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 24]: The doctor 's eyes flashed , and he said , with energy : `` You DO ring true , you brave old relics !
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 46]: And you SHALL do all of the nursing you can , for there 's none to match you in that divine office in this town ; but you ca n't do all of it , and it would be a crime to let you . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 29]: It was grand praise , golden praise , coming from such a source , and it took nearly all the resentment out of the aged twin 's hearts .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 32]: `` Your Tilly and my old Nancy shall do the rest -- good nurses both , white souls with black skins , watchful , loving , tender -- just perfect nurses !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 11]: -- and competent liars from the cradle ... Look you !
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 19]: keep a little watch on Helen ; she is sick , and is going to be sicker . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 20]: The ladies looked a little surprised , and not credulous ; and Hester said : `` How is that ?
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 17]: It is n't an hour since you said she was as sound as a nut . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 13]: The doctor answered , tranquilly : `` It was a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 43]: The ladies turned upon him indignantly , and Hannah said : `` How can you make an odious confession like that , in so indifferent a tone , when you know how we feel about all forms of -- '' `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 22]: You are as ignorant as cats , both of you , and you do n't know what you are talking about .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 84]: You are like all the rest of the moral moles ; you lie from morning till night , but because you do n't do it with your mouths , but only with your lying eyes , your lying inflections , your deceptively misplaced emphasis , and your misleading gestures , you turn up your complacent noses and parade before God and the world as saintly and unsmirched Truth-Speakers , in whose cold-storage souls a lie would freeze to death if it got there !
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 20]: Why will you humbug yourselves with that foolish notion that no lie is a lie except a spoken one ?
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 15]: What is the difference between lying with your eyes and lying with your mouth ?
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 19]: There is none ; and if you would reflect a moment you would see that it is so .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 89]: There is n't a human being that does n't tell a gross of lies every day of his life ; and you -- why , between you , you tell thirty thousand ; yet you flare up here in a lurid hypocritical horror because I tell that child a benevolent and sinless lie to protect her from her imagination , which would get to work and warm up her blood to a fever in an hour , if I were disloyal enough to my duty to let it .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 18]: Which I should probably do if I were interested in saving my soul by such disreputable means .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 8]: `` Come , let us reason together .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 5]: Let us examine details .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 25]: When you two were in the sick-room raising that riot , what would you have done if you had known I was coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 17]: `` You would have slipped out and carried Helen with you -- would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 5]: The ladies were silent .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 10]: `` What would be your object and intention ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 6]: `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 28]: `` To keep me from finding out your guilt ; to beguile me to infer that Margaret 's excitement proceeded from some cause not known to you .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 14]: In a word , to tell me a lie -- a silent lie .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 8]: Moreover , a possibly harmful one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 9]: The twins colored , but did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 22]: `` You not only tell myriads of silent lies , but you tell lies with your mouths -- you two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: `` THAT is not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 5]: `` It is so .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 5]: But only harmless ones .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 9]: You never dream of uttering a harmful one .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 14]: Do you know that that is a concession -- and a confession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 24]: `` It is an unconscious concession that harmless lies are not criminal ; it is a confession that you constantly MAKE that discrimination .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 40]: For instance , you declined old Mrs. Foster 's invitation last week to meet those odious Higbies at supper -- in a polite note in which you expressed regret and said you were very sorry you could not go .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 5]: It was a lie .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 11]: It was as unmitigated a lie as was ever uttered .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 10]: Deny it , Hester -- with another lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 9]: Hester replied with a toss of her head .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 6]: `` That will not do .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 2]: Answer .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 11]: Was it a lie , or was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 30]: The color stole into the cheeks of both women , and with a struggle and an effort they got out their confession : `` It was a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 50]: `` Good -- the reform is beginning ; there is hope for you yet ; you will not tell a lie to save your dearest friend 's soul , but you will spew out one without a scruple to save yourself the discomfort of telling an unpleasant truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 3]: He rose .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 25]: Hester , speaking for both , said ; coldly : `` We have lied ; we perceive it ; it will occur no more .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 6]: To lie is a sin .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 34]: We shall never tell another one of any kind whatsoever , even lies of courtesy or benevolence , to save any one a pang or a sorrow decreed for him by God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 9]: `` Ah , how soon you will fall !
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 18]: In fact , you have fallen already ; for what you have just uttered is a lie .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 2]: Good-by .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 2]: Reform !
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 10]: One of you go to the sick-room now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 6]: CHAPTER IV Twelve days later .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 13]: Mother and child were lingering in the grip of the hideous disease .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 8]: Of hope for either there was little .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 17]: The aged sisters looked white and worn , but they would not give up their posts .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 17]: Their hearts were breaking , poor old things , but their grit was steadfast and indestructible .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 33]: All the twelve days the mother had pined for the child , and the child for the mother , but both knew that the prayer of these longings could not be granted .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 48]: When the mother was told -- on the first day -- that her disease was typhoid , she was frightened , and asked if there was danger that Helen could have contracted it the day before , when she was in the sick-chamber on that confession visit .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 10]: Hester told her the doctor had poo-pooed the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 75]: It troubled Hester to say it , although it was true , for she had not believed the doctor ; but when she saw the mother 's joy in the news , the pain in her conscience lost something of its force -- a result which made her ashamed of the constructive deception which she had practiced , though not ashamed enough to make her distinctly and definitely wish she had refrained from it .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 43]: From that moment the sick woman understood that her daughter must remain away , and she said she would reconcile herself to the separation the best she could , for she would rather suffer death than have her child 's health imperiled .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 12]: That afternoon Helen had to take to her bed , ill .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 7]: She grew worse during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 15]: In the morning her mother asked after her : `` Is she well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 16]: Hester turned cold ; she opened her lips , but the words refused to come .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 24]: The mother lay languidly looking , musing , waiting ; suddenly she turned white and gasped out : `` Oh , my God !
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 4]: what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 5]: is she sick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 26]: Then the poor aunt 's tortured heart rose in rebellion , and words came : `` No -- be comforted ; she is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 20]: The sick woman put all her happy heart in her gratitude : `` Thank God for those dear words !
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 3]: Kiss me .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 9]: How I worship you for saying them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 29]: Hester told this incident to Hannah , who received it with a rebuking look , and said , coldly : `` Sister , it was a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 32]: Hester 's lips trembled piteously ; she choked down a sob , and said : `` Oh , Hannah , it was a sin , but I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 16]: I could not endure the fright and the misery that were in her face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 4]: `` No matter .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 5]: It was a lie .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 10]: God will hold you to account for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 33]: `` Oh , I know it , I know it , '' cried Hester , wringing her hands , `` but even if it were now , I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 9]: I know I should do it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 11]: `` Then take my place with Helen in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 8]: I will make the report myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 10]: Hester clung to her sister , begging and imploring .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 17]: `` Do n't , Hannah , oh , do n't -- you will kill her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 10]: `` I will at least speak the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 22]: In the morning she had a cruel report to bear to the mother , and she braced herself for the trial .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 19]: When she returned from her mission , Hester was waiting , pale and trembling , in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 19]: She whispered : `` Oh , how did she take it -- that poor , desolate mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 8]: Hannah 's eyes were swimming in tears .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 17]: She said : `` God forgive me , I told her the child was well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 18]: Hester gathered her to her heart , with a grateful `` God bless you , Hannah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 12]: and poured out her thankfulness in an inundation of worshiping praises .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 17]: After that , the two knew the limit of their strength , and accepted their fate .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 15]: They surrendered humbly , and abandoned themselves to the hard requirements of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 47]: Daily they told the morning lie , and confessed their sin in prayer ; not asking forgiveness , as not being worthy of it , but only wishing to make record that they realized their wickedness and were not desiring to hide it or excuse it .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 47]: Daily , as the fair young idol of the house sank lower and lower , the sorrowful old aunts painted her glowing bloom and her fresh young beauty to the wan mother , and winced under the stabs her ecstasies of joy and gratitude gave them .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 64]: In the first days , while the child had strength to hold a pencil , she wrote fond little love-notes to her mother , in which she concealed her illness ; and these the mother read and reread through happy eyes wet with thankful tears , and kissed them over and over again , and treasured them as precious things under her pillow .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 25]: Then came a day when the strength was gone from the hand , and the mind wandered , and the tongue babbled pathetic incoherences .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 10]: This was a sore dilemma for the poor aunts .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 8]: There were no love-notes for the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 8]: They did not know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 32]: Hester began a carefully studied and plausible explanation , but lost the track of it and grew confused ; suspicion began to show in the mother 's face , then alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 31]: Hester saw it , recognized the imminence of the danger , and descended to the emergency , pulling herself resolutely together and plucking victor from the open jaws of defeat .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 30]: In a placid and convincing voice she said : `` I thought it might distress you to know it , but Helen spent the night at the Sloanes ' .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 44]: There was a little party there , and , although she did not want to go , and you so sick , we persuaded her , she being young and needing the innocent pastimes of youth , and we believing you would approve .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 11]: Be sure she will write the moment she comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 15]: `` How good you are , and how dear and thoughtful for us both !
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 2]: Approve ?
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: Why , I thank you with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 5]: My poor little exile !
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 20]: Tell her I want her to have every pleasure she can -- I would not rob her of one .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 13]: Only let her keep her health , that is all I ask .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 12]: Do n't let that suffer ; I could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 21]: How thankful I am that she escaped this infection -- and what a narrow risk she ran , Aunt Hester !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 12]: Think of that lovely face all dulled and burned with fever .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 9]: I ca n't bear the thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 4]: Keep her health .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 4]: Keep her bloom !
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 31]: I can see her now , the dainty creature -- with the big , blue , earnest eyes ; and sweet , oh , so sweet and gentle and winning !
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 12]: Is she as beautiful as ever , dear Aunt Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 40]: `` Oh , more beautiful and bright and charming than ever she was before , if such a thing can be '' -- and Hester turned away and fumbled with the medicine-bottles , to hide her shame and grief .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 21]: CHAPTER V After a little , both aunts were laboring upon a difficult and baffling work in Helen 's chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 19]: Patiently and earnestly , with their stiff old fingers , they were trying to forge the required note .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 16]: They made failure after failure , but they improved little by little all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 25]: The pity of it all , the pathetic humor of it , there was none to see ; they themselves were unconscious of it .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 78]: Often their tears fell upon the notes and spoiled them ; sometimes a single misformed word made a note risky which could have been ventured but for that ; but at last Hannah produced one whose script was a good enough imitation of Helen 's to pass any but a suspicious eye , and bountifully enriched it with the petting phrases and loving nicknames that had been familiar on the child 's lips from her nursery days .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 63]: She carried it to the mother , who took it with avidity , and kissed it , and fondled it , reading its precious words over and over again , and dwelling with deep contentment upon its closing paragraph : `` Mousie darling , if I could only see you , and kiss your eyes , and feel your arms about me !
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 11]: I am so glad my practicing does not disturb you .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 4]: Get well soon .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 18]: Everybody is good to me , but I am so lonesome without you , dear mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 12]: `` The poor child , I know just how she feels .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 23]: She can not be quite happy without me ; and I -- oh , I live in the light of her eyes !
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 40]: Tell her she must practice all she pleases ; and , Aunt Hannah -- tell her I ca n't hear the piano this far , nor hear dear voice when she sings : God knows I wish I could .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 22]: No one knows how sweet that voice is to me ; and to think -- some day it will be silent !
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 7]: What are you crying for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 12]: `` Only because -- because -- it was just a memory .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 13]: When I came away she was singing , ` Loch Lomond . '
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 5]: The pathos of it !
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 11]: It always moves me so when she sings that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: `` And me , too .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 29]: How heartbreakingly beautiful it is when some youthful sorrow is brooding in her breast and she sings it for the mystic healing it brings ... Aunt Hannah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 5]: `` Dear Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 6]: `` I am very ill .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 16]: Sometimes it comes over me that I shall never hear that dear voice again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 11]: `` Oh , do n't -- do n't , Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 7]: I ca n't bear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 24]: Margaret was moved and distressed , and said , gently : `` There -- there -- let me put my arms around you .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 4]: Do n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 8]: There -- put your cheek to mine .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 3]: Be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 5]: I wish to live .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 7]: I will live if I can .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 9]: Ah , what could she do without me !
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 8]: ... Does she often speak of me ?
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 8]: -- but I know she does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 12]: `` Oh , all the time -- all the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 5]: `` My sweet child !
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 11]: She wrote the note the moment she came home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 7]: `` Yes -- the first moment .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 11]: She would not wait to take off her things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 5]: `` I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 10]: It is her dear , impulsive , affectionate way .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 15]: I knew it without asking , but I wanted to hear you say it .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 34]: The petted wife knows she is loved , but she makes her husband tell her so every day , just for the joy of hearing it ... She used the pen this time .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 17]: That is better ; the pencil-marks could rub out , and I should grieve for that .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 10]: Did you suggest that she use the pen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 14]: `` Y -- no -- she -- it was her own idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 18]: The mother looked her pleasure , and said : `` I was hoping you would say that .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 10]: There was never such a dear and thoughtful child !
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 5]: ... Aunt Hannah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 5]: `` Dear Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 17]: `` Go and tell her I think of her all the time , and worship her .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 7]: Why -- you are crying again .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 21]: Do n't be so worried about me , dear ; I think there is nothing to fear , yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 15]: The grieving messenger carried her message , and piously delivered it to unheeding ears .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 40]: The girl babbled on unaware ; looking up at her with wondering and startled eyes flaming with fever , eyes in which was no light of recognition : `` Are you -- no , you are not my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 10]: I want her -- oh , I want her !
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 14]: She was here a minute ago -- I did not see her go .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 4]: Will she come ?
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 5]: will she come quickly ?
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 5]: will she come now ?
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 30]: ... There are so many houses ... and they oppress me so ... and everything whirls and turns and whirls ... oh , my head , my head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 35]: -- and so she wandered on and on , in her pain , flitting from one torturing fancy to another , and tossing her arms about in a weary and ceaseless persecution of unrest .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 36]: Poor old Hannah wetted the parched lips and softly stroked the hot brow , murmuring endearing and pitying words , and thanking the Father of all that the mother was happy and did not know .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 43]: CHAPTER VI Daily the child sank lower and steadily lower towards the grave , and daily the sorrowing old watchers carried gilded tidings of her radiant health and loveliness to the happy mother , whose pilgrimage was also now nearing its end .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 62]: And daily they forged loving and cheery notes in the child 's hand , and stood by with remorseful consciences and bleeding hearts , and wept to see the grateful mother devour them and adore them and treasure them away as things beyond price , because of their sweet source , and sacred because her child 's hand had touched them .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 14]: At last came that kindly friend who brings healing and peace to all .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: The lights were burning low .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 44]: In the solemn hush which precedes the dawn vague figures flitted soundless along the dim hall and gathered silent and awed in Helen 's chamber , and grouped themselves about her bed , for a warning had gone forth , and they knew .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 27]: The dying girl lay with closed lids , and unconscious , the drapery upon her breast faintly rising and falling as her wasting life ebbed away .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 13]: At intervals a sigh or a muffled sob broke upon the stillness .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 36]: The same haunting thought was in all minds there : the pity of this death , the going out into the great darkness , and the mother not here to help and hearten and bless .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 23]: Helen stirred ; her hands began to grope wistfully about as if they sought something -- she had been blind some hours .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 9]: The end was come ; all knew it .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 23]: With a great sob Hester gathered her to her breast , crying , `` Oh , my child , my darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 55]: A rapturous light broke in the dying girl 's face , for it was mercifully vouchsafed her to mistake those sheltering arms for another 's ; and she went to her rest murmuring , `` Oh , mamma , I am so happy -- I longed for you -- now I can die . ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 8]: Two hours later Hester made her report .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 13]: The mother asked : `` How is it with the child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 6]: `` She is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 32]: CHAPTER VII A sheaf of white crape and black was hung upon the door of the house , and there it swayed and rustled in the wind and whispered its tidings .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 31]: At noon the preparation of the dead was finished , and in the coffin lay the fair young form , beautiful , and in the sweet face a great peace .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 17]: Two mourners sat by it , grieving and worshipping -- Hannah and the black woman Tilly .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 17]: Hester came , and she was trembling , for a great trouble was upon her spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 11]: She said : `` She asks for a note . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 5]: Hannah 's face blanched .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 17]: She had not thought of this ; it had seemed that that pathetic service was ended .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 10]: But she realized now that that could not be .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 44]: For a little while the two women stood looking into each other 's face , with vacant eyes ; then Hannah said : `` There is no way out of it -- she must have it ; she will suspect , else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 8]: `` And she would find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 7]: It would break her heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 12]: She looked at the dead face , and her eyes filled .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 10]: `` I will write it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 4]: Hester carried it .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 20]: The closing line said : `` Darling Mousie , dear sweet mother , we shall soon be together again .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 6]: Is not that good news ?
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 13]: And it is true ; they all say it is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 19]: The mother mourned , saying : `` Poor child , how will she bear it when she knows ?
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 9]: I shall never see her again in life .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 7]: It is hard , so hard .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 5]: She does not suspect ?
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 7]: You guard her from that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 10]: `` She thinks you will soon be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 13]: `` How good you are , and careful , dear Aunt Hester !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 11]: None goes near herr who could carry the infection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: `` It would be a crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 7]: `` But you SEE her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 9]: `` With a distance between -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 6]: `` That is so good .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 20]: Others one could not trust ; but you two guardian angels -- steel is not so true as you .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 14]: Others would be unfaithful ; and many would deceive , and lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 12]: Hester 's eyes fell , and her poor old lips trembled .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 52]: `` Let me kiss you for her , Aunt Hester ; and when I am gone , and the danger is past , place the kiss upon her dear lips some day , and say her mother sent it , and all her mother 's broken heart is in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 18]: Within the hour , Hester , raining tears upon the dead face , performed her pathetic mission .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 17]: CHAPTER VIII Another day dawned , and grew , and spread its sunshine in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 39]: Aunt Hannah brought comforting news to the failing mother , and a happy note , which said again , `` We have but a little time to wait , darling mother , then we shall be together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 12]: The deep note of a bell came moaning down the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 8]: `` Aunt Hannah , it is tolling .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 7]: Some poor soul is at rest .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: As I shall be soon .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 9]: You will not let her forget me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 10]: `` Oh , God knows she never will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 11]: `` Do not you hear strange noises , Aunt Hannah ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 10]: It sounds like the shuffling of many feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 11]: `` We hoped you would not hear it , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 18]: It is a little company gathering , for -- for Helen 's sake , poor little prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 11]: There will be music -- and she loves it so .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 8]: We thought you would not mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 3]: `` Mind ?
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 16]: Oh no , no -- oh , give her everything her dear heart can desire .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 14]: How good you two are to her , and how good to me !
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 7]: God bless you both always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 9]: After a listening pause : `` How lovely !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 5]: It is her organ .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 11]: Is she playing it herself , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 16]: Faint and rich and inspiring the chords floating to her ears on the still air .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 15]: `` Yes , it is her touch , dear heart , I recognize it .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 4]: They are singing .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 7]: Why -- it is a hymn !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 65]: and the sacredest of all , the most touching , the most consoling ... It seems to open the gates of paradise to me ... If I could die now ... '' Faint and far the words rose out of the stillness : Nearer , my God , to Thee , Nearer to Thee , E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 27]: With the closing of the hymn another soul passed to its rest , and they that had been one in life were not sundered in death .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 20]: The sisters , mourning and rejoicing , said : `` How blessed it was that she never knew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 41]: CHAPTER IX At midnight they sat together , grieving , and the angel of the Lord appeared in the midst transfigured with a radiance not of earth ; and speaking , said : `` For liars a place is appointed .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: There they burn in the fires of hell from everlasting unto everlasting .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 3]: Repent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 20]: The bereaved fell upon their knees before him and clasped their hands and bowed their gray heads , adoring .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 16]: But their tongues clove to the roof of their mouths , and they were dumb .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 3]: `` Speak !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 24]: that I may bear the message to the chancery of heaven and bring again the decree from which there is no appeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 71]: Then they bowed their heads yet lower , and one said : `` Our sin is great , and we suffer shame ; but only perfect and final repentance can make us whole ; and we are poor creatures who have learned our human weakness , and we know that if we were in those hard straits again our hearts would fail again , and we should sin as before .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 16]: The strong could prevail , and so be saved , but we are lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 7]: They lifted their heads in supplication .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 5]: The angel was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 18]: While they marveled and wept he came again ; and bending low , he whispered the decree .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 6]: CHAPTER X Was it Heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 3]: Or Hell ?
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 24]: A CURE FOR THE BLUES By courtesy of Mr. Cable I came into possession of a singular book eight or ten years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 13]: It is likely that mine is now the only copy in existence .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 19]: Its title-page , unabbreviated , reads as follows : `` The Enemy Conquered ; or , Love Triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 33]: By G. Ragsdale McClintock , -LRB- 1 -RRB- author of ` An Address , ' etc. , delivered at Sunflower Hill , South Carolina , and member of the Yale Law School .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 16]: New Haven : published by T. H. Pease , 83 Chapel Street , 1845 . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 14]: No one can take up this book and lay it down again unread .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 62]: Whoever reads one line of it is caught , is chained ; he has become the contented slave of its fascinations ; and he will read and read , devour and devour , and will not let it go out of his hand till it is finished to the last line , though the house be on fire over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 55]: And after a first reading he will not throw it aside , but will keep it by him , with his Shakespeare and his Homer , and will take it up many and many a time , when the world is dark and his spirits are low , and be straightway cheered and refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 23]: Yet this work has been allowed to lie wholly neglected , unmentioned , and apparently unregretted , for nearly half a century .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 69]: The reader must not imagine that he is to find in it wisdom , brilliancy , fertility of invention , ingenuity of construction , excellence of form , purity of style , perfection of imagery , truth to nature , clearness of statement , humanly possible situations , humanly possible people , fluent narrative , connected sequence of events -- or philosophy , or logic , or sense .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 73]: No ; the rich , deep , beguiling charm of the book lies in the total and miraculous ABSENCE from it of all these qualities -- a charm which is completed and perfected by the evident fact that the author , whose naive innocence easily and surely wins our regard , and almost our worship , does not know that they are absent , does not even suspect that they are absent .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 25]: When read by the light of these helps to an understanding of the situation , the book is delicious -- profoundly and satisfyingly delicious .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 40]: I call it a book because the author calls it a book , I call it a work because he calls it a work ; but , in truth , it is merely a duodecimo pamphlet of thirty-one pages .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 30]: It was written for fame and money , as the author very frankly -- yes , and very hopefully , too , poor fellow -- says in his preface .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 29]: The money never came -- no penny of it ever came ; and how long , how pathetically long , the fame has been deferred -- forty-seven years !
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 23]: He was young then , it would have been so much to him then ; but will he care for it now ?
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 13]: As time is measured in America , McClintock 's epoch is antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 23]: In his long-vanished day the Southern author had a passion for `` eloquence '' ; it was his pet , his darling .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 8]: He would be eloquent , or perish .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 18]: And he recognized only one kind of eloquence -- the lurid , the tempestuous , the volcanic .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 38]: He liked words -- big words , fine words , grand words , rumbling , thundering , reverberating words ; with sense attaching if it could be got in without marring the sound , but not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 43]: He loved to stand up before a dazed world , and pour forth flame and smoke and lava and pumice-stone into the skies , and work his subterranean thunders , and shake himself with earthquakes , and stench himself with sulphur fumes .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 26]: If he consumed his own fields and vineyards , that was a pity , yes ; but he would have his eruption at any cost .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 64]: Mr. McClintock 's eloquence -- and he is always eloquent , his crater is always spouting -- is of the pattern common to his day , but he departs from the custom of the time in one respect : his brethren allowed sense to intrude when it did not mar the sound , but he does not allow it to intrude at all .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 39]: For example , consider this figure , which he used in the village `` Address '' referred to with such candid complacency in the title-page above quoted -- `` like the topmost topaz of an ancient tower . ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 32]: Please read it again ; contemplate it ; measure it ; walk around it ; climb up it ; try to get at an approximate realization of the size of it .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 27]: Is the fellow to that to be found in literature , ancient or modern , foreign or domestic , living or dead , drunk or sober ?
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: One notices how fine and grand it sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 36]: We know that if it was loftily uttered , it got a noble burst of applause from the villagers ; yet there is n't a ray of sense in it , or meaning to it .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 20]: McClintock finished his education at Yale in 1843 , and came to Hartford on a visit that same year .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 24]: I have talked with men who at that time talked with him , and felt of him , and knew he was real .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 34]: One needs to remember that fact and to keep fast hold of it ; it is the only way to keep McClintock 's book from undermining one 's faith in McClintock 's actuality .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 5]: As to the book .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 42]: The first four pages are devoted to an inflamed eulogy of Woman -- simply woman in general , or perhaps as an institution -- wherein , among other compliments to her details , he pays a unique one to her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 17]: He says it `` fills the breast with fond alarms , echoed by every rill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 11]: It sounds well enough , but it is not true .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 14]: After the eulogy he takes up his real work and the novel begins .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 13]: It begins in the woods , near the village of Sunflower Hill .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 52]: Brightening clouds seemed to rise from the mist of the fair Chattahoochee , to spread their beauty over the thick forest , to guide the hero whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the enemy that would tarnish his name , and to win back the admiration of his long-tried friend .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 42]: It seems a general remark , but it is not general ; the hero mentioned is the to-be hero of the book ; and in this abrupt fashion , and without name or description , he is shoveled into the tale .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 33]: `` With aspirations to conquer the enemy that would tarnish his name '' is merely a phrase flung in for the sake of the sound -- let it not mislead the reader .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 16]: No one is trying to tarnish this person ; no one has thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 44]: The rest of the sentence is also merely a phrase ; the man has no friend as yet , and of course has had no chance to try him , or win back his admiration , or disturb him in any other way .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 81]: The hero climbs up over `` Sawney 's Mountain , '' and down the other side , making for an old Indian `` castle '' -- which becomes `` the red man 's hut '' in the next sentence ; and when he gets there at last , he `` surveys with wonder and astonishment '' the invisible structure , `` which time has buried in the dust , and thought to himself his happiness was not yet complete . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 32]: One does n't know why it was n't , nor how near it came to being complete , nor what was still wanting to round it up and make it so .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 13]: Maybe it was the Indian ; but the book does not say .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 50]: At this point we have an episode : Beside the shore of the brook sat a young man , about eighteen or twenty , who seemed to be reading some favorite book , and who had a remarkably noble countenance -- eyes which betrayed more than a common mind .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 25]: This of course made the youth a welcome guest , and gained him friends in whatever condition of his life he might be placed .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 18]: The traveler observed that he was a well-built figure which showed strength and grace in every movement .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 20]: He accordingly addressed him in quite a gentlemanly manner , and inquired of him the way to the village .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 55]: After he had received the desired information , and was about taking his leave , the youth said , `` Are you not Major Elfonzo , the great musician -LRB- 2 -RRB- -- the champion of a noble cause -- the modern Achilles , who gained so many victories in the Florida War ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 70]: `` I bear that name , '' said the Major , `` and those titles , trusting at the same time that the ministers of grace will carry me triumphantly through all my laudable undertakings , and if , '' continued the Major , `` you , sir , are the patronizer of noble deeds , I should like to make you my confidant and learn your address . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 23]: The youth looked somewhat amazed , bowed low , mused for a moment , and began : `` My name is Roswell .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 85]: I have been recently admitted to the bar , and can only give a faint outline of my future success in that honorable profession ; but I trust , sir , like the Eagle , I shall look down from the lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man , and shall ever be ready to give you any assistance in my official capacity , and whatever this muscular arm of mine can do , whenever it shall be called from its buried GREATNESS . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 14]: The Major grasped him by the hand , and exclaimed : `` O !
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 36]: thou exalted spirit of inspiration -- thou flame of burning prosperity , may the Heaven-directed blaze be the glare of thy soul , and battle down every rampart that seems to impede your progress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 28]: There is a strange sort of originality about McClintock ; he imitates other people 's styles , but nobody can imitate his , not even an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 41]: Other people can be windy , but McClintock blows a gale ; other people can blubber sentiment , but McClintock spews it ; other people can mishandle metaphors , but only McClintock knows how to make a business of it .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 18]: McClintock is always McClintock , he is always consistent , his style is always his own style .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 25]: He does not make the mistake of being relevant on one page and irrelevant on another ; he is irrelevant on all of them .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 24]: He does not make the mistake of being lucid in one place and obscure in another ; he is obscure all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 35]: He does not make the mistake of slipping in a name here and there that is out of character with his work ; he always uses names that exactly and fantastically fit his lunatics .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 12]: In the matter of undeviating consistency he stands alone in authorship .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 21]: It is this that makes his style unique , and entitles it to a name of its own -- McClintockian .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 14]: It is this that protects it from being mistaken for anybody else 's .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 34]: Uncredited quotations from other writers often leave a reader in doubt as to their authorship , but McClintock is safe from that accident ; an uncredited quotation from him would always be recognizable .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 58]: When a boy nineteen years old , who had just been admitted to the bar , says , `` I trust , sir , like the Eagle , I shall look down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man , '' we know who is speaking through that boy ; we should recognize that note anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 73]: There be myriads of instruments in this world 's literary orchestra , and a multitudinous confusion of sounds that they make , wherein fiddles are drowned , and guitars smothered , and one sort of drum mistaken for another sort ; but whensoever the brazen note of the McClintockian trombone breaks through that fog of music , that note is recognizable , and about it there can be no blur of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 17]: The novel now arrives at the point where the Major goes home to see his father .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 12]: When McClintock wrote this interview he probably believed it was pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 35]: The road which led to the town presented many attractions Elfonzo had bid farewell to the youth of deep feeling , and was now wending his way to the dreaming spot of his fondness .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 25]: The south winds whistled through the woods , as the waters dashed against the banks , as rapid fire in the pent furnace roars .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 35]: This brought him to remember while alone , that he quietly left behind the hospitality of a father 's house , and gladly entered the world , with higher hopes than are often realized .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 35]: But as he journeyed onward , he was mindful of the advice of his father , who had often looked sadly on the ground , when tears of cruelly deceived hope moistened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 51]: Elfonzo had been somewhat a dutiful son ; yet fond of the amusements of life -- had been in distant lands -- had enjoyed the pleasure of the world , and had frequently returned to the scenes of his boyhood , almost destitute of many of the comforts of life .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 35]: In this condition , he would frequently say to his father , `` Have I offended you , that you look upon me as a stranger , and frown upon me with stinging looks ?
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 12]: Will you not favor me with the sound of your voice ?
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 67]: If I have trampled upon your veneration , or have spread a humid veil of darkness around your expectations , send me back into the world , where no heart beats for me -- where the foot of man had never yet trod ; but give me at least one kind word -- allow me to come into the presence sometimes of thy winter-worn locks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 51]: `` Forbid it , Heaven , that I should be angry with thee , '' answered the father , `` my son , and yet I send thee back to the children of the world -- to the cold charity of the combat , and to a land of victory .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 26]: I read another destiny in thy countenance -- I learn thy inclinations from the flame that has already kindled in my soul a strange sensation .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 43]: It will seek thee , my dear ELFONZO , it will find thee -- thou canst not escape that lighted torch , which shall blot out from the remembrance of men a long train of prophecies which they have foretold against thee .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 6]: I once thought not so .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 102]: Once , I was blind ; but now the path of life is plain before me , and my sight is clear ; yet , Elfonzo , return to thy worldly occupation -- take again in thy hand that chord of sweet sounds -- struggle with the civilized world and with your own heart ; fly swiftly to the enchanted ground -- let the night-OWL send forth its screams from the stubborn oak -- let the sea sport upon the beach , and the stars sing together ; but learn of these , Elfonzo , thy doom , and thy hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 29]: Our most innocent as well as our most lawful DESIRES must often be denied us , that we may learn to sacrifice them to a Higher will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 22]: Remembering such admonitions with gratitude , Elfonzo was immediately urged by the recollection of his father 's family to keep moving .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 27]: McClintock has a fine gift in the matter of surprises ; but as a rule they are not pleasant ones , they jar upon the feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 12]: His closing sentence in the last quotation is of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 17]: It brings one down out of the tinted clouds in too sudden and collapsed a fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 10]: It incenses one against the author for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 40]: It makes the reader want to take him by this winter-worn locks , and trample on his veneration , and deliver him over to the cold charity of combat , and blot him out with his own lighted torch .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 7]: But the feeling does not last .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 22]: The master takes again in his hand that concord of sweet sounds of his , and one is reconciled , pacified .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 41]: His steps became quicker and quicker -- he hastened through the PINY woods , dark as the forest was , and with joy he very soon reached the little village of repose , in whose bosom rested the boldest chivalry .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 44]: His close attention to every important object -- his modest questions about whatever was new to him -- his reverence for wise old age , and his ardent desire to learn many of the fine arts , soon brought him into respectable notice .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 65]: One mild winter day , as he walked along the streets toward the Academy , which stood upon a small eminence , surrounded by native growth -- some venerable in its appearance , others young and prosperous -- all seemed inviting , and seemed to be the very place for learning as well as for genius to spend its research beneath its spreading shades .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 13]: He entered its classic walls in the usual mode of southern manners .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 6]: The artfulness of this man !
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 21]: None knows so well as he how to pique the curiosity of the reader -- and how to disappoint it .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 33]: He raises the hope , here , that he is going to tell all about how one enters a classic wall in the usual mode of Southern manners ; but does he ?
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 15]: No ; he smiles in his sleeve , and turns aside to other matters .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 20]: The principal of the Institution begged him to be seated and listen to the recitations that were going on .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 13]: He accordingly obeyed the request , and seemed to be much pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 59]: After the school was dismissed , and the young hearts regained their freedom , with the songs of the evening , laughing at the anticipated pleasures of a happy home , while others tittered at the actions of the past day , he addressed the teacher in a tone that indicated a resolution -- with an undaunted mind .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 18]: He said he had determined to become a student , if he could meet with his approbation .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 17]: `` Sir , '' said he , `` I have spent much time in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 10]: I have traveled among the uncivilized inhabitants of America .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 28]: I have met with friends , and combated with foes ; but none of these gratify my ambition , or decide what is to be my destiny .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 16]: I see the learned world have an influence with the voice of the people themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 18]: The despoilers of the remotest kingdoms of the earth refer their differences to this class of persons .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 59]: This the illiterate and inexperienced little dream of ; and now if you will receive me as I am , with these deficiencies -- with all my misguided opinions , I will give you my honor , sir , that I will never disgrace the Institution , or those who have placed you in this honorable station . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 30]: The instructor , who had met with many disappointments , knew how to feel for a stranger who had been thus turned upon the charities of an unfeeling community .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 28]: He looked at him earnestly , and said : `` Be of good cheer -- look forward , sir , to the high destination you may attain .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 27]: Remember , the more elevated the mark at which you aim , the more sure , the more glorious , the more magnificent the prize . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 12]: From wonder to wonder , his encouragement led the impatient listener .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 22]: A strange nature bloomed before him -- giant streams promised him success -- gardens of hidden treasures opened to his view .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 18]: All this , so vividly described , seemed to gain a new witchery from his glowing fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 12]: It seems to me that this situation is new in romance .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 10]: I feel sure it has not been attempted before .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 29]: Military celebrities have been disguised and set at lowly occupations for dramatic effect , but I think McClintock is the first to send one of them to school .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 69]: Thus , in this book , you pass from wonder to wonder , through gardens of hidden treasure , where giant streams bloom before you , and behind you , and all around , and you feel as happy , and groggy , and satisfied with your quart of mixed metaphor aboard as you would if it had been mixed in a sample-room and delivered from a jug .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 40]: Now we come upon some more McClintockian surprise -- a sweetheart who is sprung upon us without any preparation , along with a name for her which is even a little more of a surprise than she herself is .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 18]: In 1842 he entered the class , and made rapid progress in the English and Latin departments .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 43]: Indeed , he continued advancing with such rapidity that he was like to become the first in his class , and made such unexpected progress , and was so studious , that he had almost forgotten the pictured saint of his affections .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 40]: The fresh wreaths of the pine and cypress had waited anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heaven upon the heads of those who had so often poured forth the tender emotions of their souls under its boughs .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 12]: He was aware of the pleasure that he had seen there .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 24]: So one evening , as he was returning from his reading , he concluded he would pay a visit to this enchanting spot .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 23]: Little did he think of witnessing a shadow of his former happiness , though no doubt he wished it might be so .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 12]: He continued sauntering by the roadside , meditating on the past .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 13]: The nearer he approached the spot , the more anxious he became .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 56]: At that moment a tall female figure flitted across his path , with a bunch of roses in her hand ; her countenance showed uncommon vivacity , with a resolute spirit ; her ivory teeth already appeared as she smiled beautifully , promenading -- while her ringlets of hair dangled unconsciously around her snowy neck .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 8]: Nothing was wanting to complete her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 24]: The tinge of the rose was in full bloom upon her cheek ; the charms of sensibility and tenderness were always her associates .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 20]: In Ambulinia 's bosom dwelt a noble soul -- one that never faded -- one that never was conquered .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 2]: Ambulinia !
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 8]: It can hardly be matched in fiction .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 7]: The full name is Ambulinia Valeer .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 10]: Marriage will presently round it out and perfect it .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 9]: Then it will be Mrs. Ambulinia Valeer Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 5]: It takes the chromo .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 39]: Her heart yielded to no feeling but the love of Elfonzo , on whom she gazed with intense delight , and to whom she felt herself more closely bound , because he sought the hand of no other .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 8]: Elfonzo was roused from his apparent reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 22]: His books no longer were his inseparable companions -- his thoughts arrayed themselves to encourage him to the field of victory .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 17]: He endeavored to speak to his supposed Ambulinia , but his speech appeared not in words .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 27]: No , his effort was a stream of fire , that kindled his soul into a flame of admiration , and carried his senses away captive .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 13]: Ambulinia had disappeared , to make him more mindful of his duty .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 17]: As she walked speedily away through the piny woods , she calmly echoed : `` O !
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: Elfonzo , thou wilt now look from thy sunbeams .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 26]: Thou shalt now walk in a new path -- perhaps thy way leads through darkness ; but fear not , the stars foretell happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 34]: To McClintock that jingling jumble of fine words meant something , no doubt , or seemed to mean something ; but it is useless for us to try to divine what it was .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 40]: Ambulinia comes -- we do n't know whence nor why ; she mysteriously intimates -- we do n't know what ; and then she goes echoing away -- we do n't know whither ; and down comes the curtain .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 12]: McClintock 's art is subtle ; McClintock 's art is deep .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 51]: Not many days afterward , as surrounded by fragrant flowers she sat one evening at twilight , to enjoy the cool breeze that whispered notes of melody along the distant groves , the little birds perched on every side , as if to watch the movements of their new visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 54]: The bells were tolling , when Elfonzo silently stole along by the wild wood flowers , holding in his hand his favorite instrument of music -- his eye continually searching for Ambulinia , who hardly seemed to perceive him , as she played carelessly with the songsters that hopped from branch to branch .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 12]: Nothing could be more striking than the difference between the two .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 21]: Nature seemed to have given the more tender soul to Elfonzo , and the stronger and more courageous to Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 41]: A deep feeling spoke from the eyes of Elfonzo -- such a feeling as can only be expressed by those who are blessed as admirers , and by those who are able to return the same with sincerity of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 18]: He was a few years older than Ambulinia : she had turned a little into her seventeenth .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 21]: He had almost grown up in the Cherokee country , with the same equal proportions as one of the natives .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 38]: But little intimacy had existed between them until the year forty-one -- because the youth felt that the character of such a lovely girl was too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of quiet reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 59]: But as lovers will not always be insulted , at all times and under all circumstances , by the frowns and cold looks of crabbed old age , which should continually reflect dignity upon those around , and treat the unfortunate as well as the fortunate with a graceful mien , he continued to use diligence and perseverance .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 51]: All this lighted a spark in his heart that changed his whole character , and like the unyielding Deity that follows the storm to check its rage in the forest , he resolves for the first time to shake off his embarrassment and return where he had before only worshiped .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 11]: At last we begin to get the Major 's measure .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 26]: We are able to put this and that casual fact together , and build the man up before our eyes , and look at him .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 15]: And after we have got him built , we find him worth the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 61]: By the above comparison between his age and Ambulinia 's , we guess the war-worn veteran to be twenty-two ; and the other facts stand thus : he had grown up in the Cherokee country with the same equal proportions as one of the natives -- how flowing and graceful the language , and yet how tantalizing as to meaning !
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 251]: -- he had been turned adrift by his father , to whom he had been `` somewhat of a dutiful son '' ; he wandered in distant lands ; came back frequently `` to the scenes of his boyhood , almost destitute of many of the comforts of life , '' in order to get into the presence of his father 's winter-worn locks , and spread a humid veil of darkness around his expectations ; but he was always promptly sent back to the cold charity of the combat again ; he learned to play the fiddle , and made a name for himself in that line ; he had dwelt among the wild tribes ; he had philosophized about the despoilers of the kingdoms of the earth , and found out -- the cunning creature -- that they refer their differences to the learned for settlement ; he had achieved a vast fame as a military chieftain , the Achilles of the Florida campaigns , and then had got him a spelling-book and started to school ; he had fallen in love with Ambulinia Valeer while she was teething , but had kept it to himself awhile , out of the reverential awe which he felt for the child ; but now at last , like the unyielding Deity who follows the storm to check its rage in the forest , he resolves to shake off his embarrassment , and to return where before he had only worshiped .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 31]: The Major , indeed , has made up his mind to rise up and shake his faculties together , and to see if HE ca n't do that thing himself .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: This is not clear .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 54]: But no matter about that : there stands the hero , compact and visible ; and he is no mean structure , considering that his creator had never structure , considering that his creator had never created anything before , and had n't anything but rags and wind to build with this time .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 63]: It seems to me that no one can contemplate this odd creature , this quaint and curious blatherskite , without admiring McClintock , or , at any rate , loving him and feeling grateful to him ; for McClintock made him , he gave him to us ; without McClintock we could not have had him , and would now be poor .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: But we must come to the feast again .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 29]: Here is a courtship scene , down there in the romantic glades among the raccoons , alligators , and things , that has merit , peculiar literary merit .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 5]: See how Achilles woos .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 19]: Dwell upon the second sentence -LRB- particularly the close of it -RRB- and the beginning of the third .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 17]: Never mind the new personage , Leos , who is intruded upon us unheralded and unexplained .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 37]: That is McClintock 's way ; it is his habit ; it is a part of his genius ; he can not help it ; he never interrupts the rush of his narrative to make introductions .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 37]: It could not escape Ambulinia 's penetrating eye that he sought an interview with her , which she as anxiously avoided , and assumed a more distant calmness than before , seemingly to destroy all hope .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 34]: After many efforts and struggles with his own person , with timid steps the Major approached the damsel , with the same caution as he would have done in a field of battle .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 20]: `` Lady Ambulinia , '' said he , trembling , `` I have long desired a moment like this .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 7]: I dare not let it escape .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 17]: I fear the consequences ; yet I hope your indulgence will at least hear my petition .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 17]: Can you not anticipate what I would say , and what I am about to express ?
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 74]: Will not you , like Minerva , who sprung from the brain of Jupiter , release me from thy winding chains or cure me -- '' `` Say no more , Elfonzo , '' answered Ambulinia , with a serious look , raising her hand as if she intended to swear eternal hatred against the whole world ; `` another lady in my place would have perhaps answered your question in bitter coldness .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 10]: I know not the little arts of my sex .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 49]: I care but little for the vanity of those who would chide me , and am unwilling as well as ashamed to be guilty of anything that would lead you to think ` all is not gold that glitters ' ; so be no rash in your resolution .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 17]: It is better to repent now , than to do it in a more solemn hour .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 9]: Yes , I know what you would say .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 20]: I know you have a costly gift for me -- the noblest that man can make -- YOUR HEART !
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 10]: You should not offer it to one so unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 41]: Heaven , you know , has allowed my father 's house to be made a house of solitude , a home of silent obedience , which my parents say is more to be admired than big names and high-sounding titles .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 30]: Notwithstanding all this , let me speak the emotions of an honest heart -- allow me to say in the fullness of my hopes that I anticipate better days .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 61]: The bird may stretch its wings toward the sun , which it can never reach ; and flowers of the field appear to ascend in the same direction , because they can not do otherwise ; but man confides his complaints to the saints in whom he believes ; for in their abodes of light they know no more sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 20]: From your confession and indicative looks , I must be that person ; if so deceive not yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 15]: Elfonzo replied , `` Pardon me , my dear madam , for my frankness .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 41]: I have loved you from my earliest days -- everything grand and beautiful hath borne the image of Ambulinia ; while precipices on every hand surrounded me , your GUARDIAN ANGEL stood and beckoned me away from the deep abyss .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 49]: In every trial , in every misfortune , I have met with your helping hand ; yet I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love , till a voice impaired with age encouraged the cause , and declared they who acquired thy favor should win a victory .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 7]: I saw how Leos worshiped thee .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 6]: I felt my own unworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 33]: I began to KNOW JEALOUSLY , a strong guest -- indeed , in my bosom , -- yet I could see if I gained your admiration Leos was to be my rival .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 80]: I was aware that he had the influence of your parents , and the wealth of a deceased relative , which is too often mistaken for permanent and regular tranquillity ; yet I have determined by your permission to beg an interest in your prayers -- to ask you to animate my drooping spirits by your smiles and your winning looks ; for if you but speak I shall be conqueror , my enemies shall stagger like Olympus shakes .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 45]: And though earth and sea may tremble , and the charioteer of the sun may forget his dashing steed , yet I am assured that it is only to arm me with divine weapons which will enable me to complete my long-tried intention . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 52]: `` Return to yourself , Elfonzo , '' said Ambulinia , pleasantly : `` a dream of vision has disturbed your intellect ; you are above the atmosphere , dwelling in the celestial regions ; nothing is there that urges or hinders , nothing that brings discord into our present litigation .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 18]: I entreat you to condescend a little , and be a man , and forget it all .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 31]: When Homer describes the battle of the gods and noble men fighting with giants and dragons , they represent under this image our struggles with the delusions of our passions .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 31]: You have exalted me , an unhappy girl , to the skies ; you have called me a saint , and portrayed in your imagination an angel in human form .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 34]: Let her remain such to you , let her continue to be as you have supposed , and be assured that she will consider a share in your esteem as her highest treasure .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 35]: Think not that I would allure you from the path in which your conscience leads you ; for you know I respect the conscience of others , as I would die for my own .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 19]: Elfonzo , if I am worthy of thy love , let such conversation never again pass between us .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: Go , seek a nobler theme !
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 19]: we will seek it in the stream of time , as the sun set in the Tigris . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 34]: As she spake these words she grasped the hand of Elfonzo , saying at the same time -- `` Peace and prosperity attend you , my hero ; be up and doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 18]: Closing her remarks with this expression , she walked slowly away , leaving Elfonzo astonished and amazed .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 9]: He ventured not to follow or detain her .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 19]: Here he stood alone , gazing at the stars ; confounded as he was , here he stood .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 6]: Yes ; there he stood .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: There seems to be no doubt about that .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 14]: Nearly half of this delirious story has now been delivered to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 14]: It seems a pity to reduce the other half to a cold synopsis .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 2]: Pity !
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 36]: it is more than a pity , it is a crime ; for to synopsize McClintock is to reduce a sky-flushing conflagration to dull embers , it is to reduce barbaric splendor to ragged poverty .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 33]: McClintock never wrote a line that was not precious ; he never wrote one that could be spared ; he never framed one from which a word could be removed without damage .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 23]: Every sentence that this master has produced may be likened to a perfect set of teeth , white , uniform , beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 10]: If you pull one , the charm is gone .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 26]: Still , it is now necessary to begin to pull , and to keep it up ; for lack of space requires us to synopsize .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 7]: We left Elfonzo standing there amazed .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 8]: At what , we do not know .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 7]: Not at the girl 's speech .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 90]: No ; we ourselves should have been amazed at it , of course , for none of us has ever heard anything resembling it ; but Elfonzo was used to speeches made up of noise and vacancy , and could listen to them with undaunted mind like the `` topmost topaz of an ancient tower '' ; he was used to making them himself ; he -- but let it go , it can not be guessed out ; we shall never know what it was that astonished him .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 12]: He stood there awhile ; then he said , `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 11]: am I now Grief 's disappointed son at last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 51]: He did not stop to examine his mind , and to try to find out what he probably meant by that , because , for one reason , `` a mixture of ambition and greatness of soul moved upon his young heart , '' and started him for the village .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 16]: He resumed his bench in school , `` and reasonably progressed in his education . ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 21]: His heart was heavy , but he went into society , and sought surcease of sorrow in its light distractions .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 36]: He made himself popular with his violin , `` which seemed to have a thousand chords -- more symphonious than the Muses of Apollo , and more enchanting than the ghost of the Hills . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 9]: This is obscure , but let it go .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 23]: During this interval Leos did some unencouraged courting , but at last , `` choked by his undertaking , '' he desisted .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 16]: Presently `` Elfonzo again wends his way to the stately walls and new-built village . ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 15]: He goes to the house of his beloved ; she opens the door herself .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 28]: To my surprise -- for Ambulinia 's heart had still seemed free at the time of their last interview -- love beamed from the girl 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 28]: One sees that Elfonzo was surprised , too ; for when he caught that light , `` a halloo of smothered shouts ran through every vein . ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 11]: A neat figure -- a very neat figure , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 5]: Then he kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 7]: `` The scene was overwhelming . ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 6]: They went into the parlor .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 18]: The girl said it was safe , for her parents were abed , and would never know .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 21]: Then we have this fine picture -- flung upon the canvas with hardly an effort , as you will notice .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 43]: Advancing toward him , she gave a bright display of her rosy neck , and from her head the ambrosial locks breathed divine fragrance ; her robe hung waving to his view , while she stood like a goddess confessed before him .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 11]: There is nothing of interest in the couple 's interview .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 39]: Now at this point the girl invites Elfonzo to a village show , where jealousy is the motive of the play , for she wants to teach him a wholesome lesson , if he is a jealous person .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 10]: But this is a sham , and pretty shallow .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 22]: McClintock merely wants a pretext to drag in a plagiarism of his upon a scene or two in `` Othello . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: The lovers went to the play .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 7]: Elfonzo was one of the fiddlers .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 27]: He and Ambulinia must not been seen together , lest trouble follow with the girl 's malignant father ; we are made to understand that clearly .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 16]: So the two sit together in the orchestra , in the midst of the musicians .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 9]: This does not seem to be good art .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 54]: In the first place , the girl would be in the way , for orchestras are always packed closely together , and there is no room to spare for people 's girls ; in the next place , one can not conceal a girl in an orchestra without everybody taking notice of it .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 17]: There can be no doubt , it seems to me , that this is bad art .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 4]: Leos is present .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 26]: Of course , one of the first things that catches his eye is the maddening spectacle of Ambulinia `` leaning upon Elfonzo 's chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 14]: This poor girl does not seem to understand even the rudiments of concealment .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 21]: But she is `` in her seventeenth , '' as the author phrases it , and that is her justification .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 17]: Leos meditates , constructs a plan -- with personal violence as a basis , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 7]: It was their way down there .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 13]: It is a good plain plan , without any imagination in it .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 59]: He will go out and stand at the front door , and when these two come out he will `` arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo , '' and thus make for himself a `` more prosperous field of immortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence , or ever pencil drew or artist imagined . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 22]: But , dear me , while he is waiting there the couple climb out at the back window and scurry home !
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 16]: This is romantic enough , but there is a lack of dignity in the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 17]: At this point McClintock puts in the whole of his curious play -- which we skip .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 5]: Some correspondence follows now .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 11]: The bitter father and the distressed lovers write the letters .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 4]: Elopements are attempted .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 9]: They are idiotically planned , and they fail .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 13]: Then we have several pages of romantic powwow and confusion dignifying nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 19]: Another elopement is planned ; it is to take place on Sunday , when everybody is at church .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 15]: But the `` hero '' can not keep the secret ; he tells everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 23]: Another author would have found another instrument when he decided to defeat this elopement ; but that is not McClintock 's way .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 10]: He uses the person that is nearest at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 7]: The evasion failed , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 14]: Ambulinia , in her flight , takes refuge in a neighbor 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 6]: Her father drags her home .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 9]: The villagers gather , attracted by the racket .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: Elfonzo was moved at this sight .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 64]: The people followed on to see what was going to become of Ambulinia , while he , with downcast looks , kept at a distance , until he saw them enter the abode of the father , thrusting her , that was the sigh of his soul , out of his presence into a solitary apartment , when she exclaimed , `` Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 2]: Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 4]: oh , Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 9]: where art thou , with all thy heroes ?
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 4]: haste , oh !
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 8]: haste , come thou to my relief .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 8]: Ride on the wings of the wind !
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 25]: Turn thy force loose like a tempest , and roll on thy army like a whirlwind , over this mountain of trouble and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 3]: Oh friends !
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 33]: if any pity me , let your last efforts throng upon the green hills , and come to the relief of Ambulinia , who is guilty of nothing but innocent love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 17]: Elfonzo called out with a loud voice , `` My God , can I stand this !
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 15]: arouse up , I beseech you , and put an end to this tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 22]: Come , my brave boys , '' said he , `` are you ready to go forth to your duty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 5]: They stood around him .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 14]: `` Who , '' said he , `` will call us to arms ?
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 7]: Where are my thunderbolts of war ?
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 11]: Speak ye , the first who will meet the foe !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 13]: Who will go forward with me in this ocean of grievous temptation ?
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 49]: If there is one who desires to go , let him come and shake hands upon the altar of devotion , and swear that he will be a hero ; yes , a Hector in a cause like this , which calls aloud for a speedy remedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 43]: `` Mine be the deed , '' said a young lawyer , `` and mine alone ; Venus alone shall quit her station before I will forsake one jot or tittle of my promise to you ; what is death to me ?
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 16]: what is all this warlike army , if it is not to win a victory ?
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 31]: I love the sleep of the lover and the mighty ; nor would I give it over till the blood of my enemies should wreak with that of my own .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 16]: But God forbid that our fame should soar on the blood of the slumberer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 35]: Mr. Valeer stands at his door with the frown of a demon upon his brow , with his dangerous weapon -LRB- 3 -RRB- ready to strike the first man who should enter his door .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 19]: `` Who will arise and go forward through blood and carnage to the rescue of my Ambulinia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 3]: said Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 19]: `` All , '' exclaimed the multitude ; and onward they went , with their implements of battle .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 21]: Others , of a more timid nature , stood among the distant hills to see the result of the contest .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 25]: It will hardly be believed that after all this thunder and lightning not a drop of rain fell ; but such is the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 48]: Elfonzo and his gang stood up and black-guarded Mr. Valeer with vigor all night , getting their outlay back with interest ; then in the early morning the army and its general retired from the field , leaving the victory with their solitary adversary and his crowbar .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 12]: This is the first time this has happened in romantic literature .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 5]: The invention is original .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 15]: Everything in this book is original ; there is nothing hackneyed about it anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 25]: Always , in other romances , when you find the author leading up to a climax , you know what is going to happen .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 30]: But in this book it is different ; the thing which seems inevitable and unavoidable never happens ; it is circumvented by the art of the author every time .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 5]: Another elopement was attempted .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 3]: It failed .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 8]: We have now arrived at the end .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 6]: But it is not exciting .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 10]: McClintock thinks it is ; but it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 15]: One day Elfonzo sent Ambulinia another note -- a note proposing elopement No. 16 .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 25]: This time the plan is admirable ; admirable , sagacious , ingenious , imaginative , deep -- oh , everything , and perfectly easy .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 10]: One wonders why it was never thought of before .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 5]: This is the scheme .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 66]: Ambulinia is to leave the breakfast-table , ostensibly to `` attend to the placing of those flowers , which should have been done a week ago '' -- artificial ones , of course ; the others would n't keep so long -- and then , instead of fixing the flowers , she is to walk out to the grove , and go off with Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 19]: The invention of this plan overstrained the author that is plain , for he straightway shows failing powers .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 11]: The details of the plan are not many or elaborate .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 59]: The author shall state them himself -- this good soul , whose intentions are always better than his English : `` You walk carelessly toward the academy grove , where you will find me with a lightning steed , elegantly equipped to bear you off where we shall be joined in wedlock with the first connubial rights . ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 73]: Last scene of all , which the author , now much enfeebled , tries to smarten up and make acceptable to his spectacular heart by introducing some new properties -- silver bow , golden harp , olive branch -- things that can all come good in an elopement , no doubt , yet are not to be compared to an umbrella for real handiness and reliability in an excursion of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 19]: And away she ran to the sacred grove , surrounded with glittering pearls , that indicated her coming .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 12]: Elfonzo hails her with his silver bow and his golden harp .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 15]: They meet -- Ambulinia 's countenance brightens -- Elfonzo leads up the winged steed .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 21]: `` Mount , '' said he , `` ye true-hearted , ye fearless soul -- the day is ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 36]: She sprang upon the back of the young thunderbolt , a brilliant star sparkles upon her head , with one hand she grasps the reins , and with the other she holds an olive branch .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 34]: `` Lend thy aid , ye strong winds , '' they exclaimed , `` ye moon , ye sun , and all ye fair host of heaven , witness the enemy conquered . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 13]: `` Hold , '' said Elfonzo , `` thy dashing steed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 18]: `` Ride on , '' said Ambulinia , `` the voice of thunder is behind us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 35]: And onward they went , with such rapidity that they very soon arrived at Rural Retreat , where they dismounted , and were united with all the solemnities that usually attended such divine operations .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 26]: There is but one Homer , there is but one Shakespeare , there is but one McClintock -- and his immortal book is before you .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 23]: Homer could not have written this book , Shakespeare could not have written it , I could not have done it myself .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 17]: There is nothing just like it in the literature of any country or of any epoch .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 8]: It stands alone ; it is monumental .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 16]: It adds G. Ragsdale McClintock 's to the sum of the republic 's imperishable names .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 16]: The name here given is a substitute for the one actually attached to the pamphlet .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 22]: Further on it will be seen that he is a country expert on the fiddle , and has a three-township fame .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 5]: It is a crowbar .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 31]: THE CURIOUS BOOK Complete -LRB- The foregoing review of the great work of G. Ragsdale McClintock is liberally illuminated with sample extracts , but these can not appease the appetite .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 11]: Only the complete book , unabridged , can do that .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 6]: Therefore it is here printed .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 40]: -- M.T. -RRB- THE ENEMY CONQUERED ; OR , LOVE TRIUMPHANT Sweet girl , thy smiles are full of charms , Thy voice is sweeter still , It fills the breast with fond alarms , Echoed by every rill .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 40]: I begin this little work with an eulogy upon woman , who has ever been distinguished for her perseverance , her constancy , and her devoted attention to those upon whom she has been pleased to place her AFFECTIONS .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 19]: Many have been the themes upon which writers and public speakers have dwelt with intense and increasing interest .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 27]: Among these delightful themes stands that of woman , the balm to all our sighs and disappointments , and the most pre-eminent of all other topics .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 29]: Here the poet and orator have stood and gazed with wonder and with admiration ; they have dwelt upon her innocence , the ornament of all her virtues .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 31]: First viewing her external charms , such as set forth in her form and benevolent countenance , and then passing to the deep hidden springs of loveliness and disinterested devotion .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 18]: In every clime , and in every age , she has been the pride of her NATION .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 29]: Her watchfulness is untiring ; she who guarded the sepulcher was the first to approach it , and the last to depart from its awful yet sublime scene .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 29]: Even here , in this highly favored land , we look to her for the security of our institutions , and for our future greatness as a nation .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 20]: But , strange as it may appear , woman 's charms and virtues are but slightly appreciated by thousands .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 53]: Those who should raise the standard of female worth , and paint her value with her virtues , in living colors , upon the banners that are fanned by the zephyrs of heaven , and hand them down to posterity as emblematical of a rich inheritance , do not properly estimate them .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 84]: Man is not sensible , at all times , of the nature and the emotions which bear that name ; he does not understand , he will not comprehend ; his intelligence has not expanded to that degree of glory which drinks in the vast revolution of humanity , its end , its mighty destination , and the causes which operated , and are still operating , to produce a more elevated station , and the objects which energize and enliven its consummation .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 80]: This he is a stranger to ; he is not aware that woman is the recipient of celestial love , and that man is dependent upon her to perfect his character ; that without her , philosophically and truly speaking , the brightest of his intelligence is but the coldness of a winter moon , whose beams can produce no fruit , whose solar light is not its own , but borrowed from the great dispenser of effulgent beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 36]: We have no disposition in the world to flatter the fair sex , we would raise them above those dastardly principles which only exist in little souls , contracted hearts , and a distracted brain .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 30]: Often does she unfold herself in all her fascinating loveliness , presenting the most captivating charms ; yet we find man frequently treats such purity of purpose with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 6]: Why does he do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 15]: Why does he baffle that which is inevitably the source of his better days ?
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 26]: Is he so much of a stranger to those excellent qualities as not to appreciate woman , as not to have respect to her dignity ?
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 30]: Since her art and beauty first captivated man , she has been his delight and his comfort ; she has shared alike in his misfortunes and in his prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 20]: Whenever the billows of adversity and the tumultuous waves of trouble beat high , her smiles subdue their fury .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 35]: Should the tear of sorrow and the mournful sigh of grief interrupt the peace of his mind , her voice removes them all , and she bends from her circle to encourage him onward .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 31]: When darkness would obscure his mind , and a thick cloud of gloom would bewilder its operations , her intelligent eye darts a ray of streaming light into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 37]: Mighty and charming is that disinterested devotion which she is ever ready to exercise toward man , not waiting till the last moment of his danger , but seeks to relieve him in his early afflictions .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 43]: It gushes forth from the expansive fullness of a tender and devoted heart , where the noblest , the purest , and the most elevated and refined feelings are matured and developed in those may kind offices which invariably make her character .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 63]: In the room of sorrow and sickness , this unequaled characteristic may always been seen , in the performance of the most charitable acts ; nothing that she can do to promote the happiness of him who she claims to be her protector will be omitted ; all is invigorated by the animating sunbeams which awaken the heart to songs of gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 22]: Leaving this point , to notice another prominent consideration , which is generally one of great moment and of vital importance .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 13]: Invariably she is firm and steady in all her pursuits and aims .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 40]: There is required a combination of forces and extreme opposition to drive her from her position ; she takes her stand , not to be moved by the sound of Apollo 's lyre or the curved bow of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 39]: Firm and true to what she undertakes , and that which she requires by her own aggrandizement , and regards as being within the strict rules of propriety , she will remain stable and unflinching to the last .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 19]: A more genuine principle is not to be found in the most determined , resolute heart of man .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 36]: For this she deserves to be held in the highest commendation , for this she deserves the purest of all other blessings , and for this she deserves the most laudable reward of all others .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 14]: It is a noble characteristic and is worthy of imitation of any age .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 30]: And when we look at it in one particular aspect , it is still magnified , and grows brighter and brighter the more we reflect upon its eternal duration .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 22]: What will she not do , when her word as well as her affections and LOVE are pledged to her lover ?
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 93]: Everything that is dear to her on earth , all the hospitalities of kind and loving parents , all the sincerity and loveliness of sisters , and the benevolent devotion of brothers , who have surrounded her with every comfort ; she will forsake them all , quit the harmony and sweet sound of the lute and the harp , and throw herself upon the affections of some devoted admirer , in whom she fondly hopes to find more than she has left behind , which is not often realized by many .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 6]: Truth and virtue all combined !
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 7]: How deserving our admiration and love !
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 80]: Ah cruel would it be in man , after she has thus manifested such an unshaken confidence in him , and said by her determination to abandon all the endearments and blandishments of home , to act a villainous part , and prove a traitor in the revolution of his mission , and then turn Hector over the innocent victim whom he swore to protect , in the presence of Heaven , recorded by the pen of an angel .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 48]: Striking as this train may unfold itself in her character , and as pre-eminent as it may stand among the fair display of her other qualities , yet there is another , which struggles into existence , and adds an additional luster to what she already possesses .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 27]: I mean that disposition in woman which enables her , in sorrow , in grief , and in distress , to bear all with enduring patience .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 21]: This she has done , and can and will do , amid the din of war and clash of arms .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 34]: Scenes and occurrences which , to every appearance , are calculated to rend the heart with the profoundest emotions of trouble , do not fetter that exalted principle imbued in her very nature .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 63]: It is true , her tender and feeling heart may often be moved -LRB- as she is thus constituted -RRB- , but she is not conquered , she has not given up to the harlequin of disappointments , her energies have not become clouded in the last movement of misfortune , but she is continually invigorated by the archetype of her affections .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 111]: She may bury her face in her hands , and let the tear of anguish roll , she may promenade the delightful walks of some garden , decorated with all the flowers of nature , or she may steal out along some gently rippling stream , and there , as the silver waters uninterruptedly move forward , shed her silent tears ; they mingle with the waves , and take a last farewell of their agitated home , to seek a peaceful dwelling among the rolling floods ; yet there is a voice rushing from her breast , that proclaims VICTORY along the whole line and battlement of her affections .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 48]: That voice is the voice of patience and resignation ; that voice is one that bears everything calmly and dispassionately , amid the most distressing scenes ; when the fates are arrayed against her peace , and apparently plotting for her destruction , still she is resigned .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 16]: Woman 's affections are deep , consequently her troubles may be made to sink deep .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 57]: Although you may not be able to mark the traces of her grief and the furrowings of her anguish upon her winning countenance , yet be assured they are nevertheless preying upon her inward person , sapping the very foundation of that heart which alone was made for the weal and not the woe of man .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 12]: The deep recesses of the soul are fields for their operation .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 81]: But they are not destined simply to take the regions of the heart for their dominion , they are not satisfied merely with interrupting her better feelings ; but after a while you may see the blooming cheek beginning to droop and fade , her intelligent eye no longer sparkles with the starry light of heaven , her vibrating pulse long since changed its regular motion , and her palpitating bosom beats once more for the midday of her glory .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 17]: Anxiety and care ultimately throw her into the arms of the haggard and grim monster death .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 12]: But , oh , how patient , under every pining influence !
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 33]: Let us view the matter in bolder colors ; see her when the dearest object of her affections recklessly seeks every bacchanalian pleasure , contents himself with the last rubbish of creation .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 8]: With what solicitude she awaits his return !
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 21]: Sleep fails to perform its office -- she weeps while the nocturnal shades of the night triumph in the stillness .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 24]: Bending over some favorite book , whilst the author throws before her mind the most beautiful imagery , she startles at every sound .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 16]: The midnight silence is broken by the solemn announcement of the return of another morning .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 27]: He is still absent ; she listens for that voice which has so often been greeted by the melodies of her own ; but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 11]: stern silence is all that she receives for her vigilance .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 11]: Mark her unwearied watchfulness , as the night passes away .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 26]: At last , brutalized by the accursed thing , he staggers along with rage , and , shivering with cold , he makes his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 9]: Not a murmur is heard from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 28]: On the contrary , she meets him with a smile -- she caresses him with tender arms , with all the gentleness and softness of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: Here , then , is seen her disposition , beautifully arrayed .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 25]: Woman , thou art more to be admired than the spicy gales of Arabia , and more sought for than the gold of Golconda .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 23]: We believe that Woman should associate freely with man , and we believe that it is for the preservation of her rights .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 20]: She should become acquainted with the metaphysical designs of those who condescended to sing the siren song of flattery .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 23]: This , we think , should be according to the unwritten law of decorum , which is stamped upon every innocent heart .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 21]: The precepts of prudery are often steeped in the guilt of contamination , which blasts the expectations of better moments .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 46]: Truth , and beautiful dreams -- loveliness , and delicacy of character , with cherished affections of the ideal woman -- gentle hopes and aspirations , are enough to uphold her in the storms of darkness , without the transferred colorings of a stained sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 21]: How often have we seen it in our public prints , that woman occupies a false station in the world !
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 15]: and some have gone so far as to say it was an unnatural one .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 79]: So long has she been regarded a weak creature , by the rabble and illiterate -- they have looked upon her as an insufficient actress on the great stage of human life -- a mere puppet , to fill up the drama of human existence -- a thoughtless , inactive being -- that she has too often come to the same conclusion herself , and has sometimes forgotten her high destination , in the meridian of her glory .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 58]: We have but little sympathy or patience for those who treat her as a mere Rosy Melindi -- who are always fishing for pretty complements -- who are satisfied by the gossamer of Romance , and who can be allured by the verbosity of high-flown words , rich in language , but poor and barren in sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 65]: Beset , as she has been , by the intellectual vulgar , the selfish , the designing , the cunning , the hidden , and the artful -- no wonder she has sometimes folded her wings in despair , and forgotten her HEAVENLY mission in the delirium of imagination ; no wonder she searches out some wild desert , to find a peaceful home .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 7]: But this can not always continue .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 58]: A new era is moving gently onward , old things are rapidly passing away ; old superstitions , old prejudices , and old notions are now bidding farewell to their old associates and companions , and giving way to one whose wings are plumed with the light of heaven and tinged by the dews of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 86]: There is a remnant of blessedness that clings to her in spite of all evil influence , there is enough of the Divine Master left to accomplish the noblest work ever achieved under the canopy of the vaulted skies ; and that time is fast approaching , when the picture of the true woman will shine from its frame of glory , to captivate , to win back , to restore , and to call into being once more , THE OBJECT OF HER MISSION .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 5]: Star of the brave !
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 19]: thy glory shed , O'er all the earth , thy army led -- Bold meteor of immortal birth !
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 9]: Why come from Heaven to dwell on Earth ?
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 45]: Mighty and glorious are the days of youth ; happy the moments of the LOVER , mingled with smiles and tears of his devoted , and long to be remembered are the achievements which he gains with a palpitating heart and a trembling hand .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 38]: A bright and lovely dawn , the harbinger of a fair and prosperous day , had arisen over the beautiful little village of Cumming , which is surrounded by the most romantic scenery in the Cherokee country .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 53]: Brightening clouds seemed to rise from the mist of the fair Chattahoochee , to spread their beauty over the the thick forest , to guide the hero whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the enemy that would tarnish his name , and to win back the admiration of his long-tried friend .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 32]: He endeavored to make his way through Sawney 's Mountain , where many meet to catch the gales that are continually blowing for the refreshment of the stranger and the traveler .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 19]: Surrounded as he was by hills on every side , naked rocks dared the efforts of his energies .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 32]: Soon the sky became overcast , the sun buried itself in the clouds , and the fair day gave place to gloomy twilight , which lay heavily on the Indian Plains .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 17]: He remembered an old Indian Castle , that once stood at the foot of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 20]: He thought if he could make his way to this , he would rest contented for a short time .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 20]: The mountain air breathed fragrance -- a rosy tinge rested on the glassy waters that murmured at its base .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 45]: His resolution soon brought him to the remains of the red man 's hut : he surveyed with wonder and astonishment the decayed building , which time had buried in the dust , and thought to himself , his happiness was not yet complete .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 42]: Beside the shore of the brook sat a young man , about eighteen or twenty , who seemed to be reading some favorite book , and who had a remarkably noble countenance -- eyes which betrayed more than a common mind .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 24]: This of course made the youth a welcome guest , and gained him friends in whatever condition of life he might be placed .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 19]: The traveler observed that he was a well-built figure , which showed strength and grace in every movement .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 20]: He accordingly addressed him in quite a gentlemanly manner , and inquired of him the way to the village .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 52]: After he had received the desired information , and was about taking his leave , the youth said , `` Are you not Major Elfonzo , the great musician -- the champion of a noble cause -- the modern Achilles , who gained so many victories in the Florida War ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 70]: `` I bear that name , '' said the Major , `` and those titles , trusting at the same time that the ministers of grace will carry me triumphantly through all my laudable undertakings , and if , '' continued the Major , `` you , sir , are the patronizer of noble deeds , I should like to make you my confidant and learn your address . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 23]: The youth looked somewhat amazed , bowed low , mused for a moment , and began : `` My name is Roswell .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 84]: I have been recently admitted to the bar , and can only give a faint outline of my future success in that honorable profession ; but I trust , sir , like the Eagle , I shall look down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man , and shall ever be ready to give you any assistance in my official capacity , and whatever this muscular arm of mine can do , whenever it shall be called from its buried GREATNESS . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 14]: The Major grasped him by the hand , and exclaimed : `` O !
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 36]: thou exalted spirit of inspiration -- thou flame of burning prosperity , may the Heaven-directed blaze be the glare of thy soul , and battle down every rampart that seems to impede your progress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 11]: The road which led to the town presented many attractions .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 25]: Elfonzo had bid farewell to the youth of deep feeling , and was not wending his way to the dreaming spot of his fondness .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 25]: The south winds whistled through the woods , as the waters dashed against the banks , as rapid fire in the pent furnace roars .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 35]: This brought him to remember while alone , that he quietly left behind the hospitality of a father 's house , and gladly entered the world , with higher hopes than are often realized .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 34]: But as he journeyed onward , he was mindful of the advice of his father , who had often looked sadly on the ground when tears of cruelly deceived hope moistened his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 51]: Elfonzo had been somewhat of a dutiful son ; yet fond of the amusements of life -- had been in distant lands -- had enjoyed the pleasure of the world and had frequently returned to the scenes of his boyhood , almost destitute of many of the comforts of life .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 35]: In this condition , he would frequently say to his father , `` Have I offended you , that you look upon me as a stranger , and frown upon me with stinging looks ?
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 12]: Will you not favor me with the sound of your voice ?
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 66]: If I have trampled upon your veneration , or have spread a humid veil of darkness around your expectations , send me back into the world where no heart beats for me -- where the foot of man has never yet trod ; but give me at least one kind word -- allow me to come into the presence sometimes of thy winter-worn locks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 51]: `` Forbid it , Heaven , that I should be angry with thee , '' answered the father , `` my son , and yet I send thee back to the children of the world -- to the cold charity of the combat , and to a land of victory .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 26]: I read another destiny in thy countenance -- I learn thy inclinations from the flame that has already kindled in my soul a stranger sensation .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 43]: It will seek thee , my dear ELFONZO , it will find thee -- thou canst not escape that lighted torch , which shall blot out from the remembrance of men a long train of prophecies which they have foretold against thee .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 6]: I once thought not so .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 102]: Once , I was blind ; but now the path of life is plain before me , and my sight is clear ; yet Elfonzo , return to thy worldly occupation -- take again in thy hand that chord of sweet sounds -- struggle with the civilized world , and with your own heart ; fly swiftly to the enchanted ground -- let the night-OWL send forth its screams from the stubborn oak -- let the sea sport upon the beach , and the stars sing together ; but learn of these , Elfonzo , thy doom , and thy hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 29]: Our most innocent as well as our most lawful DESIRES must often be denied us , that we may learn to sacrifice them to a Higher will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 22]: Remembering such admonitions with gratitude , Elfonzo was immediately urged by the recollection of his father 's family to keep moving .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 41]: His steps became quicker and quicker -- he hastened through the PINY woods , dark as the forest was , and with joy he very soon reached the little village or repose , in whose bosom rested the boldest chivalry .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 44]: His close attention to every important object -- his modest questions about whatever was new to him -- his reverence for wise old age , and his ardent desire to learn many of the fine arts , soon brought him into respectable notice .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 64]: One mild winter day as he walked along the streets toward the Academy , which stood upon a small eminence , surrounded by native growth -- some venerable in its appearance , others young and prosperous -- all seemed inviting , and seemed to be the very place for learning as well as for genius to spend its research beneath its spreading shades .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 13]: He entered its classic walls in the usual mode of southern manners .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 20]: The principal of the Institution begged him to be seated and listen to the recitations that were going on .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 13]: He accordingly obeyed the request , and seemed to be much pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 59]: After the school was dismissed , and the young hearts regained their freedom , with the songs of the evening , laughing at the anticipated pleasures of a happy home , while others tittered at the actions of the past day , he addressed the teacher in a tone that indicated a resolution -- with an undaunted mind .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 18]: He said he had determined to become a student , if he could meet with his approbation .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 17]: `` Sir , '' said he , `` I have spent much time in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 10]: I have traveled among the uncivilized inhabitants of America .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 28]: I have met with friends , and combated with foes ; but none of these gratify my ambition , or decide what is to be my destiny .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 16]: I see the learned would have an influence with the voice of the people themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 18]: The despoilers of the remotest kingdoms of the earth refer their differences to this class of persons .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 59]: This the illiterate and inexperienced little dream of ; and now if you will receive me as I am , with these deficiencies -- with all my misguided opinions , I will give you my honor , sir , that I will never disgrace the Institution , or those who have placed you in this honorable station . ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 30]: The instructor , who had met with many disappointments , knew how to feel for a stranger who had been thus turned upon the charities of an unfeeling community .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 28]: He looked at him earnestly , and said : `` Be of good cheer -- look forward , sir , to the high destination you may attain .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 27]: Remember , the more elevated the mark at which you aim , the more sure , the more glorious , the more magnificent the prize . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 12]: From wonder to wonder , his encouragement led the impatient listener .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 22]: A stranger nature bloomed before him -- giant streams promised him success -- gardens of hidden treasures opened to his view .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 18]: All this , so vividly described , seemed to gain a new witchery from his glowing fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 18]: In 1842 he entered the class , and made rapid progress in the English and Latin departments .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 43]: Indeed , he continued advancing with such rapidity that he was like to become the first in his class , and made such unexpected progress , and was so studious , that he had almost forgotten the pictured saint of his affections .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 40]: The fresh wreaths of the pine and cypress had waited anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heavens upon the heads of those who had so often poured forth the tender emotions of their souls under its boughs .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 12]: He was aware of the pleasure that he had seen there .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 24]: So one evening , as he was returning from his reading , he concluded he would pay a visit to this enchanting spot .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 23]: Little did he think of witnessing a shadow of his former happiness , though no doubt he wished it might be so .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 12]: He continued sauntering by the roadside , meditating on the past .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 13]: The nearer he approached the spot , the more anxious he became .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 56]: At the moment a tall female figure flitted across his path , with a bunch of roses in her hand ; her countenance showed uncommon vivacity , with a resolute spirit ; her ivory teeth already appeared as she smiled beautifully , promenading -- while her ringlets of hair dangled unconsciously around her snowy neck .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 8]: Nothing was wanting to complete her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 25]: The tinge of the rose was in full bloom upon her cheek ; the charms of sensibility and tenderness were always her associates . .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 20]: In Ambulinia 's bosom dwelt a noble soul -- one that never faded -- one that never was conquered .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 39]: Her heart yielded to no feeling but the love of Elfonzo , on whom she gazed with intense delight , and to whom she felt herself more closely bound , because he sought the hand of no other .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 8]: Elfonzo was roused from his apparent reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 22]: His books no longer were his inseparable companions -- his thoughts arrayed themselves to encourage him in the field of victory .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 17]: He endeavored to speak to his supposed Ambulinia , but his speech appeared not in words .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 27]: No , his effort was a stream of fire , that kindled his soul into a flame of admiration , and carried his senses away captive .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 13]: Ambulinia had disappeared , to make him more mindful of his duty .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 16]: As she walked speedily away through the piny woods she calmly echoed : `` O !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 10]: Elfonzo , thou wilt now look from thy sunbeams .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 26]: Thou shalt now walk in a new path -- perhaps thy way leads through darkness ; but fear not , the stars foretell happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 51]: Not many days afterward , as surrounded by fragrant flowers she sat one evening at twilight , to enjoy the cool breeze that whispered notes of melody along the distant groves , the little birds perched on every side , as if to watch the movements of their new visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 53]: The bells were tolling when Elfonzo silently stole along by the wild wood flowers , holding in his hand his favorite instrument of music -- his eye continually searching for Ambulinia , who hardly seemed to perceive him , as she played carelessly with the songsters that hopped from branch to branch .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 12]: Nothing could be more striking than the difference between the two .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 21]: Nature seemed to have given the more tender soul to Elfonzo , and the stronger and more courageous to Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 41]: A deep feeling spoke from the eyes of Elfonzo -- such a feeling as can only be expressed by those who are blessed as admirers , and by those who are able to return the same with sincerity of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 18]: He was a few years older than Ambulinia : she had turned a little into her seventeenth .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 21]: He had almost grown up in the Cherokee country , with the same equal proportions as one of the natives .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 38]: But little intimacy had existed between them until the year forty-one -- because the youth felt that the character of such a lovely girl was too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of quiet reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 58]: But as lovers will not always be insulted , at all times and under all circumstances , by the frowns and cold looks of crabbed old age , which should continually reflect dignity upon those around , and treat unfortunate as well as the fortunate with a graceful mien , he continued to use diligence and perseverance .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 51]: All this lighted a spark in his heart that changed his whole character , and like the unyielding Deity that follows the storm to check its rage in the forest , he resolves for the first time to shake off his embarrassment and return where he had before only worshiped .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 37]: It could not escape Ambulinia 's penetrating eye that he sought an interview with her , which she as anxiously avoided , and assumed a more distant calmness than before , seemingly to destroy all hope .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 34]: After many efforts and struggles with his own person , with timid steps the Major approached the damsel , with the same caution as he would have done in a field of battle .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 20]: `` Lady Ambulinia , '' said he , trembling , `` I have long desired a moment like this .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 7]: I dare not let it escape .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 17]: I fear the consequences ; yet I hope your indulgence will at least hear my petition .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 17]: Can you not anticipate what I would say , and what I am about to express ?
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 74]: Will not you , like Minerva , who sprung from the brain of Jupiter , release me from thy winding chains or cure me -- '' `` Say no more , Elfonzo , '' answered Ambulinia , with a serious look , raising her hand as if she intended to swear eternal hatred against the whole world ; `` another lady in my place would have perhaps answered your question in bitter coldness .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 10]: I know not the little arts of my sex .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 49]: I care but little for the vanity of those who would chide me , and am unwilling as well as shamed to be guilty of anything that would lead you to think ` all is not gold that glitters ' ; so be not rash in your resolution .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 16]: It is better to repent now than to do it in a more solemn hour .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: Yes , I know what you would say .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 20]: I know you have a costly gift for me -- the noblest that man can make -- YOUR HEART !
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 10]: you should not offer it to one so unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 41]: Heaven , you know , has allowed my father 's house to be made a house of solitude , a home of silent obedience , which my parents say is more to be admired than big names and high-sounding titles .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 30]: Notwithstanding all this , let me speak the emotions of an honest heart ; allow me to say in the fullness of my hopes that I anticipate better days .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 61]: The bird may stretch its wings toward the sun , which it can never reach ; and flowers of the field appear to ascend in the same direction , because they can not do otherwise ; but man confides his complaints to the saints in whom he believes ; for in their abodes of light they know no more sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 21]: From your confession and indicative looks , I must be that person ; if so , deceive not yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 15]: Elfonzo replied , `` Pardon me , my dear madam , for my frankness .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 41]: I have loved you from my earliest days ; everything grand and beautiful hath borne the image of Ambulinia ; while precipices on every hand surrounded me , your GUARDIAN ANGEL stood and beckoned me away from the deep abyss .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 48]: In every trial , in every misfortune , I have met with your helping hand ; yet I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love till a voice impaired with age encouraged the cause , and declared they who acquired thy favor should win a victory .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: I saw how Leos worshipped thee .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 6]: I felt my own unworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 32]: I began to KNOW JEALOUSY -- a strong guest , indeed , in my bosom -- yet I could see if I gained your admiration Leos was to be my rival .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 80]: I was aware that he had the influence of your parents , and the wealth of a deceased relative , which is too often mistaken for permanent and regular tranquillity ; yet I have determined by your permission to beg an interest in your prayers -- to ask you to animate my dropping spirits by your smiles and your winning looks ; for if you but speak I shall be conqueror , my enemies shall stagger like Olympus shakes .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 45]: And though earth and sea may tremble , and the charioteer of the sun may forget his dashing steed , yet I am assured that it is only to arm me with divine weapons which will enable me to complete my long-tried intention . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 53]: `` Return to your self , Elfonzo , '' said Ambulinia , pleasantly ; `` a dream of vision has disturbed your intellect ; you are above the atmosphere , dwelling in the celestial regions ; nothing is there that urges or hinders , nothing that brings discord into our present litigation .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 18]: I entreat you to condescend a little , and be a man , and forget it all .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 31]: When Homer describes the battle of the gods and noble men fighting with giants and dragons , they represent under this image our struggles with the delusions of our passions .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 31]: You have exalted me , an unhappy girl , to the skies ; you have called me a saint , and portrayed in your imagination an angel in human form .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 34]: Let her remain such to you , let her continue to be as you have supposed , and be assured that she will consider a share in your esteem as her highest treasure .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 35]: Think not that I would allure you from the path in which your conscience leads you ; for you know I respect the conscience of others , as I would die for my own .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 19]: Elfonzo , if I am worthy of thy love , let such conversation never again pass between us .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 7]: Go , seek a nobler theme !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 18]: we will seek it in the stream of time as the sun set in the Tigris . ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 34]: As she spake these words she grasped the hand of Elfonzo , saying at the same time , `` Peace and prosperity attend you , my hero : be up and doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 18]: Closing her remarks with this expression , she walked slowly away , leaving Elfonzo astonished and amazed .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: He ventured not to follow or detain her .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 19]: Here he stood alone , gazing at the stars ; confounded as he was , here he stood .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 9]: The rippling stream rolled on at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 33]: Twilight had already begun to draw her sable mantle over the earth , and now and then the fiery smoke would ascend from the little town which lay spread out before him .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 20]: The citizens seemed to be full of life and good-humor ; but poor Elfonzo saw not a brilliant scene .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 21]: No ; his future life stood before him , stripped of the hopes that once adorned all his sanguine desires .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 15]: said he , `` am I now Grief 's disappointed son at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 8]: Ambulinia 's image rose before his fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 39]: A mixture of ambition and greatness of soul moved upon his young heart , and encouraged him to bear all his crosses with the patience of a Job , notwithstanding he had to encounter with so many obstacles .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 15]: He still endeavored to prosecute his studies , and reasonable progressed in his education .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 20]: Still , he was not content ; there was something yet to be done before his happiness was complete .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 8]: He would visit his friends and acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 21]: They would invite him to social parties , insisting that he should partake of the amusements that were going on .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 6]: This he enjoyed tolerably well .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 45]: The ladies and gentlemen were generally well pleased with the Major ; as he delighted all with his violin , which seemed to have a thousand chords -- more symphonious than the Muses of Apollo and more enchanting than the ghost of the Hills .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 8]: He passed some days in the country .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 25]: During that time Leos had made many calls upon Ambulinia , who was generally received with a great deal of courtesy by the family .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 50]: They thought him to be a young man worthy of attention , though he had but little in his soul to attract the attention or even win the affections of her whose graceful manners had almost made him a slave to every bewitching look that fell from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 70]: Leos made several attempts to tell her of his fair prospects -- how much he loved her , and how much it would add to his bliss if he could but think she would be willing to share these blessings with him ; but , choked by his undertaking , he made himself more like an inactive drone than he did like one who bowed at beauty 's shrine .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 13]: Elfonzo again wends his way to the stately walls and new-built village .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 17]: He now determines to see the end of the prophesy which had been foretold to him .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 35]: The clouds burst from his sight ; he believes if he can but see his Ambulinia , he can open to her view the bloody altars that have been misrepresented to stigmatize his name .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 27]: He knows that her breast is transfixed with the sword of reason , and ready at all times to detect the hidden villainy of her enemies .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 26]: He resolves to see her in her own home , with the consoling theme : '' ' I can but perish if I go . '
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 29]: Let the consequences be what they may , '' said he , `` if I die , it shall be contending and struggling for my own rights . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 11]: Night had almost overtaken him when he arrived in town .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 27]: Colonel Elder , a noble-hearted , high-minded , and independent man , met him at his door as usual , and seized him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 22]: `` Well , Elfonzo , '' said the Colonel , `` how does the world use you in your efforts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 27]: `` I have no objection to the world , '' said Elfonzo , `` but the people are rather singular in some of their opinions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 74]: `` Aye , well , '' said the Colonel , `` you must remember that creation is made up of many mysteries ; just take things by the right handle ; be always sure you know which is the smooth side before you attempt your polish ; be reconciled to your fate , be it what it may ; and never find fault with your condition , unless your complaining will benefit it .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 17]: Perseverance is a principle that should be commendable in those who have judgment to govern it .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 51]: I should never had been so successful in my hunting excursions had I waited till the deer , by some magic dream , had been drawn to the muzzle of the gun before I made an attempt to fire at the game that dared my boldness in the wild forest .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 44]: The great mystery in hunting seems to be -- a good marksman , a resolute mind , a fixed determination , and my world for it , you will never return home without sounding your horn with the breath of a new victory .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 7]: And so with every other undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 40]: Be confident that your ammunition is of the right kind -- always pull your trigger with a steady hand , and so soon as you perceive a calm , touch her off , and the spoils are yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 23]: This filled him with redoubled vigor , and he set out with a stronger anxiety than ever to the home of Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 16]: A few short steps soon brought him to the door , half out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 4]: He rapped gently .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 56]: Ambulinia , who sat in the parlor alone , suspecting Elfonzo was near , ventured to the door , opened it , and beheld the hero , who stood in an humble attitude , bowed gracefully , and as they caught each other 's looks the light of peace beamed from the eyes of Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 30]: Elfonzo caught the expression ; a halloo of smothered shouts ran through every vein , and for the first time he dared to impress a kiss upon her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 39]: The scene was overwhelming ; had the temptation been less animating , he would not have ventured to have acted so contrary to the desired wish of his Ambulinia ; but who could have withstood the irrestistable temptation !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 24]: What society condemns the practice but a cold , heartless , uncivilized people that know nothing of the warm attachments of refined society ?
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 16]: Here the dead was raised to his long-cherished hopes , and the lost was found .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 53]: Here all doubt and danger were buried in the vortex of oblivion ; sectional differences no longer disunited their opinions ; like the freed bird from the cage , sportive claps its rustling wings , wheels about to heaven in a joyful strain , and raises its notes to the upper sky .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 35]: Ambulinia insisted upon Elfonzo to be seated , and give her a history of his unnecessary absence ; assuring him the family had retired , consequently they would ever remain ignorant of his visit .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 43]: Advancing toward him , she gave a bright display of her rosy neck , and from her head the ambrosial locks breathed divine fragrance ; her robe hung waving to his view , while she stood like a goddess confessed before him .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 24]: `` It does seem to me , my dear sir , '' said Ambulinia , `` that you have been gone an age .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 19]: Oh , the restless hours I have spent since I last saw you , in yon beautiful grove .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 19]: There is where I trifled with your feelings for the express purpose of trying your attachment for me .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 10]: I now find you are devoted ; but ah !
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 12]: I trust you live not unguarded by the powers of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 41]: Though oft did I refuse to join my hand with thine , and as oft did I cruelly mock thy entreaties with borrowed shapes : yes , I feared to answer thee by terms , in words sincere and undissembled .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 46]: could I pursue , and you have leisure to hear the annals of my woes , the evening star would shut Heaven 's gates upon the impending day before my tale would be finished , and this night would find me soliciting your forgiveness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 12]: `` Dismiss thy fears and thy doubts , '' replied Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 5]: `` Look , O !
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 34]: look : that angelic look of thine -- bathe not thy visage in tears ; banish those floods that are gathering ; let my confession and my presence bring thee some relief . ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 38]: `` Then , indeed , I will be cheerful , '' said Ambulinia , `` and I think if we will go to the exhibition this evening , we certainly will see something worthy of our attention .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 28]: One of the most tragical scenes is to be acted that has ever been witnessed , and one that every jealous-hearted person should learn a lesson from .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 30]: It can not fail to have a good effect , as it will be performed by those who are young and vigorous , and learned as well as enticing .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 24]: You are aware , Major Elfonzo , who are to appear on the stage , and what the characters are to represent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 49]: `` I am acquainted with the circumstances , '' replied Elfonzo , `` and as I am to be one of the musicians upon that interesting occasion , I should be much gratified if you would favor me with your company during the hours of the exercises . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 10]: `` What strange notions are in your mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 3]: inquired Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 62]: `` Now I know you have something in view , and I desire you to tell me why it is that you are so anxious that I should continue with you while the exercises are going on ; though if you think I can add to your happiness and predilections , I have no particular objection to acquiesce in your request .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 14]: Oh , I think I foresee , now , what you anticipate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 18]: `` And will you have the goodness to tell me what you think it will be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 3]: inquired Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 33]: `` By all means , '' answered Ambulinia ; `` a rival , sir , you would fancy in your own mind ; but let me say for you , fear not !
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 3]: fear not !
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 38]: I will be one of the last persons to disgrace my sex by thus encouraging every one who may feel disposed to visit me , who may honor me with their graceful bows and their choicest compliments .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 29]: It is true that young men too often mistake civil politeness for the finer emotions of the heart , which is tantamount to courtship ; but , ah !
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 30]: how often are they deceived , when they come to test the weight of sunbeams with those on whose strength hangs the future happiness of an untried life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 55]: The people were now rushing to the Academy with impatient anxiety ; the band of music was closely followed by the students ; then the parents and guardians ; nothing interrupted the glow of spirits which ran through every bosom , tinged with the songs of a Virgil and the tide of a Homer .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 39]: Elfonzo and Ambulinia soon repaired to the scene , and fortunately for them both the house was so crowded that they took their seats together in the music department , which was not in view of the auditory .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 19]: This fortuitous circumstances added more the bliss of the Major than a thousand such exhibitions would have done .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 47]: He forgot that he was man ; music had lost its charms for him ; whenever he attempted to carry his part , the string of the instrument would break , the bow became stubborn , and refused to obey the loud calls of the audience .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 37]: Here , he said , was the paradise of his home , the long-sought-for opportunity ; he felt as though he could send a million supplications to the throne of Heaven for such an exalted privilege .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 38]: Poor Leos , who was somewhere in the crowd , looking as attentively as if he was searching for a needle in a haystack ; here is stood , wondering to himself why Ambulinia was not there .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 6]: `` Where can she be ?
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 13]: if she was only here , how I could relish the scene !
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 13]: Elfonzo is certainly not in town ; but what if he is ?
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 66]: I have got the wealth , if I have not the dignity , and I am sure that the squire and his lady have always been particular friends of mine , and I think with this assurance I shall be able to get upon the blind side of the rest of the family and make the heaven-born Ambulinia the mistress of all I possess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 22]: Then , again , he would drop his head , as if attempting to solve the most difficult problem in Euclid .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 29]: While he was thus conjecturing in his own mind , a very interesting part of the exhibition was going on , which called the attention of all present .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 30]: The curtains of the stage waved continually by the repelled forces that were given to them , which caused Leos to behold Ambulinia leaning upon the chair of Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 91]: Her lofty beauty , seen by the glimmering of the chandelier , filled his heart with rapture , he knew not how to contain himself ; to go where they were would expose him to ridicule ; to continue where he was , with such an object before him , without being allowed an explanation in that trying hour , would be to the great injury of his mental as well as of his physical powers ; and , in the name of high heaven , what must he do ?
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 67]: Finally , he resolved to contain himself as well as he conveniently could , until the scene was over , and then he would plant himself at the door , to arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo , and thus make for himself a more prosperous field of immortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence , or ever pencil drew or artist imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 73]: Accordingly he made himself sentinel , immediately after the performance of the evening -- retained his position apparently in defiance of all the world ; he waited , he gazed at every lady , his whole frame trembled ; here he stood , until everything like human shape had disappeared from the institution , and he had done nothing ; he had failed to accomplish that which he so eagerly sought for .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 5]: Poor , unfortunate creature !
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 59]: he had not the eyes of an Argus , or he might have seen his Juno and Elfonzo , assisted by his friend Sigma , make their escape from the window , and , with the rapidity of a race-horse , hurry through the blast of the storm to the residence of her father , without being recognized .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 49]: He did not tarry long , but assured Ambulinia the endless chain of their existence was more closely connected than ever , since he had seen the virtuous , innocent , imploring , and the constant Amelia murdered by the jealous-hearted Farcillo , the accursed of the land .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 52]: The following is the tragical scene , which is only introduced to show the subject-matter that enabled Elfonzo to come to such a determinate resolution that nothing of the kind should ever dispossess him of his true character , should he be so fortunate as to succeed in his present undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 25]: Amelia was the wife of Farcillo , and a virtuous woman ; Gracia , a young lady , was her particular friend and confidant .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 20]: Farcillo grew jealous of Amelia , murders her , finds out that he was deceived , AND STABS HIMSELF .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 8]: Amelia appears alone , talking to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 16]: A. Hail , ye solitary ruins of antiquity , ye sacred tombs and silent walks !
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 25]: it is your aid I invoke ; it is to you , my soul , wrapt in deep mediating , pours forth its prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 17]: Here I wander upon the stage of mortality , since the world hath turned against me .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 11]: Those whom I believed to be my friends , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 24]: are now my enemies , planting thorns in all my paths , poisoning all my pleasures , and turning the past to pain .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 29]: What a lingering catalogue of sighs and tears lies just before me , crowding my aching bosom with the fleeting dream of humanity , which must shortly terminate .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 38]: And to what purpose will all this bustle of life , these agitations and emotions of the heart have conduced , if it leave behind it nothing of utility , if it leave no traces of improvement ?
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 11]: Can it be that I am deceived in my conclusions ?
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 28]: No , I see that I have nothing to hope for , but everything for fear , which tends to drive me from the walks of time .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 37]: in this dead night , if loud winds arise , To lash the surge and bluster in the skies , May the west its furious rage display , Toss me with storms in the watery way .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 5]: -LRB- Enter Gracia . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 28]: G. Oh , Amelia , is it you , the object of grief , the daughter of opulence , of wisdom and philosophy , that thus complaineth ?
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 37]: It can not be you are the child of misfortune , speaking of the monuments of former ages , which were allotted not for the reflection of the distressed , but for the fearless and bold .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 21]: A. Not the child of poverty , Gracia , or the heir of glory and peace , but of fate .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 38]: Remember , I have wealth more than wit can number ; I have had power more than kings could emcompass ; yet the world seems a desert ; all nature appears an afflictive spectacle of warring passions .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 34]: This blind fatality , that capriciously sports with the rules and lives of mortals , tells me that the mountains will never again send forth the water of their springs to my thirst .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 14]: Oh , that I might be freed and set at liberty from wretchedness !
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 11]: But I fear , I fear this will never be .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 9]: G. Why , Amelia , this untimely grief ?
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 21]: What has caused the sorrows that bespeak better and happier days , to those lavish out such heaps of misery ?
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 26]: You are aware that your instructive lessons embellish the mind with holy truths , by wedding its attention to none but great and noble affections .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 10]: A. This , of course , is some consolation .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 59]: I will ever love my own species with feelings of a fond recollection , and while I am studying to advance the universal philanthropy , and the spotless name of my own sex , I will try to build my own upon the pleasing belief that I have accelerated the advancement of one who whispers of departed confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 19]: And I , like some poor peasant fated to reside Remote from friends , in a forest wide .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 24]: Oh , see what woman 's woes and human wants require , Since that great day hath spread the seed of sinful fire .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 15]: G. Look up , thou poor disconsolate ; you speak of quitting earthly enjoyments .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 59]: Unfold thy bosom to a friend , who would be willing to sacrifice every enjoyment for the restoration of the dignity and gentleness of mind which used to grace your walks , and which is so natural to yourself ; not only that , but your paths were strewed with flowers of every hue and of every order .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 31]: With verdant green the mountains glow , For thee , for thee , the lilies grow ; Far stretched beneath the tented hills , A fairer flower the valley fills .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 37]: A. Oh , would to Heaven I could give you a short narrative of my former prospects for happiness , since you have acknowledged to be an unchangeable confidant -- the richest of all other blessings .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 28]: Oh , ye names forever glorious , ye celebrated scenes , ye renowned spot of my hymeneal moments ; how replete is your chart with sublime reflections !
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 59]: How many profound vows , decorated with immaculate deeds , are written upon the surface of that precious spot of earth where I yielded up my life of celibacy , bade youth with all its beauties a final adieu , took a last farewell of the laurels that had accompanied me up the hill of my juvenile career .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 43]: It was then I began to descend toward the valley of disappointment and sorrow ; it was then I cast my little bark upon a mysterious ocean of wedlock , with him who then smiled and caressed me , but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 25]: now frowns with bitterness , and has grown jealous and cold toward me , because the ring he gave me is misplaced or lost .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 71]: Oh , bear me , ye flowers of memory , softly through the eventful history of past times ; and ye places that have witnessed the progression of man in the circle of so many societies , and , of , aid my recollection , while I endeavor to trace the vicissitudes of a life devoted in endeavoring to comfort him that I claim as the object of my wishes .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 21]: ye mysterious men , of all the world , how few Act just to Heaven and to your promise true !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 40]: But He who guides the stars with a watchful eye , The deeds of men lay open without disguise ; Oh , this alone will avenge the wrongs I bear , For all the oppressed are His peculiar care .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 8]: -LRB- F. makes a slight noise . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 7]: A. Who is there -- Farcillo ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 2]: G .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 5]: Then I must gone .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 4]: Heaven protect you .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 11]: Oh , Amelia , farewell , be of good cheer .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 15]: May you stand like Olympus ' towers , Against earth and all jealous powers !
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 18]: May you , with loud shouts ascend on high Swift as an eagle in the upper sky .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 10]: A. Why so cold and distant tonight , Farcillo ?
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 21]: Come , let us each other greet , and forget all the past , and give security for the future .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 3]: F. Security !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 15]: talk to me about giving security for the future -- what an insulting requisition !
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 10]: Have you said your prayers tonight , Madam Amelia ?
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 19]: A. Farcillo , we sometimes forget our duty , particularly when we expect to be caressed by others .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 2]: F .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 39]: If you bethink yourself of any crime , or of any fault , that is yet concealed from the courts of Heaven and the thrones of grace , I bid you ask and solicit forgiveness for it now .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 14]: A. Oh , be kind , Farcillo , do n't treat me so .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 8]: What do you mean by all this ?
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 41]: F. Be kind , you say ; you , madam , have forgot that kindness you owe to me , and bestowed it upon another ; you shall suffer for your conduct when you make your peace with your God .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 8]: I would not slay thy unprotected spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 39]: I call to Heaven to be my guard and my watch -- I would not kill thy soul , in which all once seemed just , right , and perfect ; but I must be brief , woman .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 8]: A. What , talk you of killing ?
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 11]: Oh , Farcillo , Farcillo , what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 16]: F. Aye , I do , without doubt ; mark what I say , Amelia .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 21]: A. Then , O God , O Heaven , and Angels , be propitious , and have mercy upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 18]: F. Amen to that , madam , with all my heart , and with all my soul .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 17]: A. Farcillo , listen to me one moment ; I hope you will not kill me .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 28]: F. Kill you , aye , that I will ; attest it , ye fair host of light , record it , ye dark imps of hell !
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 35]: A. Oh , I fear you -- you are fatal when darkness covers your brow ; yet I know not why I should fear , since I never wronged you in all my life .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 9]: I stand , sir , guiltless before you .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 2]: F .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 8]: You pretend to say you are guiltless !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 16]: Think of thy sins , Amelia ; think , oh , think , hidden woman .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 10]: A. Wherein have I not been true to you ?
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 15]: That death is unkind , cruel , and unnatural , that kills for living .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 12]: F. Peace , and be still while I unfold to thee .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 27]: A. I will , Farcillo , and while I am thus silent , tell me the cause of such cruel coldness in an hour like this .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 2]: F .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 44]: That RING , oh , that ring I so loved , and gave thee as the ring of my heart ; the allegiance you took to be faithful , when it was presented ; the kisses and smiles with which you honored it .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 27]: You became tired of the donor , despised it as a plague , and finally gave it to Malos , the hidden , the vile traitor .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 27]: A. No , upon my word and honor , I never did ; I appeal to the Most High to bear me out in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 8]: Send for Malos , and ask him .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 7]: F. Send for Malos , aye !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 10]: Malos you wish to see ; I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 10]: I knew you could not keep his name concealed .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 27]: Amelia , sweet Amelia , take heed , take heed of perjury ; you are on the stage of death , to suffer for YOUR SINS .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 16]: A. What , not to die I hope , my Farcillo , my ever beloved .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 12]: F. Yes , madam , to die a traitor 's death .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 33]: Shortly your spirit shall take its exit ; therefore confess freely thy sins , for to deny tends only to make me groan under the bitter cup thou hast made for me .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 13]: Thou art to die with the name of traitor on thy brow !
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 27]: A. Then , O Lord , have mercy upon me ; give me courage , give me grace and fortitude to stand this hour of trial .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 11]: F. Amen , I say , with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 14]: A. And , oh , Farcillo , will you have mercy , too ?
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 35]: I never intentionally offended you in all my life , never LOVED Malos , never gave him cause to think so , as the high court of Justice will acquit me before its tribunal .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 22]: F. Oh , false , perjured woman , thou didst chill my blood , and makest me a demon like thyself .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 5]: I saw the ring .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 28]: He found it , then , or got it clandestinely ; send for him , and let him confess the truth ; let his confession be sifted .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 9]: F. And you still wish to see him !
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 20]: I tell you , madam , he hath already confessed , and thou knowest the darkness of thy heart .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 22]: A. What , my deceived Farcillo , that I gave him the ring , in which all my affections were concentrated ?
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 5]: Oh , surely not .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 6]: F. Aye , he did .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 17]: Ask thy conscience , and it will speak with a voice of thunder to thy soul .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 14]: He will not say so , he dare not , he can not .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 42]: F. No , he will not say so now , because his mouth , I trust , is hushed in death , and his body stretched to the four winds of heaven , to be torn to pieces by carnivorous birds .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 21]: A. What , he is dead , and gone to the world of spirits with that declaration in his mouth ?
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 5]: Oh , unhappy man !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 5]: Oh , insupportable hour !
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 29]: F. Yes , and had all his sighs and looks and tears been lives , my great revenge could have slain them all , without the least condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 3]: A. Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 21]: he is ushered into eternity without testing the matter for which I am abused and sentenced and condemned to die .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 6]: F. Cursed , infernal woman !
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 8]: Weepest thou for him to my face ?
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 19]: He that hath robbed me of my peace , my energy , the whole love of my life ?
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 29]: Could I call the fabled Hydra , I would have him live and perish , survive and die , until the sun itself would grow dim with age .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 30]: I would make him have the thirst of a Tantalus , and roll the wheel of an Ixion , until the stars of heaven should quit their brilliant stations .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 9]: A. Oh , invincible God , save me !
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 5]: Oh , unsupportable moment !
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 5]: Oh , heavy hour !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 52]: Banish me , Farcillo -- send me where no eye can ever see me , where no sound shall ever great my ear ; but , oh , slay me not , Farcillo ; vent thy rage and thy spite upon this emaciated frame of mine , only spare my life .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 9]: F. Your petitions avail nothing , cruel Amelia .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 56]: A. Oh , Farcillo , perpetrate the dark deed tomorrow ; let me live till then , for my past kindness to you , and it may be some kind angel will show to you that I am not only the object of innocence , but one who never loved another but your noble self .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 26]: F. Amelia , the decree has gone forth , it is to be done , and that quickly ; thou art to die , madam .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 2]: A .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 27]: But half an hour allow me , to see my father and my only child , to tell her the treachery and vanity of this world .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 2]: F .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 39]: There is no alternative , there is no pause : my daughter shall not see its deceptive mother die ; your father shall not know that his daughter fell disgraced , despised by all but her enchanting Malos .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 34]: A. Oh , Farcillo , put up thy threatening dagger into its scabbard ; let it rest and be still , just while I say one prayer for thee and for my child .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 2]: F .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 30]: It is too late , thy doom is fixed , thou hast not confessed to Heaven or to me , my child 's protector -- thou art to die .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 15]: Ye powers of earth and heaven , protect and defend me in this alone .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 9]: -LRB- STABS HER WHILE IMPLORING FOR MERCY . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 13]: A. Oh , Farcillo , Farcillo , a guiltless death I die .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 3]: F. Die !
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 2]: die !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 2]: die !
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 16]: -LRB- Gracia enters running , falls on her knees weeping , and kisses Amelia . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: G. Oh , Farcillo , Farcillo !
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 4]: oh , Farcillo !
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 18]: F. I am here , the genius of the age , and the avenger of my wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 17]: G. Oh , lady , speak once more ; sweet Amelia , on , speak again .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 9]: Gone , gone -- yes , forever gone !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 19]: Farcillo , oh , cold-hearted Farcillo , some evil fiend hath urged you to do this , Farcillo .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 14]: F. Say not so again , or you shall receive the same fate .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 16]: I did the glorious deed , madam -- beware , then , how you talk .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 24]: G. I fear not your implements of war ; I will let you know you have not the power to do me harm .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 30]: If you have a heart of triple brass , it shall be reached and melted , and thy blood shall chill thy veins and grow stiff in thy arteries .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 62]: Here is the ring of the virtuous and innocent murdered Amelia ; I obtained it from Malos , who yet lives , in hopes that he will survive the wound given him , and says he got it clandestinely -- declares Amelia to be the princess of truth and virtue , invulnerable to anything like forgetting her first devotion to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 51]: The world has heard of your conduct and your jealousy , and with one universal voice declares her to be the best of all in piety ; that she is the star of this great universe , and a more virtuous woman never lived since the wheels of time began .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 25]: Oh , had you waited till tomorrow , or until I had returned , some kind window would have been opened to her relief .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 18]: she is gone -- yes , forever gone , to try the realities of an unknown world !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 10]: -LRB- Farcillo leaning over the body of Amelia . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 11]: F. Malos not dead , and here is my ring !
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 4]: Oh , Amelia !
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 3]: falsely murdered !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 5]: Oh , bloody deed !
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: Oh , wretch that I am !
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 6]: Oh , angels forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 8]: Oh , God , withhold thy vengeance !
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 4]: Oh , Amelia !
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 42]: if Heaven would make a thousand worlds like this , set with diamonds , and all of one perfect chrysolite , I would not have done this for them all , I would not have frowned and cursed as I did .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 16]: Oh , she was heavenly true , nursed in the very lap of bright angels !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 6]: Cursed slave that I am !
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 4]: Jealousy , oh !
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 4]: thou infernal demon !
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 9]: Lost , lost to every sense of honor !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 9]: Amelia -- heaven-born Amelia -- dead , dead !
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 8]: -- then let me die with thee .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 2]: Farewell !
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 2]: farewell !
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 6]: ye world that deceived me !
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 5]: -LRB- STABS HIMSELF . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 88]: Soon after the excitement of this tragical scene was over , and the enlisted feeling for Amelia had grown more buoyant with Elfonzo and Ambulinia , he determined to visit his retired home , and make the necessary improvements to enjoy a better day ; consequently he conveyed the following lines to Ambulinia : Go tell the world that hope is glowing , Go bid the rocks their silence break , Go tell the stars that love is glowing , Then bid the hero his lover take .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 68]: In the region where scarcely the foot of man hath ever trod , where the woodman hath not found his way , lies a blooming grove , seen only by the sun when he mounts his lofty throne , visited only by the light of the stars , to whom are entrusted the guardianship of earth , before the sun sinks to rest in his rosy bed .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 51]: High cliffs of rocks surround the romantic place , and in the small cavity of the rocky wall grows the daffodil clear and pure ; and as the wind blows along the enchanting little mountain which surrounds the lonely spot , it nourishes the flowers with the dew-drops of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 27]: Here is the seat of Elfonzo ; darkness claims but little victory over this dominion , and in vain does she spread out her gloomy wings .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 22]: Here the waters flow perpetually , and the trees lash their tops together to bid the welcome visitor a happy muse .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 28]: Elfonzo , during his short stay in the country , had fully persuaded himself that it was his duty to bring this solemn matter to an issue .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 51]: A duty that he individually owed , as a gentleman , to the parents of Ambulinia , a duty in itself involving not only his own happiness and his own standing in society , but one that called aloud the act of the parties to make it perfect and complete .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 28]: How he should communicate his intentions to get a favorable reply , he was at a loss to know ; he knew not whether to address Esq. .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 96]: Valeer in prose or in poetry , in a jocular or an argumentative manner , or whether he should use moral suasion , legal injunction , or seizure and take by reprisal ; if it was to do the latter , he would have no difficulty in deciding in his own mind , but his gentlemanly honor was at stake ; so he concluded to address the following letter to the father and mother of Ambulinia , as his address in person he knew would only aggravate the old gentleman , and perhaps his lady .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 35]: Cumming , Ga. , January 22 , 1844 Mr. and Mrs. Valeer -- Again I resume the pleasing task of addressing you , and once more beg an immediate answer to my many salutations .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 70]: From every circumstance that has taken place , I feel in duty bound to comply with my obligations ; to forfeit my word would be more than I dare do ; to break my pledge , and my vows that have been witnessed , sealed , and delivered in the presence of an unseen Deity , would be disgraceful on my part , as well as ruinous to Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 13]: I wish no longer to be kept in suspense about this matter .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 9]: I wish to act gentlemanly in every particular .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 37]: It is true , the promises I have made are unknown to any but Ambulinia , and I think it unnecessary to here enumerate them , as they who promise the most generally perform the least .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 12]: Can you for a moment doubt my sincerity or my character ?
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 45]: My only wish is , sir , that you may calmly and dispassionately look at the situation of the case , and if your better judgment should dictate otherwise , my obligations may induce me to pluck the flower that you so diametrically opposed .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 28]: We have sword by the saints -- by the gods of battle , and by that faith whereby just men are made perfect -- to be united .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 35]: I hope , my dear sir , you will find it convenient as well as agreeable to give me a favorable answer , with the signature of Mrs. Valeer , as well as yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 13]: With very great esteem , your humble servant , J. I. Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 14]: The moon and stars had grown pale when Ambulinia had retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 10]: A crowd of unpleasant thoughts passed through her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 30]: Solitude dwelt in her chamber -- no sound from the neighboring world penetrated its stillness ; it appeared a temple of silence , of repose , and of mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 12]: At that moment she heard a still voice calling her father .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 27]: In an instant , like the flash of lightning , a thought ran through her mind that it must be the bearer of Elfonzo 's communication .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 8]: `` It is not a dream ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 12]: she said , `` no , I can not read dreams .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 31]: I would to Heaven I was near that glowing eloquence -- that poetical language -- it charms the mind in an inexpressible manner , and warms the coldest heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 25]: While consoling herself with this strain , her father rushed into her room almost frantic with rage , exclaiming : `` Oh , Ambulinia !
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 7]: Ambulinia !! undutiful , ungrateful daughter !
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 5]: What does this mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 9]: Why does this letter bear such heart-rending intelligence ?
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 41]: Will you quit a father 's house with this debased wretch , without a place to lay his distracted head ; going up and down the country , with every novel object that many chance to wander through this region .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 30]: He is a pretty man to make love known to his superiors , and you , Ambulinia , have done but little credit to yourself by honoring his visits .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 4]: Oh , wretchedness !
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 12]: can it be that my hopes of happiness are forever blasted !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 20]: Will you not listen to a father 's entreaties , and pay some regard to a mother 's tears .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 38]: I know , and I do pray that God will give me fortitude to bear with this sea of troubles , and rescue my daughter , my Ambulinia , as a brand from the eternal burning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 8]: `` Forgive me , father , oh !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: forgive thy child , '' replied Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 19]: `` My heart is ready to break , when I see you in this grieved state of agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 16]: think not so meanly of me , as that I mourn for my own danger .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 7]: Father , I am only woman .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 54]: Mother , I am only the templement of thy youthful years , but will suffer courageously whatever punishment you think proper to inflict upon me , if you will but allow me to comply with my most sacred promises -- if you will but give me my personal right and my personal liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 4]: Oh , father !
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 14]: if your generosity will but give me these , I ask nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 33]: When Elfonzo offered me his heart , I gave him my hand , never to forsake him , and now may the mighty God banish me before I leave him in adversity .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 95]: What a heart must I have to rejoice in prosperity with him whose offers I have accepted , and then , when poverty comes , haggard as it may be , for me to trifle with the oracles of Heaven , and change with every fluctuation that may interrupt our happiness -- like the politician who runs the political gantlet for office one day , and the next day , because the horizon is darkened a little , he is seen running for his life , for fear he might perish in its ruins .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 20]: Where is the philosophy , where is the consistency , where is the charity , in conduct like this ?
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 62]: Be happy then , my beloved father , and forget me ; let the sorrow of parting break down the wall of separation and make us equal in our feeling ; let me now say how ardently I love you ; let me kiss that age-worn cheek , and should my tears bedew thy face , I will wipe them away .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 15]: Oh , I never can forget you ; no , never , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 12]: `` Weep not , '' said the father , `` Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 18]: I will forbid Elfonzo my house , and desire that you may keep retired a few days .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 39]: I will let him know that my friendship for my family is not linked together by cankered chains ; and if he ever enters upon my premises again , I will send him to his long home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 5]: `` Oh , father !
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 53]: let me entreat you to be calm upon this occasion , and though Elfonzo may be the sport of the clouds and winds , yet I feel assured that no fate will send him to the silent tomb until the God of the Universe calls him hence with a triumphant voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 59]: Here the father turned away , exclaiming : `` I will answer his letter in a very few words , and you , madam , will have the goodness to stay at home with your mother ; and remember , I am determined to protect you from the consuming fire that looks so fair to your view . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 7]: Cumming , January 22 , 1844 .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 66]: Sir -- In regard to your request , I am as I ever have been , utterly opposed to your marrying into my family ; and if you have any regard for yourself , or any gentlemanly feeling , I hope you will mention it to me no more ; but seek some other one who is not so far superior to you in standing .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 4]: W. W. Valeer .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 33]: When Elfonzo read the above letter , he became so much depressed in spirits that many of his friends thought it advisable to use other means to bring about the happy union .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 33]: `` Strange , '' said he , `` that the contents of this diminutive letter should cause me to have such depressed feelings ; but there is a nobler theme than this .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 17]: I know not why my MILITARY TITLE is not as great as that of SQUIRE VALEER .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 25]: For my life I can not see that my ancestors are inferior to those who are so bitterly opposed to my marriage with Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 45]: I know I have seen huge mountains before me , yet , when I think that I know gentlemen will insult me upon this delicate matter , should I become angry at fools and babblers , who pride themselves in their impudence and ignorance ?
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 3]: My equals !
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: I know not where to find them .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 3]: My inferiors !
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 10]: I think it beneath me ; and my superiors !
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 28]: I think it presumption ; therefore , if this youthful heart is protected by any of the divine rights , I never will betray my trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 25]: He was aware that Ambulinia had a confidence that was , indeed , as firm and as resolute as she was beautiful and interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 29]: He hastened to the cottage of Louisa , who received him in her usual mode of pleasantness , and informed him that Ambulinia had just that moment left .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 6]: `` Is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 3]: said Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: `` Oh , murdered hours !
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 13]: Why did she not remain and be the guardian of my secrets ?
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 21]: But hasten and tell me how she has stood this trying scene , and what are her future determinations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 27]: `` You know , '' said Louisa , `` Major Elfonzo , that you have Ambulinia 's first love , which is of no small consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 20]: She came here about twilight , and shed many precious tears in consequence of her own fate with yours .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 17]: We walked silently in yon little valley you see , where we spent a momentary repose .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 28]: She seemed to be quite as determined as ever , and before we left that beautiful spot she offered up a prayer to Heaven for thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 19]: `` I will see her then , '' replied Elfonzo , `` though legions of enemies may oppose .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 33]: She is mine by foreordination -- she is mine by prophesy -- she is mine by her own free will , and I will rescue her from the hands of her oppressors .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 14]: Will you not , Miss Louisa , assist me in my capture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 77]: `` I will certainly , by the aid of Divine Providence , '' answered Louisa , `` endeavor to break those slavish chains that bind the richest of prizes ; though allow me , Major , to entreat you to use no harsh means on this important occasion ; take a decided stand , and write freely to Ambulinia upon this subject , and I will see that no intervening cause hinders its passage to her .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 8]: God alone will save a mourning people .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 19]: Now is the day and now is the hour to obey a command of such valuable worth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 13]: The Major felt himself grow stronger after this short interview with Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 37]: He felt as if he could whip his weight in wildcats -- he knew he was master of his own feelings , and could now write a letter that would bring this litigation to AN ISSUE .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 7]: Cumming , January 24 , 1844 .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 107]: Dear Ambulinia -- We have now reached the most trying moment of our lives ; we are pledged not to forsake our trust ; we have waited for a favorable hour to come , thinking your friends would settle the matter agreeably among themselves , and finally be reconciled to our marriage ; but as I have waited in vain , and looked in vain , I have determined in my own mind to make a proposition to you , though you may think it not in accord with your station , or compatible with your rank ; yet , `` sub loc signo vinces . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 51]: You know I can not resume my visits , in consequence of the utter hostility that your father has to me ; therefore the consummation of our union will have to be sought for in a more sublime sphere , at the residence of a respectable friend of this village .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 46]: You can not have an scruples upon this mode of proceeding , if you will but remember it emanates from one who loves you better than his own life -- who is more than anxious to bid you welcome to a new and happy home .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 31]: Your warmest associates say come ; the talented , the learned , the wise , and the experienced say come ; -- all these with their friends say , come .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 37]: Viewing these , with many other inducements , I flatter myself that you will come to the embraces of your Elfonzo ; for now is the time of your acceptance of the day of your liberation .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 33]: You can not be ignorant , Ambulinia , that thou art the desire of my heart ; its thoughts are too noble , and too pure , to conceal themselves from you .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 42]: I shall wait for your answer to this impatiently , expecting that you will set the time to make your departure , and to be in readiness at a moment 's warning to share the joys of a more preferable life .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 46]: This will be handed to you by Louisa , who will take a pleasure in communicating anything to you that may relieve your dejected spirits , and will assure you that I now stand ready , willing , and waiting to make good my vows .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 16]: I am , dear Ambulinia , your truly , and forever , J. I. Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 43]: Louisa made it convenient to visit Mr. Valeer 's , though they did not suspect her in the least the bearer of love epistles ; consequently , she was invited in the room to console Ambulinia , where they were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 23]: Ambulinia was seated by a small table -- her head resting on her hand -- her brilliant eyes were bathed in tears .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 60]: Louisa handed her the letter of Elfonzo , when another spirit animated her features -- the spirit of renewed confidence that never fails to strengthen the female character in an hour of grief and sorrow like this , and as she pronounced the last accent of his name , she exclaimed , `` And does he love me yet !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 9]: I never will forget your generosity , Louisa .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 8]: Oh , unhappy and yet blessed Louisa !
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 18]: may you never feel what I have felt -- may you never know the pangs of love .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 44]: Had I never loved , I never would have been unhappy ; but I turn to Him who can save , and if His wisdom does not will my expected union , I know He will give me strength to bear my lot .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 33]: Amuse yourself with this little book , and take it as an apology for my silence , '' said Ambulinia , `` while I attempt to answer this volume of consolation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 42]: `` Thank you , '' said Louisa , `` you are excusable upon this occasion ; but I pray you , Ambulinia , to be expert upon this momentous subject , that there may be nothing mistrustful upon my part . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 29]: `` I will , '' said Ambulinia , and immediately resumed her seat and addressed the following to Elfonzo : Cumming , Ga. , January 28 , 1844 .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 28]: Devoted Elfonzo -- I hail your letter as a welcome messenger of faith , and can now say truly and firmly that my feelings correspond with yours .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 14]: Nothing shall be wanting on my part to make my obedience your fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 7]: Courage and perseverance will accomplish success .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 29]: Receive this as my oath , that while I grasp your hand in my own imagination , we stand united before a higher tribunal than any on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 17]: All the powers of my life , soul , and body , I devote to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 13]: Whatever dangers may threaten me , I fear not to encounter them .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 38]: Perhaps I have determined upon my own destruction , by leaving the house of the best of parents ; be it so ; I flee to you ; I share your destiny , faithful to the end .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 25]: The day that I have concluded upon for this task is SABBATH next , when the family with the citizens are generally at church .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 69]: For Heaven 's sake let not that day pass unimproved : trust not till tomorrow , it is the cheat of life -- the future that never comes -- the grave of many noble births -- the cavern of ruined enterprise : which like the lightning 's flash is born , and dies , and perishes , ere the voice of him who sees can cry , BEHOLD !
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 19]: BEHOLD !! You may trust to what I say , no power shall tempt me to betray confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 8]: Suffer me to add one word more .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 29]: I will soothe thee , in all thy grief , Beside the gloomy river ; And though thy love may yet be brief ; Mine is fixed forever .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 29]: Receive the deepest emotions of my heart for thy constant love , and may the power of inspiration by thy guide , thy portion , and thy all .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 9]: In great haste , Yours faithfully , Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 26]: `` I now take my leave of you , sweet girl , '' said Louisa , `` sincerely wishing you success on Sabbath next . ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 17]: When Ambulinia 's letter was handed to Elfonzo , he perused it without doubting its contents .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 54]: Louisa charged him to make but few confidants ; but like most young men who happened to win the heart of a beautiful girl , he was so elated with the idea that he felt as a commanding general on parade , who had confidence in all , consequently gave orders to all .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 16]: The appointed Sabbath , with a delicious breeze and cloudless sky , made its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 25]: The people gathered in crowds to the church -- the streets were filled with neighboring citizens , all marching to the house of worship .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 48]: It is entirely useless for me to attempt to describe the feelings of Elfonzo and Ambulinia , who were silently watching the movements of the multitude , apparently counting them as then entered the house of God , looking for the last one to darken the door .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 23]: The impatience and anxiety with which they waited , and the bliss they anticipated on the eventful day , is altogether indescribable .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 51]: Those that have been so fortunate as to embark in such a noble enterprise know all its realities ; and those who have not had this inestimable privilege will have to taste its sweets before they can tell to others its joys , its comforts , and its Heaven-born worth .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 23]: Immediately after Ambulinia had assisted the family off to church , she took advantage of that opportunity to make good her promises .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 17]: She left a home of enjoyment to be wedded to one whose love had been justifiable .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 49]: A few short steps brought her to the presence of Louisa , who urged her to make good use of her time , and not to delay a moment , but to go with her to her brother 's house , where Elfonzo would forever make her happy .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 25]: With lively speed , and yet a graceful air , she entered the door and found herself protected by the champion of her confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 71]: The necessary arrangements were fast making to have the two lovers united -- everything was in readiness except the parson ; and as they are generally very sanctimonious on such occasions , the news got to the parents of Ambulinia before the everlasting knot was tied , and they both came running , with uplifted hands and injured feelings , to arrest their daughter from an unguarded and hasty resolution .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 24]: Elfonzo desired to maintain his ground , but Ambulinia thought it best for him to leave , to prepare for a greater contest .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 42]: He accordingly obeyed , as it would have been a vain endeavor for him to have battled against a man who was armed with deadly weapons ; and besides , he could not resist the request of such a pure heart .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 30]: Ambulinia concealed herself in the upper story of the house , fearing the rebuke of her father ; the door was locked , and no chastisement was now expected .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 18]: Esquire Valeer , whose pride was already touched , resolved to preserve the dignity of his family .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 12]: He entered the house almost exhausted , looking wildly for Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 28]: `` Amazed and astonished indeed I am , '' said he , `` at a people who call themselves civilized , to allow such behavior as this .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 5]: Ambulinia , Ambulinia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 20]: he cried , `` come to the calls of your first , your best , and your only friend .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 30]: I appeal to you , sir , '' turning to the gentleman of the house , `` to know where Ambulinia has gone , or where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 16]: `` Do you mean to insult me , sir , in my own house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 4]: inquired the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 38]: `` I will burst , '' said Mr. V. , `` asunder every door in your dwelling , in search of my daughter , if you do not speak quickly , and tell me where she is .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 23]: I care nothing about that outcast rubbish of creation , that mean , low-lived Elfonzo , if I can but obtain Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 10]: Are you not going to open this door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 10]: `` By the Eternal that made Heaven and earth !
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 15]: I will go about the work instantly , if this is not done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 19]: The confused citizens gathered from all parts of the village , to know the cause of this commotion .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 21]: Some rushed into the house ; the door that was locked flew open , and there stood Ambulinia , weeping .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 19]: `` Father , be still , '' said she , `` and I will follow thee home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 16]: But the agitated man seized her , and bore her off through the gazing multitude .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 4]: `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 21]: she exclaimed , `` I humbly beg your pardon -- I will be dutiful -- I will obey thy commands .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 17]: Let the sixteen years I have lived in obedience to thee by my future security . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 27]: `` I do n't like to be always giving credit , when the old score is not paid up , madam , '' said the father .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 36]: The mother followed almost in a state of derangement , crying and imploring her to think beforehand , and ask advice from experienced persons , and they would tell her it was a rash undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 48]: said she , `` Ambulinia , my daughter , did you know what I have suffered -- did you know how many nights I have whiled away in agony , in pain , and in fear , you would pity the sorrows of a heartbroken mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 35]: `` Well , mother , '' replied Ambulinia , `` I know I have been disobedient ; I am aware that what I have done might have been done much better ; but oh !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 8]: what shall I do with my honor ?
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 13]: it is so dear to me ; I am pledged to Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 36]: His high moral worth is certainly worth some attention ; moreover , my vows , I have no doubt , are recorded in the book of life , and must I give these all up ?
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 8]: must my fair hopes be forever blasted ?
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 7]: Forbid it , father ; oh !
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 11]: forbid it , mother ; forbid it , Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 49]: `` I have seen so many beautiful skies overclouded , '' replied the mother , `` so many blossoms nipped by the frost , that I am afraid to trust you to the care of those fair days , which may be interrupted by thundering and tempestuous nights .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 21]: You no doubt think as I did -- life 's devious ways were strewn with sweet-scented flowers , but ah !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 26]: how long they have lingered around me and took their flight in the vivid hope that laughs at the drooping victims it has murdered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 7]: Elfonzo was moved at this sight .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 64]: The people followed on to see what was going to become of Ambulinia , while he , with downcast looks , kept at a distance , until he saw them enter the abode of the father , thrusting her , that was the sigh of his soul , out of his presence into a solitary apartment , when she exclaimed , `` Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 2]: Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 4]: oh , Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 9]: where art thou , with all thy heroes ?
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 4]: haste , oh !
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 8]: haste , come thou to my relief .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 8]: Ride on the wings of the wind !
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 25]: Turn thy force loose like a tempest , and roll on thy army like a whirlwind , over this mountain of trouble and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 4]: Oh , friends !
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 33]: if any pity me , let your last efforts throng upon the green hills , and come to the relief of Ambulinia , who is guilty of nothing but innocent love . ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 17]: Elfonzo called out with a loud voice , `` My God , can I stand this !
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 15]: arise up , I beseech you , and put an end to this tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 22]: Come , my brave boys , '' said he , `` are you ready to go forth to your duty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 5]: They stood around him .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 14]: `` Who , '' said he , `` will call us to arms ?
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 7]: Where are my thunderbolts of war ?
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 11]: Speak ye , the first who will meet the foe !
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 13]: Who will go forward with me in this ocean of grievous temptation ?
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 49]: If there is one who desires to go , let him come and shake hands upon the altar of devotion , and swear that he will be a hero ; yes , a Hector in a cause like this , which calls aloud for a speedy remedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 43]: `` Mine be the deed , '' said a young lawyer , `` and mine alone ; Venus alone shall quit her station before I will forsake one jot or tittle of my promise to you ; what is death to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 16]: what is all this warlike army , if it is not to win a victory ?
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 31]: I love the sleep of the lover and the mighty ; nor would I give it over till the blood of my enemies should wreak with that of my own .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 16]: But God forbid that our fame should soar on the blood of the slumberer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 32]: Mr. Valeer stands at his door with the frown of a demon upon his brow , with his dangerous weapon ready to strike the first man who should enter his door .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 19]: `` Who will arise and go forward through blood and carnage to the rescue of my Ambulinia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 3]: said Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 19]: `` All , '' exclaimed the multitude ; and onward they went , with their implements of battle .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 21]: Others , of a more timid nature , stood among the distant hills to see the result of the contest .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 8]: Elfonzo took the lead of his band .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 22]: Night arose in clouds ; darkness concealed the heavens ; but the blazing hopes that stimulated them gleamed in every bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 23]: All approached the anxious spot ; they rushed to the front of the house and , with one exclamation , demanded Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 17]: `` Away , begone , and disturb my peace no more , '' said Mr. Valeer .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 14]: `` You are a set of base , insolent , and infernal rascals .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 105]: Go , the northern star points your path through the dim twilight of the night ; go , and vent your spite upon the lonely hills ; pour forth your love , you poor , weak-minded wretch , upon your idleness and upon your guitar , and your fiddle ; they are fit subjects for your admiration , for let me assure you , though this sword and iron lever are cankered , yet they frown in sleep , and let one of you dare to enter my house this night and you shall have the contents and the weight of these instruments . ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 54]: `` Never yet did base dishonor blur my name , '' said Elfonzo ; `` mine is a cause of renown ; here are my warriors ; fear and tremble , for this night , though hell itself should oppose , I will endeavor to avenge her whom thou hast banished in solitude .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 13]: The voice of Ambulinia shall be heard from that dark dungeon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 22]: At that moment Ambulinia appeared at the window above , and with a tremulous voice said , `` Live , Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 8]: live to raise my stone of moss !
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 8]: why should such language enter your heart ?
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 11]: why should thy voice rend the air with such agitation ?
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 78]: I bid thee live , once more remembering these tears of mine are shed alone for thee , in this dark and gloomy vault , and should I perish under this load of trouble , join the song of thrilling accents with the raven above my grave , and lay this tattered frame beside the banks of the Chattahoochee or the stream of Sawney 's brook ; sweet will be the song of death to your Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 33]: My ghost shall visit you in the smiles of Paradise , and tell your high fame to the minds of that region , which is far more preferable than this lonely cell .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 35]: My heart shall speak for thee till the latest hour ; I know faint and broken are the sounds of sorrow , yet our souls , Elfonzo , shall hear the peaceful songs together .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 49]: One bright name shall be ours on high , if we are not permitted to be united here ; bear in mind that I still cherish my old sentiments , and the poet will mingle the names of Elfonzo and Ambulinia in the tide of other days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 23]: `` Fly , Elfonzo , '' said the voices of his united band , `` to the wounded heart of your beloved .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 8]: All enemies shall fall beneath thy sword .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 15]: Fly through the clefts , and the dim spark shall sleep in death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 20]: Elfonzo rushes forward and strikes his shield against the door , which was barricaded , to prevent any intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 7]: His brave sons throng around him .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 20]: The people pour along the streets , both male and female , to prevent or witness the melancholy scene .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 8]: `` To arms , to arms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 29]: cried Elfonzo ; `` here is a victory to be won , a prize to be gained that is more to me that the whole world beside . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 13]: `` It can not be done tonight , '' said Mr. Valeer .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 15]: `` I bear the clang of death ; my strength and armor shall prevail .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 23]: My Ambulinia shall rest in this hall until the break of another day , and if we fall , we fall together .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 31]: If we die , we die clinging to our tattered rights , and our blood alone shall tell the mournful tale of a murdered daughter and a ruined father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 19]: Sure enough , he kept watch all night , and was successful in defending his house and family .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 61]: The bright morning gleamed upon the hills , night vanished away , the Major and his associates felt somewhat ashamed that they had not been as fortunate as they expected to have been ; however , they still leaned upon their arms in dispersed groups ; some were walking the streets , others were talking in the Major 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 15]: Many of the citizen suspended business , as the town presented nothing but consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 15]: A novelty that might end in the destruction of some worthy and respectable citizens .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 14]: Mr. Valeer ventured in the streets , though not without being well armed .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 30]: Some of his friends congratulated him on the decided stand he had taken , and hoped he would settle the matter amicably with Elfonzo , without any serious injury .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 28]: `` Me , '' he replied , `` what , me , condescend to fellowship with a coward , and a low-lived , lazy , undermining villain ?
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 44]: no , gentlemen , this can not be ; I had rather be borne off , like the bubble upon the dark blue ocean , with Ambulinia by my side , than to have him in the ascending or descending line of relationship .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 34]: Gentlemen , '' continued he , `` if Elfonzo is so much of a distinguished character , and is so learned in the fine arts , why do you not patronize such men ?
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 18]: why not introduce him into your families , as a gentleman of taste and of unequaled magnanimity ?
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 15]: why are you so very anxious that he should become a relative of mine ?
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 42]: Oh , gentlemen , I fear you yet are tainted with the curiosity of our first parents , who were beguiled by the poisonous kiss of an old ugly serpent , and who , for one APPLE , DAMNED all mankind .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 16]: I wish to divest myself , as far as possible , of that untutored custom .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 45]: I have long since learned that the perfection of wisdom , and the end of true philosophy , is to proportion our wants to our possessions , our ambition to our capacities ; we will then be a happy and a virtuous people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 13]: Ambulinia was sent off to prepare for a long and tedious journey .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 28]: Her new acquaintances had been instructed by her father how to treat her , and in what manner , and to keep the anticipated visit entirely secret .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 24]: Elfonzo was watching the movements of everybody ; some friends had told him of the plot that was laid to carry off Ambulinia .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 107]: At night , he rallied some two or three of his forces , and went silently along to the stately mansion ; a faint and glimmering light showed through the windows ; lightly he steps to the door ; there were many voices rallying fresh in fancy 's eye ; he tapped the shutter ; it was opened instantly , and he beheld once more , seated beside several ladies , the hope of all his toils ; he rushed toward her , she rose from her seat , rejoicing ; he made one mighty grasp , when Ambulinia exclaimed , `` Huzza for Major Elfonzo !
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 42]: I will defend myself and you , too , with this conquering instrument I hold in my hand ; huzza , I say , I now invoke time 's broad wing to shed around us some dewdrops of verdant spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 30]: But the hour had not come for this joyous reunion ; her friends struggled with Elfonzo for some time , and finally succeeded in arresting her from his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 67]: He dared not injure them , because they were matrons whose courage needed no spur ; she was snatched from the arms of Elfonzo , with so much eagerness , and yet with such expressive signification , that he calmly withdrew from this lovely enterprise , with an ardent hope that he should be lulled to repose by the zephyrs which whispered peace to his soul .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 32]: Several long days and night passed unmolested , all seemed to have grounded their arms of rebellion , and no callidity appeared to be going on with any of the parties .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 50]: Other arrangements were made by Ambulinia ; she feigned herself to be entirely the votary of a mother 's care , and she , by her graceful smiles , that manhood might claim his stern dominion in some other region , where such boisterous love was not so prevalent .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 38]: This gave the parents a confidence that yielded some hours of sober joy ; they believed that Ambulinia would now cease to love Elfonzo , and that her stolen affections would now expire with her misguided opinions .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 13]: They therefore declined the idea of sending her to a distant land .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 3]: But oh !
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 42]: they dreamed not of the rapture that dazzled the fancy of Ambulinia , who would say , when alone , youth should not fly away on his rosy pinions , and leave her to grapple in the conflict with unknown admirers .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 25]: No frowning age shall control The constant current of my soul , Nor a tear from pity 's eye Shall check my sympathetic sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 60]: With this resolution fixed in her mind , one dark and dreary night , when the winds whistled and the tempest roared , she received intelligence that Elfonzo was then waiting , and every preparation was then ready , at the residence of Dr. Tully , and for her to make a quick escape while the family was reposing .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 43]: Accordingly she gathered her books , went the wardrobe supplied with a variety of ornamental dressing , and ventured alone in the streets to make her way to Elfonzo , who was near at hand , impatiently looking and watching her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 15]: `` What forms , '' said she , `` are those rising before me ?
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 9]: What is that dark spot on the clouds ?
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 15]: I do wonder what frightful ghost that is , gleaming on the red tempest ?
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 13]: Oh , be merciful and tell me what region you are from .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 24]: Oh , tell me , ye strong spirits , or ye dark and fleeting clouds , that I yet have a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 12]: `` A friend , '' said a low , whispering voice .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 14]: `` I am thy unchanging , thy aged , and thy disappointed mother .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 13]: Why brandish in that hand of thine a javelin of pointed steel ?
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 13]: Why suffer that lip I have kissed a thousand times to equivocate ?
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 26]: My daughter , let these tears sink deep into thy soul , and no longer persist in that which may be your destruction and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 20]: Come , my dear child , retract your steps , and bear me company to your welcome home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 47]: Without one retorting word , or frown from her brow , she yielded to the entreaties of her mother , and with all the mildness of her former character she went along with the silver lamp of age , to the home of candor and benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 23]: Her father received her cold and formal politeness -- `` Where has Ambulinia been , this blustering evening , Mrs. Valeer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 3]: inquired he .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 33]: `` Oh , she and I have been taking a solitary walk , '' said the mother ; `` all things , I presume , are now working for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 9]: Elfonzo heard this news shortly after it happened .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 16]: `` What , '' said he , `` has heaven and earth turned against me ?
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 8]: I have been disappointed times without number .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 4]: Shall I despair ?
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 7]: -- must I give it over ?
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 35]: Heaven 's decrees will not fade ; I will write again -- I will try again ; and if it traverses a gory field , I pray forgiveness at the altar of justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 9]: Desolate Hill , Cumming , Geo. , 1844 .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 31]: Unconquered and Beloved Ambulinia -- I have only time to say to you , not to despair ; thy fame shall not perish ; my visions are brightening before me .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 17]: The whirlwind 's rage is past , and we now shall subdue our enemies without doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 40]: On Monday morning , when your friends are at breakfast , they will not suspect your departure , or even mistrust me being in town , as it has been reported advantageously that I have left for the west .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 37]: You walk carelessly toward the academy grove , where you will find me with a lightning steed , elegantly equipped to bear you off where we shall be joined in wedlock with the first connubial rights .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 19]: Fail not to do this -- think not of the tedious relations of our wrongs -- be invincible .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 23]: You alone occupy all my ambition , and I alone will make you my happy spouse , with the same unimpeached veracity .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 15]: I remain , forever , your devoted friend and admirer , J. L. Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 17]: The appointed day ushered in undisturbed by any clouds ; nothing disturbed Ambulinia 's soft beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 11]: With serenity and loveliness she obeys the request of Elfonzo .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 44]: The moment the family seated themselves at the table -- `` Excuse my absence for a short time , '' said she , `` while I attend to the placing of those flowers , which should have been done a week ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 19]: And away she ran to the sacred grove , surrounded with glittering pearls , that indicated her coming .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 12]: Elfonzo hails her with his silver bow and his golden harp .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 15]: They meet -- Ambulinia 's countenance brightens -- Elfonzo leads up his winged steed .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 21]: `` Mount , '' said he , `` ye true-hearted , ye fearless soul -- the day is ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 37]: She sprang upon the back of the young thunder bolt , a brilliant star sparkles upon her head , with one hand she grasps the reins , and with the other she holds an olive branch .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 34]: `` Lend thy aid , ye strong winds , '' they exclaimed , `` ye moon , ye sun , and all ye fair host of heaven , witness the enemy conquered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 13]: `` Hold , '' said Elfonzo , `` thy dashing steed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 18]: `` Ride on , '' said Ambulinia , `` the voice of thunder is behind us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 35]: And onward they went , with such rapidity that they very soon arrived at Rural Retreat , where they dismounted , and were united with all the solemnities that usually attend such divine operations .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 38]: They passed the day in thanksgiving and great rejoicing , and on that evening they visited their uncle , where many of their friends and acquaintances had gathered to congratulate them in the field of untainted bliss .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 47]: The kind old gentleman met them in the yard : `` Well , '' said he , `` I wish I may die , Elfonzo , if you and Ambulinia have n't tied a knot with your tongue that you ca n't untie with your teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 31]: But come in , come in , never mind , all is right -- the world still moves on , and no one has fallen in this great battle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 6]: Happy now is there lot !
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 14]: Unmoved by misfortune , they live among the fair beauties of the South .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 27]: Heaven spreads their peace and fame upon the arch of the rainbow , and smiles propitiously at their triumph , THROUGH THE TEARS OF THE STORM .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 49]: THE CALIFORNIAN 'S TALE Thirty-five years ago I was out prospecting on the Stanislaus , tramping all day long with pick and pan and horn , and washing a hatful of dirt here and there , always expecting to make a rich strike , and never doing it .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 36]: It was a lovely region , woodsy , balmy , delicious , and had once been populous , long years before , but now the people had vanished and the charming paradise was a solitude .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 10]: They went away when the surface diggings gave out .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 49]: In one place , where a busy little city with banks and newspapers and fire companies and a mayor and aldermen had been , was nothing but a wide expanse of emerald turf , with not even the faintest sign that human life had ever been present there .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 6]: This was down toward Tuttletown .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 70]: In the country neighborhood thereabouts , along the dusty roads , one found at intervals the prettiest little cottage homes , snug and cozy , and so cobwebbed with vines snowed thick with roses that the doors and windows were wholly hidden from sight -- sign that these were deserted homes , forsaken years ago by defeated and disappointed families who could neither sell them nor give them away .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 33]: Now and then , half an hour apart , one came across solitary log cabins of the earliest mining days , built by the first gold-miners , the predecessors of the cottage-builders .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 102]: In some few cases these cabins were still occupied ; and when this was so , you could depend upon it that the occupant was the very pioneer who had built the cabin ; and you could depend on another thing , too -- that he was there because he had once had his opportunity to go home to the States rich , and had not done it ; had rather lost his wealth , and had then in his humiliation resolved to sever all communication with his home relatives and friends , and be to them thenceforth as one dead .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 57]: Round about California in that day were scattered a host of these living dead men -- pride-smitten poor fellows , grizzled and old at forty , whose secret thoughts were made all of regrets and longings -- regrets for their wasted lives , and longings to be out of the struggle and done with it all .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 6]: It was a lonesome land !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 40]: Not a sound in all those peaceful expanses of grass and woods but the drowsy hum of insects ; no glimpse of man or beast ; nothing to keep up your spirits and make you glad to be alive .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 30]: And so , at last , in the early part of the afternoon , when I caught sight of a human creature , I felt a most grateful uplift .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 32]: This person was a man about forty-five years old , and he was standing at the gate of one of those cozy little rose-clad cottages of the sort already referred to .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 48]: However , this one had n't a deserted look ; it had the look of being lived in and petted and cared for and looked after ; and so had its front yard , which was a garden of flowers , abundant , gay , and flourishing .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 24]: I was invited in , of course , and required to make myself at home -- it was the custom of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 65]: It was delightful to be in such a place , after long weeks of daily and nightly familiarity with miners ' cabins -- with all which this implies of dirt floor , never-made beds , tin plates and cups , bacon and beans and black coffee , and nothing of ornament but war pictures from the Eastern illustrated papers tacked to the log walls .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 67]: That was all hard , cheerless , materialistic desolation , but here was a nest which had aspects to rest the tired eye and refresh that something in one 's nature which , after long fasting , recognizes , when confronted by the belongings of art , howsoever cheap and modest they may be , that it has unconsciously been famishing and now has found nourishment .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 99]: I could not have believed that a rag carpet could feast me so , and so content me ; or that there could be such solace to the soul in wall-paper and framed lithographs , and bright-colored tidies and lamp-mats , and Windsor chairs , and varnished what-nots , with sea-shells and books and china vases on them , and the score of little unclassifiable tricks and touches that a woman 's hand distributes about a home , which one sees without knowing he sees them , yet would miss in a moment if they were taken away .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 36]: The delight that was in my heart showed in my face , and the man saw it and was pleased ; saw it so plainly that he answered it as if it had been spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 38]: `` All her work , '' he said , caressingly ; `` she did it all herself -- every bit , '' and he took the room in with a glance which was full of affectionate worship .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 24]: One of those soft Japanese fabrics with which women drape with careful negligence the upper part of a picture-frame was out of adjustment .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 27]: He noticed it , and rearranged it with cautious pains , stepping back several times to gauge the effect before he got it to suit him .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 23]: Then he gave it a light finishing pat or two with his hand , and said : `` She always does that .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 47]: You ca n't tell just what it lacks , but it does lack something until you 've done that -- you can see it yourself after it 's done , but that is all you know ; you ca n't find out the law of it .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 25]: It 's like the finishing pats a mother gives the child 's hair after she 's got it combed and brushed , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 32]: I 've seen her fix all these things so much that I can do them all just her way , though I do n't know the law of any of them .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 6]: But she knows the law .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 24]: She knows the why and the how both ; but I do n't know the why ; I only know the how . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 101]: He took me into a bedroom so that I might wash my hands ; such a bedroom as I had not seen for years : white counterpane , white pillows , carpeted floor , papered walls , pictures , dressing-table , with mirror and pin-cushion and dainty toilet things ; and in the corner a wash-stand , with real china-ware bowl and pitcher , and with soap in a china dish , and on a rack more than a dozen towels -- towels too clean and white for one out of practice to use without some vague sense of profanation .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 27]: So my face spoke again , and he answered with gratified words : `` All her work ; she did it all herself -- every bit .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 12]: Nothing here that has n't felt the touch of her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 14]: Now you would think -- But I must n't talk so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 79]: By this time I was wiping my hands and glancing from detail to detail of the room 's belongings , as one is apt to do when he is in a new place , where everything he sees is a comfort to his eye and his spirit ; and I became conscious , in one of those unaccountable ways , you know , that there was something there somewhere that the man wanted me to discover for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 38]: I knew it perfectly , and I knew he was trying to help me by furtive indications with his eye , so I tried hard to get on the right track , being eager to gratify him .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 46]: I failed several times , as I could see out of the corner of my eye without being told ; but at last I knew I must be looking straight at the thing -- knew it from the pleasure issuing in invisible waves from him .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 22]: He broke into a happy laugh , and rubbed his hands together , and cried out : `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 5]: You 've found it .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 5]: I knew you would .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 6]: It 's her picture . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 26]: I went to the little black-walnut bracket on the farther wall , and did find there what I had not yet noticed -- a daguerreotype-case .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 24]: It contained the sweetest girlish face , and the most beautiful , as it seemed to me , that I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 14]: The man drank the admiration from my face , and was fully satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 27]: `` Nineteen her last birthday , '' he said , as he put the picture back ; `` and that was the day we were married .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 15]: When you see her -- ah , just wait till you see her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 5]: `` Where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 7]: When will she be in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 8]: `` Oh , she 's away now .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 8]: She 's gone to see her people .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 9]: They live forty or fifty miles from here .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 9]: She 's been gone two weeks today . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 9]: `` When do you expect her back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 5]: `` This is Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 17]: She 'll be back Saturday , in the evening -- about nine o'clock , likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 8]: I felt a sharp sense of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 18]: `` I 'm sorry , because I 'll be gone then , '' I said , regretfully .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 3]: `` Gone ?
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 7]: No -- why should you go ?
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 4]: Do n't go .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 6]: She 'll be disappointed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 9]: She would be disappointed -- that beautiful creature !
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 15]: If she had said the words herself they could hardly have blessed me more .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 26]: I was feeling a deep , strong longing to see her -- a longing so supplicating , so insistent , that it made me afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 24]: I said to myself : `` I will go straight away from this place , for my peace of mind 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 28]: `` You see , she likes to have people come and stop with us -- people who know things , and can talk -- people like you .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 40]: She delights in it ; for she knows -- oh , she knows nearly everything herself , and can talk , oh , like a bird -- and the books she reads , why , you would be astonished .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 22]: Do n't go ; it 's only a little while , you know , and she 'll be so disappointed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 20]: I heard the words , but hardly noticed them , I was so deep in my thinkings and strugglings .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 10]: He left me , but I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 47]: Presently he was back , with the picture case in his hand , and he held it open before me and said : `` There , now , tell her to her face you could have stayed to see her , and you would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 9]: That second glimpse broke down my good resolution .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 8]: I would stay and take the risk .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 37]: That night we smoked the tranquil pipe , and talked till late about various things , but mainly about her ; and certainly I had had no such pleasant and restful time for many a day .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 8]: The Thursday followed and slipped comfortably away .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 32]: Toward twilight a big miner from three miles away came -- one of the grizzled , stranded pioneers -- and gave us warm salutation , clothed in grave and sober speech .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 24]: Then he said : `` I only just dropped over to ask about the little madam , and when is she coming home .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 6]: Any news from her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , a letter .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 10]: Would you like to hear it , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 18]: `` Well , I should think I would , if you do n't mind , Henry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 75]: Henry got the letter out of his wallet , and said he would skip some of the private phrases , if we were willing ; then he went on and read the bulk of it -- a loving , sedate , and altogether charming and gracious piece of handiwork , with a postscript full of affectionate regards and messages to Tom , and Joe , and Charley , and other close friends and neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 23]: As the reader finished , he glanced at Tom , and cried out : `` Oho , you 're at it again !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 12]: Take your hands away , and let me see your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 12]: You always do that when I read a letter from her .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 8]: I will write and tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 10]: `` Oh no , you must n't , Henry .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 18]: I 'm getting old , you know , and any little disappointment makes me want to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 18]: I thought she 'd be here herself , and now you 've got only a letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 12]: `` Well , now , what put that in your head ?
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 12]: I thought everybody knew she was n't coming till Saturday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 3]: `` Saturday !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 11]: Why , come to think , I did know it .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 10]: I wonder what 's the matter with me lately ?
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 5]: Certainly I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 9]: Ai n't we all getting ready for her ?
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 8]: Well , I must be going now .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 14]: But I 'll be on hand when she comes , old man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 51]: Late Friday afternoon another gray veteran tramped over from his cabin a mile or so away , and said the boys wanted to have a little gaiety and a good time Saturday night , if Henry thought she would n't be too tired after her journey to be kept up .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 3]: `` Tired ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 3]: She tired !
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 6]: Oh , hear the man !
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 18]: Joe , YOU know she 'd sit up six weeks to please any one of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 54]: When Joe heard that there was a letter , he asked to have it read , and the loving messages in it for him broke the old fellow all up ; but he said he was such an old wreck that THAT would happen to him if she only just mentioned his name .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 9]: `` Lord , we miss her so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 13]: Saturday afternoon I found I was taking out my watch pretty often .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 28]: Henry noticed it , and said , with a startled look : `` You do n't think she ought to be here soon , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 30]: I felt caught , and a little embarrassed ; but I laughed , and said it was a habit of mine when I was in a state of expenctancy .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 19]: But he did n't seem quite satisfied ; and from that time on he began to show uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 35]: Four times he walked me up the road to a point whence we could see a long distance ; and there he would stand , shading his eyes with his hand , and looking .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 18]: Several times he said : `` I 'm getting worried , I 'm getting right down worried .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 26]: I know she 's not due till about nine o'clock , and yet something seems to be trying to warn me that something 's happened .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 12]: You do n't think anything has happened , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 42]: I began to get pretty thoroughly ashamed of him for his childishness ; and at last , when he repeated that imploring question still another time , I lost my patience for the moment , and spoke pretty brutally to him .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 34]: It seemed to shrivel him up and cow him ; and he looked so wounded and so humble after that , that I detested myself for having done the cruel and unnecessary thing .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 39]: And so I was glad when Charley , another veteran , arrived toward the edge of the evening , and nestled up to Henry to hear the letter read , and talked over the preparations for the welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 23]: Charley fetched out one hearty speech after another , and did his best to drive away his friend 's bodings and apprehensions .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 6]: `` Anything HAPPENED to her ?
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 7]: Henry , that 's pure nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 19]: There is n't anything going to happen to her ; just make your mind easy as to that .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 6]: What did the letter say ?
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 9]: Said she was well , did n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 14]: And said she 'd be here by nine o'clock , did n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 11]: Did you ever know her to fail of her word ?
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: Why , you know you never did .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 28]: Well , then , do n't you fret ; she 'll BE here , and that 's absolutely certain , and as sure as you are born .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 16]: Come , now , let 's get to decorating -- not much time left . ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 19]: Pretty soon Tom and Joe arrived , and then all hands set about adoring the house with flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 40]: Toward nine the three miners said that as they had brought their instruments they might as well tune up , for the boys and girls would soon be arriving now , and hungry for a good , old-fashioned break-down .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 15]: A fiddle , a banjo , and a clarinet -- these were the instruments .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 25]: The trio took their places side by side , and began to play some rattling dance-music , and beat time with their big boots .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 8]: It was getting very close to nine .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 25]: Henry was standing in the door with his eyes directed up the road , his body swaying to the torture of his mental distress .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 26]: He had been made to drink his wife 's health and safety several times , and now Tom shouted : `` All hands stand by !
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 10]: One more drink , and she 's here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 13]: Joe brought the glasses on a waiter , and served the party .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 21]: I reached for one of the two remaining glasses , but Joe growled under his breath : `` Drop that !
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 5]: Take the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 4]: Which I did .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 5]: Henry was served last .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 13]: He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock began to strike .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 26]: He listened till it finished , his face growing pale and paler ; then he said : `` Boys , I 'm sick with fear .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 10]: Help me -- I want to lie down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 7]: They helped him to the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 28]: He began to nestle and drowse , but presently spoke like one talking in his sleep , and said : `` Did I hear horses ' feet ?
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 5]: Have they come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 38]: One of the veterans answered , close to his ear : `` It was Jimmy Parish come to say the party got delayed , but they 're right up the road a piece , and coming along .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 16]: Her horse is lame , but she 'll be here in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 12]: `` Oh , I 'm SO thankful nothing has happened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 13]: He was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 28]: In a moment those handy men had his clothes off , and had tucked him into his bed in the chamber where I had washed my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 8]: They closed the door and came back .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 19]: Then they seemed preparing to leave ; but I said : `` Please do n't go , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 12]: She wo n't know me ; I am a stranger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 6]: They glanced at each other .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 7]: Then Joe said : `` She ?
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 11]: Poor thing , she 's been dead nineteen years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 4]: `` Dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 5]: `` That or worse .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 46]: She went to see her folks half a year after she was married , and on her way back , on a Saturday evening , the Indians captured her within five miles of this place , and she 's never been heard of since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 10]: `` And he lost his mind in consequence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 9]: `` Never has been sane an hour since .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 13]: But he only gets bad when that time of year comes round .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 50]: Then we begin to drop in here , three days before she 's due , to encourage him up , and ask if he 's heard from her , and Saturday we all come and fix up the house with flowers , and get everything ready for a dance .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 10]: We 've done it every year for nineteen years .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 28]: The first Saturday there was twenty-seven of us , without counting the girls ; there 's only three of us now , and the girls are gone .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 64]: We drug him to sleep , or he would go wild ; then he 's all right for another year -- thinks she 's with him till the last three or four days come round ; then he begins to look for her , and gets out his poor old letter , and we come and ask him to read it to us .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 8]: Lord , she was a darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 44]: A HELPLESS SITUATION Once or twice a year I get a letter of a certain pattern , a pattern that never materially changes , in form and substance , yet I can not get used to that letter -- it always astonishes me .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 69]: It affects me as the locomotive always affects me : I saw to myself , `` I have seen you a thousand times , you always look the same way , yet you are always a wonder , and you are always impossible ; to contrive you is clearly beyond human genius -- you ca n't exist , you do n't exist , yet here you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 15]: I have a letter of that kind by me , a very old one .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 12]: I yearn to print it , and where is the harm ?
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 34]: The writer of it is dead years ago , no doubt , and if I conceal her name and address -- her this-world address -- I am sure her shade will not mind .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 21]: And with it I wish to print the answer which I wrote at the time but probably did not send .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 32]: If it went -- which is not likely -- it went in the form of a copy , for I find the original still here , pigeonholed with the said letter .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 44]: To that kind of letters we all write answers which we do not send , fearing to hurt where we have no desire to hurt ; I have done it many a time , and this is doubtless a case of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 12]: THE LETTER X ------ , California , JUNE 3 , 1879 .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 32]: Mr. S. L. Clemens , HARTFORD , CONN. : Dear Sir , -- You will doubtless be surprised to know who has presumed to write and ask a favor of you .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 19]: Let your memory go back to your days in the Humboldt mines -- ' 62 - ' 63 .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 59]: You will remember , you and Clagett and Oliver and the old blacksmith Tillou lived in a lean-to which was half-way up the gulch , and there were six log cabins in the camp -- strung pretty well separated up the gulch from its mouth at the desert to where the last claim was , at the divide .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 38]: The lean-to you lived in was the one with a canvas roof that the cow fell down through one night , as told about by you in ROUGHING IT -- my uncle Simmons remembers it very well .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 20]: He lived in the principal cabin , half-way up the divide , along with Dixon and Parker and Smith .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 22]: It had two rooms , one for kitchen and the other for bunks , and was the only one that had .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 24]: You and your party were there on the great night , the time they had dried-apple-pie , Uncle Simmons often speaks of it .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 44]: It seems curious that dried-apple-pie should have seemed such a great thing , but it was , and it shows how far Humboldt was out of the world and difficult to get to , and how slim the regular bill of fare was .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 10]: Sixteen years ago -- it is a long time .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 10]: I was a little girl then , only fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 10]: I never saw you , I lived in Washoe .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 30]: But Uncle Simmons ran across you every now and then , all during those weeks that you and party were there working your claim which was like the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 21]: The camp played out long and long ago , there was n't silver enough in it to make a button .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 30]: You never saw my husband , but he was there after you left , AND LIVED IN THAT VERY LEAN-TO , a bachelor then but married to me now .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 20]: He often wishes there had been a photographer there in those days , he would have taken the lean-to .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 35]: He got hurt in the old Hal Clayton claim that was abandoned like the others , putting in a blast and not climbing out quick enough , though he scrambled the best he could .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 13]: It landed him clear down on the train and hit a Piute .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 21]: For weeks they thought he would not get over it but he did , and is all right , now .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 5]: Has been ever since .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 17]: This is a long introduction but it is the only way I can make myself known .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 24]: The favor I ask I feel assured your generous heart will grant : Give me some advice about a book I have written .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 24]: I do not claim anything for it only it is mostly true and as interesting as most of the books of the times .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 35]: I am unknown in the literary world and you know what that means unless one has some one of influence -LRB- like yourself -RRB- to help you by speaking a good word for you .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 18]: I would like to place the book on royalty basis plan with any one you would suggest .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 10]: This is a secret from my husband and family .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 13]: I intend it as a surprise in case I get it published .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 37]: Feeling you will take an interest in this and if possible write me a letter to some publisher , or , better still , if you could see them for me and then let me hear .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 10]: I appeal to you to grant me this favor .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 10]: With deepest gratitude I think you for your attention .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 43]: One knows , without inquiring , that the twin of that embarrassing letter is forever and ever flying in this and that and the other direction across the continent in the mails , daily , nightly , hourly , unceasingly , unrestingly .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 57]: It goes to every well-known merchant , and railway official , and manufacturer , and capitalist , and Mayor , and Congressman , and Governor , and editor , and publisher , and author , and broker , and banker -- in a word , to every person who is supposed to have `` influence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 28]: It always follows the one pattern : `` You do not know me , BUT YOU ONCE KNEW A RELATIVE OF MINE , '' etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 67]: We should all like to help the applicants , we should all be glad to do it , we should all like to return the sort of answer that is desired , but -- Well , there is not a thing we can do that would be a help , for not in any instance does that latter ever come from anyone who CAN be helped .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 24]: The struggler whom you COULD help does his own helping ; it would not occur to him to apply to you , stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 28]: He has talent and knows it , and he goes into his fight eagerly and with energy and determination -- all alone , preferring to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 25]: That pathetic letter which comes to you from the incapable , the unhelpable -- how do you who are familiar with it answer it ?
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 7]: What do you find to say ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 16]: You do not want to inflict a wound ; you hunt ways to avoid that .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 5]: What do you find ?
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 14]: How do you get out of your hard place with a contend conscience ?
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 6]: Do you try to explain ?
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 16]: The old reply of mine to such a letter shows that I tried that once .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 7]: Was I satisfied with the result ?
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 13]: Possibly ; and possibly not ; probably not ; almost certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 9]: I have long ago forgotten all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 36]: But , anyway , I append my effort : THE REPLY I know Mr. H. , and I will go to him , dear madam , if upon reflection you find you still desire it .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 6]: There will be a conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 8]: I know the form it will take .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 15]: It will be like this : MR. H. How do her books strike you ?
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 3]: MR. CLEMENS .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 7]: I am not acquainted with them .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 7]: H. Who has been her publisher ?
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 6]: C. I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 7]: She HAS one , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 7]: C. I -- I think not .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 3]: H. Ah .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 8]: You think this is her first book ?
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 7]: C. Yes -- I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 5]: What is it about ?
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 7]: What is the character of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 8]: C. I believe I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 6]: H. Have you seen it ?
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 9]: C. Well -- no , I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 3]: H. Ah-h .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 7]: How long have you known her ?
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 7]: C. I do n't know her .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: H. Do n't know her ?
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 3]: C. No .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 3]: H. Ah-h .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 13]: How did you come to be interested in her book , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 21]: C. Well , she -- she wrote and asked me to find a publisher for her , and mentioned you .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 11]: H. Why should she apply to you instead of me ?
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 2]: C .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 8]: She wished me to use my influence .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 14]: H. Dear me , what has INFLUENCE to do with such a matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 21]: C. Well , I think she thought you would be more likely to examine her book if you were influenced .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 20]: H. Why , what we are here FOR is to examine books -- anybody 's book that comes along .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 5]: It 's our BUSINESS .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 15]: Why should we turn away a book unexamined because it 's a stranger 's ?
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 5]: It would be foolish .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 5]: No publisher does it .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 16]: On what ground did she request your influence , since you do not know her ?
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 14]: She must have thought you knew her literature and could speak for it .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 4]: Is that it ?
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: C. No ; she knew I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 6]: H. Well , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 24]: She had a reason of SOME sort for believing you competent to recommend her literature , and also under obligations to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 10]: C. Yes , I -- I knew her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 5]: H. Knew her UNCLE ?
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 3]: C. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 5]: H. Upon my word !
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 48]: So , you knew her uncle ; her uncle knows her literature ; he endorses it to you ; the chain is complete , nothing further needed ; you are satisfied , and therefore -- C. NO , that is n't all , there are other ties .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 70]: I know the cabin her uncle lived in , in the mines ; I knew his partners , too ; also I came near knowing her husband before she married him , and I DID know the abandoned shaft where a premature blast went off and he went flying through the air and clear down to the trail and hit an Indian in the back with almost fatal consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 9]: H. To HIM , or to the Indian ?
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 2]: C .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 8]: She did n't say which it was .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 7]: H. -LRB- WITH A SIGH -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 6]: It certainly beats the band !
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 55]: You do n't know HER , you do n't know her literature , you do n't know who got hurt when the blast went off , you do n't know a single thing for us to build an estimate of her book upon , so far as I -- C. I knew her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 6]: You are forgetting her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 8]: H. Oh , what use is HE ?
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 6]: Did you know him long ?
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 5]: How long was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 22]: C. Well , I do n't know that I really knew him , but I must have met him , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 24]: I think it was that way ; you ca n't tell about these things , you know , except when they are recent .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 3]: H. Recent ?
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 5]: When was all this ?
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 5]: C. Sixteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 9]: What a basis to judge a book upon !
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 20]: As first you said you knew him , and now you do n't know whether you did or not .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 24]: C. Oh yes , I know him ; anyway , I think I thought I did ; I 'm perfectly certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 10]: What makes you think you thought you knew him ?
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 10]: C. Why , she says I did , herself .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 4]: SHE says so !
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 22]: C. Yes , she does , and I DID know him , too , though I do n't remember it now .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 15]: H. Come -- how can you know it when you do n't remember it .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 8]: C. _ I _ do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 34]: That is , I do n't know the process , but I DO know lots of things that I do n't remember , and remember lots of things that I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 8]: It 's so with every educated person .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 7]: H. -LRB- AFTER A PAUSE -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 5]: Is your time valuable ?
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 8]: C. No -- well , not very .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 4]: H. Mine is .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 12]: So I came away then , because he was looking tired .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 19]: Overwork , I reckon ; I never do that ; I have seen the evil effects of it .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 15]: My mother was always afraid I would overwork myself , but I never did .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 14]: Dear madam , you see how it would happen if I went there .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 60]: He would ask me those questions , and I would try to answer them to suit him , and he would hunt me here and there and yonder and get me embarrassed more and more all the time , and at last he would look tired on account of overwork , and there it would end and nothing done .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 59]: I wish I could be useful to you , but , you see , they do not care for uncles or any of those things ; it does n't move them , it does n't have the least effect , they do n't care for anything but the literature itself , and they as good as despise influence .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 28]: But they do care for books , and are eager to get them and examine them , no matter whence they come , nor from whose pen .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 25]: If you will send yours to a publisher -- any publisher -- he will certainly examine it , I can assure you of that .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 35]: A TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION Consider that a conversation by telephone -- when you are simply siting by and not taking any part in that conversation -- is one of the solemnest curiosities of modern life .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 23]: Yesterday I was writing a deep article on a sublime philosophical subject while such a conversation was going on in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 18]: I notice that one can always write best when somebody is talking through a telephone close by .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 9]: Well , the thing began in this way .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 23]: A member of our household came in and asked me to have our house put into communication with Mr. Bagley 's downtown .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 21]: I have observed , in many cities , that the sex always shrink from calling up the central office themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 10]: I do n't know why , but they do .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 14]: So I touched the bell , and this talk ensued : CENTRAL OFFICE .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 4]: -LRB- GRUFFY . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 2]: Hello !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 7]: I. Is it the Central Office ?
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 7]: C. O. Of course it is .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 5]: What do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 12]: I. Will you switch me on to the Bagleys , please ?
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 5]: C. O. All right .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 8]: Just keep your ear to the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 11]: Then I heard K-LOOK , K-LOOK , K'LOOK -- KLOOK-KLOOK-KLOOK-LOOK-LOOK !
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 18]: then a horrible `` gritting '' of teeth , and finally a piping female voice : Y-e-s ?
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 5]: -LRB- RISING INFLECTION . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 8]: Did you wish to speak to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 15]: Without answering , I handed the telephone to the applicant , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 22]: Then followed that queerest of all the queer things in this world -- a conversation with only one end of it .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 12]: You hear questions asked ; you do n't hear the answer .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 12]: You hear invitations given ; you hear no thanks in return .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 23]: You have listening pauses of dead silence , followed by apparently irrelevant and unjustifiable exclamations of glad surprise or sorrow or dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 28]: You ca n't make head or tail of the talk , because you never hear anything that the person at the other end of the wire says .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 38]: Well , I heard the following remarkable series of observations , all from the one tongue , and all shouted -- for you ca n't ever persuade the sex to speak gently into a telephone : Yes ?
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 7]: Why , how did THAT happen ?
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 5]: What did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 10]: Oh no , I do n't think it was .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 2]: NO !
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 9]: Oh no , I did n't mean THAT .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 21]: I meant , put it in while it is still boiling -- or just before it COMES to a boil .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 2]: WHAT ?
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 12]: I turned it over with a backstitch on the selvage edge .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 30]: Yes , I like that way , too ; but I think it 's better to baste it on with Valenciennes or bombazine , or something of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 13]: It gives it such an air -- and attracts so much noise .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 10]: It 's forty-ninth Deuteronomy , sixty-forth to ninety-seventh inclusive .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 10]: I think we ought all to read it often .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 10]: Perhaps so ; I generally use a hair pin .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 5]: What did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 4]: -LRB- ASIDE . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 6]: Children , do be quiet !
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 3]: Pause OH !
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 3]: B FLAT !
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 12]: Dear me , I thought you said it was the cat !
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 3]: Since WHEN ?
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 10]: Why , _ I _ never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 4]: You astound me !
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 5]: It seems utterly impossible !
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 3]: WHO did ?
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 3]: Good-ness gracious !
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 9]: Well , what IS this world coming to ?
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 6]: Was it right in CHURCH ?
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 6]: And was her MOTHER there ?
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 12]: Why , Mrs. Bagley , I should have died of humiliation !
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 5]: What did they DO ?
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 3]: Long pause .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 33]: I ca n't be perfectly sure , because I have n't the notes by me ; but I think it goes something like this : te-rolly-loll-loll , loll lolly-loll-loll , O tolly-loll-loll-LEE-LY-LI-I-do !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 7]: And then REPEAT , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 25]: Yes , I think it IS very sweet -- and very solemn and impressive , if you get the andantino and the pianissimo right .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 6]: Oh , gum-drops , gum-drops !
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 10]: But I never allow them to eat striped candy .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 15]: And of course they CA N'T , till they get their teeth , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 2]: WHAT ?
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 11]: Oh , not in the least -- go right on .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 11]: He 's here writing -- it does n't bother HIM .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 10]: Very well , I 'll come if I can .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 4]: -LRB- ASIDE . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 19]: Dear me , how it does tire a person 's arm to hold this thing up so long !
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 7]: I wish she 'd -- Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 24]: Oh no , not at all ; I LIKE to talk -- but I 'm afraid I 'm keeping you from your affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 2]: Visitors ?
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 9]: No , we never use butter on them .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 25]: Yes , that is a very good way ; but all the cook-books say they are very unhealthy when they are out of season .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 12]: And HE does n't like them , anyway -- especially canned .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 21]: Oh , I think that is too high for them ; we have never paid over fifty cents a bunch .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 4]: MUST you go ?
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 4]: Well , GOOD-by .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 6]: Yes , I think so .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 2]: GOOD-by .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 10]: Four o'clock , then -- I 'll be ready .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 2]: GOOD-by .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 6]: Thank you ever so much .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 2]: GOOD-by .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 6]: Oh , not at all !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: -- just as fresh -- WHICH ?
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 11]: Oh , I 'm glad to hear you say that .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 2]: GOOD-by .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 22]: -LRB- Hangs up the telephone and says , `` Oh , it DOES tire a person 's arm so ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 18]: A man delivers a single brutal `` Good-by , '' and that is the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 20]: Not so with the gentle sex -- I say it in their praise ; they can not abide abruptness .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 26]: EDWARD MILLS AND GEORGE BENTON : A TALE These two were distantly related to each other -- seventh cousins , or something of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 26]: While still babies they became orphans , and were adopted by the Brants , a childless couple , who quickly grew very fond of them .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 29]: The Brants were always saying : `` Be pure , honest , sober , industrious , and considerate of others , and success in life is assured . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 48]: The children heard this repeated some thousands of times before they understood it ; they could repeat it themselves long before they could say the Lord 's Prayer ; it was painted over the nursery door , and was about the first thing they learned to read .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 14]: It was destined to be the unswerving rule of Edward Mills 's life .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 32]: Sometimes the Brants changed the wording a little , and said : `` Be pure , honest , sober , industrious , considerate , and you will never lack friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 10]: Baby Mills was a comfort to everybody about him .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 21]: When he wanted candy and could not have it , he listened to reason , and contented himself without it .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 15]: When Baby Benton wanted candy , he cried for it until he got it .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 49]: Baby Mills took care of his toys ; Baby Benton always destroyed his in a very brief time , and then made himself so insistently disagreeable that , in order to have peace in the house , little Edward was persuaded to yield up his play-things to him .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 42]: When the children were a little older , Georgie became a heavy expense in one respect : he took no care of his clothes ; consequently , he shone frequently in new ones , with was not the case with Eddie .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 5]: The boys grew apace .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 11]: Eddie was an increasing comfort , Georgie an increasing solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 46]: It was always sufficient to say , in answer to Eddie 's petitions , `` I would rather you would not do it '' -- meaning swimming , skating , picnicking , berrying , circusing , and all sorts of things which boys delight in .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 27]: But NO answer was sufficient for Georgie ; he had to be humored in his desires , or he would carry them with a high hand .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 25]: Naturally , no boy got more swimming skating , berrying , and so forth than he ; no body ever had a better time .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 47]: The good Brants did not allow the boys to play out after nine in summer evenings ; they were sent to bed at that hour ; Eddie honorably remained , but Georgie usually slipped out of the window toward ten , and enjoyed himself until midnight .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 31]: It seemed impossible to break Georgie of this bad habit , but the Brants managed it at last by hiring him , with apples and marbles , to stay in .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 49]: The good Brants gave all their time and attention to vain endeavors to regulate Georgie ; they said , with grateful tears in their eyes , that Eddie needed no efforts of theirs , he was so good , so considerate , and in all ways so perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 29]: By and by the boys were big enough to work , so they were apprenticed to a trade : Edward went voluntarily ; George was coaxed and bribed .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 49]: Edward worked hard and faithfully , and ceased to be an expense to the good Brants ; they praised him , so did his master ; but George ran away , and it cost Mr. Brant both money and trouble to hunt him up and get him back .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: By and by he ran away again -- more money and more trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 17]: He ran away a third time -- and stole a few things to carry with him .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 36]: Trouble and expense for Mr. Brant once more ; and , besides , it was with the greatest difficulty that he succeeded in persuading the master to let the youth go unprosecuted for the theft .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 18]: Edward worked steadily along , and in time became a full partner in his master 's business .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 31]: George did not improve ; he kept the loving hearts of his aged benefactors full of trouble , and their hands full of inventive activities to protect him from ruin .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 64]: Edward , as a boy , had interested himself in Sunday-schools , debating societies , penny missionary affairs , anti-tobacco organizations , anti-profanity associations , and all such things ; as a man , he was a quiet but steady and reliable helper in the church , the temperance societies , and in all movements looking to the aiding and uplifting of men .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 18]: This excited no remark , attracted no attention -- for it was his `` natural bent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 7]: Finally , the old people died .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 42]: The will testified their loving pride in Edward , and left their little property to George -- because he `` needed it '' ; whereas , `` owing to a bountiful Providence , '' such was not the case with Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 33]: The property was left to George conditionally : he must buy out Edward 's partner with it ; else it must go to a benevolent organization called the Prisoner 's Friend Society .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 34]: The old people left a letter , in which they begged their dear son Edward to take their place and watch over George , and help and shield him as they had done .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 13]: Edward dutifully acquiesced , and George became his partner in the business .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 34]: He was not a valuable partner : he had been meddling with drink before ; he soon developed into a constant tippler now , and his flesh and eyes showed the fact unpleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 14]: Edward had been courting a sweet and kindly spirited girl for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 67]: They loved each other dearly , and -- But about this period George began to haunt her tearfully and imploringly , and at last she went crying to Edward , and said her high and holy duty was plain before her -- she must not let her own selfish desires interfere with it : she must marry `` poor George '' and `` reform him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 20]: It would break her heart , she knew it would , and so on ; but duty was duty .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 20]: So she married George , and Edward 's heart came very near breaking , as well as her own .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 19]: However , Edward recovered , and married another girl -- a very excellent one she was , too .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 6]: Children came to both families .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 17]: Mary did her honest best to reform her husband , but the contract was too large .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 20]: George went on drinking , and by and by he fell to misusing her and the little ones sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 38]: A great many good people strove with George -- they were always at it , in fact -- but he calmly took such efforts as his due and their duty , and did not mend his ways .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 12]: He added a vice , presently -- that of secret gambling .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 49]: He got deeply in debt ; he borrowed money on the firm 's credit , as quietly as he could , and carried this system so far and so successfully that one morning the sheriff took possession of the establishment , and the two cousins found themselves penniless .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 11]: Times were hard , now , and they grew worse .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 19]: Edward moved his family into a garret , and walked the streets day and night , seeking work .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 14]: He begged for it , but it was really not to be had .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 35]: He was astonished to see how soon his face became unwelcome ; he was astonished and hurt to see how quickly the ancient interest which people had had in him faded out and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 21]: Still , he MUST get work ; so he swallowed his chagrin , and toiled on in search of it .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 36]: At last he got a job of carrying bricks up a ladder in a hod , and was a grateful man in consequence ; but after that NOBODY knew him or cared anything about him .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 36]: He was not able to keep up his dues in the various moral organizations to which he belonged , and had to endure the sharp pain of seeing himself brought under the disgrace of suspension .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 19]: But the faster Edward died out of public knowledge and interest , the faster George rose in them .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 15]: He was found lying , ragged and drunk , in the gutter one morning .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 38]: A member of the Ladies ' Temperance Refuge fished him out , took him in hand , got up a subscription for him , kept him sober a whole week , then got a situation for him .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 7]: An account of it was published .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 28]: General attention was thus drawn to the poor fellow , and a great many people came forward and helped him toward reform with their countenance and encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 19]: He did not drink a drop for two months , and meantime was the pet of the good .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 16]: Then he fell -- in the gutter ; and there was general sorrow and lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 8]: But the noble sisterhood rescued him again .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 26]: They cleaned him up , they fed him , they listened to the mournful music of his repentances , they got him his situation again .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 33]: An account of this , also , was published , and the town was drowned in happy tears over the re-restoration of the poor beast and struggling victim of the fatal bowl .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 59]: A grand temperance revival was got up , and after some rousing speeches had been made the chairman said , impressively : `` We are not about to call for signers ; and I think there is a spectacle in store for you which not many in this house will be able to view with dry eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 33]: There was an eloquent pause , and then George Benton , escorted by a red-sashed detachment of the Ladies of the Refuge , stepped forward upon the platform and signed the pledge .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 13]: The air was rent with applause , and everybody cried for joy .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 33]: Everybody wrung the hand of the new convert when the meeting was over ; his salary was enlarged next day ; he was the talk of the town , and its hero .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 7]: An account of it was published .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 29]: George Benton fell , regularly , every three months , but was faithfully rescued and wrought with , every time , and good situations were found for him .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 28]: Finally , he was taken around the country lecturing , as a reformed drunkard , and he had great houses and did an immense amount of good .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 40]: He was so popular at home , and so trusted -- during his sober intervals -- that he was enabled to use the name of a principal citizen , and get a large sum of money at the bank .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 34]: A mighty pressure was brought to bear to save him from the consequences of his forgery , and it was partially successful -- he was `` sent up '' for only two years .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 68]: When , at the end of a year , the tireless efforts of the benevolent were crowned with success , and he emerged from the penitentiary with a pardon in his pocket , the Prisoner 's Friend Society met him at the door with a situation and a comfortable salary , and all the other benevolent people came forward and gave him advice , encouragement and help .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 32]: Edward Mills had once applied to the Prisoner 's Friend Society for a situation , when in dire need , but the question , `` Have you been a prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 7]: made brief work of his case .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 18]: While all these things were going on , Edward Mills had been quietly making head against adversity .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 26]: He was still poor , but was in receipt of a steady and sufficient salary , as the respected and trusted cashier of a bank .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 16]: George Benton never came near him , and was never heard to inquire about him .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 22]: George got to indulging in long absences from the town ; there were ill reports about him , but nothing definite .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 21]: One winter 's night some masked burglars forced their way into the bank , and found Edward Mills there alone .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 19]: They commanded him to reveal the `` combination , '' so that they could get into the safe .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 3]: He refused .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 5]: They threatened his life .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 17]: He said his employers trusted him , and he could not be traitor to that trust .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 27]: He could die , if he must , but while he lived he would be faithful ; he would not yield up the `` combination . ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 5]: The burglars killed him .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 16]: The detectives hunted down the criminals ; the chief one proved to be George Benton .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 63]: A wide sympathy was felt for the widow and orphans of the dead man , and all the newspapers in the land begged that all the banks in the land would testify their appreciation of the fidelity and heroism of the murdered cashier by coming forward with a generous contribution of money in aid of his family , now bereft of support .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 31]: The result was a mass of solid cash amounting to upward of five hundred dollars -- an average of nearly three-eights of a cent for each bank in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 47]: The cashier 's own bank testified its gratitude by endeavoring to show -LRB- but humiliatingly failed in it -RRB- that the peerless servant 's accounts were not square , and that he himself had knocked his brains out with a bludgeon to escape detection and punishment .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 7]: George Benton was arraigned for trial .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 16]: Then everybody seemed to forget the widow and orphans in their solicitude for poor George .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 24]: Everything that money and influence could do was done to save him , but it all failed ; he was sentenced to death .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 37]: Straightway the Governor was besieged with petitions for commutation or pardon ; they were brought by tearful young girls ; by sorrowful old maids ; by deputations of pathetic widows ; by shoals of impressive orphans .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 13]: But no , the Governor -- for once -- would not yield .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 6]: Now George Benton experienced religion .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 7]: The glad news flew all around .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 50]: From that time forth his cell was always full of girls and women and fresh flowers ; all the day long there was prayer , and hymn-singing , and thanksgiving , and homilies , and tears , with never an interruption , except an occasional five-minute intermission for refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 38]: This sort of thing continued up to the very gallows , and George Benton went proudly home , in the black cap , before a wailing audience of the sweetest and best that the region could produce .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 36]: His grave had fresh flowers on it every day , for a while , and the head-stone bore these words , under a hand pointing aloft : `` He has fought the good fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 45]: The brave cashier 's head-stone has this inscription : `` Be pure , honest , sober , industrious , considerate , and you will never -- '' Nobody knows who gave the order to leave it that way , but it was so given .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 56]: The cashier 's family are in stringent circumstances , now , it is said ; but no matter ; a lot of appreciative people , who were not willing that an act so brave and true as his should go unrewarded , have collected forty-two thousand dollars -- and built a Memorial Church with it .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 28]: THE FIVE BOONS OF LIFE Chapter I In the morning of life came a good fairy with her basket , and said : `` Here are gifts .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: Take one , leave the others .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 12]: And be wary , chose wisely ; oh , choose wisely !
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 9]: for only one of them is valuable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 15]: The gifts were five : Fame , Love , Riches , Pleasure , Death .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 20]: The youth said , eagerly : `` There is no need to consider '' ; and he chose Pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 16]: He went out into the world and sought out the pleasures that youth delights in .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 22]: But each in its turn was short-lived and disappointing , vain and empty ; and each , departing , mocked him .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 13]: In the end he said : `` These years I have wasted .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 13]: If I could but choose again , I would choose wisely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 16]: Chapter II The fairy appeared , and said : `` Four of the gifts remain .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 22]: Choose once more ; and oh , remember -- time is flying , and only one of them is precious . ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 23]: The man considered long , then chose Love ; and did not mark the tears that rose in the fairy 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 17]: After many , many years the man sat by a coffin , in an empty home .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 32]: And he communed with himself , saying : `` One by one they have gone away and left me ; and now she lies here , the dearest and the last .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 31]: Desolation after desolation has swept over me ; for each hour of happiness the treacherous trader , Love , as sold me I have paid a thousand hours of grief .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 11]: Out of my heart of hearts I curse him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 7]: Chapter III `` Choose again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 6]: It was the fairy speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 14]: `` The years have taught you wisdom -- surely it must be so .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 4]: Three gifts remain .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 16]: Only one of them has any worth -- remember it , and choose warily . ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 19]: The man reflected long , then chose Fame ; and the fairy , sighing , went her way .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 24]: Years went by and she came again , and stood behind the man where he sat solitary in the fading day , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 32]: And she knew his thought : `` My name filled the world , and its praises were on every tongue , and it seemed well with me for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 7]: How little a while it was !
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 16]: Then came envy ; then detraction ; then calumny ; then hate ; then persecution .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 11]: Then derision , which is the beginning of the end .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 14]: And last of all came pity , which is the funeral of fame .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 9]: Oh , the bitterness and misery of renown !
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 16]: target for mud in its prime , for contempt and compassion in its decay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 8]: Chapter IV `` Chose yet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: It was the fairy 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 5]: `` Two gifts remain .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 5]: And do not despair .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 18]: In the beginning there was but one that was precious , and it is still here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 7]: `` Wealth -- which is power !
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 6]: How blind I was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 13]: `` Now , at last , life will be worth the living .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 8]: I will spend , squander , dazzle .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 23]: These mockers and despisers will crawl in the dirt before me , and I will feed my hungry heart with their envy .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 25]: I will have all luxuries , all joys , all enchantments of the spirit , all contentments of the body that man holds dear .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 8]: I will buy , buy , buy !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 23]: deference , respect , esteem , worship -- every pinchbeck grace of life the market of a trivial world can furnish forth .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 32]: I have lost much time , and chosen badly heretofore , but let that pass ; I was ignorant then , and could but take for best what seemed so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 58]: Three short years went by , and a day came when the man sat shivering in a mean garret ; and he was gaunt and wan and hollow-eyed , and clothed in rags ; and he was gnawing a dry crust and mumbling : `` Curse all the world 's gifts , for mockeries and gilded lies !
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 6]: And miscalled , every one .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 9]: They are not gifts , but merely lendings .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 25]: Pleasure , Love , Fame , Riches : they are but temporary disguises for lasting realities -- Pain , Grief , Shame , Poverty .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 25]: The fairy said true ; in all her store there was but one gift which was precious , only one that was not valueless .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 54]: How poor and cheap and mean I know those others now to be , compared with that inestimable one , that dear and sweet and kindly one , that steeps in dreamless and enduring sleep the pains that persecute the body , and the shames and griefs that eat the mind and heart .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 3]: Bring it !
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 9]: I am weary , I would rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 18]: Chapter V The fairy came , bringing again four of the gifts , but Death was wanting .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 17]: She said : `` I gave it to a mother 's pet , a little child .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 15]: It was ignorant , but trusted me , asking me to choose for it .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 9]: You did not ask me to choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: `` Oh , miserable me !
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 7]: What is left for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 16]: `` What not even you have deserved : the wanton insult of Old Age . ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 42]: THE FIRST WRITING-MACHINES From My Unpublished Autobiography Some days ago a correspondent sent in an old typewritten sheet , faded by age , containing the following letter over the signature of Mark Twain : `` Hartford , March 10 , 1875 .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 11]: `` Please do not use my name in any way .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 13]: Please do not even divulge that fact that I own a machine .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 55]: I have entirely stopped using the typewriter , for the reason that I never could write a letter with it to anybody without receiving a request by return mail that I would not only describe the machine , but state what progress I had made in the use of it , etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 25]: I do n't like to write letters , and so I do n't want people to know I own this curiosity-breeding little joker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 27]: A note was sent to Mr. Clemens asking him if the letter was genuine and whether he really had a typewriter as long ago as that .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 18]: Mr. Clemens replied that his best answer is the following chapter from his unpublished autobiography : 1904 .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 7]: VILLA QUARTO , FLORENCE , JANUARY .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 37]: Dictating autobiography to a typewriter is a new experience for me , but it goes very well , and is going to save time and `` language '' -- the kind of language that soothes vexation .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 12]: I have dictated to a typewriter before -- but not autobiography .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 18]: Between that experience and the present one there lies a mighty gap -- more than thirty years !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 6]: It is sort of lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 20]: In that wide interval much has happened -- to the type-machine as well as to the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 12]: At the beginning of that interval a type-machine was a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 11]: The person who owned one was a curiosity , too .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 20]: But now it is the other way about : the person who DOES N'T own one is a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 13]: I saw a type-machine for the first time in -- what year ?
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 21]: I suppose it was 1873 -- because Nasby was with me at the time , and it was in Boston .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 19]: We must have been lecturing , or we could not have been in Boston , I take it .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 7]: I quitted the platform that season .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 11]: But never mind about that , it is no matter .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 18]: Nasby and I saw the machine through a window , and went in to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 36]: The salesman explained it to us , showed us samples of its work , and said it could do fifty-seven words a minute -- a statement which we frankly confessed that we did not believe .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 16]: So he put his type-girl to work , and we timed her by the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 9]: She actually did the fifty-seven in sixty seconds .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 14]: We were partly convinced , but said it probably could n't happen again .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 4]: But it did .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 19]: We timed the girl over and over again -- with the same result always : she won out .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 27]: She did her work on narrow slips of paper , and we pocketed them as fast as she turned them out , to show as curiosities .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 12]: The price of the machine was one hundred and twenty-five dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 12]: I bought one , and we went away very much excited .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 22]: At the hotel we got out our slips and were a little disappointed to find that they contained the same words .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 17]: The girl had economized time and labor by using a formula which she knew by heart .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 47]: However , we argued -- safely enough -- that the FIRST type-girl must naturally take rank with the first billiard-player : neither of them could be expected to get out of the game any more than a third or a half of what was in it .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 31]: If the machine survived -- IF it survived -- experts would come to the front , by and by , who would double the girl 's output without a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 16]: They would do one hundred words a minute -- my talking speed on the platform .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 8]: That score has long ago been beaten .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 60]: At home I played with the toy , repeated and repeating and repeated `` The Boy stood on the Burning Deck , '' until I could turn that boy 's adventure out at the rate of twelve words a minute ; then I resumed the pen , for business , and only worked the machine to astonish inquiring visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 13]: They carried off many reams of the boy and his burning deck .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 26]: By and by I hired a young woman , and did my first dictating -LRB- letters , merely -RRB- , and my last until now .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 19]: The machine did not do both capitals and lower case -LRB- as now -RRB- , but only capitals .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 9]: Gothic capitals they were , and sufficiently ugly .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 20]: I remember the first letter I dictated , it was to Edward Bok , who was a boy then .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 10]: I was not acquainted with him at that time .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 16]: His present enterprising spirit is not new -- he had it in that early day .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 20]: He was accumulating autographs , and was not content with mere signatures , he wanted a whole autograph LETTER .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 12]: I furnished it -- in type-written capitals , SIGNATURE AND ALL .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 16]: It was long ; it was a sermon ; it contained advice ; also reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 37]: I said writing was my TRADE , my bread-and-butter ; I said it was not fair to ask a man to give away samples of his trade ; would he ask the blacksmith for a horseshoe ?
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 9]: would he ask the doctor for a corpse ?
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 13]: Now I come to an important matter -- as I regard it .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 20]: In the year '74 the young woman copied a considerable part of a book of mine ON THE MACHINE .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 55]: In a previous chapter of this Autobiography I have claimed that I was the first person in the world that ever had a telephone in the house for practical purposes ; I will now claim -- until dispossess -- that I was the first person in the world to APPLY THE TYPE-MACHINE TO LITERATURE .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 11]: That book must have been THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 19]: I wrote the first half of it in ' 72 , the rest of it in ' 74 .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 19]: My machinist type-copied a book for me in ' 74 , so I concluded it was that one .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 15]: That early machine was full of caprices , full of defects -- devilish ones .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 13]: It had as many immoralities as the machine of today has virtues .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 24]: After a year or two I found that it was degrading my character , so I thought I would give it to Howells .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 23]: He was reluctant , for he was suspicious of novelties and unfriendly toward them , and he remains so to this day .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 5]: But I persuaded him .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 24]: He had great confidence in me , and I got him to believe things about the machine that I did not believe myself .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 20]: He took it home to Boston , and my morals began to improve , but his have never recovered .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 13]: He kept it six months , and then returned it to me .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 18]: I gave it away twice after that , but it would n't stay ; it came back .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 36]: Then I gave it to our coachman , Patrick McAleer , who was very grateful , because he did not know the animal , and thought I was trying to make him wiser and better .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 32]: As soon as he got wiser and better he traded it to a heretic for a side-saddle which he could not use , and there my knowledge of its history ends .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 29]: ITALIAN WITHOUT A MASTER It is almost a fortnight now that I am domiciled in a medieval villa in the country , a mile or two from Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 46]: I can not speak the language ; I am too old not to learn how , also too busy when I am busy , and too indolent when I am not ; wherefore some will imagine that I am having a dull time of it .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 6]: But it is not so .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 42]: The `` help '' are all natives ; they talk Italian to me , I answer in English ; I do not understand them , they do not understand me , consequently no harm is done , and everybody is satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 26]: In order to be just and fair , I throw in an Italian word when I have one , and this has a good influence .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 10]: I get the word out of the morning paper .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 23]: I have to use it while it is fresh , for I find that Italian words do not keep in this climate .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 12]: They fade toward night , and next morning they are gone .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 28]: But it is no matter ; I get a new one out of the paper before breakfast , and thrill the domestics with it while it lasts .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 25]: I have no dictionary , and I do not want one ; I can select words by the sound , or by orthographic aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 24]: Many of them have French or German or English look , and these are the ones I enslave for the day 's service .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 7]: That is , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 3]: Not always .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 52]: If I find a learnable phrase that has an imposing look and warbles musically along I do not care to know the meaning of it ; I pay it out to the first applicant , knowing that if I pronounce it carefully HE will understand it , and that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 6]: Yesterday 's word was AVANTI .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 13]: It sounds Shakespearian , and probably means Avaunt and quit my sight .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 10]: Today I have a whole phrase : SONO DISPIACENTISSIMO .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 19]: I do not know what it means , but it seems to fit in everywhere and give satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 56]: Although as a rule my words and phrases are good for one day and train only , I have several that stay by me all the time , for some unknown reason , and these come very handy when I get into a long conversation and need things to fire up with in monotonous stretches .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 13]: One of the best ones is DOV ' ` E IL GATTO .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 24]: It nearly always produces a pleasant surprise , therefore I save it up for places where I want to express applause or admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 21]: The fourth word has a French sound , and I think the phrase means `` that takes the cake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 32]: During my first week in the deep and dreamy stillness of this woodsy and flowery place I was without news of the outside world , and was well content without it .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 37]: It has been four weeks since I had seen a newspaper , and this lack seemed to give life a new charm and grace , and to saturate it with a feeling verging upon actual delight .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 24]: Then came a change that was to be expected : the appetite for news began to rise again , after this invigorating rest .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 37]: I had to feed it , but I was not willing to let it make me its helpless slave again ; I determined to put it on a diet , and a strict and limited one .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 21]: So I examined an Italian paper , with the idea of feeding it on that , and on that exclusively .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 11]: On that exclusively , and without help of a dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 14]: In this way I should surely be well protected against overloading and indigestion .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 11]: A glance at the telegraphic page filled me with encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 5]: There were no scare-heads .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 7]: That was good -- supremely good .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 62]: But there were headings -- one-liners and two-liners -- and that was good too ; for without these , one must do as one does with a German paper -- pay our precious time in finding out what an article is about , only to discover , in many cases , that there is nothing in it of interest to you .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 7]: The headline is a valuable thing .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 57]: Necessarily we are all fond of murders , scandals , swindles , robberies , explosions , collisions , and all such things , when we knew the people , and when they are neighbors and friends , but when they are strangers we do not get any great pleasure out of them , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 38]: Now the trouble with an American paper is that it has no discrimination ; it rakes the whole earth for blood and garbage , and the result is that you are daily overfed and suffer a surfeit .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 32]: By habit you stow this muck every day , but you come by and by to take no vital interest in it -- indeed , you almost get tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 32]: As a rule , forty-nine-fiftieths of it concerns strangers only -- people away off yonder , a thousand miles , two thousand miles , ten thousand miles from where you are .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 18]: Why , when you come to think of it , who cares what becomes of those people ?
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 18]: I would not give the assassination of one personal friend for a whole massacre of those others .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 29]: And , to my mind , one relative or neighbor mixed up in a scandal is more interesting than a whole Sodom and Gomorrah of outlanders gone rotten .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 8]: Give me the home product every time .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 42]: I saw at a glance that the Florentine paper would suit me : five out of six of its scandals and tragedies were local ; they were adventures of one 's very neighbors , one might almost say one 's friends .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 17]: In the matter of world news there was not too much , but just about enough .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 3]: I subscribed .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 9]: I have had no occasion to regret it .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 23]: Every morning I get all the news I need for the day ; sometimes from the headlines , sometimes from the text .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 11]: I have never had to call for a dictionary yet .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 7]: I read the paper with ease .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 24]: Often I do not quite understand , often some of the details escape me , but no matter , I get the idea .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 48]: I will cut out a passage or two , then you see how limpid the language is : Il ritorno dei Beati d'Italia Elargizione del Re all ' Ospedale italiano The first line means that the Italian sovereigns are coming back -- they have been to England .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 16]: The second line seems to mean that they enlarged the King at the Italian hospital .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 7]: With a banquet , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 7]: An English banquet has that effect .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 15]: Further : Il ritorno dei Sovrani a Roma ROMA , 24 , ore 22,50 .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 16]: -- I Sovrani e le Principessine Reali si attendono a Roma domani alle ore 15,51 .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 10]: Return of the sovereigns to Rome , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 16]: Date of the telegram , Rome , November 24 , ten minutes before twenty-three o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 26]: The telegram seems to say , `` The Sovereigns and the Royal Children expect themselves at Rome tomorrow at fifty-one minutes after fifteen o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 25]: I do not know about Italian time , but I judge it begins at midnight and runs through the twenty-four hours without breaking bulk .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 12]: In the following ad , the theaters open at half-past twenty .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 16]: If these are not matinees , 20.30 must mean 8.30 P.M. , by my reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 15]: Spettacolli del di 25 TEATRO DELLA PERGOLA -- -LRB- Ore 20,30 -RRB- -- Opera .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 4]: BOH ` EME .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 3]: TEATRO ALFIERI .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 13]: -- Compagnia drammatica Drago -- -LRB- Ore 20,30 -RRB- -- LA LEGGE .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 10]: ALHAMBRA -- -LRB- Ore 20,30 -RRB- -- Spettacolo variato .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 10]: SALA EDISON -- Grandiosoo spettacolo Cinematografico : QUO VADIS ?
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 34]: -- Inaugurazione della Chiesa Russa -- In coda al Direttissimo -- Vedute di Firenze con gran movimeno -- America : Transporto tronchi giganteschi -- I ladri in casa del Diavolo -- Scene comiche .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 7]: CINEMATOGRAFO -- Via Brunelleschi n. 4 .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 10]: -- Programma straordinario , DON CHISCIOTTE -- Prezzi populari .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 27]: The whole of that is intelligible to me -- and sane and rational , too -- except the remark about the Inauguration of a Russian Chinese .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 6]: That one oversizes my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 5]: Give me five cards .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 43]: This is a four-page paper ; and as it is set in long primer leaded and has a page of advertisements , there is no room for the crimes , disasters , and general sweepings of the outside world -- thanks be !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 23]: Today I find only a single importation of the off-color sort : Una Principessa che fugge con un cocchiere PARIGI , 24 .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 15]: -- Il MATIN ha da Berlino che la principessa Schovenbare-Waldenbure scomparve il 9 novembre .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 6]: Sarebbe partita col suo cocchiere .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 6]: La Principassa ha 27 anni .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 14]: Twenty-seven years old , and scomparve -- scampered -- on the 9th November .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 13]: You see by the added detail that she departed with her coachman .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 20]: I hope Sarebbe has not made a mistake , but I am afraid the chances are that she has .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 3]: SONO DISPIACENTISSIMO .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 11]: There are several fires : also a couple of accidents .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 63]: This is one of them : Grave disgrazia sul Ponte Vecchio Stammattina , circe le 7,30 , mentre Giuseppe Sciatti , di anni 55 , di Casellina e Torri , passava dal Ponte Vecchio , stando seduto sopra un barroccio carico di verdura , perse l' equilibrio e cadde al suolo , rimanendo con la gamba destra sotto una ruota del veicolo .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 27]: Lo Sciatti fu subito raccolto da alcuni cittadini , che , per mezzo della pubblica vettura n. 365 , lo transporto a San Giovanni di Dio .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 24]: Ivi il medico di guardia gli riscontro la frattura della gamba destra e alcune lievi escoriazioni giudicandolo guaribile in 50 giorni salvo complicazioni .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 17]: What it seems to say is this : `` Serious Disgrace on the Old Old Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 35]: This morning about 7.30 , Mr. Joseph Sciatti , aged 55 , of Casellina and Torri , while standing up in a sitting posture on top of a carico barrow of vedure -LRB- foliage ?
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 2]: hay ?
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 3]: vegetables ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 23]: , lost his equilibrium and fell on himself , arriving with his left leg under one of the wheels of the vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 11]: `` Said Sciatti was suddenly harvested -LRB- gathered in ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 20]: by several citizens , who by means of public cab No. 365 transported to St. John of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 60]: Paragraph No. 3 is a little obscure , but I think it says that the medico set the broken left leg -- right enough , since there was nothing the matter with the other one -- and that several are encouraged to hope that fifty days well fetch him around in quite giudicandolo-guaribile way , if no complications intervene .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 8]: I am sure I hope so myself .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 32]: There is a great and peculiar charm about reading news-scraps in a language which you are not acquainted with -- the charm that always goes with the mysterious and the uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 45]: You can never be absolutely sure of the meaning of anything you read in such circumstances ; you are chasing an alert and gamy riddle all the time , and the baffling turns and dodges of the prey make the life of the hunt .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 6]: A dictionary would spoil it .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 48]: Sometimes a single word of doubtful purport will cast a veil of dreamy and golden uncertainty over a whole paragraph of cold and practical certainties , and leave steeped in a haunting and adorable mystery an incident which had been vulgar and commonplace but for that benefaction .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 13]: Would you be wise to draw a dictionary on that gracious word ?
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 6]: would you be properly grateful ?
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 21]: After a couple of days ' rest I now come back to my subject and seek a case in point .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 22]: I find it without trouble , in the morning paper ; a cablegram from Chicago and Indiana by way of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 21]: All the words save one are guessable by a person ignorant of Italian : Revolverate in teatro PARIGI , 27 .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 46]: -- La PATRIE ha da Chicago : Il guardiano del teatro dell ` opera di Walace -LRB- Indiana -RRB- , avendo voluto espellare uno spettatore che continuava a fumare malgrado il diviety , questo spalleggiato dai suoi amici tir ` o diversi colpi di rivoltella .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 4]: Il guardiano ripose .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 5]: Nacque una scarica generale .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 6]: Grande panico tra gli spettatori .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 3]: Nessun ferito .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 2]: TRANSLATION .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 6]: -- `` Revolveration in Theater .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 4]: PARIS , 27TH .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 46]: LA PATRIE has from Chicago : The cop of the theater of the opera of Wallace , Indiana , had willed to expel a spectator which continued to smoke in spite of the prohibition , who , spalleggiato by his friends , tire -LRB- Fr .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 14]: TIRE , Anglice PULLED -RRB- manifold revolver-shots ; great panic among the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 4]: Nobody hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 43]: It is bettable that that harmless cataclysm in the theater of the opera of Wallace , Indiana , excited not a person in Europe but me , and so came near to not being worth cabling to Florence by way of France .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 6]: But it does excite me .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 25]: It excites me because I can not make out , for sure , what it was that moved the spectator to resist the officer .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 27]: I was gliding along smoothly and without obstruction or accident , until I came to that word `` spalleggiato , '' then the bottom fell out .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 24]: You notice what a rich gloom , what a somber and pervading mystery , that word sheds all over the whole Wallachian tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 15]: That is the charm of the thing , that is the delight of it .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 12]: This is where you begin , this is where you revel .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 55]: You can guess and guess , and have all the fun you like ; you need not be afraid there will be an end to it ; none is possible , for no amount of guessing will ever furnish you a meaning for that word that you can be sure is the right one .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 37]: All the other words give you hints , by their form , their sound , or their spelling -- this one does n't , this one throws out no hints , this one keeps its secret .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 35]: If there is even the slightest slight shadow of a hint anywhere , it lies in the very meagerly suggestive fact that `` spalleggiato '' carries our word `` egg '' in its stomach .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 16]: Well , make the most out of it , and then where are you at ?
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 63]: You conjecture that the spectator which was smoking in spite of the prohibition and become reprohibited by the guardians , was `` egged on '' by his friends , and that was owing to that evil influence that he initiated the revolveration in theater that has galloped under the sea and come crashing through the European press without exciting anybody but me .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 18]: But are you sure , are you dead sure , that that was the way of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 15]: Then the uncertainty remains , the mystery abides , and with it the charm .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 3]: Guess again .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 36]: If I had a phrase-book of a really satisfactory sort I would study it , and not give all my free time to undictionarial readings , but there is no such work on the market .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 6]: The existing phrase-books are inadequate .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 28]: They are well enough as far as they go , but when you fall down and skin your leg they do n't tell you what to say .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 41]: ITALIAN WITH GRAMMAR I found that a person of large intelligence could read this beautiful language with considerable facility without a dictionary , but I presently found that to such a parson a grammar could be of use at times .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 32]: It is because , if he does not know the WERE 'S and the WAS 'S and the MAYBE 'S and the HAS-BEENS 'S apart , confusions and uncertainties can arise .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 27]: He can get the idea that a thing is going to happen next week when the truth is that it has already happened week before last .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 6]: Even more previously , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 73]: Examination and inquiry showed me that the adjectives and such things were frank and fair-minded and straightforward , and did not shuffle ; it was the Verb that mixed the hands , it was the Verb that lacked stability , it was the Verb that had no permanent opinion about anything , it was the Verb that was always dodging the issue and putting out the light and making all the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 26]: Further examination , further inquiry , further reflection , confirmed this judgment , and established beyond peradventure the fact that the Verb was the storm-center .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 42]: This discovery made plain the right and wise course to pursue in order to acquire certainty and exactness in understanding the statements which the newspaper was daily endeavoring to convey to me : I must catch a Verb and tame it .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 67]: I must find out its ways , I must spot its eccentricities , I must penetrate its disguises , I must intelligently foresee and forecast at least the commoner of the dodges it was likely to try upon a stranger in given circumstances , I must get in on its main shifts and head them off , I must learn its game and play the limit .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 52]: I had noticed , in other foreign languages , that verbs are bred in families , and that the members of each family have certain features or resemblances that are common to that family and distinguish it from the other families -- the other kin , the cousins and what not .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 76]: I had noticed that this family-mark is not usually the nose or the hair , so to speak , but the tail -- the Termination -- and that these tails are quite definitely differentiated ; insomuch that an expert can tell a Pluperfect from a Subjunctive by its tail as easily and as certainly as a cowboy can tell a cow from a horse by the like process , the result of observation and culture .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 24]: I should explain that I am speaking of legitimate verbs , those verbs which in the slang of the grammar are called Regular .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 43]: There are other -- I am not meaning to conceal this ; others called Irregulars , born out of wedlock , of unknown and uninteresting parentage , and naturally destitute of family resemblances , as regards to all features , tails included .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 11]: But of these pathetic outcasts I have nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 33]: I do not approve of them , I do not encourage them ; I am prudishly delicate and sensitive , and I do not allow them to be used in my presence .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 21]: But , as I have said , I decided to catch one of the others and break it into harness .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 4]: One is enough .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 60]: Once familiar with its assortment of tails , you are immune ; after that , no regular verb can conceal its specialty from you and make you think it is working the past or the future or the conditional or the unconditional when it is engaged in some other line of business -- its tail will give it away .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 13]: I found out all these things by myself , without a teacher .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 9]: I selected the verb AMARE , TO LOVE .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 46]: Not for any personal reason , for I am indifferent about verbs ; I care no more for one verb than for another , and have little or no respect for any of them ; but in foreign languages you always begin with that one .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 7]: Why , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 35]: It is merely habit , I suppose ; the first teacher chose it , Adam was satisfied , and there has n't been a successor since with originality enough to start a fresh one .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 13]: For they ARE a pretty limited lot , you will admit that ?
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 44]: Originality is not in their line ; they ca n't think up anything new , anything to freshen up the old moss-grown dullness of the language lesson and put life and `` go '' into it , and charm and grace and picturesqueness .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 84]: I knew I must look after those details myself ; therefore I thought them out and wrote them down , and set for the FACCHINO and explained them to him , and said he must arrange a proper plant , and get together a good stock company among the CONTADINI , and design the costumes , and distribute the parts ; and drill the troupe , and be ready in three days to begin on this Verb in a shipshape and workman-like manner .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 85]: I told him to put each grand division of it under a foreman , and each subdivision under a subordinate of the rank of sergeant or corporal or something like that , and to have a different uniform for each squad , so that I could tell a Pluperfect from a Compound Future without looking at the book ; the whole battery to be under his own special and particular command , with the rank of Brigadier , and I to pay the freight .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 68]: I then inquired into the character and possibilities of the selected verb , and was much disturbed to find that it was over my size , it being chambered for fifty-seven rounds -- fifty-seven ways of saying I LOVE without reloading ; and yet none of them likely to convince a girl that was laying for a title , or a title that was laying for rocks .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 98]: It seemed to me that with my inexperience it would be foolish to go into action with this mitrailleuse , so I ordered it to the rear and told the facchino to provide something a little more primitive to start with , something less elaborate , some gentle old-fashioned flint-lock , smooth-bore , double-barreled thing , calculated to cripple at two hundred yards and kill at forty -- an arrangement suitable for a beginner who could be satisfied with moderate results on the offstart and did not wish to take the whole territory in the first campaign .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 4]: But in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 43]: He was not able to mend the matter , all the verbs being of the same build , all Gatlings , all of the same caliber and delivery , fifty-seven to the volley , and fatal at a mile and a half .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 72]: But he said the auxiliary verb AVERE , TO HAVE , was a tidy thing , and easy to handle in a seaway , and less likely to miss stays in going about than some of the others ; so , upon his recommendation I chose that one , and told him to take it along and scrape its bottom and break out its spinnaker and get it ready for business .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 11]: I will explain that a facchino is a general-utility domestic .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 15]: Mine was a horse-doctor in his better days , and a very good one .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 11]: At the end of three days the facchino-doctor-brigadier was ready .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 9]: I was also ready , with a stenographer .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 9]: We were in a room called the Rope-Walk .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 23]: This is a formidably long room , as is indicated by its facetious name , and is a good place for reviews .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 5]: At 9:30 the F.-D .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 41]: - B. took his place near me and gave the word of command ; the drums began to rumble and thunder , the head of the forces appeared at an upper door , and the `` march-past '' was on .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 112]: Down they filed , a blaze of variegated color , each squad gaudy in a uniform of its own and bearing a banner inscribed with its verbal rank and quality : first the Present Tense in Mediterranean blue and old gold , then the Past Definite in scarlet and black , then the Imperfect in green and yellow , then the Indicative Future in the stars and stripes , then the Old Red Sandstone Subjunctive in purple and silver -- and so on and so on , fifty-seven privates and twenty commissioned and non-commissioned officers ; certainly one of the most fiery and dazzling and eloquent sights I have ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 8]: I could not keep back the tears .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 6]: Presently : `` Halt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 4]: commanded the Brigadier .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 6]: `` Front -- face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 5]: `` Right dress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 6]: `` Stand at ease ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 7]: `` One -- two -- three .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 6]: In unison -- RECITE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 4]: It was fine .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 24]: In one noble volume of sound of all the fifty-seven Haves in the Italian language burst forth in an exalting and splendid confusion .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 9]: Then came commands : `` About -- face !
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 4]: Eyes -- front !
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 6]: Helm alee -- hard aport !
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 5]: Forward -- march ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 7]: and the drums let go again .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 22]: When the last Termination had disappeared , the commander said the instruction drill would now begin , and asked for suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 26]: I said : `` They say I HAVE , THOU HAST , HE HAS , and so on , but they do n't say WHAT .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 55]: It will be better , and more definite , if they have something to have ; just an object , you know , a something -- anything will do ; anything that will give the listener a sort of personal as well as grammatical interest in their joys and complaints , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 10]: He said : `` It is a good point .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 6]: Would a dog do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 16]: I said I did not know , but we could try a dog and see .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 15]: So he sent out an aide-de-camp to give the order to add the dog .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 26]: The six privates of the Present Tense now filed in , in charge of Sergeant AVERE -LRB- TO HAVE -RRB- , and displaying their banner .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 29]: They formed in line of battle , and recited , one at a time , thus : `` IO HO UN CANE , I have a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 12]: `` TU HAI UN CANE , thou hast a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 12]: `` EGLI HA UN CANE , he has a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 12]: `` NOI ABBIAMO UN CANE , we have a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 12]: `` VOI AVETE UN CANE , you have a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 12]: `` EGLINO HANNO UN CANE , they have a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 4]: No comment followed .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 11]: They returned to camp , and I reflected a while .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 12]: The commander said : `` I fear you are disappointed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' I said ; `` they are too monotonous , too singsong , to dead-and-alive ; they have no expression , no elocution .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 13]: It is n't natural ; it could never happen in real life .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 18]: A person who had just acquired a dog is either blame ' glad or blame ' sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 7]: He is not on the fence .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 6]: I never saw a case .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 14]: What the nation do you suppose is the matter with these people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 10]: He thought maybe the trouble was with the dog .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 25]: He said : `` These are CONTADINI , you know , and they have a prejudice against dogs -- that is , against marimane .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 37]: Marimana dogs stand guard over people 's vines and olives , you know , and are very savage , and thereby a grief and an inconvenience to persons who want other people 's things at night .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 19]: In my judgment they have taken this dog for a marimana , and have soured on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 33]: I saw that the dog was a mistake , and not functionable : we must try something else ; something , if possible , that could evoke sentiment , interest , feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 9]: `` What is cat , in Italian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 4]: `` Gatto . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 12]: `` Is it a gentleman cat , or a lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 5]: `` Gentleman cat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 11]: `` How are these people as regards that animal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 16]: `` We-ll , they -- they -- '' `` You hesitate : that is enough .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 7]: How are they about chickens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 10]: He tilted his eyes toward heaven in mute ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 3]: I understood .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 9]: `` What is chicken , in Italian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 6]: `` Pollo , PODERE . ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 7]: -LRB- Podere is Italian for master .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 14]: It is a title of courtesy , and conveys reverence and admiration . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 23]: `` Pollo is one chicken by itself ; when there are enough present to constitute a plural , it is POLLI . ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 8]: `` Very well , polli will do .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 9]: Which squad is detailed for duty next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 6]: `` The Past Definite . ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 13]: `` Send out and order it to the front -- with chickens .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 17]: And let them understand that we do n't want any more of this cold indifference . ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 38]: He gave the order to an aide , adding , with a haunting tenderness in his tone and a watering mouth in his aspect : `` Convey to them the conception that these are unprotected chickens . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 29]: He turned to me , saluting with his hand to his temple , and explained , `` It will inflame their interest in the poultry , sire . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 5]: A few minutes elapsed .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 29]: Then the squad marched in and formed up , their faces glowing with enthusiasm , and the file-leader shouted : `` EBBI POLLI , I had chickens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 8]: `` Go on , the next . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 9]: `` AVEST POLLI , thou hadst chickens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 3]: `` Fine !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 3]: Next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 9]: `` EBBE POLLI , he had chickens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 3]: `` Moltimoltissimo !
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 7]: Go on , the next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 9]: `` AVEMMO POLLI , we had chickens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 11]: `` Basta-basta aspettatto avanti -- last man -- CHARGE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 9]: `` EBBERO POLLI , they had chickens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 24]: Then they formed in echelon , by columns of fours , refused the left , and retired in great style on the double-quick .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 17]: I was enchanted , and said : `` Now , doctor , that is something LIKE !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 12]: Chickens are the ticket , there is no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 7]: What is the next squad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 5]: `` The Imperfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 7]: `` How does it go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 33]: `` IO AVENA , I had , TU AVEVI , thou hadst , EGLI AVENA , he had , NOI AV -- '' `` Wait -- we 've just HAD the hads .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 7]: What are you giving me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 8]: `` But this is another breed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 9]: `` What do we want of another breed ?
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 6]: Is n't one breed enough ?
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 35]: HAD is HAD , and your tricking it out in a fresh way of spelling is n't going to make it any hadder than it was before ; now you know that yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 16]: `` But there is a distinction -- they are not just the same Hads . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 9]: `` How do you make it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 50]: `` Well , you use that first Had when you are referring to something that happened at a named and sharp and perfectly definite moment ; you use the other when the thing happened at a vaguely defined time and in a more prolonged and indefinitely continuous way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 15]: `` Why , doctor , it is pure nonsense ; you know it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 144]: Look here : If I have had a had , or have wanted to have had a had , or was in a position right then and there to have had a had that had n't had any chance to go out hadding on account of this foolish discrimination which lets one Had go hadding in any kind of indefinite grammatical weather but restricts the other one to definite and datable meteoric convulsions , and keeps it pining around and watching the barometer all the time , and liable to get sick through confinement and lack of exercise , and all that sort of thing , why -- why , the inhumanity of it is enough , let alone the wanton superfluity and uselessness of any such a loafing consumptive hospital-bird of a Had taking up room and cumbering the place for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 55]: These finical refinements revolt me ; it is not right , it is not honorable ; it is constructive nepotism to keep in office a Had that is so delicate it ca n't come out when the wind 's in the nor ` west -- I wo n't have this dude on the payroll .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 16]: Cancel his exequator ; and look here -- '' `` But you miss the point .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 5]: It is like this .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 17]: You see -- '' `` Never mind explaining , I do n't care anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 27]: Six Hads is enough for me ; anybody that needs twelve , let him subscribe ; I do n't want any stock in a Had Trust .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 17]: Knock out the Prolonged and Indefinitely Continuous ; four-fifths of it is water , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 8]: `` But I beg you , podere !
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 20]: It is often quite indispensable in cases where -- '' `` Pipe the next squad to the assault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 76]: But it was not to be ; for at that moment the dull boom of the noon gun floated up out of far-off Florence , followed by the usual softened jangle of church-bells , Florentine and suburban , that bursts out in murmurous response ; by labor-union law the COLAZIONE -LRB- 1 -RRB- must stop ; stop promptly , stop instantly , stop definitely , like the chosen and best of the breed of Hads .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 16]: Colazione is Italian for a collection , a meeting , a seance , a sitting .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 3]: -- M.T. .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 43]: A BURLESQUE BIOGRAPHY Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure , I yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 15]: Ours is a noble house , and stretches a long way back into antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 21]: The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 21]: This was in the eleventh century , when our people were living in Aberdeen , county of Cork , England .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 54]: Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name -LRB- except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness -RRB- , instead of Higgins , is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 16]: It is a kind of vague , pretty romance , and we leave it alone .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 8]: All the old families do that way .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 20]: Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note -- a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus 's time .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 31]: At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate , to see about something , and never returned again .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 6]: While there he died suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 15]: Augustus Twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year 1160 .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 49]: He was as full of fun as he could be , and used to take his old saber and sharpen it up , and get in a convenient place on a dark night , and stick it through people as they went by , to see them jump .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 6]: He was a born humorist .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 56]: But he got to going too far with it ; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties , the authorities removed one end of him , and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar , where it could contemplate the people and have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 14]: He never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 44]: Then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers -- noble , high-spirited fellows , who always went into battle singing , right behind the army , and always went out a-whooping , right ahead of it .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 41]: This is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart 's poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it , and that that one stuck out at right angles , and bore fruit winter and summer .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 16]: Early in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain , called `` the Scholar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 8]: He wrote a beautiful , beautiful hand .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 25]: And he could imitate anybody 's hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 8]: He had infinite sport with his talent .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 25]: But by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road , and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 26]: Still , he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business , which , with inconsiderable intervals , was some forty-two years .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 8]: In fact , he died in harness .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 26]: During all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till the government gave him another .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 6]: He was a perfect pet .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 26]: And he was always a favorite with his fellow-artists , and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society , called the Chain Gang .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 21]: He always wore his hair short , had a preference for striped clothes , and died lamented by the government .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 9]: He was a sore loss to his country .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 6]: For he was so regular .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 11]: Some years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 14]: He came over to this country with Columbus in 1492 as a passenger .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 12]: He appears to have been of a crusty , uncomfortable disposition .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 23]: He complained of the food all the way over , and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 5]: He wanted fresh shad .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 48]: Hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air , sneering about the commander , and saying he did not believe Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 9]: The memorable cry of `` Land ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 9]: thrilled every heart in the ship but his .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 34]: He gazed awhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water , and then said : `` Land be hanged -- it 's a raft ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 88]: When this questionable passenger came on board the ship , he brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked `` B. G. , '' one cotton sock marked `` L. W. C. , '' one woolen one marked `` D. F. , '' and a night-shirt marked `` O. M. R. '' And yet during the voyage he worried more about his `` trunk , '' and gave himself more airs about it , than all the rest of the passengers put together .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 34]: If the ship was `` down by the head , '' and would not steer , he would go and move his `` trunk '' further aft , and then watch the effect .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 26]: If the ship was `` by the stern , '' he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to `` shift that baggage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 27]: In storms he had to be gagged , because his wailings about his `` trunk '' made it impossible for the men to hear the orders .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 64]: The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing , but it is noted in the ship 's log as a `` curious circumstance '' that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper , he took it ashore in four trunks , a queensware crate , and a couple of champagne baskets .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 44]: But when he came back insinuating , in an insolent , swaggering way , that some of this things were missing , and was going to search the other passengers ' baggage , it was too much , and they threw him overboard .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 23]: They watched long and wonderingly for him to come up , but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 39]: But while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side , and the interest was momentarily increasing , it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor-cable hanging limp from the bow .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 62]: Then in the ship 's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note : `` In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gone downe and got ye anchor , and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from ye interior , saying yt he hadde founde it , ye sonne of a ghun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 42]: Yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts , and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 43]: He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows , and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 47]: At this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty , and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America , and while there received injuries which terminated in his death .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 35]: The great-grandson of the `` Reformer '' flourished in sixteen hundred and something , and was known in our annals as `` the old Admiral , '' though in history he had other titles .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 25]: He was long in command of fleets of swift vessels , well armed and manned , and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 20]: Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on , always made good fair time across the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 56]: But if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do , his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer -- and then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully , expecting the owners to come for it , but they never did .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 28]: And he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 9]: He called it `` walking a plank . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 6]: All the pupils liked it .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 15]: At any rate , they never found any fault with it after trying it .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 26]: When the owners were late coming for their ships , the Admiral always burned them , so that the insurance money should not be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 18]: At last this fine old tar was cut down in the fullness of his years and honors .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 27]: And to her dying day , his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 21]: Charles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century , and was a zealous and distinguished missionary .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 31]: He converted sixteen thousand South Sea islanders , and taught them that a dog-tooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 62]: His poor flock loved him very , very dearly ; and when his funeral was over , they got up in a body -LRB- and came out of the restaurant -RRB- with tears in their eyes , and saying , one to another , that he was a good tender missionary , and they wished they had some more of him .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 26]: Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis -LRB- Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain -RRB- adorned the middle of the eighteenth century , and aided General Braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 16]: It was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 67]: So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is correct ; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission , and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again , the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 17]: What he did say was : `` It ai n't no -LRB- hic -RRB- no use .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 21]: ` At man 's so drunk he ca n't stan ' still long enough for a man to hit him .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 21]: I -LRB- hic -RRB- I ca n't ` ford to fool away any more am ` nition on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 44]: That was why he stopped at the seventeenth round , and it was a good , plain , matter-of-fact reason , too , and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent , persuasive flavor of probability there is about it .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 100]: I also enjoyed the story-book narrative , but I felt a marring misgiving that every Indian at Braddock 's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times -LRB- two easily grows to seventeen in a century -RRB- , and missed him , jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission ; and so I somehow feared that the only reason why Washington 's case is remembered and the others forgotten is , that in his the prophecy came true , and in that of the others it did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 41]: There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made ; but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 49]: I will remark here , in passing , that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well-known in history by their aliases , that I have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them , or even mention them in the order of their birth .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 132]: Among these may be mentioned Richard Brinsley Twain , alias Guy Fawkes ; John Wentworth Twain , alias Sixteen-String Jack ; William Hogarth Twain , alias Jack Sheppard ; Ananias Twain , alias Baron Munchausen ; John George Twain , alias Captain Kydd ; and then there are George Francis Twain , Tom Pepper , Nebuchadnezzar , and Baalam 's Ass -- they all belong to our family , but to a branch of it somewhat distinctly removed from the honorable direct line -- in fact , a collateral branch , whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that , in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for , they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 46]: It is not well , when writing an autobiography , to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time -- it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather , and then skip from there to yourself , which I now do .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 11]: I was born without teeth -- and there Richard III .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 25]: had the advantage of me ; but I was born without a humpback , likewise , and there I had the advantage of him .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 10]: My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 8]: But now a thought occurs to me .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 29]: My own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors , that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until I am hanged .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 30]: If some other biographies I have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred , it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 6]: How does it strike you ?
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 12]: HOW TO TELL A STORY The Humorous Story an American Development .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 25]: -- Its Difference from Comic and Witty Stories I do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 31]: I only claim to know how a story ought to be told , for I have been almost daily in the company of the most expert story-tellers for many years .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 16]: There are several kinds of stories , but only one difficult kind -- the humorous .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 8]: I will talk mainly about that one .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 18]: The humorous story is American , the comic story is English , the witty story is French .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 25]: The humorous story depends for its effect upon the MANNER of the telling ; the comic story and the witty story upon the MATTER .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 42]: The humorous story may be spun out to great length , and may wander around as much as it pleases , and arrive nowhere in particular ; but the comic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 11]: The humorous story bubbles gently along , the others burst .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 42]: The humorous story is strictly a work of art -- high and delicate art -- and only an artist can tell it ; but no art is necessary in telling the comic and the witty story ; anybody can do it .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 31]: The art of telling a humorous story -- understand , I mean by word of mouth , not print -- was created in America , and has remained at home .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 71]: The humorous story is told gravely ; the teller does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about it ; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is one of the funniest things he has ever heard , then tells it with eager delight , and is the first person to laugh when he gets through .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 43]: And sometimes , if he has had good success , he is so glad and happy that he will repeat the `` nub '' of it and glance around from face to face , collecting applause , and then repeat it again .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 8]: It is a pathetic thing to see .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 29]: Very often , of course , the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub , point , snapper , or whatever you like to call it .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 43]: Then the listener must be alert , for in many cases the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way , with the pretense that he does not know it is a nub .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 37]: Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal ; then when the belated audience presently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise , as if wondering what they had found to laugh at .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 16]: Dan Setchell used it before him , Nye and Riley and others use it today .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 22]: But the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub ; he shouts it at you -- every time .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 35]: And when he prints it , in England , France , Germany , and Italy , he italicizes it , puts some whopping exclamation-points after it , and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 20]: All of which is very depressing , and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 29]: Let me set down an instance of the comic method , using an anecdote which has been popular all over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 73]: The teller tells it in this way : THE WOUNDED SOLDIER In the course of a certain battle a soldier whose leg had been shot off appealed to another soldier who was hurrying by to carry him to the rear , informing him at the same time of the loss which he had sustained ; whereupon the generous son of Mars , shouldering the unfortunate , proceeded to carry out his desire .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 35]: The bullets and cannon-balls were flying in all directions , and presently one of the latter took the wounded man 's head off -- without , however , his deliverer being aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 24]: In no long time he was hailed by an officer , who said : `` Where are you going with that carcass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 14]: `` To the rear , sir -- he 's lost his leg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 7]: `` His leg , forsooth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 15]: responded the astonished officer ; `` you mean his head , you booby . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 19]: Whereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his burden , and stood looking down upon it in great perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 19]: At length he said : `` It is true , sir , just as you have said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 45]: Then after a pause he added , `` BUT HE TOLD ME IT WAS HIS LEG !!!!! '' Here the narrator bursts into explosion after explosion of thunderous horse-laughter , repeating that nub from time to time through his gasping and shriekings and suffocatings .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 26]: It takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comic-story form ; and is n't worth the telling , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 29]: Put into the humorous-story form it takes ten minutes , and is about the funniest thing I have ever listened to -- as James Whitcomb Riley tells it .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 37]: He tells it in the character of a dull-witted old farmer who has just heard it for the first time , thinks it is unspeakably funny , and is trying to repeat it to a neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 167]: But he ca n't remember it ; so he gets all mixed up and wanders helplessly round and round , putting in tedious details that do n't belong in the tale and only retard it ; taking them out conscientiously and putting in others that are just as useless ; making minor mistakes now and then and stopping to correct them and explain how he came to make them ; remembering things which he forgot to put in in their proper place and going back to put them in there ; stopping his narrative a good while in order to try to recall the name of the soldier that was hurt , and finally remembering that the soldier 's name was not mentioned , and remarking placidly that the name is of no real importance , anyway -- better , of course , if one knew it , but not essential , after all -- and so on , and so on , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 71]: The teller is innocent and happy and pleased with himself , and has to stop every little while to hold himself in and keep from laughing outright ; and does hold in , but his body quakes in a jelly-like way with interior chuckles ; and at the end of the ten minutes the audience have laughed until they are exhausted , and the tears are running down their faces .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 29]: The simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness of the old farmer are perfectly simulated , and the result is a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 26]: This is art -- and fine and beautiful , and only a master can compass it ; but a machine could tell the other story .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 37]: To string incongruities and absurdities together in a wandering and sometimes purposeless way , and seem innocently unaware that they are absurdities , is the basis of the American art , if my position is correct .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 9]: Another feature is the slurring of the point .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 21]: A third is the dropping of a studied remark apparently without knowing it , as if one where thinking aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 8]: The fourth and last is the pause .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 12]: Artemus Ward dealt in numbers three and four a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 51]: He would begin to tell with great animation something which he seemed to think was wonderful ; then lose confidence , and after an apparently absent-minded pause add an incongruous remark in a soliloquizing way ; and that was the remark intended to explode the mine -- and it did .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 74]: For instance , he would say eagerly , excitedly , `` I once knew a man in New Zealand who had n't a tooth in his head '' -- here his animation would die out ; a silent , reflective pause would follow , then he would say dreamily , and as if to himself , `` and yet that man could beat a drum better than any man I ever saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 21]: The pause is an exceedingly important feature in any kind of story , and a frequently recurring feature , too .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 40]: It is a dainty thing , and delicate , and also uncertain and treacherous ; for it must be exactly the right length -- no more and no less -- or it fails of its purpose and makes trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 37]: If the pause is too short the impressive point is passed , and the audience have had time to divine that a surprise is intended -- and then you ca n't surprise them , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 37]: On the platform I used to tell a negro ghost story that had a pause in front of the snapper on the end , and that pause was the most important thing in the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 43]: If I got it the right length precisely , I could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some impressible girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her seat -- and that was what I was after .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 17]: This story was called `` The Golden Arm , '' and was told in this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 20]: You can practice with it yourself -- and mind you look out for the pause and get it right .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 38]: THE GOLDEN ARM Once ` pon a time dey wuz a momsus mean man , en he live ` way out in de prairie all ` lone by hisself , ` cep 'n he had a wife .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 21]: En bimeby she died , en he tuck en toted her way out dah in de prairie en buried her .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 17]: Well , she had a golden arm -- all solid gold , fum de shoulder down .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 28]: He wuz pow ` ful mean -- pow ` ful ; en dat night he could n't sleep , caze he want dat golden arm so bad .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 64]: When it come midnight he could n't stan ' it no mo ' ; so he git up , he did , en tuck his lantern en shoved out thoo de storm en dug her up en got de golden arm ; en he bent his head down ` gin de ` win , en plowed en plowed en plowed thoo de snow .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 37]: Den all on a sudden he stop -LRB- make a considerable pause here , and look startled , and take a listening attitude -RRB- en say : `` My LAN ' , what 's dat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 49]: En he listen -- en listen -- en de win ' say -LRB- set your teeth together and imitate the wailing and wheezing singsong of the wind -RRB- , `` Bzzz-z-zzz '' -- en den , way back yonder whah de grave is , he hear a VOICE !

Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 10]: -LRB- You must begin to shiver violently now . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 16]: En he begin to shiver en shake , en say , `` Oh , my !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 7]: OH , my lan ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 62]: en de win ' blow de lantern out , en de snow en sleet blow in his face en mos ' choke him , en he start a-plowin ' knee-deep toward home mos ' dead , he so sk ` yerd -- en pooty soon he hear de voice agin , en -LRB- pause -RRB- it ` us comin AFTER him !

Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 18]: When he git to de pasture he hear it agin -- closter now , en A-COMIN ' !
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 21]: -- a-comin ' back dah in de dark en de storm -- -LRB- repeat the wind and the voice -RRB- .

Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 20]: Den -- den -- he seem to feel someth 'n' C-O-L-D , right down ` most agin his head !

Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 20]: Den de voice say , RIGHT AT HIS YEAR -- `` W-h-o -- g-o-t -- m-y g-o-l-d-e-n ARM ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 44]: -LRB- You must wail it out very plaintively and accusingly ; then you stare steadily and impressively into the face of the farthest-gone auditor -- a girl , preferably -- and let that awe-inspiring pause begin to build itself in the deep hush .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 25]: When it has reached exactly the right length , jump suddenly at that girl and yell , `` YOU 'VE got it ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 23]: If you 've got the PAUSE right , she 'll fetch a dear little yelp and spring right out of her shoes .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 25]: But you MUST get the pause right ; and you will find it the most troublesome and aggravating and uncertain thing you ever undertook .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 43]: GENERAL WASHINGTON 'S NEGRO BODY-SERVANT A Biographical Sketch The stirring part of this celebrated colored man 's life properly began with his death -- that is to say , the notable features of his biography began with the first time he died .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 37]: He had been little heard of up to that time , but since then we have never ceased to hear of him ; we have never ceased to hear of him at stated , unfailing intervals .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 24]: His was a most remarkable career , and I have thought that its history would make a valuable addition to our biographical literature .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 25]: Therefore , I have carefully collated the materials for such a work , from authentic sources , and here present them to the public .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 35]: I have rigidly excluded from these pages everything of a doubtful character , with the object in view of introducing my work into the schools for the instruction of the youth of my country .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 12]: The name of the famous body-servant of General Washington was George .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 45]: After serving his illustrious master faithfully for half a century , and enjoying throughout his long term his high regard and confidence , it became his sorrowful duty at last to lay that beloved master to rest in his peaceful grave by the Potomac .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 24]: Ten years afterward -- in 1809 -- full of years and honors , he died himself , mourned by all who knew him .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 39]: The Boston GAZETTE of that date thus refers to the event : George , the favorite body-servant of the lamented Washington , died in Richmond , Va. , last Tuesday , at the ripe age of 95 years .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 20]: His intellect was unimpaired , and his memory tenacious , up to within a few minutes of his decease .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 31]: He was present at the second installation of Washington as President , and also at his funeral , and distinctly remembered all the prominent incidents connected with those noted events .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 26]: From this period we hear no more of the favorite body-servant of General Washington until May , 1825 , at which time he died again .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 42]: A Philadelphia paper thus speaks of the sad occurrence : At Macon , Ga. , last week , a colored man named George , who was the favorite body-servant of General Washington , died at the advanced age of 95 years .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 54]: Up to within a few hours of his dissolution he was in full possession of all his faculties , and could distinctly recollect the second installation of Washington , his death and burial , the surrender of Cornwallis , the battle of Trenton , the griefs and hardships of Valley Forge , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 13]: Deceased was followed to the grave by the entire population of Macon .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 44]: On the Fourth of July , 1830 , and also of 1834 and 1836 , the subject of this sketch was exhibited in great state upon the rostrum of the orator of the day , and in November of 1840 he died again .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 23]: The St. Louis REPUBLICAN of the 25th of that month spoke as follows : `` ANOTHER RELIC OF THE REVOLUTION GONE . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 32]: `` George , once the favorite body-servant of General Washington , died yesterday at the house of Mr. John Leavenworth in this city , at the venerable age of 95 years .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 82]: He was in the full possession of his faculties up to the hour of his death , and distinctly recollected the first and second installations and death of President Washington , the surrender of Cornwallis , the battles of Trenton and Monmouth , the sufferings of the patriot army at Valley Forge , the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence , the speech of Patrick Henry in the Virginia House of Delegates , and many other old-time reminiscences of stirring interest .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 11]: Few white men die lamented as was this aged negro .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 8]: The funeral was very largely attended . ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 35]: During the next ten or eleven years the subject of this sketch appeared at intervals at Fourth-of-July celebrations in various parts of the country , and was exhibited upon the rostrum with flattering success .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 10]: But in the fall of 1855 he died again .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 44]: The California papers thus speak of the event : ANOTHER OLD HERO GONE Died , at Dutch Flat , on the 7th of March , George -LRB- once the confidential body-servant of General Washington -RRB- , at the great age of 95 years .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 20]: His memory , which did not fail him till the last , was a wonderful storehouse of interesting reminiscences .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 44]: He could distinctly recollect the first and second installations and death of President Washington , the surrender of Cornwallis , the battles of Trenton and Monmouth , and Bunker Hill , the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence , and Braddock 's defeat .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 22]: George was greatly respected in Dutch Flat , and it is estimated that there were 10,000 people present at his funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 34]: The last time the subject of this sketch died was in June , 1864 ; and until we learn the contrary , it is just to presume that he died permanently this time .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 46]: The Michigan papers thus refer to the sorrowful event : ANOTHER CHERISHED REMNANT OF THE REVOLUTION GONE George , a colored man , and once the favorite body-servant of George Washington , died in Detroit last week , at the patriarchal age of 95 years .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 71]: To the moment of his death his intellect was unclouded , and he could distinctly remember the first and second installations and death of Washington , the surrender of Cornwallis , the battles of Trenton and Monmouth , and Bunker Hill , the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence , Braddock 's defeat , the throwing over of the tea in Boston harbor , and the landing of the Pilgrims .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 18]: He died greatly respected , and was followed to the grave by a vast concourse of people .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 7]: The faithful old servant is gone !
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 12]: We shall never see him more until he turns up again .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 29]: He has closed his long and splendid career of dissolution , for the present , and sleeps peacefully , as only they sleep who have earned their rest .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 9]: He was in all respects a remarkable man .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 27]: He held his age better than any celebrity that has figured in history ; and the longer he lived the stronger and longer his memory grew .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 16]: If he lives to die again , he will distinctly recollect the discovery of America .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 36]: The above resume of his biography I believe to be substantially correct , although it is possible that he may have died once or twice in obscure places where the event failed of newspaper notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 22]: One fault I find in all the notices of his death I have quoted , and this ought to be correct .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 13]: In them he uniformly and impartially died at the age of 95 .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 6]: This could not have been .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 20]: He might have done that once , or maybe twice , but he could not have continued it indefinitely .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 28]: Allowing that when he first died , he died at the age of 95 , he was 151 years old when he died last , in 1864 .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 11]: But his age did not keep pace with his recollections .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 22]: When he died the last time , he distinctly remembered the landing of the Pilgrims , which took place in 1620 .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 46]: He must have been about twenty years old when he witnessed that event , wherefore it is safe to assert that the body-servant of General Washington was in the neighborhood of two hundred and sixty or seventy years old when he departed this life finally .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 41]: Having waited a proper length of time , to see if the subject of his sketch had gone from us reliably and irrevocably , I now publish his biography with confidence , and respectfully offer it to a mourning nation .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 20]: P.S. -- I see by the papers that this infamous old fraud has just died again , in Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 19]: This makes six times that he is known to have died , and always in a new place .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 30]: The death of Washington 's body-servant has ceased to be a novelty ; it 's charm is gone ; the people are tired of it ; let it cease .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 49]: This well-meaning but misguided negro has not put six different communities to the expense of burying him in state , and has swindled tens of thousands of people into following him to the grave under the delusion that a select and peculiar distinction was being conferred upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 41]: Let him stay buried for good now ; and let that newspaper suffer the severest censure that shall ever , in all the future time , publish to the world that General Washington 's favorite colored body-servant has died again .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 45]: WIT INSPIRATIONS OF THE `` TWO-YEAR-OLDS '' All infants appear to have an impertinent and disagreeable fashion nowadays of saying `` smart '' things on most occasions that offer , and especially on occasions when they ought not to be saying anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 21]: Judging by the average published specimens of smart sayings , the rising generation of children are little better than idiots .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 37]: And the parents must surely be but little better than the children , for in most cases they are the publishers of the sunbursts of infantile imbecility which dazzle us from the pages of our periodicals .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 51]: I may seem to speak with some heat , not to say a suspicion of personal spite ; and I do admit that it nettles me to hear about so many gifted infants in these days , and remember that I seldom said anything smart when I was a child .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 13]: I tried it once or twice , but it was not popular .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 22]: The family were not expecting brilliant remarks from me , and so they snubbed me sometimes and spanked me the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 44]: But it makes my flesh creep and my blood run cold to think what might have happened to me if I had dared to utter some of the smart things of this generation 's `` four-year-olds '' where my father could hear me .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 25]: To have simply skinned me alive and considered his duty at an end would have seemed to him criminal leniency toward one so sinning .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 15]: He was a stern , unsmiling man , and hated all forms of precocity .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 26]: If I had said some of the things I have referred to , and said them in his hearing , he would have destroyed me .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 5]: He would , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 10]: He would , provided the opportunity remained with him .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 24]: But it would not , for I would have had judgment enough to take some strychnine first and say my smart thing afterward .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 14]: The fair record of my life has been tarnished by just one pun .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 20]: My father overheard that , and he hunted me over four or five townships seeking to take my life .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 33]: If I had been full-grown , of course he would have been right ; but , child as I was , I could not know how wicked a thing I had done .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 22]: I made one of those remarks ordinarily called `` smart things '' before that , but it was not a pun .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 15]: Still , it came near causing a serious rupture between my father and myself .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 30]: My father and mother , my uncle Ephraim and his wife , and one or two others were present , and the conversation turned on a name for me .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 55]: I was lying there trying some India-rubber rings of various patterns , and endeavoring to make a selection , for I was tired of trying to cut my teeth on people 's fingers , and wanted to get hold of something that would enable me to hurry the thing through and get something else .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 34]: Did you ever notice what a nuisance it was cutting your teeth on your nurse 's finger , or how back-breaking and tiresome it was trying to cut them on your big toe ?
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 23]: And did you never get out of patience and wish your teeth were in Jerico long before you got them half cut ?
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 11]: To me it seems as if these things happened yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: And they did , to some children .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 4]: But I digress .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 9]: I was lying there trying the India-rubber rings .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 41]: I remember looking at the clock and noticing that in an hour and twenty-five minutes I would be two weeks old , and thinking how little I had done to merit the blessings that were so unsparingly lavished upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 11]: My father said : `` Abraham is a good name .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 7]: My grandfather was named Abraham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 11]: My mother said : `` Abraham is a good name .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 11]: Let us have Abraham for one of his names . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 10]: I said : `` Abraham suits the subscriber . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 22]: My father frowned , my mother looked pleased ; my aunt said : `` What a little darling it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 19]: My father said : `` Isaac is a good name , and Jacob is a good name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 13]: My mother assented , and said : `` No names are better .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 11]: Let us add Isaac and Jacob to his names . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 7]: I said : `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 10]: Isaac and Jacob are good enough for yours truly .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 9]: Pass me that rattle , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 10]: I ca n't chew India-rubber rings all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 15]: Not a soul made a memorandum of these sayings of mine , for publication .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 17]: I saw that , and did it myself , else they would have been utterly lost .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 53]: So far from meeting with a generous encouragement like other children when developing intellectually , I was now furiously scowled upon by my father ; my mother looked grieved and anxious , and even my aunt had about her an expression of seeming to think that maybe I had gone too far .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 26]: I took a vicious bite out of an India-rubber ring , and covertly broke the rattle over the kitten 's head , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 14]: Presently my father said : `` Samuel is a very excellent name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 7]: I saw that trouble was coming .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 5]: Nothing could prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 65]: I laid down my rattle ; over the side of the cradle I dropped my uncle 's silver watch , the clothes-brush , the toy dog , my tin soldier , the nutmeg-grater , and other matters which I was accustomed to examine , and meditate upon and make pleasant noises with , and bang and batter and break when I needed wholesome entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 34]: Then I put on my little frock and my little bonnet , and took my pygmy shoes in one hand and my licorice in the other , and climbed out on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 18]: I said to myself , Now , if the worse comes to worst , I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 26]: Then I said aloud , in a firm voice : `` Father , I can not , can not wear the name of Samuel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 5]: `` My son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 7]: `` Father , I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 5]: I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 13]: `` Father , I have an invincible antipathy to that name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 8]: `` My son , this is unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 11]: Many great and good men have been named Samuel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 14]: `` Sir , I have yet to hear of the first instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 6]: There was Samuel the prophet .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 8]: Was not he great and good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 6]: `` Not so very . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 4]: `` My son !
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 10]: With His own voice the Lord called him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 19]: `` Yes , sir , and had to call him a couple times before he could come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 16]: And then I sallied forth , and that stern old man sallied forth after me .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 64]: He overtook me at noon the following day , and when the interview was over I had acquired the name of Samuel , and a thrashing , and other useful information ; and by means of this compromise my father 's wrath was appeased and a misunderstanding bridged over which might have become a permanent rupture if I had chosen to be unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 39]: But just judging by this episode , what would my father have done to me if I had ever uttered in his hearing one of the flat , sickly things these `` two-years-olds '' say in print nowadays ?
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 15]: In my opinion there would have been a case of infanticide in our family .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 47]: AN ENTERTAINING ARTICLE I take the following paragraph from an article in the Boston ADVERTISER : AN ENGLISH CRITIC ON MARK TWAIN Perhaps the most successful flights of humor of Mark Twain have been descriptions of the persons who did not appreciate his humor at all .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 65]: We have become familiar with the Californians who were thrilled with terror by his burlesque of a newspaper reporter 's way of telling a story , and we have heard of the Pennsylvania clergyman who sadly returned his INNOCENTS ABROAD to the book-agent with the remark that `` the man who could shed tears over the tomb of Adam must be an idiot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 17]: But Mark Twain may now add a much more glorious instance to his string of trophies .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 29]: The SATURDAY REVIEW , in its number of October 8th , reviews his book of travels , which has been republished in England , and reviews it seriously .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 42]: We can imagine the delight of the humorist in reading this tribute to his power ; and indeed it is so amusing in itself that he can hardly do better than reproduce the article in full in his next monthly Memoranda .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 26]: -LRB- Publishing the above paragraph thus , gives me a sort of authority for reproducing the SATURDAY REVIEW 'S article in full in these pages .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 18]: I dearly wanted to do it , for I can not write anything half so delicious myself .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 26]: If I had a cast-iron dog that could read this English criticism and preserve his austerity , I would drive him off the door-step . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 10]: -LRB- From the London `` Saturday Review . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 8]: REVIEWS OF NEW BOOKS THE INNOCENTS ABROAD .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 5]: A Book of Travels .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 4]: By Mark Twain .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 6]: London : Hotten , publisher .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 2]: 1870 .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 6]: Lord Macaulay died too soon .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 19]: We never felt this so deeply as when we finished the last chapter of the above-named extravagant work .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 41]: Macaulay died too soon -- for none but he could mete out complete and comprehensive justice to the insolence , the impertinence , the presumption , the mendacity , and , above all , the majestic ignorance of this author .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 43]: To say that the INNOCENTS ABROAD is a curious book , would be to use the faintest language -- would be to speak of the Matterhorn as a neat elevation or of Niagara as being `` nice '' or `` pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 18]: `` Curious '' is too tame a word wherewith to describe the imposing insanity of this work .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 12]: There is no word that is large enough or long enough .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 22]: Let us , therefore , photograph a passing glimpse of book and author , and trust the rest to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 43]: Let the cultivated English student of human nature picture to himself this Mark Twain as a person capable of doing the following-described things -- and not only doing them , but with incredible innocence PRINTING THEM calmly and tranquilly in a book .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 44]: For instance : He states that he entered a hair-dresser 's in Paris to get shaved , and the first `` rake '' the barber gave him with his razor it LOOSENED HIS `` HIDE '' and LIFTED HIM OUT OF THE CHAIR .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 5]: This is unquestionably exaggerated .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 24]: In Florence he was so annoyed by beggars that he pretends to have seized and eaten one in a frantic spirit of revenge .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 11]: There is , of course , no truth in this .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 36]: He gives at full length a theatrical program seventeen or eighteen hundred years old , which he professes to have found in the ruins of the Coliseum , among the dirt and mold and rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 25]: It is a sufficient comment upon this statement to remark that even a cast-iron program would not have lasted so long under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 34]: In Greece he plainly betrays both fright and flight upon one occasion , but with frozen effrontery puts the latter in this falsely tamed form : `` We SIDLED toward the Piraeus . ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 6]: `` Sidled , '' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 61]: He does not hesitate to intimate that at Ephesus , when his mule strayed from the proper course , he got down , took him under his arm , carried him to the road again , pointed him right , remounted , and went to sleep contentedly till it was time to restore the beast to the path once more .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 27]: He states that a growing youth among his ship 's passengers was in the constant habit of appeasing his hunger with soap and oakum between meals .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 40]: In Palestine he tells of ants that came eleven miles to spend the summer in the desert and brought their provisions with them ; yet he shows by his description of the country that the feat was an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 49]: He mentions , as if it were the most commonplace of matters , that he cut a Moslem in two in broad daylight in Jerusalem , with Godfrey de Bouillon 's sword , and would have shed more blood IF HE HAD HAD A GRAVEYARD OF HIS OWN .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 9]: These statements are unworthy a moment 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 24]: Mr. Twain or any other foreigner who did such a thing in Jerusalem would be mobbed , and would infallibly lose his life .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 5]: But why go on ?
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 10]: Why repeat more of his audacious and exasperating falsehoods ?
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 69]: Let us close fittingly with this one : he affirms that `` in the mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople I got my feet so stuck up with a complication of gums , slime , and general impurity , that I wore out more than two thousand pair of bootjacks getting my boots off that night , and even then some Christian hide peeled off with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 4]: It is monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 14]: Such statements are simply lies -- there is no other name for them .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 62]: Will the reader longer marvel at the brutal ignorance that pervades the American nation when we tell him that we are informed upon perfectly good authority that this extravagant compilation of falsehoods , this exhaustless mine of stupendous lies , this INNOCENTS ABROAD , has actually been adopted by the schools and colleges of several of the states as a text-book !
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 25]: But if his falsehoods are distressing , his innocence and his ignorance are enough to make one burn the book and despise the author .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 56]: In one place he was so appalled at the sudden spectacle of a murdered man , unveiled by the moonlight , that he jumped out of the window , going through sash and all , and then remarks with the most childlike simplicity that he `` was not scared , but was considerably agitated . ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 23]: It puts us out of patience to note that the simpleton is densely unconscious that Lucrezia Borgia ever existed off the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 25]: He is vulgarly ignorant of all foreign languages , but is frank enough to criticize , the Italians ' use of their own tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 41]: He says they spell the name of their great painter `` Vinci , but pronounce it Vinchy '' -- and then adds with a naivete possible only to helpless ignorance , `` foreigners always spell better than they pronounce . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 23]: In another place he commits the bald absurdity of putting the phrase `` tare an ouns '' into an Italian 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 70]: In Rome he unhesitatingly believes the legend that St. Philip Neri 's heart was so inflamed with divine love that it burst his ribs -- believes it wholly because an author with a learned list of university degrees strung after his name endorses it -- `` otherwise , '' says this gentle idiot , `` I should have felt a curiosity to know what Philip had for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 40]: Our author makes a long , fatiguing journey to the Grotto del Cane on purpose to test its poisoning powers on a dog -- got elaborately ready for the experiment , and then discovered that he had no dog .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 22]: A wiser person would have kept such a thing discreetly to himself , but with this harmless creature everything comes out .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 65]: He hurts his foot in a rut two thousand years old in exhumed Pompeii , and presently , when staring at one of the cinder-like corpses unearthed in the next square , conceives the idea that maybe it is the remains of the ancient Street Commissioner , and straightway his horror softens down to a sort of chirpy contentment with the condition of things .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 44]: In Damascus he visits the well of Ananias , three thousand years old , and is as surprised and delighted as a child to find that the water is `` as pure and fresh as if the well had been dug yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 37]: In the Holy Land he gags desperately at the hard Arabic and Hebrew Biblical names , and finally concludes to call them Baldwinsville , Williamsburgh , and so on , `` for convenience of spelling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 25]: We have thus spoken freely of this man 's stupefying simplicity and innocence , but we can not deal similarly with his colossal ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 8]: We do not know where to begin .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 18]: And if we knew where to begin , we certainly would not know where to leave off .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 10]: We will give one specimen , and one only .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 17]: He did not know , until he got to Rome , that Michael Angelo was dead !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 35]: And then , instead of crawling away and hiding his shameful ignorance somewhere , he proceeds to express a pious , grateful sort of satisfaction that he is gone and out of his troubles !
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 17]: No , the reader may seek out the author 's exhibition of his uncultivation for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 25]: The book is absolutely dangerous , considering the magnitude and variety of its misstatements , and the convincing confidence with which they are made .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 12]: And yet it is a text-book in the schools of America .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 44]: The poor blunderer mouses among the sublime creations of the Old Masters , trying to acquire the elegant proficiency in art-knowledge , which he has a groping sort of comprehension is a proper thing for a traveled man to be able to display .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 9]: But what is the manner of his study ?
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 8]: And what is the progress he achieves ?
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 24]: To what extent does he familiarize himself with the great pictures of Italy , and what degree of appreciation does he arrive at ?
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 27]: Read : `` When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking up into heaven , we know that that is St. Mark .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 33]: When we see a monk with a book and a pen , looking tranquilly up to heaven , trying to think of a word , we know that that is St. Matthew .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 36]: When we see a monk sitting on a rock , looking tranquilly up to heaven , with a human skull beside him , and without other baggage , we know that that is St. Jerome .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 15]: Because we know that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 24]: When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven , but having no trade-mark , we always ask who those parties are .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 11]: We do this because we humbly wish to learn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 65]: He then enumerates the thousands and thousand of copies of these several pictures which he has seen , and adds with accustomed simplicity that he feels encouraged to believe that when he has seen `` Some More '' of each , and had a larger experience , he will eventually `` begin to take an absorbing interest in them '' -- the vulgar boor .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 18]: That we have shown this to be a remarkable book , we think no one will deny .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 23]: That is a pernicious book to place in the hands of the confiding and uniformed , we think we have also shown .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 20]: That the book is a deliberate and wicked creation of a diseased mind , is apparent upon every page .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 61]: Having placed our judgment thus upon record , let us close with what charity we can , by remarking that even in this volume there is some good to be found ; for whenever the author talks of his own country and lets Europe alone , he never fails to make himself interesting , and not only interesting but instructive .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 103]: No one can read without benefit his occasional chapters and paragraphs , about life in the gold and silver mines of California and Nevada ; about the Indians of the plains and deserts of the West , and their cannibalism ; about the raising of vegetables in kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three teaspoons of guano ; about the moving of small arms from place to place at night in wheelbarrows to avoid taxes ; and about a sort of cows and mules in the Humboldt mines , that climb down chimneys and disturb the people at night .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 13]: These matters are not only new , but are well worth knowing .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 16]: It is a pity the author did not put in more of the same kind .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 21]: His book is well written and is exceedingly entertaining , and so it just barely escaped being quite valuable also .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 34]: -LRB- One month later -RRB- Latterly I have received several letters , and see a number of newspaper paragraphs , all upon a certain subject , and all of about the same tenor .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 6]: I here give honest specimens .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 36]: One is from a New York paper , one is from a letter from an old friend , and one is from a letter from a New York publisher who is a stranger to me .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 77]: I humbly endeavor to make these bits toothsome with the remark that the article they are praising -LRB- which appeared in the December GALAXY , and PRETENDED to be a criticism from the London SATURDAY REVIEW on my INNOCENTS ABROAD -RRB- WAS WRITTEN BY MYSELF , EVERY LINE OF IT : The HERALD says the richest thing out is the `` serious critique '' in the London SATURDAY REVIEW , on Mark Twain 's INNOCENTS ABROAD .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 68]: We thought before we read it that it must be `` serious , '' as everybody said so , and were even ready to shed a few tears ; but since perusing it , we are bound to confess that next to Mark Twain 's `` Jumping Frog '' it 's the finest bit of humor and sarcasm that we 've come across in many a day .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 13]: -LRB- I do not get a compliment like that every day . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 34]: I used to think that your writings were pretty good , but after reading the criticism in THE GALAXY from the LONDON REVIEW , have discovered what an ass I must have been .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 42]: If suggestions are in order , mine is , that you put that article in your next edition of the INNOCENTS , as an extra chapter , if you are not afraid to put your own humor in competition with it .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 11]: It is as rich a thing as I ever read .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 11]: -LRB- Which is strong commendation from a book publisher . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 42]: The London Reviewer , my friend , is not the stupid , `` serious '' creature he pretends to be , _ I _ think ; but , on the contrary , has a keep appreciation and enjoyment of your book .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 21]: As I read his article in THE GALAXY , I could imagine him giving vent to many a hearty laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 42]: But he is writing for Catholics and Established Church people , and high-toned , antiquated , conservative gentility , whom it is a delight to him to help you shock , while he pretends to shake his head with owlish density .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 7]: He is a magnificent humorist himself .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 8]: -LRB- Now that is graceful and handsome .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 42]: I take off my hat to my life-long friend and comrade , and with my feet together and my fingers spread over my heart , I say , in the language of Alabama , `` You do me proud . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 18]: I stand guilty of the authorship of the article , but I did not mean any harm .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 73]: I saw by an item in the Boston ADVERTISER that a solemn , serious critique on the English edition of my book had appeared in the London SATURDAY REVIEW , and the idea of SUCH a literary breakfast by a stolid , ponderous British ogre of the quill was too much for a naturally weak virtue , and I went home and burlesqued it -- reveled in it , I may say .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 23]: I never saw a copy of the real SATURDAY REVIEW criticism until after my burlesque was written and mailed to the printer .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 29]: But when I did get hold of a copy , I found it to be vulgar , awkwardly written , ill-natured , and entirely serious and in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 18]: The gentleman who wrote the newspaper paragraph above quoted had not been misled as to its character .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 13]: If any man doubts my word now , I will kill him .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 14]: No , I will not kill him ; I will win his money .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 38]: I will bet him twenty to one , and let any New York publisher hold the stakes , that the statements I have above made as to the authorship of the article in question are entirely true .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 36]: Perhaps I may get wealthy at this , for I am willing to take all the bets that offer ; and if a man wants larger odds , I will give him all he requires .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 54]: But he ought to find out whether I am betting on what is termed `` a sure thing '' or not before he ventures his money , and he can do that by going to a public library and examining the London SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th , which contains the real critique .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 17]: Bless me , some people thought that _ I _ was the `` sold '' person !
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 33]: P.S. -- I can not resist the temptation to toss in this most savory thing of all -- this easy , graceful , philosophical disquisition , with his happy , chirping confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 19]: It is from the Cincinnati ENQUIRER : Nothing is more uncertain than the value of a fine cigar .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 32]: Nine smokers out of ten would prefer an ordinary domestic article , three for a quarter , to fifty-cent Partaga , if kept in ignorance of the cost of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 19]: The flavor of the Partaga is too delicate for palates that have been accustomed to Connecticut seed leaf .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 6]: So it is with humor .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 18]: The finer it is in quality , the more danger of its not being recognized at all .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 16]: Even Mark Twain has been taken in by an English review of his INNOCENTS ABROAD .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 37]: Mark Twain is by no means a coarse humorist , but the Englishman 's humor is so much finer than his , that he mistakes it for solid earnest , and `` lafts most consumedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 12]: A man who can not learn stands in his own light .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 59]: Hereafter , when I write an article which I know to be good , but which I may have reason to fear will not , in some quarters , be considered to amount to much , coming from an American , I will aver that an Englishman wrote it and that it is copied from a London journal .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 14]: And then I will occupy a back seat and enjoy the cordial applause .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 38]: -LRB- Still later -RRB- Mark Twain at last sees that the SATURDAY REVIEW 'S criticism of his INNOCENTS ABROAD was not serious , and he is intensely mortified at the thought of having been so badly sold .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 32]: He takes the only course left him , and in the last GALAXY claims that HE wrote the criticism himself , and published it in THE GALAXY to sell the public .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 11]: This is ingenious , but unfortunately it is not true .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 48]: If any of our readers will take the trouble to call at this office we sill show them the original article in the SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th , which , on comparison , will be found to be identical with the one published in THE GALAXY .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 23]: The best thing for Mark to do will be to admit that he was sold , and say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: The above is from the Cincinnati ENQUIRER , and is a falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 5]: Come to the proof .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 56]: If the ENQUIRER people , through any agent , will produce at THE GALAXY office a London SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th , containing an article which , on comparison , will be found to be identical with the one published in THE GALAXY , I will pay to that agent five hundred dollars cash .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 66]: Moreover , if at any specified time I fail to produce at the same place a copy of the London SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th , containing a lengthy criticism upon the INNOCENTS ABROAD , entirely different , in every paragraph and sentence , from the one I published in THE GALAXY , I will pay to the ENQUIRER agent another five hundred dollars cash .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 20]: I offer Sheldon & Co. , publishers , 500 Broadway , New York , as my `` backers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 16]: Any one in New York , authorized by the ENQUIRER , will receive prompt attention .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 28]: It is an easy and profitable way for the ENQUIRER people to prove that they have not uttered a pitiful , deliberate falsehood in the above paragraphs .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 18]: Will they swallow that falsehood ignominiously , or will they send an agent to THE GALAXY office .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 11]: I think the Cincinnati ENQUIRER must be edited by children .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 15]: A LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY Riverdale-on-the-Hudson , OCTOBER 15 , 1902 .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 73]: THE HON. THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY , WASHINGTON , D. C. : Sir , -- Prices for the customary kinds of winter fuel having reached an altitude which puts them out of the reach of literary persons in straitened circumstances , I desire to place with you the following order : Forty-five tons best old dry government bonds , suitable for furnace , gold 7 per cents. , 1864 , preferred .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 12]: Twelve tons early greenbacks , range size , suitable for cooking .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 18]: Eight barrels seasoned 25 and 50 cent postal currency , vintage of 1866 , eligible for kindlings .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 40]: Please deliver with all convenient despatch at my house in Riverdale at lowest rates for spot cash , and send bill to Your obliged servant , Mark Twain , Who will be very grateful , and will vote right .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 26]: AMENDED OBITUARIES TO THE EDITOR : Sir , -- I am approaching seventy ; it is in sight ; it is only three years away .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 7]: Necessarily , I must go soon .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 185]: It is but matter-of-course wisdom , then , that I should begin to set my worldly house in order now , so that it may be done calmly and with thoroughness , in place of waiting until the last day , when , as we have often seen , the attempt to set both houses in order at the same time has been marred by the necessity for haste and by the confusion and waste of time arising from the inability of the notary and the ecclesiastic to work together harmoniously , taking turn about and giving each other friendly assistance -- not perhaps in fielding , which could hardly be expected , but at least in the minor offices of keeping game and umpiring ; by consequence of which conflict of interests and absence of harmonious action a draw has frequently resulted where this ill-fortune could not have happened if the houses had been set in order one at a time and hurry avoided by beginning in season , and giving to each the amount of time fairly and justly proper to it .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 45]: In setting my earthly house in order I find it of moment that I should attend in person to one or two matters which men in my position have long had the habit of leaving wholly to others , with consequences often most regrettable .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 16]: I wish to speak of only one of these matters at this time : Obituaries .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 27]: Of necessity , an Obituary is a thing which can not be so judiciously edited by any hand as by that of the subject of it .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 54]: In such a work it is not the Facts that are of chief importance , but the light which the obituarist shall throw upon them , the meaning which he shall dress them in , the conclusions which he shall draw from them , and the judgments which he shall deliver upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 11]: The Verdicts , you understand : that is the danger-line .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 65]: In considering this matter , in view of my approaching change , it has seemed to me wise to take such measures as may be feasible , to acquire , by courtesy of the press , access to my standing obituaries , with the privilege -- if this is not asking too much -- of editing , not their Facts , but their Verdicts .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 37]: This , not for the present profit , further than as concerns my family , but as a favorable influence usable on the Other Side , where there are some who are not friendly to me .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 26]: With this explanation of my motives , I will now ask you of your courtesy to make an appeal for me to the public press .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 47]: It is my desire that such journals and periodicals as have obituaries of me lying in their pigeonholes , with a view to sudden use some day , will not wait longer , but will publish them now , and kindly send me a marked copy .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 19]: My address is simply New York City -- I have no other that is permanent and not transient .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 39]: I will correct them -- not the Facts , but the Verdicts -- striking out such clauses as could have a deleterious influence on the Other Side , and replacing them with clauses of a more judicious character .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 50]: I should , of course , expect to pay double rates for both the omissions and the substitutions ; and I should also expect to pay quadruple rates for all obituaries which proved to be rightly and wisely worded in the originals , thus requiring no emendations at all .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 41]: It is my desire to leave these Amended Obituaries neatly bound behind me as a perennial consolation and entertainment to my family , and as an heirloom which shall have a mournful but definite commercial value for my remote posterity .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 28]: I beg , sir , that you will insert this Advertisement -LRB- 1t-eow , agate , inside -RRB- , and send the bill to Yours very respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 3]: Mark Twain .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 47]: P.S. -- For the best Obituary -- one suitable for me to read in public , and calculated to inspire regret -- I desire to offer a Prize , consisting of a Portrait of me done entirely by myself in pen and ink without previous instructions .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 14]: The ink warranted to be the kind used by the very best artists .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 44]: A MONUMENT TO ADAM Some one has revealed to the TRIBUNE that I once suggested to Rev. Thomas K. Beecher , of Elmira , New York , that we get up a monument to Adam , and that Mr. Beecher favored the project .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 8]: There is more to it than that .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 15]: The matter started as a joke , but it came somewhat near to materializing .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 8]: It is long ago -- thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 31]: Mr. Darwin 's DESCENT OF MAN has been in print five or six years , and the storm of indignation raised by it was still raging in pulpits and periodicals .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 21]: In tracing the genesis of the human race back to its sources , Mr. Darwin had left Adam out altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 22]: We had monkeys , and `` missing links , '' and plenty of other kinds of ancestors , but no Adam .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 80]: Jesting with Mr. Beecher and other friends in Elmira , I said there seemed to be a likelihood that the world would discard Adam and accept the monkey , and that in the course of time Adam 's very name would be forgotten in the earth ; therefore this calamity ought to be averted ; a monument would accomplish this , and Elmira ought not to waste this honorable opportunity to do Adam a favor and herself a credit .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 5]: Then the unexpected happened .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 33]: Two bankers came forward and took hold of the matter -- not for fun , not for sentiment , but because they saw in the monument certain commercial advantages for the town .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 24]: The project had seemed gently humorous before -- it was more than that now , with this stern business gravity injected into it .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 8]: The bankers discussed the monument with me .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 5]: We met several times .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 12]: They proposed an indestructible memorial , to cost twenty-five thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 42]: The insane oddity of a monument set up in a village to preserve a name that would outlast the hills and the rocks without any such help , would advertise Elmira to the ends of the earth -- and draw custom .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 37]: It would be the only monument on the planet to Adam , and in the matter of interest and impressiveness could never have a rival until somebody should set up a monument to the Milky Way .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 32]: People would come from every corner of the globe and stop off to look at it , no tour of the world would be complete that left out Adam 's monument .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 61]: Elmira would be a Mecca ; there would be pilgrim ships at pilgrim rates , pilgrim specials on the continent 's railways ; libraries would be written about the monument , every tourist would kodak it , models of it would be for sale everywhere in the earth , its form would become as familiar as the figure of Napoleon .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 36]: One of the bankers subscribed five thousand dollars , and I think the other one subscribed half as much , but I do not remember with certainty now whether that was the figure or not .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 12]: We got designs made -- some of them came from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 78]: In the beginning -- as a detail of the project when it was yet a joke -- I had framed a humble and beseeching and perfervid petition to Congress begging the government to built the monument , as a testimony of the Great Republic 's gratitude to the Father of the Human Race and as a token of her loyalty to him in this dark day of humiliation when his older children were doubting and deserting him .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 40]: It seemed to me that this petition ought to be presented , now -- it would be widely and feelingly abused and ridiculed and cursed , and would advertise our scheme and make our ground-floor stock go off briskly .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 25]: So I sent it to General Joseph R. Hawley , who was then in the House , and he said he would present it .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 7]: But he did not do it .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 36]: I think he explained that when he came to read it he was afraid of it : it was too serious , to gushy , too sentimental -- the House might take it for earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 33]: We ought to have carried out our monument scheme ; we could have managed it without any great difficulty , and Elmira would now be the most celebrated town in the universe .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 44]: Very recently I began to build a book in which one of the minor characters touches incidentally upon a project for a monument to Adam , and now the TRIBUNE has come upon a trace of the forgotten jest of thirty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 8]: Apparently mental telegraphy is still in business .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 14]: It is odd ; but the freaks of mental telegraphy are usually odd .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 36]: A HUMANE WORD FROM SATAN -LRB- The following letter , signed by Satan and purporting to come from him , we have reason to believe was not written by him , but by Mark Twain .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 4]: -- Editor . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 23]: TO THE EDITOR OF HARPER 'S WEEKLY : Dear Sir and Kinsman , -- Let us have done with this frivolous talk .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 19]: The American Board accepts contributions from me every year : then why should n't it from Mr. Rockefeller ?
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 40]: In all the ages , three-fourths of the support of the great charities has been conscience-money , as my books will show : then what becomes of the sting when that term is applied to Mr. Rockefeller 's gift ?
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 12]: The American Board 's trade is financed mainly from the graveyards .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 5]: Bequests , you understand .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 2]: Conscience-money .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 24]: Confession of an old crime and deliberate perpetration of a new one ; for deceased 's contribution is a robbery of his heirs .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 20]: Shall the Board decline bequests because they stand for one of these offenses every time and generally for both ?
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 5]: Allow me to continue .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 30]: The charge must persistently and resentfully and remorselessly dwelt upon is that Mr. Rockefeller 's contribution is incurably tainted by perjury -- perjury proved against him in the courts .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 10]: IT MAKES US SMILE -- down in my place !
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 23]: Because there is n't a rich man in your vast city who does n't perjure himself every year before the tax board .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 11]: They are all caked with perjury , many layers thick .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 6]: Iron-clad , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 23]: If there is one that is n't , I desire to acquire him for my museum , and will pay Dinosaur rates .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 18]: Will you say it is n't infraction of the law , but only annual evasion of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 14]: Comfort yourselves with that nice distinction if you like -- FOR THE PRESENT .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 22]: But by and by , when you arrive , I will show you something interesting : a whole hell-full of evaders !
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 16]: Sometimes a frank law-breaker turns up elsewhere , but I get those others every time .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 6]: To return to my muttons .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 98]: I wish you to remember that my rich perjurers are contributing to the American Board with frequency : it is money filched from the sworn-off personal tax ; therefore it is the wages of sin ; therefore it is my money ; therefore it is _ I _ that contribute it ; and , finally , it is therefore as I have said : since the Board daily accepts contributions from me , why should it decline them from Mr. Rockefeller , who is as good as I am , let the courts say what they may ?
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 2]: Satan .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 61]: INTRODUCTION TO `` THE NEW GUIDE OF THE CONVERSATION IN PORTUGUESE AND ENGLISH '' by Pedro Carolino In this world of uncertainties , there is , at any rate , one thing which may be pretty confidently set down as a certainty : and that is , that this celebrated little phrase-book will never die while the English language lasts .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 26]: Its delicious unconscious ridiculousness , and its enchanting naivete , as are supreme and unapproachable , in their way , as are Shakespeare 's sublimities .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 43]: Whatsoever is perfect in its kind , in literature , is imperishable : nobody can imitate it successfully , nobody can hope to produce its fellow ; it is perfect , it must and will stand alone : its immortality is secure .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 53]: It is one of the smallest books in the world , but few big books have received such wide attention , and been so much pondered by the grave and learned , and so much discussed and written about by the thoughtful , the thoughtless , the wise , and the foolish .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 52]: Long notices of it have appeared , from time to time , in the great English reviews , and in erudite and authoritative philological periodicals ; and it has been laughed at , danced upon , and tossed in a blanket by nearly every newspaper and magazine in the English-speaking world .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 26]: Every scribbler , almost , has had his little fling at it , at one time or another ; I had mine fifteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 79]: The book gets out of print , every now and then , and one ceases to hear of it for a season ; but presently the nations and near and far colonies of our tongue and lineage call for it once more , and once more it issues from some London or Continental or American press , and runs a new course around the globe , wafted on its way by the wind of a world 's laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 29]: Many persons have believed that this book 's miraculous stupidities were studied and disingenuous ; but no one can read the volume carefully through and keep that opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 35]: It was written in serious good faith and deep earnestness , by an honest and upright idiot who believed he knew something of the English language , and could impart his knowledge to others .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 16]: The amplest proof of this crops out somewhere or other upon each and every page .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 64]: There are sentences in the book which could have been manufactured by a man in his right mind , and with an intelligent and deliberate purposes to seem innocently ignorant ; but there are other sentences , and paragraphs , which no mere pretended ignorance could ever achieve -- nor yet even the most genuine and comprehensive ignorance , when unbacked by inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 108]: It is not a fraud who speaks in the following paragraph of the author 's Preface , but a good man , an honest man , a man whose conscience is at rest , a man who believes he has done a high and worthy work for his nation and his generation , and is well pleased with his performance : We expect then , who the little book -LRB- for the care what we wrote him , and for her typographical correction -RRB- that may be worth the acceptation of the studious persons , and especially of the Youth , at which we dedicate him particularly .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 12]: One can not open this book anywhere and not find richness .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 23]: To prove that this is true , I will open it at random and copy the page I happen to stumble upon .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 26]: Here is the result : DIALOGUE 16 For To See the Town Anothony , go to accompany they gentilsmen , do they see the town .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 12]: We wo n't to see all that is it remarquable here .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 8]: Come with me , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 12]: I shall not folget nothing what can to merit your attention .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 13]: Here we are near to cathedral ; will you come in there ?
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 21]: We will first to see him in oudside , after we shall go in there for to look the interior .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 8]: Admire this master piece gothic architecture 's .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 11]: The chasing of all they figures is astonishing ' indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 12]: The cupola and the nave are not less curious to see .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 9]: What is this palace how I see yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 6]: It is the town hall .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 8]: And this tower here at this side ?
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 5]: It is the Observatory .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 18]: The bridge is very fine , it have ten arches , and is constructed of free stone .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 12]: The streets are very layed out by line and too paved .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 8]: What is the circuit of this town ?
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 3]: Two leagues .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 7]: There is it also hospitals here ?
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 5]: It not fail them .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 11]: What are then the edifices the worthest to have seen ?
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 17]: It is the arsnehal , the spectacle 's hall , the Cusiomhouse , and the Purse .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 29]: We are going too see the others monuments such that the public pawnbroker 's office , the plants garden 's , the money office 's , the library .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 12]: That it shall be for another day ; we are tired .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 22]: DIALOGUE 17 To Inform One ` self of a Person How is that gentilman who you did speak by and by ?
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 4]: Is a German .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 6]: I did think him Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 7]: He is of the Saxony side .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 7]: He speak the french very well .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 37]: Tough he is German , he speak so much well italyan , french , spanish and english , that among the Italyans , they believe him Italyan , he speak the frenche as the Frenches himselves .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 12]: The Spanishesmen believe him Spanishing , and the Englishes , Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 11]: It is difficult to enjoy well so much several languages .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 41]: The last remark contains a general truth ; but it ceases to be a truth when one contracts it and apples it to an individual -- provided that that individual is the author of this book , Sehnor Pedro Carolino .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 41]: I am sure I should not find it difficult `` to enjoy well so much several languages '' -- or even a thousand of them -- if he did the translating for me from the originals into his ostensible English .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 20]: ADVICE TO LITTLE GIRLS Good little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers for every trifling offense .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 12]: This retaliation should only be resorted to under peculiarly aggravated circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 36]: If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust , while one of your more fortunate little playmates has a costly China one , you should treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 32]: And you ought not to attempt to make a forcible swap with her unless your conscience would justify you in it , and you know you are able to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 47]: You ought never to take your little brother 's `` chewing-gum '' away from him by main force ; it is better to rope him in with the promise of the first two dollars and a half you find floating down the river on a grindstone .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 21]: In the artless simplicity natural to this time of life , he will regard it as a perfectly fair transaction .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 21]: In all ages of the world this eminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant to financial ruin and disaster .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 38]: If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother , do not correct him with mud -- never , on any account , throw mud at him , because it will spoil his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 16]: It is better to scald him a little , for then you obtain desirable results .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 39]: You secure his immediate attention to the lessons you are inculcating , and at the same time your hot water will have a tendency to move impurities from his person , and possibly the skin , in spots .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 20]: If your mother tells you to do a thing , it is wrong to reply that you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 34]: It is better and more becoming to intimate that you will do as she bids you , and then afterward act quietly in the matter according to the dictates of your best judgment .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 39]: You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parents that you are indebted for your food , and for the privilege of staying home from school when you let on that you are sick .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 31]: Therefore you ought to respect their little prejudices , and humor their little whims , and put up with their little foibles until they get to crowding you too much .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 11]: Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 17]: You ought never to `` sass '' old people unless they `` sass '' you first .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 23]: POST-MORTEM POETRY -LRB- 1 -RRB- In Philadelphia they have a custom which it would be pleasant to see adopted throughout the land .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 17]: It is that of appending to published death-notices a little verse or two of comforting poetry .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 25]: Any one who is in the habit of reading the daily Philadelphia LEDGER must frequently be touched by these plaintive tributes to extinguished worth .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 31]: In Philadelphia , the departure of a child is a circumstance which is not more surely followed by a burial than by the accustomed solacing poesy in the PUBLIC LEDGER .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 24]: In that city death loses half its terror because the knowledge of its presence comes thus disguised in the sweet drapery of verse .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 21]: For instance , in a late LEDGER I find the following -LRB- I change the surname -RRB- : DIED Hawks .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 23]: -- On the 17th inst. , Clara , the daughter of Ephraim and Laura Hawks , aged 21 months and 2 days .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 42]: That merry shout no more I hear , No laughing child I see , No little arms are around my neck , No feet upon my knee ; No kisses drop upon my cheek , These lips are sealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 15]: Dear Lord , how could I give Clara up To any but to Thee ?
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 10]: A child thus mourned could not die wholly discontented .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 23]: From the LEDGER of the same date I make the following extract , merely changing the surname , as before : Becket .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 30]: -- On Sunday morning , 19th inst. , John P. , infant son of George and Julia Becket , aged 1 year , 6 months , and 15 days .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 42]: That merry shout no more I hear , No laughing child I see , No little arms are round my neck , No feet upon my knee ; No kisses drop upon my cheek ; These lips are sealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 15]: Dear Lord , how could I give Johnnie up To any but to Thee ?
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 41]: The similarity of the emotions as produced in the mourners in these two instances is remarkably evidenced by the singular similarity of thought which they experienced , and the surprising coincidence of language used by them to give it expression .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 24]: In the same journal , of the same date , I find the following -LRB- surname suppressed , as before -RRB- : Wagner .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 26]: -- On the 10th inst. , Ferguson G. , the son of William L. and Martha Theresa Wagner , aged 4 weeks and 1 day .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 42]: That merry shout no more I hear , No laughing child I see , No little arms are round my neck , No feet upon my knee ; No kisses drop upon my cheek , These lips are sealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 15]: Dear Lord , how could I give Ferguson up To any but to Thee ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 18]: It is strange what power the reiteration of an essentially poetical thought has upon one 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 23]: When we take up the LEDGER and read the poetry about little Clara , we feel an unaccountable depression of the spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 30]: When we drift further down the column and read the poetry about little Johnnie , the depression and spirits acquires and added emphasis , and we experience tangible suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 29]: When we saunter along down the column further still and read the poetry about little Ferguson , the word torture but vaguely suggests the anguish that rends us .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 25]: In the LEDGER -LRB- same copy referred to above -RRB- I find the following -LRB- I alter surname , as usual -RRB- : Welch .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 33]: -- On the 5th inst. , Mary C. Welch , wife of William B. Welch , and daughter of Catharine and George W. Markland , in the 29th year of her age .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 16]: A mother dear , a mother kind , Has gone and left us all behind .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 16]: Cease to weep , for tears are vain , Mother dear is out of pain .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 33]: Farewell , husband , children dear , Serve thy God with filial fear , And meet me in the land above , Where all is peace , and joy , and love .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 7]: What could be sweeter than that ?
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 63]: No collection of salient facts -LRB- without reduction to tabular form -RRB- could be more succinctly stated than is done in the first stanza by the surviving relatives , and no more concise and comprehensive program of farewells , post-mortuary general orders , etc. , could be framed in any form than is done in verse by deceased in the last stanza .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 12]: These things insensibly make us wiser and tenderer , and better .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 5]: Another extract : Ball .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 20]: -- On the morning of the 15th inst. , Mary E. , daughter of John and Sarah F. Ball .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 27]: 'T is sweet to rest in lively hope That when my change shall come Angels will hover round my bed , To waft my spirit home .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 14]: The following is apparently the customary form for heads of families : Burns .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 13]: -- On the 20th inst. , Michael Burns , aged 40 years .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 31]: Dearest father , thou hast left us , Hear thy loss we deeply feel ; But 't is God that has bereft us , He can all our sorrows heal .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 6]: Funeral at 2 o'clock sharp .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 28]: There is something very simple and pleasant about the following , which , in Philadelphia , seems to be the usual form for consumptives of long standing .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 24]: -LRB- It deplores four distinct cases in the single copy of the LEDGER which lies on the Memoranda editorial table -RRB- : Bromley .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 20]: -- On the 29th inst. , of consumption , Philip Bromley , in the 50th year of his age .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 28]: Affliction sore long time he bore , Physicians were in vain -- Till God at last did hear him mourn , And eased him of his pain .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 32]: That friend whom death from us has torn , We did not think so soon to part ; An anxious care now sinks the thorn Still deeper in our bleeding heart .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 8]: This beautiful creation loses nothing by repetition .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 21]: On the contrary , the oftener one sees it in the LEDGER , the more grand and awe-inspiring it seems .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 10]: With one more extract I will close : Doble .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 15]: -- On the 4th inst. , Samuel Pervil Worthington Doble , aged 4 days .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 25]: Our little Sammy 's gone , His tiny spirit 's fled ; Our little boy we loved so dear Lies sleeping with the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 26]: A tear within a father 's eye , A mother 's aching heart , Can only tell the agony How hard it is to part .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 15]: Could anything be more plaintive than that , without requiring further concessions of grammar ?
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 20]: Could anything be likely to do more toward reconciling deceased to circumstances , and making him willing to go ?
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 3]: Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 9]: The power of song can hardly be estimated .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 27]: There is an element about some poetry which is able to make even physical suffering and death cheerful things to contemplate and consummations to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 14]: This element is present in the mortuary poetry of Philadelphia degree of development .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 21]: The custom I have been treating of is one that should be adopted in all the cities of the land .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 69]: It is said that once a man of small consequence died , and the Rev. T. K. Beecher was asked to preach the funeral sermon -- a man who abhors the lauding of people , either dead or alive , except in dignified and simple language , and then only for merits which they actually possessed or possess , not merits which they merely ought to have possessed .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 11]: The friends of the deceased got up a stately funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 56]: They must have had misgivings that the corpse might not be praised strongly enough , for they prepared some manuscript headings and notes in which nothing was left unsaid on that subject that a fervid imagination and an unabridged dictionary could compile , and these they handed to the minister as he entered the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 41]: They were merely intended as suggestions , and so the friends were filled with consternation when the minister stood in the pulpit and proceeded to read off the curious odds and ends in ghastly detail and in a loud voice !
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 39]: And their consternation solidified to petrification when he paused at the end , contemplated the multitude reflectively , and then said , impressively : `` The man would be a fool who tried to add anything to that .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 5]: Let us pray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 31]: And with the same strict adhesion to truth it can be said that the man would be a fool who tried to add anything to the following transcendent obituary poem .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 50]: There is something so innocent , so guileless , so complacent , so unearthly serene and self-satisfied about this peerless `` hog-wash , '' that the man must be made of stone who can read it without a dulcet ecstasy creeping along his backbone and quivering in his marrow .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 25]: There is no need to say that this poem is genuine and in earnest , for its proofs are written all over its face .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 18]: An ingenious scribbler might imitate it after a fashion , but Shakespeare himself could not counterfeit it .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 36]: It is noticeable that the country editor who published it did not know that it was a treasure and the most perfect thing of its kind that the storehouses and museums of literature could show .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 122]: He did not dare to say no to the dread poet -- for such a poet must have been something of an apparition -- but he just shoveled it into his paper anywhere that came handy , and felt ashamed , and put that disgusted `` Published by Request '' over it , and hoped that his subscribers would overlook it or not feel an impulse to read it : -LRB- Published by Request -RRB- LINES Composed on the death of Samuel and Catharine Belknap 's children by M. A. Glaze Friends and neighbors all draw near , And listen to what I have to say ; And never leave your children dear When they are small , and go away .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 30]: But always think of that sad fate , That happened in year of ' 63 ; Four children with a house did burn , Think of their awful agony .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 30]: Their mother she had gone away , And left them there alone to stay ; The house took fire and down did burn ; Before their mother did return .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 20]: Their piteous cry the neighbors heard , And then the cry of fire was given ; But , ah !
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 14]: before they could them reach , Their little spirits had flown to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 34]: Their father he to war had gone , And on the battle-field was slain ; But little did he think when he went away , But what on earth they would meet again .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 29]: The neighbors often told his wife Not to leave his children there , Unless she got some one to stay , And of the little ones take care .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 36]: The oldest he was years not six , And the youngest only eleven months old , But often she had left them there alone , As , by the neighbors , I have been told .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 9]: How can she bear to see the place .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 28]: Where she so oft has left them there , Without a single one to look to them , Or of the little ones to take good care .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 38]: Oh , can she look upon the spot , Whereunder their little burnt bones lay , But what she thinks she hears them say , '' Twas God had pity , and took us on high . '
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 31]: And there may she kneel down and pray , And ask God her to forgive ; And she may lead a different life While she on earth remains to live .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 15]: Her husband and her children too , God has took from pain and woe .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 16]: May she reform and mend her ways , That she may also to them go .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 31]: And when it is God 's holy will , O , may she be prepared To meet her God and friends in peace , And leave this world of care .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 4]: Written in 1870 .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 23]: THE DANGER OF LYING IN BED The man in the ticket-office said : `` Have an accident insurance ticket , also ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 15]: `` No , '' I said , after studying the matter over a little .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 19]: `` No , I believe not ; I am going to be traveling by rail all day today .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 8]: However , tomorrow I do n't travel .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 7]: Give me one for tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 5]: The man looked puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 38]: He said : `` But it is for accident insurance , and if you are going to travel by rail -- '' `` If I am going to travel by rail I sha 'n' t need it .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 16]: Lying at home in bed is the thing _ I _ am afraid of . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 8]: I had been looking into this matter .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 51]: Last year I traveled twenty thousand miles , almost entirely by rail ; the year before , I traveled over twenty-five thousand miles , half by sea and half by rail ; and the year before that I traveled in the neighborhood of ten thousand miles , exclusively by rail .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 32]: I suppose if I put in all the little odd journeys here and there , I may say I have traveled sixty thousand miles during the three years I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 5]: AND NEVER AN ACCIDENT .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 36]: For a good while I said to myself every morning : `` Now I have escaped thus far , and so the chances are just that much increased that I shall catch it this time .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 12]: I will be shrewd , and buy an accident ticket . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 26]: And to a dead moral certainty I drew a blank , and went to bed that night without a joint started or a bone splintered .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 23]: I got tired of that sort of daily bother , and fell to buying accident tickets that were good for a month .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 18]: I said to myself , `` A man CA N'T buy thirty blanks in one bundle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 5]: But I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 10]: There was never a prize in the the lot .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 25]: I could read of railway accidents every day -- the newspaper atmosphere was foggy with them ; but somehow they never came my way .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 23]: I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accident business , and had nothing to show for it .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 20]: My suspicions were aroused , and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won in this lottery .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 24]: I found plenty of people who had invested , but not an individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 10]: I stopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 5]: The result was astounding .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 13]: THE PERIL LAY NOT IN TRAVELING , BUT IN STAYING AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 40]: I hunted up statistics , and was amazed to find that after all the glaring newspaper headlines concerning railroad disasters , less than THREE HUNDRED people had really lost their lives by those disasters in the preceding twelve months .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 14]: The Erie road was set down as the most murderous in the list .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 28]: It had killed forty-six -- or twenty-six , I do not exactly remember which , but I know the number was double that of any other road .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 40]: But the fact straightway suggested itself that the Erie was an immensely long road , and did more business than any other line in the country ; so the double number of killed ceased to be matter for surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 34]: By further figuring , it appeared that between New York and Rochester the Erie ran eight passenger-trains each way every day -- 16 altogether ; and carried a daily average of 6,000 persons .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 16]: That is about a million in six months -- the population of New York City .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 33]: Well , the Erie kills from 13 to 23 persons of ITS million in six months ; and in the same time 13,000 of New York 's million die in their beds !
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 10]: My flesh crept , my hair stood on end .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 6]: `` This is appalling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 18]: `` The danger is n't in traveling by rail , but in trusting to those deadly beds .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 10]: I will never sleep in a bed again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 15]: I had figured on considerably less than one-half the length of the Erie road .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 19]: It was plain that the entire road must transport at least eleven or twelve thousand people every day .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 22]: There are many short roads running out of Boston that do fully half as much ; a great many such roads .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 15]: There are many roads scattered about the Union that do a prodigious passenger business .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 25]: Therefore it was fair to presume that an average of 2,500 passengers a day for each road in the country would be almost correct .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 16]: There are 846 railway lines in our country , and 846 times 2,500 are 2,115,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 30]: So the railways of America move more than two millions of people every day ; six hundred and fifty millions of people a year , without counting the Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 68]: They do that , too -- there is no question about it ; though where they get the raw material is clear beyond the jurisdiction of my arithmetic ; for I have hunted the census through and through , and I find that there are not that many people in the United States , by a matter of six hundred and ten millions at the very least .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 13]: They must use some of the same people over again , likely .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 32]: San Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York ; there are 60 deaths a week in the former and 500 a week in the latter -- if they have luck .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 25]: That is 3,120 deaths a year in San Francisco , and eight times as many in New York -- say about 25,000 or 26,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 10]: The health of the two places is the same .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 37]: So we will let it stand as a fair presumption that this will hold good all over the country , and that consequently 25,000 out of every million of people we have must die every year .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 9]: That amounts to one-fortieth of our total population .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 10]: One million of us , then , die annually .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 68]: Out of this million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed , shot , drowned , hanged , poisoned , or meet a similarly violent death in some other popular way , such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirt conflagrations , getting buried in coal-mines , falling off house-tops , breaking through church , or lecture-room floors , taking patent medicines , or committing suicide in other forms .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 47]: The Erie railroad kills 23 to 46 ; the other 845 railroads kill an average of one-third of a man each ; and the rest of that million , amounting in the aggregate to that appalling figure of 987,631 corpses , die naturally in their beds !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 13]: You will excuse me from taking any more chances on those beds .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: The railroads are good enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 44]: And my advice to all people is , Do n't stay at home any more than you can help ; but when you have GOT to stay at home a while , buy a package of those insurance tickets and sit up nights .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 7]: You can not be too cautious .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 22]: -LRB- One can see now why I answered that ticket-agent in the manner recorded at the top of this sketch . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 23]: The moral of this composition is , that thoughtless people grumble more than is fair about railroad management in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 61]: When we consider that every day and night of the year full fourteen thousand railway-trains of various kinds , freighted with life and armed with death , go thundering over the land , the marvel is , NOT that they kill three hundred human beings in a twelvemonth , but that they do not kill three hundred times three hundred !
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 29]: PORTRAIT OF KING WILLIAM III I never can look at those periodical portraits in THE GALAXY magazine without feeling a wild , tempestuous ambition to be an artist .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 37]: I have seen thousands and thousands of pictures in my time -- acres of them here and leagues of them in the galleries of Europe -- but never any that moved me as these portraits do .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 20]: There is a portrait of Monsignore Capel in the November number , now COULD anything be sweeter than that ?
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 26]: And there was Bismarck 's , in the October number ; who can look at that without being purer and stronger and nobler for it ?
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 30]: And Thurlow and Weed 's picture in the September number ; I would not have died without seeing that , no , not for anything this world can give .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 41]: But look back still further and recall my own likeness as printed in the August number ; if I had been in my grave a thousand years when that appeared , I would have got up and visited the artist .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 30]: I sleep with all these portraits under my pillow every night , so that I can go on studying them as soon as the day dawns in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 23]: I know them all as thoroughly as if I had made them myself ; I know every line and mark about them .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 35]: Sometimes when company are present I shuffle the portraits all up together , and then pick them out one by one and call their names , without referring to the printing on the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 13]: I seldom make a mistake -- never , when I am calm .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 26]: I have had the portraits framed for a long time , waiting till my aunt gets everything ready for hanging them up in the parlor .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 16]: But first one thing and then another interferes , and so the thing is delayed .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 19]: Once she said they would have more of the peculiar kind of light they needed in the attic .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 4]: The old simpleton !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 10]: it is as dark as a tomb up there .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 18]: But she does not know anything about art , and so she has no reverence for it .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 20]: When I showed her my `` Map of the Fortifications of Paris , '' she said it was rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 22]: Well , from nursing those portraits so long , I have come at last to have a perfect infatuation for art .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 32]: I have a teacher now , and my enthusiasm continually and tumultuously grows , as I learn to use with more and more facility the pencil , brush , and graver .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 13]: I am studying under De Mellville , the house and portrait painter .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 13]: -LRB- His name was Smith when he lived in the West . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 22]: He does any kind of artist work a body wants , having a genius that is universal , like Michael Angelo .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 8]: Resembles that great artist , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 23]: The back of his head is like this , and he wears his hat-brim tilted down on his nose to expose it .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 11]: I have been studying under De Mellville several months now .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 12]: The first month I painted fences , and gave general satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 8]: The next month I white-washed a barn .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 25]: The third , I was doing tin roofs ; the forth , common signs ; the fifth , statuary to stand before cigar shops .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 15]: This present month is only the sixth , and I am already in portraits !
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 36]: The humble offering which accompanies these remarks -LRB- see figure -RRB- -- the portrait of his Majesty William III. , King of Prussia -- is my fifth attempt in portraits , and my greatest success .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 31]: It has received unbounded praise from all classes of the community , but that which gratifies me most is the frequent and cordial verdict that it resembles the GALAXY portraits .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 19]: Those were my first love , my earliest admiration , the original source and incentive of my art-ambition .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 13]: Whatever I am in Art today , I owe to these portraits .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 11]: I ask no credit for myself -- I deserve none .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 8]: And I never take any , either .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 46]: Many a stranger has come to my exhibition -LRB- for I have had my portrait of King William on exhibition at one dollar a ticket -RRB- , and would have gone away blessing ME , if I had let him , but I never did .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 9]: I always stated where I got the idea .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 24]: King William wears large bushy side-whiskers , and some critics have thought that this portrait would be more complete if they were added .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 6]: But it was not possible .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 30]: There was not room for side-whiskers and epaulets both , and so I let the whiskers go , and put in the epaulets , for the sake of style .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 9]: That thing on his hat is an eagle .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 10]: The Prussian eagle -- it is a national emblem .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 27]: When I say hat I mean helmet ; but it seems impossible to make a picture of a helmet that a body can have confidence in .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 21]: I wish kind friends everywhere would aid me in my endeavor to attract a little attention to the GALAXY portraits .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 19]: I feel persuaded it can be accomplished , if the course to be pursued be chosen with judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 41]: I write for that magazine all the time , and so do many abler men , and if I can get these portraits into universal favor , it is all I ask ; the reading-matter will take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 13]: COMMENDATIONS OF THE PORTRAIT There is nothing like it in the Vatican .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 3]: Pius IX .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 31]: It has none of that vagueness , that dreamy spirituality about it , which many of the first critics of Arkansas have objected to in the Murillo school of Art .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 2]: Ruskin .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 6]: The expression is very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 3]: J.W. Titian .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 15]: -LRB- Keeps a macaroni store in Venice , at the old family stand . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 14]: It is the neatest thing in still life I have seen for years .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 3]: Rosa Bonheur .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 8]: The smile may be almost called unique .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 2]: Bismarck .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 12]: I never saw such character portrayed in a picture face before .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 3]: De Mellville .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 30]: There is a benignant simplicity about the execution of this work which warms the heart toward it as much , full as much , as it fascinates the eye .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 2]: Landseer .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 12]: One can not see it without longing to contemplate the artist .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 3]: Frederick William .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 21]: Send me the entire edition -- together with the plate and the original portrait -- and name your own price .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 16]: And -- would you like to come over and stay awhile with Napoleon at Wilhelmshohe ?
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 8]: It shall not cost you a cent .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 3]: William III .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 9]: DOES THE RACE OF MAN LOVE A LORD ?
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 28]: Often a quite assified remark becomes sanctified by use and petrified by custom ; it is then a permanency , its term of activity a geologic period .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 109]: The day after the arrival of Prince Henry I met an English friend , and he rubbed his hands and broke out with a remark that was charged to the brim with joy -- joy that was evidently a pleasant salve to an old sore place : `` Many a time I 've had to listen without retort to an old saying that is irritatingly true , and until now seemed to offer no chance for a return jibe : ` An Englishman does dearly love a lord ' ; but after this I shall talk back , and say , ` How about the Americans ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: It is a curious thing , the currency that an idiotic saying can get .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 13]: The man that first says it thinks he has made a discovery .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 11]: The man he says it to , thinks the same .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 75]: It departs on its travels , is received everywhere with admiring acceptance , and not only as a piece of rare and acute observation , but as being exhaustively true and profoundly wise ; and so it presently takes its place in the world 's list of recognized and established wisdoms , and after that no one thinks of examining it to see whether it is really entitled to its high honors or not .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 63]: I call to mind instances of this in two well-established proverbs , whose dullness is not surpassed by the one about the Englishman and his love for a lord : one of them records the American 's Adoration of the Almighty Dollar , the other the American millionaire-girl 's ambition to trade cash for a title , with a husband thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 18]: It is n't merely the American that adores the Almighty Dollar , it is the human race .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 111]: The human race has always adored the hatful of shells , or the bale of calico , or the half-bushel of brass rings , or the handful of steel fish-hooks , or the houseful of black wives , or the zareba full of cattle , or the two-score camels and asses , or the factory , or the farm , or the block of buildings , or the railroad bonds , or the bank stock , or the hoarded cash , or -- anything that stands for wealth and consideration and independence , and can secure to the possessor that most precious of all things , another man 's envy .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 24]: It was a dull person that invented the idea that the American 's devotion to the dollar is more strenuous than another 's .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 28]: Rich American girls do buy titles , but they did not invent that idea ; it had been worn threadbare several hundred centuries before America was discovered .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 33]: European girls still exploit it as briskly as ever ; and , when a title is not to be had for the money in hand , they buy the husband without it .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 15]: They must put up the `` dot , '' or there is no trade .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 12]: The commercialization of brides is substantially universal , except in America .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 18]: It exists with us , to some little extent , but in no degree approaching a custom .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 9]: `` The Englishman dearly loves a lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 10]: What is the soul and source of this love ?
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 20]: I think the thing could be more correctly worded : `` The human race dearly envies a lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 12]: That is to say , it envies the lord 's place .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 13]: On two accounts , I think : its Power and its Conspicuousness .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 48]: Where Conspicuousness carries with it a Power which , by the light of our own observation and experience , we are able to measure and comprehend , I think our envy of the possessor is as deep and as passionate as is that of any other nation .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 69]: No one can care less for a lord than the backwoodsman , who has had no personal contact with lords and has seldom heard them spoken of ; but I will not allow that any Englishman has a profounder envy of a lord than has the average American who has lived long years in a European capital and fully learned how immense is the position the lord occupies .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 53]: Of any ten thousand Americans who eagerly gather , at vast inconvenience , to get a glimpse of Prince Henry , all but a couple of hundred will be there out of an immense curiosity ; they are burning up with desire to see a personage who is so much talked about .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 76]: They envy him ; but it is Conspicuousness they envy mainly , not the Power that is lodged in his royal quality and position , for they have but a vague and spectral knowledge and appreciation of that ; though their environment and associations they have been accustomed to regard such things lightly , and as not being very real ; consequently , they are not able to value them enough to consumingly envy them .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 58]: But , whenever an American -LRB- or other human being -RRB- is in the presence , for the first time , of a combination of great Power and Conspicuousness which he thoroughly understands and appreciates , his eager curiosity and pleasure will be well-sodden with that other passion -- envy -- whether he suspects it or not .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 45]: At any time , on any day , in any part of America , you can confer a happiness upon any passing stranger by calling his attention to any other passing stranger and saying : `` Do you see that gentleman going along there ?
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 6]: It is Mr. Rockefeller . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 4]: Watch his eye .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 13]: It is a combination of power and conspicuousness which the man understands .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 13]: When we understand rank , we always like to rub against it .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 13]: When a man is conspicuous , we always want to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 16]: Also , if he will pay us an attention we will manage to remember it .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 33]: Also , we will mention it now and then , casually ; sometimes to a friend , or if a friend is not handy , we will make out with a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 13]: Well , then , what is rank , and what is conspicuousness ?
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 28]: At once we think of kings and aristocracies , and of world-wide celebrities in soldierships , the arts , letters , etc. , and we stop there .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 6]: But that is a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 45]: Rank holds its court and receives its homage on every round of the ladder , from the emperor down to the rat-catcher ; and distinction , also , exists on every round of the ladder , and commands its due of deference and envy .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 50]: To worship rank and distinction is the dear and valued privilege of all the human race , and it is freely and joyfully exercised in democracies as well as in monarchies -- and even , to some extent , among those creatures whom we impertinently call the Lower Animals .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 23]: For even they have some poor little vanities and foibles , though in this matter they are paupers as compared to us .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 25]: A Chinese Emperor has the worship of his four hundred millions of subjects , but the rest of the world is indifferent to him .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 34]: A Christian Emperor has the worship of his subjects and of a large part of the Christian world outside of his domains ; but he is a matter of indifference to all China .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 77]: A king , class A , has an extensive worship ; a king , class B , has a less extensive worship ; class C , class D , class E get a steadily diminishing share of worship ; class L -LRB- Sultan of Zanzibar -RRB- , class P -LRB- Sultan of Sulu -RRB- , and class W -LRB- half-king of Samoa -RRB- , get no worship at all outside their own little patch of sovereignty .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 7]: Take the distinguished people along down .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 7]: Each has his group of homage-payers .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 74]: In the navy , there are many groups ; they start with the Secretary and the Admiral , and go down to the quartermaster -- and below ; for there will be groups among the sailors , and each of these groups will have a tar who is distinguished for his battles , or his strength , or his daring , or his profanity , and is admired and envied by his group .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 110]: The same with the army ; the same with the literary and journalistic craft ; the publishing craft ; the cod-fishery craft ; Standard Oil ; U. S. Steel ; the class A hotel -- and the rest of the alphabet in that line ; the class A prize-fighter -- and the rest of the alphabet in his line -- clear down to the lowest and obscurest six-boy gang of little gamins , with its one boy that can thrash the rest , and to whom he is king of Samoa , bottom of the royal race , but looked up to with a most ardent admiration and envy .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 35]: There is something pathetic , and funny , and pretty , about this human race 's fondness for contact with power and distinction , and for the reflected glory it gets out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 84]: The king , class A , is happy in the state banquet and the military show which the emperor provides for him , and he goes home and gathers the queen and the princelings around him in the privacy of the spare room , and tells them all about it , and says : `` His Imperial Majesty put his hand upon my shoulder in the most friendly way -- just as friendly and familiar , oh , you ca n't imagine it !
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 14]: -- and everybody SEEING him do it ; charming , perfectly charming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 101]: The king , class G , is happy in the cold collation and the police parade provided for him by the king , class B , and goes home and tells the family all about it , and says : `` And His Majesty took me into his own private cabinet for a smoke and a chat , and there we sat just as sociable , and talking away and laughing and chatting , just the same as if we had been born in the same bunk ; and all the servants in the anteroom could see us doing it !
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: Oh , it was too lovely for anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 55]: The king , class Q , is happy in the modest entertainment furnished him by the king , class M , and goes home and tells the household about it , and is as grateful and joyful over it as were his predecessors in the gaudier attentions that had fallen to their larger lot .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 49]: Emperors , kings , artisans , peasants , big people , little people -- at the bottom we are all alike and all the same ; all just alike on the inside , and when our clothes are off , nobody can tell which of us is which .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 26]: We are unanimous in the pride we take in good and genuine compliments paid us , and distinctions conferred upon us , in attentions shown .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 18]: There is not one of us , from the emperor down , but is made like that .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: Do I mean attentions shown us by the guest ?
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 15]: No , I mean simply flattering attentions , let them come whence they may .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 23]: We despise no source that can pay us a pleasing attention -- there is no source that is humble enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 41]: You have heard a dear little girl say to a frowzy and disreputable dog : `` He came right to me and let me pat him on the head , and he would n't let the others touch him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 14]: and you have seen her eyes dance with pride in that high distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 6]: You have often seen that .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 25]: If the child were a princess , would that random dog be able to confer the like glory upon her with his pretty compliment ?
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 32]: Yes ; and even in her mature life and seated upon a throne , she would still remember it , still recall it , still speak of it with frank satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 150]: That charming and lovable German princess and poet , Carmen Sylva , Queen of Roumania , remembers yet that the flowers of the woods and fields `` talked to her '' when she was a girl , and she sets it down in her latest book ; and that the squirrels conferred upon her and her father the valued compliment of not being afraid of them ; and `` once one of them , holding a nut between its sharp little teeth , ran right up against my father '' -- it has the very note of `` He came right to me and let me pat him on the head '' -- `` and when it saw itself reflected in his boot it was very much surprised , and stopped for a long time to contemplate itself in the polished leather '' -- then it went its way .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 4]: And the birds !
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 94]: she still remembers with pride that `` they came boldly into my room , '' when she had neglected her `` duty '' and put no food on the window-sill for them ; she knew all the wild birds , and forgets the royal crown on her head to remember with pride that they knew her ; also that the wasp and the bee were personal friends of hers , and never forgot that gracious relationship to her injury : `` never have I been stung by a wasp or a bee . ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 35]: And here is that proud note again that sings in that little child 's elation in being singled out , among all the company of children , for the random dog 's honor-conferring attentions .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 37]: `` Even in the very worst summer for wasps , when , in lunching out of doors , our table was covered with them and every one else was stung , they never hurt me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 82]: When a queen whose qualities of mind and heart and character are able to add distinction to so distinguished a place as a throne , remembers with grateful exultation , after thirty years , honors and distinctions conferred upon her by the humble , wild creatures of the forest , we are helped to realize that complimentary attentions , homage , distinctions , are of no caste , but are above all cast -- that they are a nobility-conferring power apart .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 6]: We all like these things .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 152]: When the gate-guard at the railway-station passes me through unchallenged and examines other people 's tickets , I feel as the king , class A , felt when the emperor put the imperial hand on his shoulder , `` everybody seeing him do it '' ; and as the child felt when the random dog allowed her to pat his head and ostracized the others ; and as the princess felt when the wasps spared her and stung the rest ; and I felt just so , four years ago in Vienna -LRB- and remember it yet -RRB- , when the helmeted police shut me off , with fifty others , from a street which the Emperor was to pass through , and the captain of the squad turned and saw the situation and said indignantly to that guard : `` Ca n't you see it is the Herr Mark Twain ?
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 5]: Let him through ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 82]: It was four years ago ; but it will be four hundred before I forget the wind of self-complacency that rose in me , and strained my buttons when I marked the deference for me evoked in the faces of my fellow-rabble , and noted , mingled with it , a puzzled and resentful expression which said , as plainly as speech could have worded it : `` And who in the nation is the Herr Mark Twain UM GOTTESWILLEN ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 38]: How many times in your life have you heard this boastful remark : `` I stood as close to him as I am to you ; I could have put out my hand and touched him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 11]: We have all heard it many and many a time .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 13]: It was a proud distinction to be able to say those words .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 25]: It brought envy to the speaker , a kind of glory ; and he basked in it and was happy through all his veins .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 10]: And who was it he stood so close to ?
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 8]: The answer would cover all the grades .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 50]: Sometimes it was a king ; sometimes it was a renowned highwayman ; sometimes it was an unknown man killed in an extraordinary way and made suddenly famous by it ; always it was a person who was for the moment the subject of public interest of a village .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 12]: `` I was there , and I saw it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 8]: That is a common and envy-compelling remark .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 79]: It can refer to a battle ; to a handing ; to a coronation ; to the killing of Jumbo by the railway-train ; to the arrival of Jenny Lind at the Battery ; to the meeting of the President and Prince Henry ; to the chase of a murderous maniac ; to the disaster in the tunnel ; to the explosion in the subway ; to a remarkable dog-fight ; to a village church struck by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 26]: It will be said , more or less causally , by everybody in America who has seen Prince Henry do anything , or try to .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 16]: The man who was absent and did n't see him to anything , will scoff .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 34]: It is his privilege ; and he can make capital out of it , too ; he will seem , even to himself , to be different from other Americans , and better .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 47]: As his opinion of his superior Americanism grows , and swells , and concentrates and coagulates , he will go further and try to belittle the distinction of those that saw the Prince do things , and will spoil their pleasure in it if he can .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 11]: My life has been embittered by that kind of person .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 55]: If you are able to tell of a special distinction that has fallen to your lot , it gravels them ; they can not bear it ; and they try to make believe that the thing you took for a special distinction was nothing of the kind and was meant in quite another way .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 11]: Once I was received in private audience by an emperor .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 28]: Last week I was telling a jealous person about it , and I could see him wince under it , see him bite , see him suffer .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 16]: I revealed the whole episode to him with considerable elaboration and nice attention to detail .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 14]: When I was through , he asked me what had impressed me most .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 9]: I said : `` His Majesty 's delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 30]: They told me to be sure and back out from the presence , and find the door-knob as best I could ; it was not allowable to face around .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 62]: Now the Emperor knew it would be a difficult ordeal for me , because of lack of practice ; and so , when it was time to part , he turned , with exceeding delicacy , and pretended to fumble with things on his desk , so I could get out in my own way , without his seeing me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 4]: It went home !
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 4]: It was vitriol !
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 20]: I saw the envy and disgruntlement rise in the man 's face ; he could n't keep it down .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 19]: I saw him try to fix up something in his mind to take the bloom off that distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 17]: I enjoyed that , for I judged that he had his work cut out for him .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 47]: He struggled along inwardly for quite a while ; then he said , with a manner of a person who has to say something and has n't anything relevant to say : `` You said he had a handful of special-brand cigars on the table ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 14]: `` Yes ; _ I _ never saw anything to match them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 5]: I had him again .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 48]: He had to fumble around in his mind as much as another minute before he could play ; then he said in as mean a way as I ever heard a person say anything : `` He could have been counting the cigars , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 9]: I can not endure a man like that .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 19]: It is nothing to him how unkind he is , so long as he takes the bloom off .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 7]: It is all he cares for .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 23]: `` An Englishman -LRB- or other human being -RRB- does dearly love a lord , '' -LRB- or other conspicuous person . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 5]: It includes us all .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 42]: We love to be noticed by the conspicuous person ; we love to be associated with such , or with a conspicuous event , even in a seventh-rate fashion , even in the forty-seventh , if we can not do better .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 11]: This accounts for some of our curious tastes in mementos .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 116]: It accounts for the large private trade in the Prince of Wales 's hair , which chambermaids were able to drive in that article of commerce when the Prince made the tour of the world in the long ago -- hair which probably did not always come from his brush , since enough of it was marketed to refurnish a bald comet ; it accounts for the fact that the rope which lynches a negro in the presence of ten thousand Christian spectators is salable five minutes later at two dollars and inch ; it accounts for the mournful fact that a royal personage does not venture to wear buttons on his coat in public .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 22]: We do love a lord -- and by that term I mean any person whose situation is higher than our own .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 46]: The lord of the group , for instance : a group of peers , a group of millionaires , a group of hoodlums , a group of sailors , a group of newsboys , a group of saloon politicians , a group of college girls .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 31]: No royal person has ever been the object of a more delirious loyalty and slavish adoration than is paid by the vast Tammany herd to its squalid idol in Wantage .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 24]: There is not a bifurcated animal in that menagerie that would not be proud to appear in a newspaper picture in his company .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 54]: At the same time , there are some in that organization who would scoff at the people who have been daily pictured in company with Prince Henry , and would say vigorously that THEY would not consent to be photographed with him -- a statement which would not be true in any instance .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 55]: There are hundreds of people in America who would frankly say to you that they would not be proud to be photographed in a group with the Prince , if invited ; and some of these unthinking people would believe it when they said it ; yet in no instance would it be true .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 24]: We have a large population , but we have not a large enough one , by several millions , to furnish that man .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 15]: He has not yet been begotten , and in fact he is not begettable .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 121]: You may take any of the printed groups , and there is n't a person in the dim background who is n't visibly trying to be vivid ; if it is a crowd of ten thousand -- ten thousand proud , untamed democrats , horny-handed sons of toil and of politics , and fliers of the eagle -- there is n't one who is trying to keep out of range , there is n't one who is n't plainly meditating a purchase of the paper in the morning , with the intention of hunting himself out in the picture and of framing and keeping it if he shall find so much of his person in it as his starboard ear .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 32]: We all love to get some of the drippings of Conspicuousness , and we will put up with a single , humble drip , if we ca n't get any more .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 23]: We may pretend otherwise , in conversation ; but we ca n't pretend it to ourselves privately -- and we do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 57]: We do confess in public that we are the noblest work of God , being moved to it by long habit , and teaching , and superstition ; but deep down in the secret places of our souls we recognize that , if we ARE the noblest work , the less said about it the better .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 32]: We of the North poke fun at the South for its fondness of titles -- a fondness for titles pure and simple , regardless of whether they are genuine or pinchbeck .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 34]: We forget that whatever a Southerner likes the rest of the human race likes , and that there is no law of predilection lodged in one people that is absent from another people .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 9]: There is no variety in the human race .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 17]: We are all children , all children of the one Adam , and we love toys .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 16]: We can soon acquire that Southern disease if some one will give it a start .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 9]: It already has a start , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 77]: I have been personally acquainted with over eighty-four thousand persons who , at one time or another in their lives , have served for a year or two on the staffs of our multitudinous governors , and through that fatality have been generals temporarily , and colonels temporarily , and judge-advocates temporarily ; but I have known only nine among them who could be hired to let the title go when it ceased to be legitimate .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 43]: I know thousands and thousands of governors who ceased to be governors away back in the last century ; but I am acquainted with only three who would answer your letter if you failed to call them `` Governor '' in it .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 65]: I know acres and acres of men who have done time in a legislature in prehistoric days , but among them is not half an acre whose resentment you would not raise if you addressed them as `` Mr. '' instead of `` Hon. '' The first thing a legislature does is to convene in an impressive legislative attitude , and get itself photographed .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 92]: Each member frames his copy and takes it to the woods and hangs it up in the most aggressively conspicuous place in his house ; and if you visit the house and fail to inquire what that accumulation is , the conversation will be brought around to it by that aforetime legislator , and he will show you a figure in it which in the course of years he has almost obliterated with the smut of his finger-marks , and say with a solemn joy , `` It 's me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 17]: Have you ever seen a country Congressman enter the hotel breakfast-room in Washington with his letters ?
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 13]: -- and sit at his table and let on to read them ?
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 9]: -- and wrinkle his brows and frown statesman-like ?
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 21]: -- keeping a furtive watch-out over his glasses all the while to see if he is being observed and admired ?
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 12]: -- those same old letters which he fetches in every morning ?
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 5]: Have you seen it ?
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 7]: Have you seen him show off ?
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 9]: It is THE sight of the national capital .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 7]: Except one ; a pathetic one .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 120]: That is the ex-Congressman : the poor fellow whose life has been ruined by a two-year taste of glory and of fictitious consequence ; who has been superseded , and ought to take his heartbreak home and hide it , but can not tear himself away from the scene of his lost little grandeur ; and so he lingers , and still lingers , year after year , unconsidered , sometimes snubbed , ashamed of his fallen estate , and valiantly trying to look otherwise ; dreary and depressed , but counterfeiting breeziness and gaiety , hailing with chummy familiarity , which is not always welcomed , the more-fortunes who are still in place and were once his mates .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 5]: Have you seen him ?
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 37]: He clings piteously to the one little shred that is left of his departed distinction -- the `` privilege of the floor '' ; and works it hard and gets what he can out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 9]: That is the saddest figure I know of .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 10]: Yes , we do so love our little distinctions !
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 25]: And then we loftily scoff at a Prince for enjoying his larger ones ; forgetting that if we only had his chance -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 9]: `` Senator '' is not a legitimate title .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 59]: A Senator has no more right to be addressed by it than have you or I ; but , in the several state capitals and in Washington , there are five thousand Senators who take very kindly to that fiction , and who purr gratefully when you call them by it -- which you may do quite unrebuked .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 17]: Then those same Senators smile at the self-constructed majors and generals and judges of the South !
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 14]: Indeed , we do love our distinctions , get them how we may .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 10]: And we work them for all they are worth .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 32]: In prayer we call ourselves `` worms of the dust , '' but it is only on a sort of tacit understanding that the remark shall not be taken at par .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 7]: WE -- worms of the dust !
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 9]: Oh , no , we are not that .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 18]: Except in fact ; and we do not deal much in fact when we are contemplating ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 38]: As a race , we do certainly love a lord -- let him be Croker , or a duke , or a prize-fighter , or whatever other personage shall chance to be the head of our group .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 25]: Many years ago , I saw a greasy youth in overalls standing by the HERALD office , with an expectant look in his face .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 16]: Soon a large man passed out , and gave him a pat on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 15]: That was what the boy was waiting for -- the large man 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 40]: The pat made him proud and happy , and the exultation inside of him shone out through his eyes ; and his mates were there to see the pat and envy it and wish they could have that glory .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 24]: The boy belonged down cellar in the press-room , the large man was king of the upper floors , foreman of the composing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 21]: The light in the boy 's face was worship , the foreman was his lord , head of his group .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 6]: The pat was an accolade .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 33]: It was as precious to the boy as it would have been if he had been an aristocrat 's son and the accolade had been delivered by his sovereign with a sword .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 30]: The quintessence of the honor was all there ; there was no difference in values ; in truth there was no difference present except an artificial one -- clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 47]: All the human race loves a lord -- that is , loves to look upon or be noticed by the possessor of Power or Conspicuousness ; and sometimes animals , born to better things and higher ideals , descend to man 's level in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 29]: In the Jardin des Plantes I have see a cat that was so vain of being the personal friend of an elephant that I was ashamed of her .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 7]: EXTRACTS FROM ADAM 'S DIARY MONDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 16]: -- This new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 10]: It is always hanging around and following me about .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 13]: I do n't like this ; I am not used to company .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 26]: I wish it would stay with the other animals ... Cloudy today , wind in the east ; think we shall have rain ... WE ?
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 13]: Where did I get that word -- the new creature uses it .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 2]: TUESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 7]: -- Been examining the great waterfall .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 12]: It is the finest thing on the estate , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 18]: The new creature calls it Niagara Falls -- why , I am sure I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 7]: Says it LOOKS like Niagara Falls .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 13]: That is not a reason , it is mere waywardness and imbecility .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 9]: I get no chance to name anything myself .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 17]: The new creature names everything that comes along , before I can get in a protest .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 14]: And always that same pretext is offered -- it LOOKS like the thing .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 8]: There is a dodo , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 21]: Says the moment one looks at it one sees at a glance that it `` looks like a dodo . ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 11]: It will have to keep that name , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 16]: It wearies me to fret about it , and it does no good , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 2]: Dodo !
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 11]: It looks no more like a dodo than I do .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 2]: WEDNESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 19]: -- Built me a shelter against the rain , but could not have it to myself in peace .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 5]: The new creature intruded .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 47]: When I tried to put it out it shed water out of the holes it looks with , and wiped it away with the back of its paws , and made a noise such as some of the other animals make when they are in distress .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 12]: I wish it would not talk ; it is always talking .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 22]: That sounds like a cheap fling at the poor creature , a slur ; but I do not mean it so .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 35]: I have never heard the human voice before , and any new and strange sound intruding itself here upon the solemn hush of these dreaming solitudes offends my ear and seems a false note .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 48]: And this new sound is so close to me ; it is right at my shoulder , right at my ear , first on one side and then on the other , and I am used only to sounds that are more or less distant from me .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 2]: FRIDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 14]: The naming goes recklessly on , in spite of anything I can do .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 21]: I had a very good name for the estate , and it was musical and pretty -- GARDEN OF EDEN .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 15]: Privately , I continue to call it that , but not any longer publicly .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 22]: The new creature says it is all woods and rocks and scenery , and therefore has no resemblance to a garden .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 17]: Says it LOOKS like a park , and does not look like anything BUT a park .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 14]: Consequently , without consulting me , it has been new-named NIAGARA FALLS PARK .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 10]: This is sufficiently high-handed , it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 22]: And already there is a sign up : KEEP OFF THE GRASS My life is not as happy as it was .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 2]: SATURDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 9]: -- The new creature eats too much fruit .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 10]: We are going to run short , most likely .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 22]: `` We '' again -- that is ITS word ; mine , too , now , from hearing it so much .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 7]: Good deal of fog this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 10]: I do not go out in the fog myself .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 5]: This new creature does .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 16]: It goes out in all weathers , and stumps right in with its muddy feet .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 3]: And talks .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 10]: It used to be so pleasant and quiet here .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 2]: SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 4]: -- Pulled through .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 11]: This day is getting to be more and more trying .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 14]: It was selected and set apart last November as a day of rest .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 10]: I had already six of them per week before .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 16]: This morning found the new creature trying to clod apples out of that forbidden tree .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 2]: MONDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 10]: -- The new creature says its name is Eve .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 10]: That is all right , I have no objections .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 15]: Says it is to call it by , when I want it to come .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 8]: I said it was superfluous , then .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 23]: The word evidently raised me in its respect ; and indeed it is a large , good word and will bear repetition .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 13]: It says it is not an It , it is a She .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 31]: This is probably doubtful ; yet it is all one to me ; what she is were nothing to me if she would but go by herself and not talk .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 2]: TUESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 48]: -- She has littered the whole estate with execrable names and offensive signs : This way to the Whirlpool This way to Goat Island Cave of the Winds this way She says this park would make a tidy summer resort if there was any custom for it .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 15]: Summer resort -- another invention of hers -- just words , without any meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 6]: What is a summer resort ?
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 17]: But it is best not to ask her , she has such a rage for explaining .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 2]: FRIDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 14]: -- She has taken to beseeching me to stop going over the Falls .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 6]: What harm does it do ?
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 6]: Says it makes her shudder .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 18]: I wonder why ; I have always done it -- always liked the plunge , and coolness .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 10]: I supposed it was what the Falls were for .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 19]: They have no other use that I can see , and they must have been made for something .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 16]: She says they were only made for scenery -- like the rhinoceros and the mastodon .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 14]: I went over the Falls in a barrel -- not satisfactory to her .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 10]: Went over in a tub -- still not satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 11]: Swam the Whirlpool and the Rapids in a fig-leaf suit .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 5]: It got much damaged .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 8]: Hence , tedious complaints about my extravagance .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 7]: I am too much hampered here .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 9]: What I need is a change of scene .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 2]: SATURDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 71]: -- I escaped last Tuesday night , and traveled two days , and built me another shelter in a secluded place , and obliterated my tracks as well as I could , but she hunted me out by means of a beast which she has tamed and calls a wolf , and came making that pitiful noise again , and shedding that water out of the places she looks with .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 17]: I was obliged to return with her , but will presently emigrate again when occasion offers .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 50]: She engages herself in many foolish things ; among others ; to study out why the animals called lions and tigers live on grass and flowers , when , as she says , the sort of teeth they wear would indicate that they were intended to eat each other .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 47]: This is foolish , because to do that would be to kill each other , and that would introduce what , as I understand , is called `` death '' ; and death , as I have been told , has not yet entered the Park .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 9]: Which is a pity , on some accounts .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 2]: SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 4]: -- Pulled through .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 2]: MONDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 25]: -- I believe I see what the week is for : it is to give time to rest up from the weariness of Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 6]: It seems a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 9]: ... She has been climbing that tree again .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 6]: Clodded her out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 6]: She said nobody was looking .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 13]: Seems to consider that a sufficient justification for chancing any dangerous thing .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 4]: Told her that .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 15]: The word justification moved her admiration -- and envy , too , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 6]: It is a good word .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 2]: TUESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 16]: -- She told me she was made out of a rib taken from my body .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 12]: This is at least doubtful , if not more than that .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 42]: I have not missed any rib ... She is in much trouble about the buzzard ; says grass does not agree with it ; is afraid she ca n't raise it ; thinks it was intended to live on decayed flesh .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 14]: The buzzard must get along the best it can with what is provided .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 12]: We can not overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 2]: SATURDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 22]: -- She fell in the pond yesterday when she was looking at herself in it , which she is always doing .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 11]: She nearly strangled , and said it was most uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 113]: This made her sorry for the creatures which live in there , which she calls fish , for she continues to fasten names on to things that do n't need them and do n't come when they are called by them , which is a matter of no consequence to her , she is such a numbskull , anyway ; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last night and put them in my bed to keep warm , but I have noticed them now and then all day and I do n't see that they are any happier there then they were before , only quieter .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 9]: When night comes I shall throw them outdoors .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 26]: I will not sleep with them again , for I find them clammy and unpleasant to lie among when a person has n't anything on .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 2]: SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 4]: -- Pulled through .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 2]: TUESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 10]: -- She has taken up with a snake now .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 35]: The other animals are glad , for she was always experimenting with them and bothering them ; and I am glad because the snake talks , and this enables me to get a rest .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 2]: FRIDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 29]: -- She says the snake advises her to try the fruit of the tree , and says the result will be a great and fine and noble education .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 19]: I told her there would be another result , too -- it would introduce death into the world .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 41]: That was a mistake -- it had been better to keep the remark to myself ; it only gave her an idea -- she could save the sick buzzard , and furnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 10]: I advised her to keep away from the tree .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 6]: She said she would n't .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 4]: I foresee trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 3]: Will emigrate .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 2]: WEDNESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 8]: -- I have had a variegated time .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 44]: I escaped last night , and rode a horse all night as fast as he could go , hoping to get clear of the Park and hide in some other country before the trouble should begin ; but it was not to be .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 65]: About an hour after sun-up , as I was riding through a flowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing , slumbering , or playing with each other , according to their wont , all of a sudden they broke into a tempest of frightful noises , and in one moment the plain was a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 20]: I knew what it meant -- Eve had eaten that fruit , and death was come into the world .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 65]: ... The tigers ate my house , paying no attention when I ordered them to desist , and they would have eaten me if I had stayed -- which I did n't , but went away in much haste ... I found this place , outside the Park , and was fairly comfortable for a few days , but she has found me out .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 17]: Found me out , and has named the place Tonawanda -- says it LOOKS like that .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 25]: In fact I was not sorry she came , for there are but meager pickings here , and she brought some of those apples .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 12]: I was obliged to eat them , I was so hungry .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 58]: It was against my principles , but I find that principles have no real force except when one is well fed ... She came curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves , and when I asked her what she meant by such nonsense , and snatched them away and threw them down , she tittered and blushed .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 20]: I had never seen a person titter and blush before , and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 11]: She said I would soon know how it was myself .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 4]: This was correct .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 62]: Hungry as I was , I laid down the apple half-eaten -- certainly the best one I ever saw , considering the lateness of the season -- and arrayed myself in the discarded boughs and branches , and then spoke to her with some severity and ordered her to go and get some more and not make a spectacle or herself .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 38]: She did it , and after this we crept down to where the wild-beast battle had been , and collected some skins , and I made her patch together a couple of suits proper for public occasions .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 31]: They are uncomfortable , it is true , but stylish , and that is the main point about clothes ... I find she is a good deal of a companion .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 19]: I see I should be lonesome and depressed without her , now that I have lost my property .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 16]: Another thing , she says it is ordered that we work for our living hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 5]: She will be useful .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 4]: I will superintend .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 4]: TEN DAYS LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 12]: -- She accuses ME of being the cause of our disaster !
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 26]: She says , with apparent sincerity and truth , that the Serpent assured her that the forbidden fruit was not apples , it was chestnuts .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 16]: I said I was innocent , then , for I had not eaten any chestnuts .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 21]: She said the Serpent informed her that `` chestnut '' was a figurative term meaning an aged and moldy joke .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 43]: I turned pale at that , for I have made many jokes to pass the weary time , and some of them could have been of that sort , though I had honestly supposed that they were new when I made them .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 16]: She asked me if I had made one just at the time of the catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 17]: I was obliged to admit that I had made one to myself , though not aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 4]: It was this .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 30]: I was thinking about the Falls , and I said to myself , `` How wonderful it is to see that vast body of water tumble down there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 36]: Then in an instant a bright thought flashed into my head , and I let it fly , saying , `` It would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble UP there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 31]: -- and I was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when all nature broke loose in war and death and I had to flee for my life .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 40]: `` There , '' she said , with triumph , `` that is just it ; the Serpent mentioned that very jest , and called it the First Chestnut , and said it was coeval with the creation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 8]: Alas , I am indeed to blame .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 18]: Would that I were not witty ; oh , that I had never had that radiant thought !
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 3]: NEXT YEAR .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 7]: -- We have named it Cain .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 43]: She caught it while I was up country trapping on the North Shore of the Erie ; caught it in the timber a couple of miles from our dug-out -- or it might have been four , she is n't certain which .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 13]: It resembles us in some ways , and may be a relation .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 16]: That is what she thinks , but this is an error , in my judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 57]: The difference in size warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animal -- a fish , perhaps , though when I put it in the water to see , it sank , and she plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the experiment to determine the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 27]: I still think it is a fish , but she is indifferent about what it is , and will not let me have it to try .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 6]: I do not understand this .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 19]: The coming of the creature seems to have changed her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 23]: She thinks more of it than she does of any of the other animals , but is not able to explain why .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 9]: Her mind is disordered -- everything shows it .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 22]: Sometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the night when it complains and wants to get to the water .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 48]: At such times the water comes out of the places in her face that she looks out of , and she pats the fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it , and betrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 19]: I have never seen her do like this with any other fish , and it troubles me greatly .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 42]: She used to carry the young tigers around so , and play with them , before we lost our property , but it was only play ; she never took on about them like this when their dinner disagreed with them .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 2]: SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 47]: -- She does n't work , Sundays , but lies around all tired out , and likes to have the fish wallow over her ; and she makes fool noises to amuse it , and pretends to chew its paws , and that makes it laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 11]: I have not seen a fish before that could laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 13]: This makes me doubt ... I have come to like Sunday myself .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 9]: Superintending all the week tires a body so .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 7]: There ought to be more Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 14]: In the old days they were tough , but now they come handy .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 2]: WEDNESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 7]: -- It is n't a fish .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 10]: I can not quite make out what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 18]: It makes curious devilish noises when not satisfied , and says `` goo-goo '' when it is .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 75]: It is not one of us , for it does n't walk ; it is not a bird , for it does n't fly ; it is not a frog , for it does n't hop ; it is not a snake , for it does n't crawl ; I feel sure it is not a fish , though I can not get a chance to find out whether it can swim or not .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 16]: It merely lies around , and mostly on its back , with its feet up .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 11]: I have not seen any other animal do that before .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 19]: I said I believed it was an enigma ; but she only admired the word without understanding it .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 15]: In my judgment it is either an enigma or some kind of a bug .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 16]: If it dies , I will take it apart and see what its arrangements are .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 9]: I never had a thing perplex me so .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 4]: THREE MONTHS LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 8]: -- The perplexity augments instead of diminishing .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 5]: I sleep but little .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 16]: It has ceased from lying around , and goes about on its four legs now .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 43]: Yet it differs from the other four legged animals , in that its front legs are unusually short , consequently this causes the main part of its person to stick up uncomfortably high in the air , and this is not attractive .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 22]: It is built much as we are , but its method of traveling shows that it is not of our breed .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 40]: The short front legs and long hind ones indicate that it is a of the kangaroo family , but it is a marked variation of that species , since the true kangaroo hops , whereas this one never does .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 16]: Still it is a curious and interesting variety , and has not been catalogued before .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 49]: As I discovered it , I have felt justified in securing the credit of the discovery by attaching my name to it , and hence have called it KANGAROORUM ADAMIENSIS ... It must have been a young one when it came , for it has grown exceedingly since .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 35]: It must be five times as big , now , as it was then , and when discontented it is able to make from twenty-two to thirty-eight times the noise it made at first .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 12]: Coercion does not modify this , but has the contrary effect .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 8]: For this reason I discontinued the system .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 23]: She reconciles it by persuasion , and by giving it things which she had previously told me she would n't give it .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 25]: As already observed , I was not at home when it first came , and she told me she found it in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 59]: It seems odd that it should be the only one , yet it must be so , for I have worn myself out these many weeks trying to find another one to add to my collection , and for this to play with ; for surely then it would be quieter and we could tame it more easily .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 19]: But I find none , nor any vestige of any ; and strangest of all , no tracks .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 26]: It has to live on the ground , it can not help itself ; therefore , how does it get about without leaving a track ?
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 13]: I have set a dozen traps , but they do no good .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 32]: I catch all small animals except that one ; animals that merely go into the trap out of curiosity , I think , to see what the milk is there for .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 5]: They never drink it .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 4]: THREE MONTHS LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 15]: -- The Kangaroo still continues to grow , which is very strange and perplexing .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 12]: I never knew one to be so long getting its growth .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 35]: It has fur on its head now ; not like kangaroo fur , but exactly like our hair except that it is much finer and softer , and instead of being black is red .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 19]: I am like to lose my mind over the capricious and harassing developments of this unclassifiable zoological freak .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 27]: If I could catch another one -- but that is hopeless ; it is a new variety , and the only sample ; this is plain .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 103]: But I caught a true kangaroo and brought it in , thinking that this one , being lonesome , would rather have that for company than have no kin at all , or any animal it could feel a nearness to or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among strangers who do not know its ways or habits , or what to do to make it feel that it is among friends ; but it was a mistake -- it went into such fits at the sight of the kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen one before .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 20]: I pity the poor noisy little animal , but there is nothing I can do to make it happy .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 26]: If I could tame it -- but that is out of the question ; the more I try the worse I seem to make it .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 18]: It grieves me to the heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 15]: I wanted to let it go , but she would n't hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 15]: That seemed cruel and not like her ; and yet she may be right .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 20]: It might be lonelier than ever ; for since I can not find another one , how could IT ?
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 4]: FIVE MONTHS LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 7]: -- It is not a kangaroo .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 28]: No , for it supports itself by holding to her finger , and thus goes a few steps on its hind legs , and then falls down .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 28]: It is probably some kind of a bear ; and yet it has no tail -- as yet -- and no fur , except upon its head .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 21]: It still keeps on growing -- that is a curious circumstance , for bears get their growth earlier than this .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 29]: Bears are dangerous -- since our catastrophe -- and I shall not be satisfied to have this one prowling about the place much longer without a muzzle on .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 38]: I have offered to get her a kangaroo if she would let this one go , but it did no good -- she is determined to run us into all sorts of foolish risks , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 11]: She was not like this before she lost her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 4]: A FORTNIGHT LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 6]: -- I examined its mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 12]: There is no danger yet : it has only one tooth .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 6]: It has no tail yet .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 16]: It makes more noise now than it ever did before -- and mainly at night .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 5]: I have moved out .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 19]: But I shall go over , mornings , to breakfast , and see if it has more teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 35]: If it gets a mouthful of teeth it will be time for it to go , tail or no tail , for a bear does not need a tail in order to be dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 4]: FOUR MONTHS LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 37]: -- I have been off hunting and fishing a month , up in the region that she calls Buffalo ; I do n't know why , unless it is because there are not any buffaloes there .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 26]: Meantime the bear has learned to paddle around all by itself on its hind legs , and says `` poppa '' and `` momma . ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 7]: It is certainly a new species .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 41]: This resemblance to words may be purely accidental , of course , and may have no purpose or meaning ; but even in that case it is still extraordinary , and is a thing which no other bear can do .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 29]: This imitation of speech , taken together with general absence of fur and entire absence of tail , sufficiently indicates that this is a new kind of bear .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 10]: The further study of it will be exceedingly interesting .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 21]: Meantime I will go off on a far expedition among the forests of the north and make an exhaustive search .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 24]: There must certainly be another one somewhere , and this one will be less dangerous when it has company of its own species .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 13]: I will go straightway ; but I will muzzle this one first .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 4]: THREE MONTHS LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 17]: -- It has been a weary , weary hunt , yet I have had no success .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 18]: In the mean time , without stirring from the home estate , she has caught another one !
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 6]: I never saw such luck .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 19]: I might have hunted these woods a hundred years , I never would have run across that thing .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 3]: NEXT DAY .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 26]: -- I have been comparing the new one with the old one , and it is perfectly plain that they are of the same breed .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 39]: I was going to stuff one of them for my collection , but she is prejudiced against it for some reason or other ; so I have relinquished the idea , though I think it is a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 14]: It would be an irreparable loss to science if they should get away .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 43]: The old one is tamer than it was and can laugh and talk like a parrot , having learned this , no doubt , from being with the parrot so much , and having the imitative faculty in a high developed degree .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 46]: I shall be astonished if it turns out to be a new kind of parrot ; and yet I ought not to be astonished , for it has already been everything else it could think of since those first days when it was a fish .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 30]: The new one is as ugly as the old one was at first ; has the same sulphur-and-raw-meat complexion and the same singular head without any fur on it .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 5]: She calls it Abel .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 4]: TEN YEARS LATER .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 12]: -- They are BOYS ; we found it out long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 20]: It was their coming in that small immature shape that puzzled us ; we were not used to it .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 6]: There are some girls now .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 19]: Abel is a good boy , but if Cain had stayed a bear it would have improved him .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 33]: After all these years , I see that I was mistaken about Eve in the beginning ; it is better to live outside the Garden with her than inside it without her .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 28]: At first I thought she talked too much ; but now I should be sorry to have that voice fall silent and pass out of my life .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 26]: Blessed be the chestnut that brought us near together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart and the sweetness of her spirit !
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 9]: EVE 'S DIARY Translated from the Original SATURDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 11]: -- I am almost a whole day old , now .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 4]: I arrived yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 8]: That is as it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 26]: And it must be so , for if there was a day-before-yesterday I was not there when it happened , or I should remember it .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 19]: It could be , of course , that it did happen , and that I was not noticing .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 23]: Very well ; I will be very watchful now , and if any day-before-yesterdays happen I will make a note of it .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 34]: It will be best to start right and not let the record get confused , for some instinct tells me that these details are going to be important to the historian some day .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 57]: For I feel like an experiment , I feel exactly like an experiment ; it would be impossible for a person to feel more like an experiment than I do , and so I am coming to feel convinced that that is what I AM -- an experiment ; just an experiment , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 14]: Then if I am an experiment , am I the whole of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 17]: No , I think not ; I think the rest of it is part of it .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 22]: I am the main part of it , but I think the rest of it has its share in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 18]: Is my position assured , or do I have to watch it and take care of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 5]: The latter , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 13]: Some instinct tells me that eternal vigilance is the price of supremacy .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 16]: -LRB- That is a good phrase , I think , for one so young . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 9]: Everything looks better today than it did yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 36]: In the rush of finishing up yesterday , the mountains were left in a ragged condition , and some of the plains were so cluttered with rubbish and remnants that the aspects were quite distressing .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 27]: Noble and beautiful works of art should not be subjected to haste ; and this majestic new world is indeed a most noble and beautiful work .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 15]: And certainly marvelously near to being perfect , notwithstanding the shortness of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 24]: There are too many stars in some places and not enough in others , but that can be remedied presently , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 31]: The moon got loose last night , and slid down and fell out of the scheme -- a very great loss ; it breaks my heart to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 20]: There is n't another thing among the ornaments and decorations that is comparable to it for beauty and finish .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 7]: It should have been fastened better .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 21]: If we can only get it back again -- But of course there is no telling where it went to .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 20]: And besides , whoever gets it will hide it ; I know it because I would do it myself .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 65]: I believe I can be honest in all other matters , but I already begin to realize that the core and center of my nature is love of the beautiful , a passion for the beautiful , and that it would not be safe to trust me with a moon that belonged to another person and that person did n't know I had it .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 50]: I could give up a moon that I found in the daytime , because I should be afraid some one was looking ; but if I found it in the dark , I am sure I should find some kind of an excuse for not saying anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 14]: For I do love moons , they are so pretty and so romantic .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 30]: I wish we had five or six ; I would never go to bed ; I should never get tired lying on the moss-bank and looking up at them .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 6]: Stars are good , too .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 12]: I wish I could get some to put in my hair .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 7]: But I suppose I never can .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 19]: You would be surprised to find how far off they are , for they do not look it .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 45]: When they first showed , last night , I tried to knock some down with a pole , but it did n't reach , which astonished me ; then I tried clods till I was all tired out , but I never got one .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 12]: It was because I am left-handed and can not throw good .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 72]: Even when I aimed at the one I was n't after I could n't hit the other one , though I did make some close shots , for I saw the black blot of the clod sail right into the midst of the golden clusters forty or fifty times , just barely missing them , and if I could have held out a little longer maybe I could have got one .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 78]: So I cried a little , which was natural , I suppose , for one of my age , and after I was rested I got a basket and started for a place on the extreme rim of the circle , where the stars were close to the ground and I could get them with my hands , which would be better , anyway , because I could gather them tenderly then , and not break them .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 43]: But it was farther than I thought , and at last I had go give it up ; I was so tired I could n't drag my feet another step ; and besides , they were sore and hurt me very much .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 45]: I could n't get back home ; it was too far and turning cold ; but I found some tigers and nestled in among them and was most adorably comfortable , and their breath was sweet and pleasant , because they live on strawberries .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 19]: I had never seen a tiger before , but I knew them in a minute by the stripes .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 16]: If I could have one of those skins , it would make a lovely gown .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 9]: Today I am getting better ideas about distances .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 46]: I was so eager to get hold of every pretty thing that I giddily grabbed for it , sometimes when it was too far off , and sometimes when it was but six inches away but seemed a foot -- alas , with thorns between !
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 30]: I learned a lesson ; also I made an axiom , all out of my own head -- my very first one ; THE SCRATCHED EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE THORN .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 13]: I think it is a very good one for one so young .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 26]: I followed the other Experiment around , yesterday afternoon , at a distance , to see what it might be for , if I could .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 9]: But I was not able to make out .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 7]: I think it is a man .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 24]: I had never seen a man , but it looked like one , and I feel sure that that is what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 17]: I realize that I feel more curiosity about it than about any of the other reptiles .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 27]: If it is a reptile , and I suppose it is ; for it has frowzy hair and blue eyes , and looks like a reptile .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 37]: It has no hips ; it tapers like a carrot ; when it stands , it spreads itself apart like a derrick ; so I think it is a reptile , though it may be architecture .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 72]: I was afraid of it at first , and started to run every time it turned around , for I thought it was going to chase me ; but by and by I found it was only trying to get away , so after that I was not timid any more , but tracked it along , several hours , about twenty yards behind , which made it nervous and unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 14]: At last it was a good deal worried , and climbed a tree .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 14]: I waited a good while , then gave it up and went home .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 6]: Today the same thing over .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 9]: I 've got it up the tree again .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 2]: SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 7]: -- It is up there yet .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 4]: Resting , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 20]: But that is a subterfuge : Sunday is n't the day of rest ; Saturday is appointed for that .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 18]: It looks to me like a creature that is more interested in resting than it anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 9]: It would tire me to rest so much .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 12]: It tires me just to sit around and watch the tree .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 15]: I do wonder what it is for ; I never see it do anything .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 13]: They returned the moon last night , and I was SO happy !
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 9]: I think it is very honest of them .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 34]: It slid down and fell off again , but I was not distressed ; there is no need to worry when one has that kind of neighbors ; they will fetch it back .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 11]: I wish I could do something to show my appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 18]: I would like to send them some stars , for we have more than we can use .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 20]: I mean I , not we , for I can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 10]: It has low tastes , and is not kind .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 47]: When I went there yesterday evening in the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little speckled fishes that play in the pool , and I had to clod it to make it go up the tree again and let them alone .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 10]: I wonder if THAT is what it is for ?
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 6]: Has n't it any heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 10]: Has n't it any compassion for those little creature ?
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 14]: Can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such ungentle work ?
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 7]: It has the look of it .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 16]: One of the clods took it back of the ear , and it used language .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 22]: It gave me a thrill , for it was the first time I had ever heard speech , except my own .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 12]: I did not understand the words , but they seemed expressive .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 62]: When I found it could talk I felt a new interest in it , for I love to talk ; I talk , all day , and in my sleep , too , and I am very interesting , but if I had another to talk to I could be twice as interesting , and would never stop , if desired .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 16]: If this reptile is a man , it is n't an IT , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 9]: That would n't be grammatical , would it ?
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: I think it would be HE .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 43]: In that case one would parse it thus : nominative , HE ; dative , HIM ; possessive , HIS ` N. Well , I will consider it a man and call it he until it turns out to be something else .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 10]: This will be handier than having so many uncertainties .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 4]: NEXT WEEK SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 15]: -- All the week I tagged around after him and tried to get acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 19]: I had to do the talking , because he was shy , but I did n't mind it .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 30]: He seemed pleased to have me around , and I used the sociable `` we '' a good deal , because it seemed to flatter him to be included .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 2]: WEDNESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 18]: -- We are getting along very well indeed , now , and getting better and better acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 27]: He does not try to avoid me any more , which is a good sign , and shows that he likes to have me with him .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 25]: That pleases me , and I study to be useful to him in every way I can , so as to increase his regard .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 44]: During the last day or two I have taken all the work of naming things off his hands , and this has been a great relief to him , for he has no gift in that line , and is evidently very grateful .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 27]: He ca n't think of a rational name to save him , but I do not let him see that I am aware of his defect .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 21]: Whenever a new creature comes along I name it before he has time to expose himself by an awkward silence .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 10]: In this way I have saved him many embarrassments .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 7]: I have no defect like this .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 14]: The minute I set eyes on an animal I know what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 44]: I do n't have to reflect a moment ; the right name comes out instantly , just as if it were an inspiration , as no doubt it is , for I am sure it was n't in me half a minute before .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 21]: I seem to know just by the shape of the creature and the way it acts what animal it is .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 19]: When the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat -- I saw it in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 5]: But I saved him .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 17]: And I was careful not to do it in a way that could hurt his pride .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 42]: I just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleasing surprise , and not as if I was dreaming of conveying information , and said , `` Well , I do declare , if there is n't the dodo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 46]: I explained -- without seeming to be explaining -- how I know it for a dodo , and although I thought maybe he was a little piqued that I knew the creature when he did n't , it was quite evident that he admired me .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 19]: That was very agreeable , and I thought of it more than once with gratification before I slept .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 17]: How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it !
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 2]: THURSDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 5]: -- my first sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 15]: Yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish I would not talk to him .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 48]: I could not believe it , and thought there was some mistake , for I loved to be with him , and loved to hear him talk , and so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when I had not done anything ?
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 65]: But at last it seemed true , so I went away and sat lonely in the place where I first saw him the morning that we were made and I did not know what he was and was indifferent about him ; but now it was a mournful place , and every little think spoke of him , and my heart was very sore .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 37]: I did not know why very clearly , for it was a new feeling ; I had not experienced it before , and it was all a mystery , and I could not make it out .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 61]: But when night came I could not bear the lonesomeness , and went to the new shelter which he has built , to ask him what I had done that was wrong and how I could mend it and get back his kindness again ; but he put me out in the rain , and it was my first sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 2]: SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 31]: -- It is pleasant again , now , and I am happy ; but those were heavy days ; I do not think of them when I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 19]: I tried to get him some of those apples , but I can not learn to throw straight .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 12]: I failed , but I think the good intention pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 31]: They are forbidden , and he says I shall come to harm ; but so I come to harm through pleasing him , why shall I care for that harm ?
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 2]: MONDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 15]: -- This morning I told him my name , hoping it would interest him .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 8]: But he did not care for it .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 4]: It is strange .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 12]: If he should tell me his name , I would care .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 14]: I think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any other sound .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 5]: He talks very little .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 20]: Perhaps it is because he is not bright , and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 26]: It is such a pity that he should feel so , for brightness is nothing ; it is in the heart that the values lie .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 27]: I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches , and riches enough , and that without it intellect is poverty .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 13]: Although he talks so little , he has quite a considerable vocabulary .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 9]: This morning he used a surprisingly good word .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 23]: He evidently recognized , himself , that it was a good one , for he worked in in twice afterward , casually .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 18]: It was good casual art , still it showed that he possesses a certain quality of perception .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 14]: Without a doubt that seed can be made to grow , if cultivated .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 7]: Where did he get that word ?
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 10]: I do not think I have ever used it .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 10]: No , he took no interest in my name .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 15]: I tried to hide my disappointment , but I suppose I did not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 15]: I went away and sat on the moss-bank with my feet in the water .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 23]: It is where I go when I hunger for companionship , some one to look at , some one to talk to .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 28]: It is not enough -- that lovely white body painted there in the pool -- but it is something , and something is better than utter loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 42]: It talks when I talk ; it is sad when I am sad ; it comforts me with its sympathy ; it says , `` Do not be downhearted , you poor friendless girl ; I will be your friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 18]: It IS a good friend to me , and my only one ; it is my sister .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 8]: That first time that she forsook me !
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 12]: ah , I shall never forget that -- never , never .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 8]: My heart was lead in my body !
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 17]: I said , `` She was all I had , and now she is gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 22]: In my despair I said , `` Break , my heart ; I can not bear my life any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 16]: and hid my face in my hands , and there was no solace for me .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 29]: And when I took them away , after a little , there she was again , white and shining and beautiful , and I sprang into her arms !
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 22]: That was perfect happiness ; I had known happiness before , but it was not like this , which was ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 6]: I never doubted her afterward .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 45]: Sometimes she stayed away -- maybe an hour , maybe almost the whole day , but I waited and did not doubt ; I said , `` She is busy , or she is gone on a journey , but she will come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 9]: And it was so : she always did .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 29]: At night she would not come if it was dark , for she was a timid little thing ; but if there was a moon she would come .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 23]: I am not afraid of the dark , but she is younger than I am ; she was born after I was .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 30]: Many and many are the visits I have paid her ; she is my comfort and my refuge when my life is hard -- and it is mainly that .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 2]: TUESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 30]: -- All the morning I was at work improving the estate ; and I purposely kept away from him in the hope that he would get lonely and come .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 5]: But he did not .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 44]: At noon I stopped for the day and took my recreation by flitting all about with the bees and the butterflies and reveling in the flowers , those beautiful creatures that catch the smile of God out of the sky and preserve it !
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 38]: I gathered them , and made them into wreaths and garlands and clothed myself in them while I ate my luncheon -- apples , of course ; then I sat in the shade and wished and waited .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 6]: But he did not come .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 4]: But no matter .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 15]: Nothing would have come of it , for he does not care for flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 23]: He called them rubbish , and can not tell one from another , and thinks it is superior to feel like that .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 74]: He does not care for me , he does not care for flowers , he does not care for the painted sky at eventide -- is there anything he does care for , except building shacks to coop himself up in from the good clean rain , and thumping the melons , and sampling the grapes , and fingering the fruit on the trees , to see how those properties are coming along ?
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 39]: I laid a dry stick on the ground and tried to bore a hole in it with another one , in order to carry out a scheme that I had , and soon I got an awful fright .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 19]: A thin , transparent bluish film rose out of the hole , and I dropped everything and ran !
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 13]: I thought it was a spirit , and I WAS so frightened !
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 92]: But I looked back , and it was not coming ; so I leaned against a rock and rested and panted , and let my limps go on trembling until they got steady again ; then I crept warily back , alert , watching , and ready to fly if there was occasion ; and when I was come near , I parted the branches of a rose-bush and peeped through -- wishing the man was about , I was looking so cunning and pretty -- but the sprite was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 17]: I went there , and there was a pinch of delicate pink dust in the hole .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 14]: I put my finger in , to feel it , and said OUCH !
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 6]: and took it out again .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 6]: It was a cruel pain .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 41]: I put my finger in my mouth ; and by standing first on one foot and then the other , and grunting , I presently eased my misery ; then I was full of interest , and began to examine .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 11]: I was curious to know what the pink dust was .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 18]: Suddenly the name of it occurred to me , though I had never heard of it before .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 4]: It was FIRE !
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 17]: I was as certain of it as a person could be of anything in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 10]: So without hesitation I named it that -- fire .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 66]: I had created something that did n't exist before ; I had added a new thing to the world 's uncountable properties ; I realized this , and was proud of my achievement , and was going to run and find him and tell him about it , thinking to raise myself in his esteem -- but I reflected , and did not do it .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 9]: No -- he would not care for it .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 15]: He would ask what it was good for , and what could I answer ?
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 25]: for if it was not GOOD for something , but only beautiful , merely beautiful -- So I sighed , and did not go .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 50]: For it was n't good for anything ; it could not build a shack , it could not improve melons , it could not hurry a fruit crop ; it was useless , it was a foolishness and a vanity ; he would despise it and say cutting words .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 37]: But to me it was not despicable ; I said , `` Oh , you fire , I love you , you dainty pink creature , for you are BEAUTIFUL -- and that is enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 10]: and was going to gather it to my breast .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 3]: But refrained .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 38]: Then I made another maxim out of my head , though it was so nearly like the first one that I was afraid it was only a plagiarism : `` THE BURNT EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE FIRE . ''
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 62]: I wrought again ; and when I had made a good deal of fire-dust I emptied it into a handful of dry brown grass , intending to carry it home and keep it always and play with it ; but the wind struck it and it sprayed up and spat out at me fiercely , and I dropped it and ran .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 31]: When I looked back the blue spirit was towering up and stretching and rolling away like a cloud , and instantly I thought of the name of it -- SMOKE !
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 15]: -- though , upon my word , I had never heard of smoke before .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 44]: Soon brilliant yellow and red flares shot up through the smoke , and I named them in an instant -- FLAMES -- and I was right , too , though these were the very first flames that had ever been in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 49]: They climbed the trees , then flashed splendidly in and out of the vast and increasing volume of tumbling smoke , and I had to clap my hands and laugh and dance in my rapture , it was so new and strange and so wonderful and so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 18]: He came running , and stopped and gazed , and said not a word for many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 7]: Then he asked what it was .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 15]: Ah , it was too bad that he should ask such a direct question .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 13]: I had to answer it , of course , and I did .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 6]: I said it was fire .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 27]: If it annoyed him that I should know and he must ask ; that was not my fault ; I had no desire to annoy him .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 13]: After a pause he asked : `` How did it come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 14]: Another direct question , and it also had to have a direct answer .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 6]: `` I made it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 9]: The fire was traveling farther and farther off .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 23]: He went to the edge of the burned place and stood looking down , and said : `` What are these ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 4]: `` Fire-coals . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 18]: He picked up one to examine it , but changed his mind and put it down again .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 5]: Then he went away .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 4]: NOTHING interests him .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 5]: But I was interested .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 20]: There were ashes , gray and soft and delicate and pretty -- I knew what they were at once .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 11]: And the embers ; I knew the embers , too .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 25]: I found my apples , and raked them out , and was glad ; for I am very young and my appetite is active .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 13]: But I was disappointed ; they were all burst open and spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 16]: Spoiled apparently ; but it was not so ; they were better than raw ones .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 14]: Fire is beautiful ; some day it will be useful , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 2]: FRIDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 21]: -- I saw him again , for a moment , last Monday at nightfall , but only for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 24]: I was hoping he would praise me for trying to improve the estate , for I had meant well and had worked hard .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 13]: But he was not pleased , and turned away and left me .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 22]: He was also displeased on another account : I tried once more to persuade him to stop going over the Falls .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 35]: That was because the fire had revealed to me a new passion -- quite new , and distinctly different from love , grief , and those others which I had already discovered -- FEAR .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 5]: And it is horrible !
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 29]: -- I wish I had never discovered it ; it gives me dark moments , it spoils my happiness , it makes me shiver and tremble and shudder .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 23]: But I could not persuade him , for he has not discovered fear yet , and so he could not understand me .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 23]: EXTRACT FROM ADAM 'S DIARY Perhaps I ought to remember that she is very young , a mere girl and make allowances .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 62]: She is all interest , eagerness , vivacity , the world is to her a charm , a wonder , a mystery , a joy ; she ca n't speak for delight when she finds a new flower , she must pet it and caress it and smell it and talk to it , and pour out endearing names upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 99]: And she is color-mad : brown rocks , yellow sand , gray moss , green foliage , blue sky ; the pearl of the dawn , the purple shadows on the mountains , the golden islands floating in crimson seas at sunset , the pallid moon sailing through the shredded cloud-rack , the star-jewels glittering in the wastes of space -- none of them is of any practical value , so far as I can see , but because they have color and majesty , that is enough for her , and she loses her mind over them .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 22]: If she could quiet down and keep still a couple minutes at a time , it would be a reposeful spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 91]: In that case I think I could enjoy looking at her ; indeed I am sure I could , for I am coming to realize that she is a quite remarkably comely creature -- lithe , slender , trim , rounded , shapely , nimble , graceful ; and once when she was standing marble-white and sun-drenched on a boulder , with her young head tilted back and her hand shading her eyes , watching the flight of a bird in the sky , I recognized that she was beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 3]: MONDAY NOON .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 21]: -- If there is anything on the planet that she is not interested in it is not in my list .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 17]: There are animals that I am indifferent to , but it is not so with her .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 25]: She has no discrimination , she takes to all of them , she thinks they are all treasures , every new one is welcome .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 40]: When the mighty brontosaurus came striding into camp , she regarded it as an acquisition , I considered it a calamity ; that is a good sample of the lack of harmony that prevails in our views of things .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 20]: She wanted to domesticate it , I wanted to make it a present of the homestead and move out .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 78]: She believed it could be tamed by kind treatment and would be a good pet ; I said a pet twenty-one feet high and eighty-four feet long would be no proper thing to have about the place , because , even with the best intentions and without meaning any harm , it could sit down on the house and mash it , for any one could see by the look of its eye that it was absent-minded .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 19]: Still , her heart was set upon having that monster , and she could n't give it up .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 28]: She thought we could start a dairy with it , and wanted me to help milk it ; but I would n't ; it was too risky .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 14]: The sex was n't right , and we had n't any ladder anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 13]: Then she wanted to ride it , and look at the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 56]: Thirty or forty feet of its tail was lying on the ground , like a fallen tree , and she thought she could climb it , but she was mistaken ; when she got to the steep place it was too slick and down she came , and would have hurt herself but for me .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 5]: Was she satisfied now ?
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 22]: Nothing ever satisfies her but demonstration ; untested theories are not in her line , and she wo n't have them .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 36]: It is the right spirit , I concede it ; it attracts me ; I feel the influence of it ; if I were with her more I think I should take it up myself .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 36]: Well , she had one theory remaining about this colossus : she thought that if we could tame it and make him friendly we could stand in the river and use him for a bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 60]: It turned out that he was already plenty tame enough -- at least as far as she was concerned -- so she tried her theory , but it failed : every time she got him properly placed in the river and went ashore to cross over him , he came out and followed her around like a pet mountain .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 5]: Like the other animals .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 5]: They all do that .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 2]: FRIDAY .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 15]: -- Tuesday -- Wednesday -- Thursday -- and today : all without seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 20]: It is a long time to be alone ; still , it is better to be alone than unwelcome .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 23]: I HAD to have company -- I was made for it , I think -- so I made friends with the animals .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 64]: They are just charming , and they have the kindest disposition and the politest ways ; they never look sour , they never let you feel that you are intruding , they smile at you and wag their tail , if they 've got one , and they are always ready for a romp or an excursion or anything you want to propose .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 7]: I think they are perfect gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 21]: All these days we have had such good times , and it has n't been lonesome for me , ever .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 2]: Lonesome !
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 7]: No , I should say not .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 126]: Why , there 's always a swarm of them around -- sometimes as much as four or five acres -- you ca n't count them ; and when you stand on a rock in the midst and look out over the furry expanse it is so mottled and splashed and gay with color and frisking sheen and sun-flash , and so rippled with stripes , that you might think it was a lake , only you know it is n't ; and there 's storms of sociable birds , and hurricanes of whirring wings ; and when the sun strikes all that feathery commotion , you have a blazing up of all the colors you can think of , enough to put your eyes out .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 38]: We have made long excursions , and I have seen a great deal of the world ; almost all of it , I think ; and so I am the first traveler , and the only one .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 20]: When we are on the march , it is an imposing sight -- there 's nothing like it anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 43]: For comfort I ride a tiger or a leopard , because it is soft and has a round back that fits me , and because they are such pretty animals ; but for long distance or for scenery I ride the elephant .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 32]: He hoists me up with his trunk , but I can get off myself ; when we are ready to camp , he sits and I slide down the back way .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 19]: The birds and animals are all friendly to each other , and there are no disputes about anything .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 47]: They all talk , and they all talk to me , but it must be a foreign language , for I can not make out a word they say ; yet they often understand me when I talk back , particularly the dog and the elephant .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 5]: It makes me ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 28]: It shows that they are brighter than I am , for I want to be the principal Experiment myself -- and I intend to be , too .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 21]: I have learned a number of things , and am educated , now , but I was n't at first .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 6]: I was ignorant at first .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 37]: At first it used to vex me because , with all my watching , I was never smart enough to be around when the water was running uphill ; but now I do not mind it .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 20]: I have experimented and experimented until now I know it never does run uphill , except in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 33]: I know it does in the dark , because the pool never goes dry , which it would , of course , if the water did n't come back in the night .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 30]: It is best to prove things by actual experiment ; then you KNOW ; whereas if you depend on guessing and supposing and conjecturing , you never get educated .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 43]: Some things you CA N'T find out ; but you will never know you ca n't by guessing and supposing : no , you have to be patient and go on experimenting until you find out that you ca n't find out .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 17]: And it is delightful to have it that way , it makes the world so interesting .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 14]: If there was n't anything to find out , it would be dull .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 31]: Even trying to find out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and finding out , and I do n't know but more so .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 28]: The secret of the water was a treasure until I GOT it ; then the excitement all went away , and I recognized a sense of loss .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 60]: By experiment I know that wood swims , and dry leaves , and feathers , and plenty of other things ; therefore by all that cumulative evidence you know that a rock will swim ; but you have to put up with simply knowing it , for there is n't any way to prove it -- up to now .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 13]: But I shall find a way -- then THAT excitement will go .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 31]: Such things make me sad ; because by and by when I have found out everything there wo n't be any more excitements , and I do love excitements so !
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 12]: The other night I could n't sleep for thinking about it .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 42]: At first I could n't make out what I was made for , but now I think it was to search out the secrets of this wonderful world and be happy and thank the Giver of it all for devising it .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 31]: I think there are many things to learn yet -- I hope so ; and by economizing and not hurrying too fast I think they will last weeks and weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 4]: I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 29]: When you cast up a feather it sails away on the air and goes out of sight ; then you throw up a clod and it does n't .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 7]: It comes down , every time .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 14]: I have tried it and tried it , and it is always so .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 6]: I wonder why it is ?
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 15]: Of course it DOES N'T come down , but why should it SEEM to ?
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 8]: I suppose it is an optical illusion .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 8]: I mean , one of them is .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 7]: I do n't know which one .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 41]: It may be the feather , it may be the clod ; I ca n't prove which it is , I can only demonstrate that one or the other is a fake , and let a person take his choice .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 14]: By watching , I know that the stars are not going to last .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 15]: I have seen some of the best ones melt and run down the sky .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 24]: Since one can melt , they can all melt ; since they can all melt , they can all melt the same night .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 9]: That sorrow will come -- I know it .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 69]: I mean to sit up every night and look at them as long as I can keep awake ; and I will impress those sparkling fields on my memory , so that by and by when they are taken away I can by my fancy restore those lovely myriads to the black sky and make them sparkle again , and double them by the blur of my tears .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 16]: After the Fall When I look back , the Garden is a dream to me .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 25]: It was beautiful , surpassingly beautiful , enchantingly beautiful ; and now it is lost , and I shall not see it any more .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 15]: The Garden is lost , but I have found HIM , and am content .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 35]: He loves me as well as he can ; I love him with all the strength of my passionate nature , and this , I think , is proper to my youth and sex .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 52]: If I ask myself why I love him , I find I do not know , and do not really much care to know ; so I suppose that this kind of love is not a product of reasoning and statistics , like one 's love for other reptiles and animals .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 8]: I think that this must be so .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 42]: I love certain birds because of their song ; but I do not love Adam on account of his singing -- no , it is not that ; the more he sings the more I do not get reconciled to it .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 20]: Yet I ask him to sing , because I wish to learn to like everything he is interested in .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 21]: I am sure I can learn , because at first I could not stand it , but now I can .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 21]: It sours the milk , but it does n't matter ; I can get used to that kind of milk .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 20]: It is not on account of his brightness that I love him -- no , it is not that .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 34]: He is not to blame for his brightness , such as it is , for he did not make it himself ; he is as God make him , and that is sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 12]: There was a wise purpose in it , THAT I know .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 32]: In time it will develop , though I think it will not be sudden ; and besides , there is no hurry ; he is well enough just as he is .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 19]: It is not on account of his gracious and considerate ways and his delicacy that I love him .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 21]: No , he has lacks in this regard , but he is well enough just so , and is improving .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 20]: It is not on account of his industry that I love him -- no , it is not that .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 20]: I think he has it in him , and I do not know why he conceals it from me .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 6]: It is my only pain .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 11]: Otherwise he is frank and open with me , now .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 11]: I am sure he keeps nothing from me but this .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 47]: It grieves me that he should have a secret from me , and sometimes it spoils my sleep , thinking of it , but I will put it out of my mind ; it shall not trouble my happiness , which is otherwise full to overflowing .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 20]: It is not on account of his education that I love him -- no , it is not that .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 19]: He is self-educated , and does really know a multitude of things , but they are not so .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 20]: It is not on account of his chivalry that I love him -- no , it is not that .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 30]: He told on me , but I do not blame him ; it is a peculiarity of sex , I think , and he did not make his sex .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 43]: Of course I would not have told on him , I would have perished first ; but that is a peculiarity of sex , too , and I do not take credit for it , for I did not make my sex .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 9]: Then why is it that I love him ?
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 9]: MERELY BECAUSE HE IS MASCULINE , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 21]: At bottom he is good , and I love him for that , but I could love him without it .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 16]: If he should beat me and abuse me , I should go on loving him .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 10]: It is a matter of sex , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 32]: He is strong and handsome , and I love him for that , and I admire him and am proud of him , but I could love him without those qualities .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 47]: He he were plain , I should love him ; if he were a wreck , I should love him ; and I would work for him , and slave over him , and pray for him , and watch by his bedside until I died .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 16]: Yes , I think I love him merely because he is MINE and is MASCULINE .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 9]: There is no other reason , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 25]: And so I think it is as I first said : that this kind of love is not a product of reasonings and statistics .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 14]: It just COMES -- none knows whence -- and can not explain itself .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 6]: And does n't need to .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 6]: It is what I think .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 33]: But I am only a girl , the first that has examined this matter , and it may turn out that in my ignorance and inexperience I have not got it right .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 60]: Forty Years Later It is my prayer , it is my longing , that we may pass from this life together -- a longing which shall never perish from the earth , but shall have place in the heart of every wife that loves , until the end of time ; and it shall be called by my name .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 55]: But if one of us must go first , it is my prayer that it shall be I ; for he is strong , I am weak , I am not so necessary to him as he is to me -- life without him would not be life ; now could I endure it ?
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 19]: This prayer is also immortal , and will not cease from being offered up while my race continues .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 16]: I am the first wife ; and in the last wife I shall be repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 14]: At Eve 's Grave ADAM : Wheresoever she was , THERE was Eden .
